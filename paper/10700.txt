                                            ABSTRACT


Do urban hospital closures affect health care access or health outcomes? We study closures in Los

Angeles County between 1997 and 2003, through their effect on distance to the nearest hospital. We

find that increased distance to the nearest hospital shifts regular care away from emergency rooms

and outpatient clinics to doctor's offices. While most residents are otherwise unaffected by closures,

lower-income residents report more difficulty accessing care, working age residents are less likely

to receive HIV tests, and seniors less likely to receive flu shots. We also find some evidence that

increased distance raises infant mortality rates and stronger evidence that it increases deaths from

unintentional injuries and heart attacks.

Introduction

         Just prior to the November 2002 elections, Los Angeles County announced that

without a $350 million bailout it would be forced to close several area hospitals and

clinics. High on the list of proposed closures were Harbor-UCLA and Olive View-

UCLA Medical Centers, hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of the county’s

Medi-Cal and uninsured populations. Since Harbor-UCLA is a Trauma I center, its

closure would mean the loss of significant trauma and emergency care services in the Los

Angeles area. The passage of a ballot initiative (Measure B) that increased tax funding

for emergency rooms and trauma centers has reduced pressure on the county’s health care

system though, even with this additional funding, the system is still projected to face a

deficit of between $300 and $600 million over the next 3 years. Thus, the possibility of

imminent hospital closures remains real.

         The proposed closures are part of an ongoing trend in Southern California.

Between 1997 and 2002, Los Angeles County lost roughly 10 percent of its initial 133

hospitals (see Table 1). Since 2002, Tenet Healthcare Corporation, an owner of several

of these hospitals, has announced additional closures in the area (Hymon 2004, Vrana

2003). Although considerable media attention has focused on the potential deleterious

effects of hospital closures on access to care and health outcomes in Los Angeles County,

surprisingly little is known about the impact of urban hospital closures on patients. The

bulk of the literature on urban closures focuses on the supply-side of the market: the

determinants of closure (see Lindrooth et al. 2003 for a good summary) and the operating

efficiency of hospitals remaining in the market (Lindrooth et al. 2003).1


1
 Scheffler et al. (2001) specifically studies the causes of hospital closures in California between 1995 and
2000. Not surprisingly, poor financial performance is a key predictor of closure.


                                                      1
        Research on the impact of closures on access to care and health more generally

has focused largely on rural hospitals (Bindman et al. 1990, Mullner et al. 1989,

Rosenbach and Dayhoff 1995, Succi et al. 1997, US GAO 1991). For obvious reasons,

such studies have, at best, limited implications for considering the consequences of

hospital closures in urban areas such as Los Angeles County. A notable exception,

Vigdor (1999), examines the effect of changes in the density of hospitals in Los Angeles

County between 1984 and 1995 on rates of avoidable hospitalizations and deaths in the

hospital from heart attacks and motor vehicle accidents. As pointed out by the author,

however, by focusing solely on hospital discharges, Vigdor (1999) cannot assess the

effect of closures on the health of people who never make it to the hospital in an

emergency or on people who rely on hospital-based outpatient facilities.

        In this paper, we address the gap in the literature by assessing the impact of

hospital closures in the Los Angeles Region on perceived access to care, actual health

care utilization, and health outcomes. We consider closures through their effect on

distance from a resident’s home to the nearest hospital. Past work shows that patients

typically choose both providers and hospitals, particularly for acute conditions, based on

proximity and reduced travel time (McGuirk and Porell 1984, Cohen and Lee 1985,

Dranove et al. 1993, McClellan et al. 1994). Thus, increased distance may translate to

reduced access to care. While patients affected by a closure in urban areas often have

other hospitals nearby, the reduction in hospital supply may lead to increased crowding at

and reduced access to the facilities remaining in the market.2 As a result, some may

forgo or delay care when obtaining it becomes more of a hassle.

2
 One recent study reports that in 90 percent of urban communities that experienced a closure between 1990
and 2000, emergency and inpatient care were still available within 10 miles of the closed facility
(Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General 2003).


                                                   2
        On the other hand, it is possible that closures may have beneficial effects on

patients who are directly affected. Since closed hospitals are typically low-volume, poor-

performers, health care outcomes might improve as residents are forced to choose among

the remaining higher volume hospitals. Similarly, closures may shift some patients’

usual source of care from a hospital to physician offices or community clinics, which are

generally viewed as more appropriate sources of primary care.

        To the extent that closures affect access and utilization, the effects are likely to

vary with patient characteristics. We expect the effect of closures to be greatest on

seniors, who travel shorter distances to the hospital (Vigdor 1999) and low-income

patients, who are both less likely to travel far and more likely to use the hospital as their

“regular” source of care (Weissman and Epstein 1994).3 Indeed, in a study of hospital

choice for maternal delivery in the San Francisco Bay Area, Phibbs et al. (1993) find that

Medi-Cal women rely more heavily on public transportation than privately insured

women and are therefore more sensitive to distance. Given the higher likelihood among

Medi-Cal women of delivering at hospitals lacking specialized neonatal care and with

worse perinatal outcomes, the authors interpret distance as a barrier to effective care for

the poor. Similarly, in a study using national data, Currie and Reagan (2003) find that

central-city black children living further from a hospital are less likely to have had a

check-up, regardless of their insurance status. Both studies suggest that to the extent that

closures force nearby residents to travel further for care, poor women and children may

be particularly adversely affected. 4


3
  Among children with a regular source of care in 1993, only 5 percent of the privately insured rely on a
clinic or emergency room whereas 35 percent of publicly insured and 20 percent of uninsured do so (Bloom
1997a). The breakdown by insurance status is similar for working-age adults (Bloom 1997b).
4
  Patients whose choice of hospital is determined largely by proximity may be vulnerable in other, less


                                                   3
        There may also be important differences with respect to health conditions. Even

if the closure of weaker, poorer performing hospitals improves the average quality of

hospitals, closures may have negative consequences for certain types of patients. In

particular, outcomes for patients experiencing health events requiring fast attention, such

as injuries sustained in an accident or a heart attack (AMI) may be affected by small

changes in travel distance (Herlitz et al. 1993). In contrast, we would not expect urban

hospital closures to affect mortality from conditions like cancer, where immediate

emergency care is less relevant.

        Our analysis is based on two distinct sources of health data: household surveys

conducted by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS)

between 1997 and 2002, the period when most of the recent closures were occurring, and

annual administrative zip code level mortality data from the California Department of

Health Services. The survey data, which provide information on residential location,

allow us to assess the impact of changes in hospital proximity on perceived health care

access and reported health care utilization. The administrative data give us an

independent source of information on health outcomes, not subject to self-reporting bias.

        We find that increased distance to the nearest hospital is associated with a lower

probability of identifying an emergency room or an outpatient hospital clinic as a usual

source of care. It is also associated with an increase in the probability of respondents’

reporting a doctor’s office as the place they go when sick or in need of health care advice.

Distance has little effect on perceived access to care in the population generally, though it



easily measured ways. For example, several studies indicate that within the same medical center, patients
who travel farther to receive elective care or even cancer treatment have better outcomes than similar
patients with the same disease and receiving the same treatment, but who live nearby (Ballard et al. 1994,
Goodman et al. 1997, Lamont et al. 2003).


                                                     4
is negatively related to perceived access for lower-income residents who tend to rely

more on hospitals. This effect is partially offset by insurance. Among the elderly,

distance is negatively related to the probability of receiving an influenza vaccine. In

contrast, we find that hospital closures are associated with an increase in the probability

that those with health insurance receive colon cancer screening, possibly reflecting a

switch among residents to higher quality hospitals or their increased use of office-based

physician care, where referrals for such screening are common.

        Increased distance to the nearest hospital is also associated with delays in the

receipt of prenatal care and a rise in infant mortality rates, though the latter effect is

sensitive to the empirical specification. Finally, we find evidence that increased distance

is associated with increased deaths from unintentional injuries and acute myocardial

infarction, but not from other causes such as cancer or chronic heart disease, for which

timely emergency care is less important.



Data and Methods

        Data Sources

        We use several independent sources of data. The first is household level data

from the Los Angeles County Health Surveys (LACHS), which were conducted by the

LACDHS in 1997, 1999/2000, and 2002/2003. The LACHS, which surveys roughly

8000 adults, depending on the year, asks several questions on perceived access to care

and self-reported utilization. Specifically, the survey asks whether the individual has a

usual source of care (and where it is), how they perceive their access to care (very to

somewhat difficult versus very to somewhat easy), and whether or not they have received




                                               5
several different types of preventive care (colon cancer screening, vaccines, HIV tests).

In addition, it has detailed information about a respondent’s health status, demographics,

socio-economic status, and medical insurance status. Importantly for this analysis, there

is also information on the zip code of each respondent’s residence, which allows us to

link respondents to measures of distance to the nearest hospital.5

           To examine the effect of distance to the nearest hospital on health outcomes, we

use zip code level birth and death reports from California’s Department of Health

Services. Using the birth data, we assess the impact of distance to the nearest hospital on

the receipt of prenatal care and infant mortality rates. The expected effect is theoretically

ambiguous. On the one hand, previous studies have been shown maternal health care

access, and thus infant health, to be sensitive to distance (Phibbs et al. 2003). Moreover,

the time it takes to get to an emergency room may be critical for an infant’s recovery

from an accident or a serious acute illness occurring after discharge from the hospital.

On the other hand, when smaller hospitals with less technically advanced facilities close,

more births may occur at larger hospitals with better facilities (e.g., neo-natal intensive

care units), which may lead to better birth outcomes.

           We use cause-specific mortality data from 1997-2001 to test for an effect of

distance to the nearest hospital on mortality from conditions for which access to timely

emergency care is likely to be an important determinant of survival. Specifically, we

examine the effect of distance on the count of deaths from heart attacks and unintentional

injuries. As a specification check, we also consider the relationship between distance on

the number of deaths from colon and lung cancer and chronic ischemic heart disease,

outcomes that should be not be sensitive to how long it takes to get to the nearest

    Zip codes are stripped from the publicly available LACHS data.

hospital. A finding that distance is related to these outcomes would most likely be

spurious, which would then cast doubt on our research design.

        To calculate changes in travel distances from the center of each zip code in Los

Angeles County to the address of the nearest hospital, we use data from the 1997-2001

Office of Statewide Health Planning’s (OSHPD’s) Annual Utilization Report of Hospitals

1997-2001, supplemented by OSHPD’s 2002 Hospital Facility Listing. We consider

hospitals in the entire Los Angeles Region, as the nearest hospital to certain County

residents may lie in neighboring counties within the Region. Since changes in proximity

to the hospital for LA County residents came almost exclusively through closures,

whereas residents from other parts of the region experience many changes due to

openings as well as closures (see Table 1), we restrict our analysis to LA County.6



        Econometric Specification

        We use a quasi-experimental design to examine how changes in the travel

distance from the population center of each zip code in Los Angeles County to the

nearest hospital have affected perceived access, self-reported health care utilization, and

actual health outcomes among residents in that zip code.7 Essentially we compare

changes for individuals in areas where hospitals closed to otherwise similar individuals in

areas where the availability of hospital services remained constant. One set of

regressions uses the individual-level data from the LACHS, while another uses annual


6
  LA County residents were affected by 1 opening, a Kaiser facility in Baldwin Park. Because it occurred
just prior to the closing of another neighborhood facility, Santa Rosa Hospital, distance from the two
affected zip centers to the nearest hospital was virtually unchanged. Moreover, as Kaiser is technically
open only to its enrollees, we are understating the true change in distance from the Santa Rosa closing.
7
  The zip center coordinates from http://www.oseda.missouri.edu/uic/zip.resources.html are essentially a
population-weighted average of the coordinates for the census blocks in a zip code area. They are virtually
identical to the zip center coordinates given by both Yahoo!® Maps and MapQuest®.


                                                     7
utilization and mortality data aggregated to the level of the zip code. For both types of

data, the general form of the econometric specification is:



    (1)      Yzt = αDistancezt + X’β + γt + δz + εzt,



where the dependent variable, Y, includes the measures of access, utilization and health

outcomes just described. Control variables are represented by the vector X. In the

models estimated using the LACHS data the controls are individual characteristics that

are likely to affect medical care utilization and perceived access, such as income, health

insurance coverage and health status. We also include some neighborhood characteristics

such as the number of community health clinics in a zip code and city-level

unemployment rates.8

          In the zip code level infant mortality models, the controls include the share of

births delivered by race of mother (White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, Filipino, American

Indian and unknown), share of births by weight category (under 1500g, 1500-2499g, over

2500g and weight unknown) and share of births by mother’s age group (under 20, 20-29,

30-34, 35 and over, and age unknown). When we consider counts of infant deaths (in

contrast to infant death rates), we include the total number of births in the zip code as an

additional covariate. The models of other mortality counts in a zip code include controls

for total deaths, deaths by homicide (to proxy for the general risk of the neighborhood)


8
  Annual unemployment rates are available for 125 cities and “census designated places” through the
California Economic Development Department’s “Labor Force Data on Sub-County Areas in California.”
For cities missing unemployment rates, we use the county-year average. We also include an indicator for
this substitution in the regressions. Clinics, which are listed in OSHPD’s Primary Care Clinic Listings,
open and close based on where there is greatest need (US GAO 1995). Thus, we use counts of clinics in an
area to proxy for the health care needs and status of a community.


                                                   8
and the age distribution of deaths (to proxy for the age structure of the neighborhood).

Both the infant mortality and the mortality count models also control for the number of

health clinics in the zip code.

         The terms γt and δz are fixed effects for time (i.e., year) and geographic area. In

all of the models we present, we include zip code fixed effects. In these specifications,

the effect of distance is identified by changes in mean distance induced by hospital

closures. The advantage of this approach is that we can account very completely for

differences in demand that may exist across areas due to factors such as the

socioeconomic characteristics of the population. In the mortality regressions we also

report specifications that include separate time trends for each zip code to account for

demographic or economic shifts within a zip code that are not common across areas.

Because we have only three years of survey data, however, we do not include zip code-

specific time trends in any of the models of individual health care access or use.

         Because hospital closures are quite rare, a possible disadvantage of this estimation

strategy is that the model is identified by changes affecting a fairly small percentage of

the population. Therefore, as an alternative specification, we estimate models that

replace the zip code dummy variables with city or “community” fixed effects.9 To the

extent that these communities are relatively homogeneous with respect to demographics

and other demand side variables, this specification exploits additional within-community

differences in distance related to the location of all hospitals, not just those that closed or

opened during the period of the analysis.


9
 For areas outside of the city of Los Angeles we use the city as the geographic unit in this specification.
Within Los Angeles we include separate fixed effects for distinct communities such as Brentwood,
Hollywood, Encino and Boyle Heights. These communities are geographically compact and relatively
homogeneous in terms of economic and demographic characteristics.


                                                      9
         Another possible limitation of (1) is that it assumes that the effect of distance is

the same for all residents of an area, which clearly may not be the case. To the extent

that uninsured patients are more likely to use emergency departments and hospital-based

clinics as a source of primary care, we would expect them to be more strongly affected by

the distance to the nearest hospital. Similarly, lower income people are likely to face

higher transportation costs, which would translate to a larger effect of distance on access

and utilization. In the models using the LACHS data we test for these possible

differential effects by estimating models in which the distance variable is interacted with

insurance coverage. We also estimate models on a sub-sample of individuals reporting

an annual household income of less than $30,000. 10

         All of the outcomes from the LACHS are dichotomous: whether the usual source

of care is an emergency room or hospital-based clinic, whether or not the respondent

believes she has good access to care, and whether or not the person has received several

types of preventive care or diagnostic tests. For these outcomes we estimate probit

models. In our analysis of deaths (infant mortality as well as deaths of all residents by

cause), we use negative binomial models, exploiting the nonnegative count nature of

mortality data while using a more flexible functional form than the more common

Poisson model.11 We do this to avoid introducing additional noise into the analysis,

since in many zip code years there are few deaths of any given type.12 In all models we

adjust standard errors to allow for correlation in the error terms at the zip code level.13


10
   Median household income in Los Angeles County in 2000 is roughly $42,000.
11
   The Negative Binomial model is essentially a Poisson regression model with unobserved heterogeneity
introduced by a gamma distributed error term. This more flexible functional form allows for over-
dispersion. Hausman et al. (1984) pioneered the approach; Long (1997) provides a good review.
12
   For example, in 30 percent of all zip code years there are no infant deaths and in 54 percent there are
fewer than 5 deaths from unintentional injuries.
13
   Failure to account for this will cause the precision of our estimates to be overstated, leading to an over-


                                                      10
Results

         Descriptive Statistics: LACHS

         Table 2 presents summary statistics for LACHS respondents overall and

separately according to whether they live in zip codes that experienced a change in

distance to the closest hospital during the sample period. For the full sample, the average

driving distance to the nearest hospital is 2.64 miles. The figures in the second and third

columns show that the average distance is greater for individuals who faced an increase

in distance due to a closure compared to individuals for whom the distance did not

change. This is also true before closures (not shown here): zip codes that experienced

hospital closures during this period experienced an increase in driving distance to the

nearest hospital by about a mile, from an average driving distance of just under 3 miles to

almost 4 miles. Within this group, the change in distance associated with a closure

ranged from roughly a tenth of a mile to about 3.6 miles.

         Other differences between the two groups suggest the importance of controlling

for individual characteristics and area fixed effects. Those who faced a change were

significantly more likely to be white (54 vs. 39 percent), U.S. citizens (84 vs. 77 percent),

English-speaking (81 vs. 76 percent) and have a college or post-graduate degree (37 vs.

30 percent). Respondents in affected zip codes are also more likely to have private health

insurance (58 vs. 51 percent), less likely to have Medi-Cal (4.5 vs. 8.3 percent) and less

likely to rely on hospital for care (10 vs. 14 percent). Those affected by closures also

have better self-reported health and access to care. These differences are not surprising

given that several of the neighborhoods that lost hospitals (e.g. Beverly Hills, Burbank,


rejection of the hypothesis that changes in distance to the nearest hospital have no effect on access to care
(Moulton 1986; Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan 2004).


                                                      11
and North Hollywood) are relatively affluent. To the extent that our models do not fully

capture this heterogeneity and that the group experiencing a change in distance is

“healthier,” and of higher SES, we risk understating any negative effects of closure on

vulnerable populations.

         The last part of Table 2 presents the outcomes we examine. The measures of

usual source of care and perceived access are defined for the full sample. In contrast, the

questions concerning the receipt of various types of preventive care were targeted to

specific relevant populations—e.g., individuals over age 50 for colon cancer screening,

individuals over age 65 for flu and pneumonia vaccines and women of different ages for

Pap smears and mammograms.



            Probit Regression Results: Access to Care and Preventive Screening

         The probit regression results for these outcomes are reported in Table 3 (usual

source of care and place of care), Table 4 (perceived access) and Table 5 (preventive

care). For all models, we report marginal effects (i.e., probability derivatives) computed

at the sample means of the data rather than the raw coefficients. Marginal effects of

health-related controls are reported in Appendix Tables 1, 2 and 3.14 In all cases, the

“marginal effect” of the interaction between insurance and distance is calculated as the

cross-derivative of the standard normal cumulative distribution with respect to distance

and insurance, evaluated at the sample means of the data (Ai and Norton 2003).

         Panel A of Table 3 looks at whether the respondent has a "particular regular

14
   For sake of brevity, we do not discuss these covariates in the text though they are interesting in their own
right. For example, they confirm that more vulnerable patients (e.g. those with poor self-reported health
status and diabetics) are more likely to use an ED or hospital based clinic as their regular source of care.
Similarly, those with poor self-reported health status and arthritics (primarily seniors), report more
difficulty accessing care.


                                                      12
source of care where he/she goes most often." Columns (1) and (3) consider the main

distance effect alone; columns (2) and (4) include the interaction between health

insurance and distance. In the full sample (columns (1) and (2)), hospital closures have

little detectable effect on the probability of reporting a usual source of care. Surprisingly,

in the low-income sample, a one-mile increase in distance to the nearest hospital is

associated with an almost 2 percent increase in the likelihood of reporting a particular

place where care is sought.15 One possible explanation for this counter-intuitive result is

that around the time of a closure, county or city authorities may have increased outreach

efforts to encourage low-income patients who had relied on the hospital emergency room

(but perhaps did not view it as a “usual” source of care) to find an alternative. Similarly,

low-income residents may have responded to the considerable media attention given to

hospital closures by identifying an alternative source of care. Finally, some physicians or

clinics that serve low-income populations may have seen closures as a business

opportunity and either moved into the area or marketed their services more aggressively.

         The results in Panels B and C suggest that in the full sample the zero effect on

having a usual source of care masks an effect of closures on where patients receive care.

Increased distance to the hospital is associated with a decrease in reliance on an ED or

clinic when sick (Panel B). Although these effects are not significant at conventional

levels, if we exclude patients without a regular source of care (not shown here), the full

sample results indicate that a one-mile increase in distance is associated with a

statistically significant 1.3 percentage point decline in the probability of reporting an ED

or clinic as the source of care (off a base of 17 percent). This reduction coincides with an

15
  The increased likelihood of having a regular place of care appears to be independent of health insurance
(see col (4), Panel A) but further analysis using separate interactions for Medi-Cal, Medicare, and “private”
insurance (not shown here), suggests that the increase is common to all but Medicare beneficiaries.


                                                     13
increased reliance on a physician’s office (Panel C). In both the full and low-income

samples, respondents report a 2 to 3 percentage point increase in the likelihood of going

to a doctor’s office when sick. This effect, which is independent of insurance status, is

quite large for the low-income group, suggesting an almost 5 percent increase in

reporting that a doctor’s office is the usual place of care.16

         Table 4 takes the analysis a step further by asking how closures and the

subsequent shifting of sources of care affect perceived access. Results are given

separately for those with (Panel A) and without (Panel B) a regular source of care. Not

surprisingly, across all residents, increased distance appears to have little effect on

perceived access to care. For low-income respondents, however, a one-mile increase in

the distance to the nearest hospital results in a roughly 3 percent decrease in ease of

obtaining health care. The effect is fully offset by health insurance, implying that low-

income uninsured residents, despite their increase in reporting a doctor’s office as their

usual source of care, perceive more difficulty in accessing care after a hospital closure.

Among low-income residents who report no regular source of care (Panel B) the effect is

independent of insurance status and is quite large. A one-mile increase in distance to the

hospital is associated with a 7.1 percentage point decline in reported ease of access,

which is nearly a 20 percent effect relative to the base of 38 percent. Seniors also report

decreased ease of access (not shown here), irrespective of insurance status. Among those

65 and over, a one-mile increase in distance is associated with a 5 percentage point

decline in ease of access to care off of a base of 85 percent.

         While reported source of care and perceived access are clearly important, we care


16
  This effect is independent of health insurance status, although here again further analysis suggests the
increase is common to all (uninsured, privately insured or Medi-Cal insured) but Medicare beneficiaries.


                                                     14
ultimately about the effect of hospital closures on the use of health care services and

health outcomes. The regressions reported in Table 5 examine the effect of changes in

the distance to the nearest hospital on use of health care services. Panel A considers

colon cancer screenings (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) in individuals over 50.17 In

both the full sample and the low-income subsample, the simplest model suggests a

negative though insignificant relationship between the probability of screening and

increased distance. When we include the insurance interaction, however, we find that

for insured individuals there is a positive relationship between distance and the

probability of screening, although the effect is not statistically significant for the low-

income group. For insured people in the full sample, a one-mile increase in distance to

the hospital is associated with a roughly 3 percentage point increase in the probability of

colon cancer screening or an almost 7.5 percent increase. 18 Since doctors typically

provide hospital referrals for this service, the increased screening may be attributable to

the increase in regular care sought in a physician’s office.

         We also estimated the effect of distance on HIV tests for adults under age 65

(Panel B). The coefficients on distance and the interaction between distance and

insurance status are all statistically insignificant. When we use an alternative

econometric specification, discussed in our sensitivity tests below, however, we find

evidence suggesting that hospital closures may decrease the likelihood the residents get


17
  The question was asked of those 40 and older in 1997 but only those 50 and older in subsequent surveys.
18
  The 1997 survey asks about tests in the last two years, whereas later surveys ask whether the respondent
has ever had the test. This change creates a bias toward finding a positive effect of distance as the 1997
pre-closure rate of screening in a zip code is by definition less than (or equal to) the lifetime screening rate.
Sensitivity tests limiting the sample to the 1999 and 2002 survey years yield results that are remarkably
similar for the insured respondents, suggesting a roughly 3 percentage point increase in the probability of a
screen with a one-mile increase in distance to the hospital. If anything the results above, understate the
negative effect on the uninsured. The results from the 1999-2002 data suggest that the uninsured
experience a 5-percentage point decline in colon cancer screens, significant at the 20 percent level.


                                                       15
screened for HIV.

       Panel C looks at flu shots in the past year and pneumonia vaccines (ever) for

those 65 and over. Because household income is less meaningful for this population, we

limit this analysis to the full sample of seniors. A one-mile increase in distance to the

hospital lowers the probability of having a flu shot by about 3 percentage points for all

seniors. While this result may seem surprising given that flu shots need not be given in a

hospital setting, it may reflect the fact that flu shot campaigns are often coordinated by a

local hospital. In addition, since hospitals are typically high-volume providers of flu

shots, closures may increase congestion at other facilities offering shots and thereby

decrease access to the vaccine. In contrast to flu shots, we find no effect of distance on

the probability of pneumonia vaccination. The difference between the pneumonia

vaccine and flu shot results, however, may be related to the fact that the pneumonia

vaccine is given to seniors on a roughly 10-year basis whereas the flu shot is given

yearly. Thus, even if seniors are less likely to go to the hospital for a vaccination, this

effect may only show up over a long time horizon.

       Finally, in models not reported, we examined the effect of distance on PAP smear

tests for women 18 and over, and mammograms for women over 40, all within the last

two years. Compared to the other types of preventive screening, there is less reason to

expect an effect of distance on these outcomes. PAP smears can be administered

anywhere and are commonly provided in physicians’ offices. Similarly, mammograms

are often given in dedicated, non-hospital based facilities. It is not surprising, then, that

for these outcomes we find no discernable effect of distance to the nearest hospital.




                                              16
       Sensitivity Tests

       As noted above, by controlling for geographic area effects at such a fine level, we

are identifying the impact of hospital closures only as they affect those in the immediate

surroundings of the hospital. And, since closures are relatively rare, we capture changes

in health of a fairly small percentage of the population. As an alternative specification,

we replace the zip code with community or neighborhood fixed effects. To the extent

that these communities are relatively homogeneous with respect to demographics and

other demand side variables, this specification exploits additional within-community

differences in distance to the location of all neighborhood hospitals, not just those that

closed during the period of analysis.

       Results using this less restrictive model (see Appendix Table 4) are generally

quite similar to those with zip code fixed effects. The colon cancer screening results are

virtually identical in magnitude but more precisely estimated. In the case of HIV tests,

this alternative specification indicates that an additional mile in distance to the nearest

hospital is associated with a statistically significant 0.5 percentage point decline in

probability of receiving screening. The effect is also negative and of similar magnitude

for low-income residents, although only significant at the 19 percent level. In contrast

the flu vaccine results are no longer statistically significant when we include

neighborhood rather than zip code fixed effects.

       Another potential problem with our main analyses is that, as demonstrated by the

descriptive statistics in Table 2, people in zip codes not affected by hospital closures are

quite different from those in affected zip codes and thus do not necessarily make a good

control group. Since those who did experience an increase in distance to the hospital




                                              17
were typically higher SES, however, any bias from the choice of control group is likely to

understate deleterious effects of closures and overstate any positive effects.

        One way to more fully control for this heterogeneity is to restrict the analysis to

respondents living in zip codes where there was a change in distance to the nearest

hospital at some point during the sample period (see Appendix Table 5). Restricting the

sample in such a manner cuts the number of observations down by about 85 percent, from

about 22,000 to almost 3,000 respondents, and typically, though not always, reduces the

precision of the results. In general, however, the results are qualitatively similar. In a

few cases, the results suggest that the estimated effects (both positive and negative) using

the full sample are understated. The increase in colon cancer screens among insured

residents is still statistically significant at the 5 percent level and is about twice the

magnitude, suggesting a one-mile increase in distance to the hospital increases the

probability of being screened for colon cancer by about 6 percentage points. Similarly,

the probability of HIV screening among insured residents declines by 1.8 percentage

points, implying a 6 percent reduction in screening that is statistically significant at the 2

percent level. The restricted sample results also suggest that the flu shot estimates from

the full sample are understated. The results from the restricted sample imply that a one-

mile increase in distance leads to nearly a 10-percentage point decline in testing (a 14

percent effect relative to the sample mean), which is significant at the 10 percent level.

        Although the precise magnitude of the results vary somewhat across

specifications or samples, the basic qualitative results are clear. On net, the LACHS

results suggest both positive and negative effects due to the closure of even poor

performing hospitals. Not surprisingly, the negative effects are largely concentrated in




                                               18
vulnerable populations – lower income residents, the uninsured, and seniors.



Zip Code Level Analysis of Prenatal Care and Infant Mortality

        We now turn to our analysis of mortality using zip code level administrative data.

Table 6 summarizes the data that we use to analyze the effect of hospital closures on

receipt of prenatal care and infant mortality. As expected given the LACHS data,

mothers in zip codes that faced closures are more likely to be white and less likely to be

black or Hispanic. They tend to be older and are also significantly more likely to have

received prenatal care in their 1st trimester of pregnancy. The birth weight distribution of

their babies is not statistically significant different and the infant death rate is only

slightly lower from that of mothers in zip codes that experienced no change in distance to

the nearest hospital.

        The first two columns of Table 7 consider early use of prenatal care services

among women who eventually give birth. With or without zip code time trends, we find

a negative effect of increased distance on the share of births that received 1st trimester

prenatal care. The effect of distance is larger in the model that includes the zip code

trends (-0.658 vs. -0.144), where it is statistically significant at the 6 percent level.

However, even this effect is small in economic terms. Relative to the mean of the

dependent variable (864), the result in column 2 represents a 0.08% effect.

        Next, we examine the effect of distance to the nearest hospital on infant deaths.

In columns 3 and 4, the dependent variable is the infant mortality rate (deaths per 1000

live births). Columns 5 and 6 report results from negative binomial regressions in which

the dependent variable is the total number of infant deaths; in this specification the total




                                               19
number of births enters on the right hand side. Overall, these models are suggestive of an

effect of distance on infant deaths, though the results are sensitive to the specification. In

column 3, a one-mile increase in distance to the nearest hospital is associated with a .061

increase in infant deaths per 1000 live births. However, when zip code specific trends are

included, the sign on the effect flips and is no longer statistically significant. Similarly,

the basic negative binomial model implies that a one-mile increase in distance to the

nearest hospital is associated with a roughly 7 percent increase in the number of deaths in

the first year of life, but the effect is smaller (4.7%) and not statistically significant (p-

value = 0.289) when we add separate time trends for each zip code.



Zip Code Level Analysis of Mortality from Other Causes

         Increased distance to the nearest hospital may affect survival probabilities of area

residents experiencing acute conditions for which prompt medical attention is crucial. To

test for such effects we consider the effect of distance on mortality from acute myocardial

infarction and unintentional injuries. As a check on these results, we estimate similar

models on outcomes where emergency care is much less important: chronic heart disease

and cancer. The summary statistics for the data used in this part of the analysis are

reported in Table 819 and the key regression results are in Table 9.

         For AMI, the basic model indicates that a one-mile increase in distance leads to a

nearly a 3% increase in the number of deaths (Table 9, column 1). The magnitude of this

effect more than doubles when we include zip code specific time trends (column 2). We

obtain similar results for deaths due to unintentional injuries: a one-mile increase in

19
  Consistent with the differences in SES found in the other data sets, fewer residents in zip codes
experiencing a change in distance die by homicide. In contrast, there is no significant difference in the
share of total deaths from heart attacks or unintentional injuries.


                                                     20
distance to the nearest hospital is associated with a roughly 4 to 6 percent increase in the

number of deaths, with the larger effect coming from the model with the zip code specific

time trends.

        In contrast, we find no significant relationship between changes in distance to the

nearest hospital and deaths from chronic heart disease, colon cancer or lung cancer.

Given our LACHS findings of increased colon cancer screenings among those with

health insurance and the fact that colon cancer is highly curable if diagnosed and treated

early (Tomeo 1999), we may have expected a consequent effect on colon cancer deaths.20

Since we cannot infer insurance status from death records, however, any effect of early

diagnosis on deaths from colon cancer may be masked in our data. Moreover, five years

may not provide a long enough time period to see any effect of increased diagnosis (and

subsequent treatment) on colon cancer death rates. Though not presented here for sake of

brevity, this invariance to distance is also found for deaths from chronic pulmonary

obstructive disorder (COPD), Alzheimer’s disease, and diabetes. We take these null

results as some confirmation that the heart attack and unintentional injury findings are

picking up real effects of changes in distance to the nearest hospital rather than some

unobserved factors affecting deaths more generally in these zip codes.



        Discussion

        While important, the finding that hospital closures in Los Angeles County may

have reduced access and increased mortality does not necessarily imply that the closures

were welfare-reducing. It is necessary to weigh these costs against the benefits of

20
  Unlike diagnostic tests for other forms of cancer or even many other diseases, colon cancer screenings
are a “primary prevention” method because early detection of precancerous polyps can prevent the actual
development of disease (Tomeo 1999).


                                                   21
closures, most importantly those benefits related to improved operating efficiency and

lower costs. While a full cost-benefit analysis of these closures is beyond the scope of

this paper, we can conduct a rough assessment.

        Scheffler et al. (2001) document that the California hospitals that closed during

the period of our study were smaller than average and, prior to closing, had weaker

financial performance than those that remained opened. They calculate that statewide

these closures reduced total inpatient capacity by between 3 and 4 percent. Shifting care

to more efficient hospitals and reducing excess capacity should have reduced system-

wide costs. According to Lindrooth et al. (2003), urban hospital closures result in a

roughly 3 percent reduction in costs per adjusted admission. Applying this estimate to

the average cost per adjusted admission in 1999 in Los Angeles County of $2346 and an

annual figure of 5.5 million patient days (OSHPD 2001), implies that the closures in LA

County in the late 1990s saved approximately $387 million per year.

       Our analysis suggests that the greatest cost of hospital closures is due to the

increase in deaths from AMI and unintentional injuries. In our data, the zip code level

means for these outcomes are 14 deaths per year for AMI and 5 deaths per year for

accidents. Based on our estimates of the effect of a one-mile increase in distance, the

mean increase associated with hospital closures in our sample, closures increased AMI

deaths an average of 4.5 percent and deaths due to unintentional injuries an average of the

4.85 percent. Together, these estimates translate to an additional 0.873 deaths per year in

affected zip codes. Since 35 zip codes were affected, this implies that closures in LA

County resulted in an average of 30.5 additional deaths per year. Ignoring the fact that

those who die from AMI are typically middle-aged and using standard value of life




                                            22
estimates of between $1 and $5 million (Viscusi 1993), the mortality-related costs of

hospital closures may be as high as $92 million, well below the estimated cost savings.

         Supplementing this rough cost-benefit calculation with the net costs of reduced

HIV testing and influenza vaccinations as well as decreased access to care are unlikely to

change this basic assessment. This average calculation, however, masks specific,

changes in health care use that may not have been cost-beneficial. For example, consider

the effect of closures on flu shots among the elderly, which numerous studies find to be

very cost-effective (see Nichol 2003 for an extensive review). One study of elderly

members of a health maintenance organization found that influenza vaccines reduced

direct medical costs by an average of $73 per person, largely by reducing hospitalizations

(Nichol et al. 1998). Our results imply that the hospital closures in LA County resulted in

over 26,700 fewer seniors receiving vaccines.21 Combining these two estimates would

imply that the reduced immunizations caused by the closures led to additional medical

costs of over $1.8 million. Flu vaccines have also been shown to reduce mortality among

the elderly. One meta-analysis cited in Nichol (2003) suggests that vaccinating seniors

reduces deaths from all causes by about 50 percent. With about 42,000 deaths per year

among seniors in the County and a value of $25,000 per additional year of life lived and 5

more years of life expected, the reduction implies a cost of almost $74 million (42,000 *

.50 * .028 * $125,000) in years of life lost.22




21
   Specifically, we find that closures reduced the probability of being immunized by 2.8 percentage points.
This effect and a total senior population of 955,000 equal 26,740.

Conclusions

       Past work has shown that urban hospital closures improve the efficiency of the

health care systems by shifting care to lower cost facilities (Lindrooth et al. 2003). In a

similar vein, we find that hospital closures shift care previously given in emergency

rooms and outpatient clinics to doctor’s offices, a more appropriate and cost-effective

source of regular care (Baker and Baker 1996). Although these efficiency savings from

hospital closures are extremely important, they tell only part of the story.

       We find that proximity to a hospital is an important determinant of access to care

for the more vulnerable residents in Los Angeles County. Lower-income residents and

seniors, who tend to rely more on hospitals, report more difficulty accessing care as a

result of closures, though this effect is partially offset by insurance. Moreover, increased

distance to the hospital lowers the probability that seniors receive flu shots, that younger

residents get screened for HIV and the timeliness of prenatal care for pregnant women.

       Cause-specific mortality data suggests that urban hospital closures also have

implications for the population more generally. We find strong evidence that increased

distance to the nearest hospital is associated with higher mortality counts from emergent

conditions, such as heart attacks and unintentional injuries. We also find some evidence

that distance to the nearest hospital is positively related to infant mortality, though these

results are less robust. Overall, we conclude that the costs associated with these adverse

outcomes are outweighed by the efficiency gains related to hospital closures. Social

welfare may be further increased, however, by promoting low-cost, non-hospital-based

ways of treating emergent conditions after a local hospital closure.

Notes: The neighboring counties are Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino.General Acute Care
(GAC) hospitals are all nonfederal hospitals except psychiatric hospitals (acute or long term), chemical
recovery hospitals, and state correctional facilities. A GAC hospital is listed as having closed in 1998 if it
appeared in the 1997 but not the 1998 or later years. Some hospitals that were incorrectly not listed in
certain years were added back to the data; a detailed list of the reporting errors is available on request.

Notes: Standard errors for continuous variables are given in parenthesis. With the exception of the hospital data which
are from OSHPD, data are from the (adult) Los Angeles County Health Survey (LACHS) 1997, 1999/2000 and
2002/2003. Miles to closest hospital is defined as the MapQuest® driving distance from the population centroid or in
some cases the physical center of a zip code to the closest hospital. Insurance and health status questions refer to time
of survey. BMI is defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Self-assessed health status
ranges from excellent (1) to poor (5). Colon cancer screens include colonoscopies and sigmoidoscopies among
respondents 50 and over in their lifetime. All other questions about diagnostic exams refer to the past two years. The
flu shot refers to this year while the pneumonia vaccine refers to the respondent’s lifetime.

Notes: Standard errors are clustered at the zip code level. Absolute value of t-statistics are and shown in
parenthesis for the OLS regression and of z-statistics for the negative binomial regression (NBR) models.
The key independent variable is the driving distance from each zip code population center to the closest
hospital in a given year. All models also control for both the age and racial distribution of mothers, the
weight distribution of babies, the number of community health clinics, zip code fixed effects and year fixed
effects. Where indicated, zip-code specific time trends are also included. The NBR models also control for
total births. (Since the mean of the dependent variable in a binomial regression model is parameterized as
µi = exp(Xi’β), the percentage change in expected deaths from a unit change in distance is given by
100*[exp(βk)-1]. )
