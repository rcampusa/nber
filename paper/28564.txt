Climate Royalty Surcharges

NBER Working Paper No. 28564

JEL No. H23,Q35,Q38,Q54,Q58

                                        ABSTRACT

In 2019, production on federal lands comprised 40% of domestic coal, 22% of domestic oil, and
12% of domestic natural gas production. Currently, the federal fossil fuel leasing program
does not consider the climate costs of burning federal fossil fuels. One way to do so is
through a climate royalty surcharge in addition to the current royalty rate, set in 1920, of
12.5% (18.75% offshore). We consider determining this surcharge by maximizing revenue,
maximizing welfare, or setting royalties to achieve 80% of the emissions reductions of an
outright leasing ban. Using the model in Prest (2021), we calculate the resulting surcharges
and their implications. We estimate that all three approaches would lead to meaningful declines
in global emissions, and the first two would substantially increase royalty receipts, which
are split with the state of production. For example, we estimate that choosing a common
royalty rate to maximize revenues yields a climate royalty surcharge of 39%, increases
annual royalty receipts by $6.2B, and reduces global emissions by 37 to 63 MMton CO2e/year.

Starting in the 19th century for coal, and in the 20th century for oil and gas, the US government
promoted fossil fuel extraction from federal lands. Fossil fuel production on federal lands helped
drive settlement of the American West, provided a secure domestic supply of energy to a
growing nation, and created jobs and wealth. In 2019, production on federal lands comprised
40% of domestic coal production, 22% of domestic oil production, and 12% of domestic natural
gas. Now, however, we understand that CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels is the primary
driver of climate change. As a result, there have been calls to rethink the federal government's
role in fossil fuel leasing in the context of the broader energy transition to a decarbonized
economy.

A week after entering office, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008, which paused new
oil and natural gas leases on public lands and offshore waters; federal coal leasing was, in effect,
already on pause because of the lack of demand for new leases. The Executive Order instructs
the Secretary of the Interior to examine the climate and other environmental consequences of the
federal mineral leasing program, including considering "whether to adjust royalties associated
with coal, oil, and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters, or take other
appropriate action, to account for corresponding climate costs."

This note addresses three issues raised by this EO. First, to the immediate point, we lay out
general economic considerations why it may or may not be appropriate to adjust royalties based
on climate considerations. In brief, while CO2 emissions from burning federal fossil fuels
contributes to climate damages, whether those emissions can be mitigated by programmatic
reforms depends on several factors. One such factor is the extent to which foregone federal
production is simply replaced by nonfederal production; another is any interaction with other
climate policies that in effect place a price on CO2 emissions, although at the moment there are
no such policies in the United States. The question of spillovers, or leakage, into nonfederal
production is an empirical one. Consistent with estimates in the literature, our modeling indicates
that leakage is incomplete, so raising federal fossil fuel royalties would in fact produce climate
benefits.

Second, we estimate how large those benefits would be as a function of a royalty adjustment to
account for climate costs. We examine two key metrics: total royalty receipts and (net) abated
carbon. Because there is essentially no demand for new coal leases, we focus on federal oil and
gas and find that total royalties follow a "Laffer curve": at low values of the climate royalty
surcharge, total receipts increase, but at some point they plateau then decline. A subtlety is that
carbon damages are typically measured in dollars per ton of CO2, but federal royalties are
assessed as a percentage of extraction revenue. Because the prices and carbon intensities of oil
and gas differ, the same carbon fee ($/ton CO2) implies different percentages of price for oil and
for gas. We therefore consider three options for a climate cost assessment: applying the same
carbon fee ($/ton CO2) to both oil and gas; applying the same climate royalty surcharge


                                                 2
(percentage points); or applying different carbon fees to oil and gas. All carbon fees or royalty
surcharges are in addition to the current federal royalty rate.

Third, we address the question of how one might choose the carbon fee or, alternatively, the
climate royalty surcharge.

One principle is to maximize royalty revenue. This principle has three justifications, two of
which pertain to climate change. First, because royalty revenues are split equally between the
federal government and the state of extraction, the revenue-maximizing rate maximizes the funds
going to states to address the challenges that fossil-fuel extraction communities will face as a
result of the broader energy transition, with or without a change in royalties. Second, we find that
the revenue-maximizing rate significantly reduces emissions without shutting down fossil fuel
leasing altogether. Third, putting climate concerns aside, the revenue-maximizing rate achieves a
long-standing goal of obtaining value for the taxpayer from selling federally owned resources.1

A second principle for choosing the royalty surcharge is to maximize social welfare. Welfare
maximization is a standard principle of optimal taxation theory (e.g., in the context of Pigovian
taxation, Sandmo (1975)). Hein (2018) argues that the welfare maximization principle, applied to
fossil fuel royalties, is consistent with the statutory mandate for the federal fossil fuel leasing
program.

The third principle is that a royalty rate schedule be chosen to phase out new federal fossil fuel
leasing by a specified date. This approach could, for example, be motivated by achieving a
carbon budget for emissions from federal fossil fuels. As we discuss, there are legal questions
about whether existing authorities authorize shutting down the program administratively, and in
any event we do not have available a downstream carbon budget for the federal leasing program.
We therefore approximate these ideas by considering a fee, or surcharge, that achieves 80% of
the emissions reductions that would be achieved by a total cessation of new fossil fuel leases.

We address these issues using a model of federal and nonfederal oil and gas production
developed by Prest (2021). We find that, if a single climate royalty surcharge is applied to both
oil and gas, revenues are maximized by a surcharge of approximately 39%. Currently, oil and gas
royalties are 12.5% onshore (18.75% offshore), values meant to compensate the taxpayer for the
value of the extracted fuels. Adding the climate royalty surcharge to the 12.5% onshore taxpayer
compensation rate yields a total federal royalty rate of 51.5%. We estimate that this would
generate approximately $6 billion of additional royalty revenues annually on average from 2020-
2050. We estimate that, under the revenue-maximizing rate, global emissions would fall by
roughly 37 MMT CO2e/year, approximately 40% of the reductions achieved by a leasing ban.

1
 CEA (2016) provides additional discussion of setting royalty rates to maximize revenue and estimates the revenue-
maximizing royalty rate for new federal coal leases.

                                                        3
Further reducing emissions from the revenue-maximizing rate to the level arising from a leasing
ban, reduces total royalty revenues by approximately $140-$240 per ton of additional CO2e
abated.

This revenue-maximizing common royalty surcharge is bracketed by welfare-maximizing
common royalty surcharges of 19% and 44%, respectively computed using a $50/mtCO2 Social
Cost of Carbon (SCC; the interim Biden administration central value is $51) and a $125/mtCO2
SCC (the New York State value, which uses a 2% discount rate instead of the 3% rate used for
the interim Biden value). Also, we estimate that a common royalty surcharge of approximately
70% would lead to a reduction of emissions of 80% of what would be achieved by a cessation of
all new leasing. There is considerable uncertainty around this 80%-reduction estimate, however,
because it extrapolates well outside the range of the data on which our estimates rely.

1.         The Federal Fossil Fuel Leasing Program

Federal fossil fuel leasing is governed by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (MLA) and the
Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The fossil fuel leasing program is
administered by the Department of the Interior, with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
managing onshore leasing and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) managing
offshore leasing. In 2019, fossil fuel production on federal lands comprised 40% of domestic
coal production, 22% of domestic oil production, and 12% of domestic gas production.

Since the 1920s, the federal royalty rate for surface-mined coal and onshore oil and gas has been
at the 12.5% floor established by the MLA; for underground coal, the royalty rate is 8%.2 In
2008, deepwater offshore rates for new drilling leases were increased from 12.5% to 16.67%,
then raised further in 2009 to 18.75%,3 where they currently stand for drilling in depths
exceeding 200 meters. Royalty rates are one of the terms of a lease. Federal coal leases have an
initial term of 20 years, with 10-year renewals; federal oil and gas leases have a primary lease
period of 10 years, with 2-year extensions. Once producing, a federal oil and gas lease is
extended indefinitely so long as wells on it can produce oil or gas.

Royalties are the primary, but not sole, source of US government revenues from federal fossil
fuel leasing. For onshore leases, tracts for potential mineral leasing are either identified by the
BLM or nominated by private parties. Mineral rights to those tracts are first auctioned
competitively to the highest bidder. If BLM receives at least one bid above $2 per acre, a value
specified in nominal terms in 1920 in the MLA, then BLM awards the bid to the highest bidder.
If no bid of $2 per acre is received, BLM makes the tract available on a first-come, first-serve

basis. The bids in excess of the $2 minimum are called bonus bids. In addition, the BLM receives
rents on the land of $1.50 per acre for the first five years of the lease and $2 per acre thereafter.4

Receipts under the federal fossil fuel leasing program are shown in Figure 1. Of the three
primary components of revenue ­ royalties, bonus bids, and rents ­ royalties comprised between
83% and 93% annually. In fiscal year 2019, the oil and gas program received $7.745 billion in
royalties, of which 85% was from oil, $496 million in bonus bids, and $130 million in rents.
Total receipts from the coal program are an order of magnitude less than for the oil & gas
program. Since FY 2017, coal bonus bid receipts have been less than $15 million annually, down
from $460 million in FY 2013, indicating the drying up of demand for new federal coal leases.5

The basis for current federal fossil fuel leasing royalties is ensuring a fair return to the taxpayer
for the right to extract the minerals from federal lands. Under FLPMA, the concept of fair return
is linked to "fair market value".6 Because burning federal fossil fuels imposes costs on others,
absent a price on carbon the market value does not account for the damages imposed by using
federal fossil fuels. This suggests, as indicated in the Biden EO, adjusting royalty rates to reflect
the costs of those climate damages.

There are various legal considerations regarding incorporating climate costs into royalty rates, or
ceasing fossil fuel leasing altogether, through administrative actions. The MLA specifies a
royalty rate "of not less than 12.5 percent" but does not specify a ceiling.7 Statutory language and
historical practice establishes the basis for considering environmental impacts in leasing
decisions. At the same time, BLM manages federal lands under FLPMA, with a "multiple use"
policy. Specifically, FLPMA states that oil, gas, and other minerals extraction programs should
support "the orderly and economic development of domestic mineral resources, reserves, and
reclamation of metals and minerals to help assure satisfaction of industrial, security and
environmental needs".8

  Coal leasing rules are different than oil and gas. BLM sets but does not disclose a minimum bonus bid based on its
assessment of the value of a tract, and if no bid is received above that floor, the auction fails. GAO (2013) found
that, of the 107 coal tracts leased from 1990 to 2013, 96 had a single bidder. A tract with a failed auction can be, and
frequently is, nominated again, providing the (typically sole) bidder with multiple opportunities to bid above the
floor. Our focus is on oil and gas leasing, so we do not pursue these issues further, see however CEA (2016), Hein
and Howard (2016), and Gerarden, Reeder, and Stock (2016) for additional discussion.

In 2016, the Department of the Interior issued a moratorium on new leases while it conducted a
programmatic environmental review of the coal leasing program (DOI 2017). The DOI explicitly
suggested a royalty surcharge, or adder, as one way to account for climate damages from burning
the fossil fuels. Krupnick et al. (2016) analyze the legal basis for changing federal coal royalties
administratively and conclude that DOI has the statutory and regulatory authority to impose a
carbon charge via the royalty rate. Hein (2018) reaches a similar conclusion for federal oil and
gas leasing as well as coal. At the same time, the multiple use mandate under FLPMA could be
interpreted as limiting administrative authority to permanently end leasing or to set a royalty rate

                                                       6
tantamount to permanently ending leasing. We take no stand on the legal issues, other than to
note that a climate royalty surcharge at some value less than a value tantamount to a leasing ban
might be attractive from a legal perspective.

2.       The Economics of Fossil Fuel Leasing Reform9,10

A climate royalty surcharge adjusts the price of the extracted fossil fuel so that it reflects the
damages caused by burning it, that is, it partially or completely internalizes the carbon
externality. Because the fair return principle does not incorporate climate considerations, any
adjustments to the royalty rate to account for climate costs would be in addition to the current
rate.

A climate royalty surcharge would increase the cost of production on federal lands and waters.
As a result, some drilling projects might become unprofitable, so the demand for federal drilling
leases would fall. The resulting decline in new leasing would reduce production on federal lands,
which would decrease total (federal plus nonfederal) production. Because the decrease in
production would tighten total supply, the market price of oil and gas would rise. This increase in
price would pull in additional nonfederal production, partially offsetting the decrease in
production on federal lands.

In general, nonfederal production will increase by less than the decline in federal production
because, at the higher price, consumer demand falls, so the total quantity of oil and gas used
declines. From the perspective of reducing CO2 emissions, the policy of incorporating climate
considerations into the federal royalty rate results in "leakage," because a fraction of the decline
in federal production is offset. The leakage rate  is the fraction of the reduction in emissions
from federally produced oil and gas that is offset by emissions from non-federally produced oil
and gas. The leakage rate is determined by supply and demand. On the supply side, if the lost

  The economics literature on incorporating climate considerations into fossil fuel leasing reform consists of
Gerarden, Reeder, and Stock (2020), Erickson and Lazarus (2018), and Prest (2021). Gerarden, Reeder, and Stock
(2020) (the published version of Gerarden, Reeder, and Stock (2016)) consider climate royalty surcharges in the
federal coal program and their interaction with demand-side CO2 regulation. Erikson and Lazarus (2018) estimate
potential reductions from the cessation of coal and oil (but not gas) leasing by 2030, using a static constant-elasticity
model that drew from estimates from the literature. Prest (2021) developed an eight-component combined model oil
and gas leasing, where each component is separately econometrically parameterized, to estimate the effect of
percentage-based and SCC-based royalty surcharges on emissions, production, and royalties annually through 2050.
This research fits into a growing body of research on supply-side climate policies, see Lazarus and van Asselt (2018)
for a survey.
10
   At a conceptual level, royalty rate determination under the concept of maximizing taxpayer return is part of the
theory of contracting and regulation with asymmetric information. A textbook treatment of this material is Laffont
and Tirole (1994), which makes the connection between auctions and regulation in a setting of asymmetric
information and moral hazard. For a review of the theoretical literature on royalty auctions, see Skrzypacz (2013).
Evidence on the relation between auction structure and government revenues is summarized in Haile, Hendricks,
and Porter (2010). For additional references to auction theory in the context of US oil and gas lease auctions (a
bonus bid auction not a royalty auction), see Compiani, Haile, and Sant'Anna (2020).

                                                           7
federal production is readily replaced by nonfederal production at nearly the same cost (that is, if
supply is elastic), then leakage will tend to be high. On the demand side, if the demand for oil
and gas is insensitive to price (that is, if demand is inelastic), then leakage will tend to be high.

There are two ways to quantify an adjustment that reflects the climate costs of federal fossil
fuels. The first, which we refer to as a carbon fee, is by a fee assessed per unit of production
(e.g., dollars per barrel of oil), where the fee is based on the monetized damages from burning
that fuel, which is in turn based on the carbon content of that fuel. The second, which we term a
climate royalty surcharge, is an ad valorem assessment, so that payments are a percentage of
sales. The carbon fee framework aligns with conventional applications of carbon pricing,
whereas the climate royalty surcharge aligns with the current ad-valorem percentage assessment
of federal royalties. Given a base price, a carbon fee can be recast as a climate royalty surcharge
and vice versa.

2.1    Carbon fees

Basic economic principles provide some guidance about setting carbon fees in the presence of a
carbon externality. Absent leakage ­ for example, if a fee (or tax) could be applied to all fossil
fuels, federal and nonfederal ­ the optimal policy in a standard model of welfare maximization is
to set the carbon fee equal to the marginal value of the avoided climate damage (e.g., Nordhaus
(1982)). The marginal damage is the net present value of current and future monetized climate
damages, that is, the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The units of this carbon fee are dollars per
ton CO2. We will refer to this as the welfare-maximizing carbon fee, although it should be kept
in mind that the model in which this maximizes welfare is a simple one that abstracts from other
externalities in the energy sector, such as research and network externalities, technology growth,
and from multiple real-world frictions and constraints.

With leakage, the optimal carbon fee no longer equals the SCC. Instead, the marginal damages
avoided are those from the net emissions avoided. These net climate damages avoided are (1-
)SCC for each ton of direct (or gross) emissions reductions, where  is the leakage rate. Thus,
the carbon fee , in dollars per ton CO2e, to apply to the covered fuel is  = (1-)SCC (Holland
2012).

The situation is more complicated when there are interactions in the supply of fuels, as is the
case for oil and gas because some wells produce both oil and gas. Because of co-production, a
change in market circumstances in one fuel will affect production of the other fuel. Thus, the
welfare-maximizing carbon fee for oil and gas takes into account the cross-effects resulting from
co-production. The resulting pair of welfare-maximizing per-ton carbon fees, oil and gas, are
given in the appendix.



                                                  8
Note that the carbon fee  is measured in units of dollars per ton of CO2e. One way to incorporate
climate considerations into payments for federal oil and gas production would be to have a two-
part payment, with one part being the current 12.5% (or 18.75% offshore) royalty payment and a
second part for the carbon fee. The first part is an ad valorem royalty, the second part an
assessment per quantity unit (e.g., dollars per barrel) of oil or gas produced.11 In native quantity
units, the fee would be e, where e is the carbon intensity of the fuel (e.g., tons CO2e per barrel).

2.2.     Implied climate royalty surcharge

Historically, federal fossil fuel royalties have been a percentage of sales, and there might be legal
or administrative reasons to continue an ad valorem assessment. A per-ton CO2e carbon fee  can
be converted to an ad-valorem climate royalty surcharge r using the emissions intensity and
price. For example, for oil, let Poil denote a benchmark price. Then the climate royalty surcharge,
roil, corresponding to a carbon fee oil. is roil = eoil/Poil, where eoil is the emissions intensity of oil
(tons CO2e per barrel). In practice, the benchmark price P could be a per-dollar wholesale price
of the fuel at the date of issuance of the lease. The total royalty rate is the taxpayer compensation
portion (12.5%) plus the climate royalty surcharge

Because oil and gas have different carbon intensities and prices, a single carbon fee implies
different values of the carbon royalty surcharge for oil and gas. Historically, however, royalty
rates have been the same for oil and gas for 100 years, and there might be legal or administrative
reasons to have the same ad-valorem climate royalty surcharge for both oil and gas. Whether the
royalty surcharges differ across fuels or are the same, at the welfare-maximizing climate royalty
surcharge, its marginal cost, in terms of royalty revenue, equals its marginal climate benefit. The
formula for the optimal common climate royalty surcharge when there is coproduction of oil and
gas and leakage across fuels is given in the Appendix.

2.3.     Determining the climate royalty surcharge

The effect of federal leasing reform on emissions is one important consideration, but so is the
effect of that reform on communities traditionally supported by fossil fuel extraction on federal
lands. Half of federal onshore royalty revenues is shared with the states (less a 2% administrative
charge; 90% for Alaska and special arrangements for Gulf of Mexico drilling), and those states
also receive revenues from separate state severance taxes, royalties, and/or other fees. As the
energy transition progresses, states and communities reliant on federal extraction will face fiscal
and related challenges. Although federal resources could be provided to support state transition
through legislation, adding a climate royalty surcharge would automatically do so
administratively.

11
  Sandmo (1975) shows that that, absent cross elasticities, the optimal tax is a linear combination of the Ramsey
revenue raising component ("taxpayer compensation") and the marginal damage component.

                                                          9
With these observations in mind, we consider four principles for setting the climate royalty
surcharge.

The first is to choose the climate royalty surcharge to maximize royalty revenues. This approach
maximizes extraction revenues returned to states. Setting the climate royalty surcharge to
maximize revenues also results in large emissions reductions. This principle also achieves the
traditional goal of fully compensating the taxpayer for private extraction of public resources.12

The second is to choose the climate royalty surcharge to maximize social welfare. In general, this
entails choosing the policy instrument so that the marginal cost equals its marginal benefit in
avoided climate damages. This approach has the virtue of being grounded in the classic theory of
optimal taxation. That framework, however, abstracts from many real-world complications, such
as externalities other than the carbon externality, which are important in climate applications.

Third, much of the world has adopted a net-zero targeting approach to guiding climate policy,
with target dates of 2050 (EU) or 2060 (China). Under a net-zero targeting approach, the royalty
surcharge should be set on a path to phase out (non-offset) federal fossil fuel leasing. Cognizant
of the legal question of whether fossil fuel leasing can be ended administratively under FLPMA,
we implement this approach by considering a royalty surcharge that does not entirely shut down
the program but instead achieves 80% of the global emissions reductions achieved by a ban on
new leasing.

Fourth, the climate royalty surcharge could be chosen so that total emissions from federal fossil
fuels were constrained by a carbon budget. To achieve this budget, the carbon surcharge would
rise over time so that at some point federal production would end. Implementing this approach
requires a carbon budget for federal fossil fuels, however developing such a budget goes beyond
the scope of this paper so we do not pursue this principle further.

2.4.    Interaction with lease auctions

An increase in the federal royalty rate would interact with the federal competitive auction
process, plausibly leading to lower bonus bids at auction. The ad-valorem royalty and the bonus
bid have different risk properties, in particular the royalty is a risk-sharing arrangement in which
the government bears the risk that the tract might not be productive, whereas under the bonus bid
the bidder bears that risk; in addition, the bonus bid is paid up front, whereas royalties are paid



12
  CEA (2016) interprets the fair return mandate as maximizing value of the least to the taxpayer. This is consistent
with requirements for competitive auctions, for example of the infrared spectrum. CEA (2020) calculates a revenue-
maximizing royalty adjustment for federal Powder River Basin coal.

                                                         10
later, when the lease is producing. As a result, an expected increase in royalty payments from a
royalty surcharge would lead to a partial, but not necessarily complete, decrease in bonus bids.

Empirically, these interactions are likely to have a limited effect on projected total revenues. As
shown in Figure 1, from 2013 to 2019, oil and gas royalty revenues averaged 7.5 times bonus
bids; in FY 2019, oil and gas royalty receipts were $7.745 billion, whereas bonus bids were only
$496 million. Thus, the scope for a decline in bonus bids offsetting an increase in royalties is
limited.

3.       Estimated Effects of an Oil and Gas Climate Royalty Surcharge on Production,
         Emissions, and Revenue

We now turn to a quantitative assessment of the effect of a climate royalty surcharge on
production, emissions, and revenue for new oil and gas leases; we exclude coal because of the
absence of current and anticipated future demand for new coal leases.

Our calculations are based on Prest's (2021) model of oil and gas production on federal lands.
The model has three stages of production (drilling, well completion, and production) for wells
differentiated by federal/nonfederal, oil-directed/gas-directed, and onshore/offshore, for a total of
eight well types. An important parameter in assessing the effect of the royalty surcharge is the
elasticity of demand. Historically, the demand for oil has been inelastic because there are few
alternatives to gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel. Looking ahead, as alternatives like electric vehicles
become more common, oil demand could become more elastic. Similarly, in 2019, 36% of
natural gas was used for electricity, and as renewable generation increases the electricity demand
for gas could become more elastic. For these reasons, we use low demand elasticities as our base
case, but also consider a scenario with more elastic demand.13 The demand elasticities are the
same as in Prest (2021). For the base case, we use demand elasticities of -0.2 for both oil and
gas, based on several empirical estimates and surveys of the literature (Erickson and Lazarus
2018, Hamilton 2009, Bordoff and Houser 2015, Arora 2014, and Auffhammer and Rubin 2018).
For the high elasticity case, we use estimates from the higher end of the literature; these are -0.51
for oil (Balke and Brown 2018, Metcalf 2018, Allaire and Brown 2012) and -0.42 for gas
(Hausman and Kellogg 2015, Metcalf 2018).

  The model in Prest (2021) combines a detailed, econometrically calibrated simulation model of US supply with a
rest of world (ROW) module with responsive supply based on the IEA 2019 World Energy Outlook. This accounts
for cross-price effects on US supply (e.g., how oil prices affect both oil production and gas co-production, and vice
versa), dynamics (how changes to prices or policies today affect drilling and production over time), and leakage
(e.g., how changes in production on federal lands if offset by increases from nonfederal and foreign suppliers). For
details, see Prest (2021).

3.1.     Common carbon fee

We first consider assessing production on new leases a carbon fee expressed in 2020 dollars per
metric ton of CO2, where the per-ton CO2 fee is the same for oil and gas.

Table 1 translates selected per-ton fees into assessments expressed in the native price units of the
fuel ($/barrel for oil, $/thousand cubic feet, or mcf, for gas). For comparison purposes, these
rates are also provided for coal, although coal is not included in subsequent calculations.

Notes: Oil price is West Texas Intermediate spot price; natural gas is Henry Hub spot price; and coal is 8800 Btu/lb
Powder River Basin subbituminous spot price. Prices are 2019 averages from the Energy Information
Administration. Royalty rates are 12.5% for surface-mined coal and for onshore oil and gas and are 18.75% for
deepwater offshore oil and gas. These rates are converted to native price units using the 2019 price in the first line
and the carbon intensities for the relevant fossil fuel.

Figure 2 summarizes the effect of a carbon fee on total royalty revenues (base royalty rate plus
carbon fee) and CO2e emissions, for both base (low) and high elasticities. The business-as-usual
(BAU; no new policy) scenario corresponds to the carbon fee equaling zero; under this
assumption, average oil and gas royalties are projected to be $9.6 billion/year on average from
2020-2050. The figure also shows annual average revenues under a leasing ban. Under the new
leasing ban, production continues under existing leases, which generates royalties, and the 30-
year average royalties are $4.1 billion/year. Emissions are shown as reductions from BAU, as a
percentage of the reductions under a leasing ban.

Total revenues follow a Laffer curve: as the carbon fee increases from zero, total royalty
revenues increase, then peak, then decline to below BAU levels, as the decline in production
offsets the revenues generated by a higher carbon fee. Total revenues are maximized at a carbon
fee of $22 per metric ton CO2e, above which revenues drop off sharply. At a sufficiently high
price, new production drops to zero, so royalties fall below BAU royalties. At their peak,
increasing the carbon fee increases average annual royalties by about $4.6 billion compared with




                                                          12
BAU. Under current law, about half of this would be distributed to the states and half would be
retained by the federal government.14

Figure 2. 2020-2050 average royalty revenues (left axis) and emissions reduction relative to
those achieved by a leasing ban (right) under a common per-ton carbon fee




        Note: Annual average emissions reductions under a leasing ban are estimated to be 85 MMton CO2e/year in
        the low-elasticity base case and 147 MMton CO2e/year in the high-elasticity case.


A nuance in this revenue Laffer curve is that it has two peaks, a global maximum at
approximately $22/ton CO2e, in addition to a local maximum at $45. The peak around $22/ton is
associated with gas production declining more rapidly than oil in response to the per-ton carbon
fee: as seen in Table 1, a $25 carbon fee is 64% of the price of gas, but only 19% of the price of
oil. Because the two fuels have Laffer curve peaks at different values of the carbon fee, the
composite Laffer curve has two peaks.

Total emissions fall as the carbon fee increases. For lower values of the carbon fee, the reduction
in emissions is steeper than for higher values. The reason for this nonlinear behavior is the same
as for the double peak in the revenue Laffer curves: at low levels, the carbon fee reduces both oil
and gas production, but at higher levels, gas-directed leasing largely stops so the only gas
production is coproduction from oil-directed wells.

  Much of the federal share of onshore royalties--40 percentage points of the 50% federal share--is deposited in
the Reclamation Fund, which supports irrigation and hydropower projects. See https://revenuedata.doi.gov/how-
revenue-works/reclamation

The results in Figure 2 are insensitive to the demand elasticity. The effect on total emissions
depends strongly on the elasticity, however: under a leasing ban, global emissions are estimated
to fall by 85 and 147 MMt CO2e/year for the base and high elasticity cases respectively. At the
revenue-maximizing carbon fee, emissions reductions are about 38% of the emissions reductions
achieved by a leasing ban, corresponding to 32 to 56 MMt CO2e/year in the low elasticity base
case and high elasticity cases, respectively.

Figure 3 shows time paths of revenues under a revenue-maximizing carbon fee, a leasing ban,
and BAU. Because the carbon fee applies to only new leases, the effects of the programs phase
in over time. The effects on revenues, whether positive (under a $22/ton carbon fee) or negative
(under a leasing ban) are smaller than plus or minus $1 billion per year through 2025. The gap
widens significantly after 2030.15

of 2020 dollars)




Table 2 provides the values of the revenue-maximizing and welfare-maximizing carbon fees,
along with their climate and revenue effects, where the estimates are for the low elasticity base
case. The welfare-maximizing fee depends on the Social Cost of Carbon. The table uses two
SCC values: $50/ton, closely reflecting the interim Biden Administration central value (3%

  Even under a leasing ban, royalties flatten out over time as wells on existing leasing continue to produce, albeit at
declining levels. Revenues under the leasing ban flatten out after 2040. This is the net result of two offsetting
factors: production on existing leases declines annually as wells are exhausted, but under this price path, oil and gas
prices rise at a similar rate.

discounting) for emissions in 2020 in 2020 dollars, and $125, which uses the same models and
assumptions but a 2% discount rate.16 The welfare-maximizing carbon fees are $13/ton and
$33/ton for the two SCC values, bracketing the $22 revenue-maximizing value. Emissions
reductions depend strongly on the fee, with the $33/ton fee yielding emissions reductions that are
nearly 60% of the reductions under a leasing ban.

Table 2 also shows a case not discussed so far, which is raising the royalty rate for onshore
extraction to match the 18.75% rate for offshore oil and gas. This change increases taxpayer
receipts somewhat, however the gains in revenues are small compared with the revenue-
maximizing rate. The decline in emissions resulting from this alignment of onshore and offshore
rates is quite modest.

3.2.       Common climate royalty surcharge

As can be seen in Table 2, imposing the same carbon fee on oil and gas implies quite different
climate royalty surcharges for the two fuels. We now consider applying the same climate royalty
surcharge to oil and gas, which aligns with historical practice.

Figure 4 shows total royalty revenues and emissions reductions as a function of a common
royalty rate. Revenues again follow a Laffer curve, but without the double peak because the
common royalty rate implies a smaller carbon charge on gas than on oil. The revenue-
maximizing royalty surcharge is 39%.

common climate royalty surcharge




Figure 5 shows the time path of revenues for the revenue-maximizing 39% common royalty
surcharge, and revenues and emissions reductions for various common royalty surcharges are
summarized in Table 3.

The revenue-maximizing climate royalty surcharge, 39%, is slightly less than the welfare-
maximizing surcharge of 44% when using an SCC of $125/ton CO2e. The emissions reductions
at the welfare-maximizing surcharge is half that of a leasing ban. Compared to a common carbon
fee, a common royalty surcharge implies a relatively higher tax on higher-emissions and higher-
value oil than on gas. As a result, the revenue-maximizing climate surcharge results in higher
revenues and slightly more emissions reductions than the revenue-maximizing carbon fee.

3.3.       Different carbon fees for oil and gas

The calculations so far assume either the same carbon fee (dollars per ton CO2e) or the same
climate royalty surcharge (in percent) for oil and gas. In principle, however, the fees or
surcharges could be calculated separately for the two fuels. Because of coproduction of oil and
gas, the effects of the two separate surcharges interact. For example, a surcharge on oil only, but
not on gas, would reduce gas production because of reduced drilling of wells that produce both
oil and gas. As a result, the effects of a different surcharge on each fuel needs to be analyzed
jointly.

Table 4 presents the effect of distinct oil and gas carbon fees on additional royalty revenues for
the base case elasticity. Because of the interactions and the different types and locations of wells,
the interaction between the two carbon fees is complex. For a given value of the oil fee, as the
gas fee increases, total royalties initially increase, then decline as gas-directed drilling
diminishes. However, because of gas co-production at oil-directed wells, total revenues revive as
the gas carbon fee further increases, for a double peak along almost every row of Table 4. With a
single common fee, total royalties were maximized at $22/ton CO2e, yielding royalty revenues of
$14.2 B/year. According to Table 4, total revenues could be further increased by imposing higher
fee on oil of $50/ton and reducing the gas surcharge to $5/ton to $16.2 B/year.

Table 5 presents the effect of distinct oil and gas carbon fees on emissions, both for the base case
elasticities. The revenue-maximizing carbon fee of $50 for oil and $5 for gas yields similar
emissions reduction to the single-fee maximum of $22 in Table 2, 37 MMT/yr compared to 32
MMT/yr. However, the composition of these emissions reductions differs, with a high oil fee and
low gas fee placing greater emphasis on reducing oil production, rather than gas.

Table 6 is the counterpart of Table 2 when there are distinct carbon fees. As derived in the
appendix, the welfare-maximizing pair of carbon fees depends on the SCC, on direct and cross-
price effects, for instance how a fee on oil affects gas through co-production, and on leakage
rates. We solve for the optimal price numerically along the grid of oil and gas fees shown in
Tables 4 and 5. At a $50/ton SCC based on a 3% discount rate, the welfare-maximizing fees are
about $20/ton for oil and $15/ton for gas. These amount to about $9/barrel gas and $1/mcf of
gas, which in turn are roughly equivalent to a climate surcharge of 15% for oil and 39% for gas.
This achieves 29% of the emissions reductions that a leasing ban would achieve and raise $4.7
B/year in revenue above BAU. At a $125/ton SCC, the welfare-maximizing fees are twice as
large at about $40/ton for oil and $30/ton per gas, corresponding to climate royalty surcharges of
approximately 30% for oil and 77% for gas. This achieves about 60% of the emissions
reductions that a leasing ban would and raises $4 b/year in revenue above BAU, compared to the
$5.5 b/year loss in revenues under a ban.

4.     Discussion

Looking across the multiple cases ­ the three principles for determining the surcharge, the low
and high demand elasticities, and whether there is a common carbon fee, a common royalty
surcharge, or a different carbon fee for oil and gas ­ suggests three main conclusions.

First, all cases imply substantial climate surcharges, typically in the 20% to 50% range. These
surcharges are in addition to the current royalty rate of 12.5% (18.75% offshore). The current
royalty rates, which for onshore oil and gas and surface-mined coal date to the MLA of 1920,
neither take climate costs into account nor do they maximize revenue to the taxpayer. It is worth
noting that any of the calculations here could have yielded a corner solution in which an increase
in the royalty rate decreased royalty revenues, but that is not the case. Thus, all the royalty
surcharges considered have both a traditional taxpayer return justification in addition to a climate
cost justification.

Second, for surcharges based on revenue or welfare maximization, both the revenue increases
and emissions reductions are substantial compared to the no-policy BAU scenario. For example,
for a common royalty surcharge, the revenue-maximizing surcharge of 39% reduces emissions
by more than 40% of what would be achieved by a royalty ban, while increasing annual average
revenues by $6.2B, compared to BAU.

Third, although the revenue-maximizing royalty surcharges and projected revenues with a
surcharge do not depend significantly on the elasticity of demand, projected emissions reductions
do. For the revenue-maximizing common surcharge of 39%, we estimate emissions reductions
range from 37 to 63 MMton CO2e/year. As a point of comparison, these round to one percent of
US CO2 emissions in 2019.

The welfare-maximizing common surcharge is estimated to be 19% and 44% for $50/ton and
$125/ton SCCs respectively. Welfare could be further increased by charging separate fees or
surcharges by charging $20-40/ton fees for oil production and lower fees of $15-$30/ton for gas.
In surcharge terms, these separate charges are equivalent to 15-30% surcharges for oil and 40-
80% surcharges for gas. These would reduce emissions by 25 to 88 MMt CO2e/year and raise $4
to $5 billion/year.

                                                Appendix

This appendix derives the social welfare maximizing emissions fee or climate royalty surcharge
when there are multiple fuels, some of which are covered by the fee or surcharge and some of
which are not. The setup is standard, e.g. Hoel (1996), Holland (2012), and Fhn et al. (2017),
with static utility, cost, and damage functions, extended to n fuels, with leakage and co-
production. Each fuel has covered (superscript c) and uncovered (u) production. The n-vector of
production of covered fuels is Q c = (q1c ,..., qn
                                                 c
                                                   ) and uncovered fuels is Qu = (q1u ,..., qn
                                                                                             u
                                                                                               ) ; the
vector of total production is Q = Qc + Qu. The representative consumer derives utility U(Q) from
consumption of the fuels, where consumption equals production. The cost function for producing
uncovered fuels is C u (Q u ) . For covered fuels, the cost function is C c (Qc ,.) , where the final
argument is the carbon fee or royalty surcharge; this cost function is inclusive of carbon
fee/royalty payments. Burning Qi produces emissions Ei = eiQi, where ei is the emissions
intensity of fuel i (e.g., tons CO2e/barrel), with vectors of covered, uncovered, and total
emissions being Ec, Eu, and E = Ec + Eu. Total covered emissions E tot ,c = eQc total uncovered
emissions are E tot ,u = eQu , and total emissions are E tot = eQ , where e = (e1 ,..., en ) . External
damages from emissions are D(Etot).

Separate carbon fees. First consider the problem of setting a vector  of carbon fees on each
covered fuel, where the fees are denominated in dollars per ton CO2e and the fees can differ
across fuels. Total receipts from the fee are  E .

The social planner chooses the vector of carbon fees  to maximize social welfare:

             max W (Q) = U (Q) - C c (Q c , ) - C u (Qu ) - D( E tot ) +  E c ,                           (1)

where receipts from the carbon fee are added back into welfare because they are subtracted off in
the covered cost function. The first order conditions for  is,

             U  Q c Qu           C c (Q c , ) Q c C c (Q c , ) C u (Qu , ) Qu
                   +            -                -            -
             Q '                   Q c                           Qu         
                                                                                                          (2)
               E tot           E c
             -       + E c +       = 0,
                                




                                                     23
where  = dD/dEtot is the marginal damage. Market clearing implies that
U C c (Qc , ) C u (Qu )
  =          =          , and the envelope theorem implies that C c (Qc , )  = E c . Thus,
Q   Q   c
               Q   u


                      E c   E tot
(2) simplifies to         =       , so
                             

                         -1
               E c  E tot
             =            .                                                                     (3)
                 
                   

Expression (3) generalizes Holland's (2012, equation (5)) expression for a single fuel with partial
coverage to multiple fuels. In the case of a single fuel, (3) reduces to  = (1 -  ) , where  is the
leakage rate (that is, the increase in uncovered production for a unit decrease in covered
production) and  is the marginal monetized damages of emissions, that is, the social cost of
carbon (SCC).

Another special case of (3) is when there is no substitution in production or consumption across
fuels, so the markets are separate. Then the welfare-maximizing fee for each fuel is  i = (1 - i )
, where i is the leakage rate for covered production into uncovered production of fuel i.

In general, the welfare-maximizing vector of fees depends on leakage both within and across
fuels.

Common royalty surcharge. Next consider the problem of setting a common ad-valorem climate
royalty surcharge r, which applies equally to the value of production of each fuel. This surcharge
applies above and beyond any base royalty rate set using non-climate considerations, such as
taxpayer value. The market value of covered fuels is Y c = PQc , where P is the vector of prices.
The royalty costs are part of the covered fuel cost function so the social planner's problem now
is,

            max W (Q) = U (Q) - C c (Q c , r ) - C u (Qu ) - D( E tot ) + rY c .                (4)

The first order condition for r is,
             U  Q c Qu  C c (Q c , r ) Q c C c (Q c , r ) C u (Q u , r ) Q u
                        +      -          -              -

                E         Y      c
            -     +Yc + r   = 0.

                                                     24
Using market clearing conditions and the envelope theorem as above yields,

                      Y c E
                    r    =   .                                                                        (6)
                      r    r

Equation (6) has an intuitive interpretation: the marginal cost of further increasing the royalty
surcharge, which is the foregone revenue (the royalty rate times the loss in the market value of
covered production), should equal the marginal benefit, which is the net change in emissions
valued at the SCC.

Rearranging (6) and expanding terms yields,

                     Q
                     e 
             r=      r                                                                                (7)
                  Q c P  c
                P    +   Q
                  r    r

If the effect on the value of the covered fuel from a royalty surcharge is dominated by the effect
on quantity produced, not its effect on market prices, then the second term in the denominator of
(7) is small so we have the approximation,

                       Q
                         e
                    r   r   .                                                                         (8)
                        Q c
                      P
                        r

In the approximation (8), the royalty rate is proportional to the SCC, scaled by the emissions-
weighted average of the marginal change in production. It can be shown that the right hand side
of (8) is the welfare-maximizing royalty rate computed from the welfare-maximizing distinct
carbon fees on each fuel, subject to the constraint that each carbon fee is the same percentage of
sales of the applicable fuel at the fixed price vector P. The difference between this optimal per-
ton fee, reexpressed as a percentage of sales, and the welfare-maximizing royalty rate (7) is the
that the optimal royalty rate also incorporates the effect of a change in the royalty rate on prices
and thus on royalty receipts. Because prices will typically rise as the royalty rate increases, the
denominator in (7) is smaller (less negative) than the denominator in (8), so the welfare-
maximizing royalty rate computed using (7) will exceed the value computed using (8).

In the case of a single fuel, (8) simplifies to r = e (1 -  ) D P , which is the optimal carbon fee
with leakage  > 0, expressed in dollars per quantity unit (barrel), then reexpressed as a fraction
of the sales price of the fuel.
