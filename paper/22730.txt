                                         ABSTRACT

Network planning models, which forecast the profitability of airline schedules, support many
critical decisions, including equipment purchase decisions. Network planning models include an
itinerary choice model that is used to allocate air total demand in a city pair to different
itineraries. Multinomial logit (MNL) models are commonly used in practice and capture how
individuals make trade-offs among different itinerary attributes; however, none that we are aware
of account for price endogeneity. This study formulates an itinerary choice model that is
consistent with those used by industry and corrects for price endogeneity using a control function
that uses several types of instrumental variables. We estimate our model using a database of more
than 3 million tickets provided by the Airlines Reporting Corporation. Results based on
Continental U.S. markets for May 2013 departures show that models that fail to account for price
endogeneity overestimate customers’ value of time and result in biased price estimates and
incorrect pricing recommendations. The size and comprehensiveness of our database allows us to
estimate highly refined departure time of day preference curves that account for distance,
direction of travel, number of time zones traversed, departure day of week and itinerary type
(outbound, inbound or one-way). These time of day preference curves can be used by airlines,
researchers, and government organizations in the evaluation of different policies such as
congestion pricing.

1. Introduction and motivation
Network planning models, which are used to forecast the profitability of airline schedules,
support many important long- and intermediate-term decisions. For example, they aid airlines
in performing merger and acquisition scenarios, route schedule analysis, code-share scenarios,
minimum connection time studies, price-elasticity studies, hub location and hub buildup
studies, and equipment purchasing decisions (Garrow, et al. 2010).
       Network planning models forecast schedule profitability by determining the number of
passengers who travel in an origin destination (OD) pair, allocating these passengers to
specific itineraries, and calculating expected costs and revenues. The passenger allocation
model is often referred to as an itinerary choice model because it represents how individuals
make choices among itineraries. Many airlines use discrete choice models to capture how
individuals make trade-offs among different itinerary characteristics, e.g., departure times,
elapsed times, the number of connections, equipment types, carriers, and prices (see Garrow,
et al., 2010 and Jacobs, et al., 2012 for reviews of itinerary choice models used in practice and
Coldren, et al., 2003 and Koppelman, et al., 2008 for specific studies conducted for United
Airlines and Boeing, respectively).
       However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the itinerary choice models used in
practice account for price endogeneity. Price endogeneity occurs when prices are influenced
by demand, i.e., higher prices are observed when demand is high and lower prices are
observed when demand is low. Failure to correct for price endogeneity is critical, as it will
result in biased estimates and incorrect profitability calculations. Recent work has focused
attention on the importance of accounting for endogeneity in demand studies. For example
Guevara (2015) notes that “endogeneity often arises in discrete-choice models, precluding the
consistent estimation of the model parameters, but is habitually neglected in practical
applications.” Guevara (2015) provides several examples from the mode choice, residential
location, and intercity travel demand literatures that provide evidence of endogeneity due to
omission of attributes and reviews approaches researchers have been using to account for this
endogeneity. These studies include those by Wardman and Whelan (2011) and Tirachini et al.
(2013) for mode choice applications; Guevara and Ben-Akiva (2006, 2012) for residential
location applications and Mumbower et al. (2014) for intercity applications.
       Our prior work in air travel demand modeling has found strong evidence of price
endogeneity. In Mumbower et al. (2014) we model flight-level price elasticities in four
markets using linear regression models and find striking differences in price elasticity
estimates between a model that ignores and a model that accounts for price endogeneity. The

                                               4
model that ignores price endogeneity produces inelastic results (-0.58) whereas the model that
accounts for price endogeneity using a two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach produces
elastic (-1.32) results. In Hotle et al. (2015) we investigate the impact of airlines’ advance
purchase deadlines on individuals’ online search and purchase behaviors for 60 markets. Our
model, which is also based on a 2SLS method, finds strong evidence of price endogeneity.
       This paper builds on prior research by showing how to correct for price endogeneity
for an itinerary choice model that is consistent with those used by industry. Unlike our
previous applications, our model incudes “all” Continental U.S. markets and is based on
discrete choice versus linear regression methods. Specifically, we follow the approach of
Coldren and colleagues (2003) described for United Airlines and use a multinomial logit
(MNL) to model itinerary choice for Continental U.S. markets. Results demonstrate the
importance of accounting for price endogeneity; failure to do so results in value of time
estimates that are too high, biased price estimates, and incorrect pricing recommendations.
The results are intuitive, and validation tests indicate that the corrected model outperforms the
uncorrected specification.
       Our study is distinct from the majority of prior studies reported in the literature in that
we use a large database of individual tickets from multiple carriers for our analysis.
Specifically, we estimate our model using an analysis database of 3 million tickets provided
by the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC). We are uniquely positioned to examine the
potential of using the ARC ticketing database for itinerary choice modeling applications as we
are able to work with detailed price data whereas airlines cannot due to anti-trust regulations.
Our paper contributes to the literature in three key ways. First, we demonstrate the ability to
use the ARC ticketing database (in spite of its limitations) to replicate itinerary choice models
representative of those used in practice. Second, we find a valid set of instruments to correct
for price endogeneity for Continental U.S. markets. Third, due to the size of our analysis
database, we are able to estimate detailed departure time of day preference curves that are
segmented by distance, direction of travel, number of time zones traveled, day of week, and
itinerary type (outbound, inbound or one-way). To the best of our knowledge, these curves
represent the most refined publicly-available estimates of airline passengers’ time of day
preferences.
       The remaining sections are organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data
processing assumption we used to create our analysis database and the variables used in our
study. Section 3 presents our methodology, with a particular focus on how we addressed price
endogeneity. Empirical results are presented in Section 4. We conclude by highlighting how

                                               5
our model contributes to the literature and offering directions for future research, many of
which are based on the data limitations commonly faced by industry when estimating discrete
choice models for itinerary choice applications.


2. Data
This section describes the data and variables we used, explains the process we used to
generate choice sets, and assesses the representativeness of our analysis database.

2.1. Airlines Reporting Corporation ticketing database
The Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) is a ticketing clearinghouse that maintains
financial transactions for all tickets purchased through travel agencies worldwide. This
includes both online (e.g., Expedia) and brick-and-mortar agencies. Some carriers, most
notably Southwest, are under-represented in the database because the majority of their ticket
sales are through direct sales channels (e.g., southwest.com) that are not reported to ARC.
       ARC has detailed information associated with each ticket. This includes the price paid
for the ticket (and associated taxes and currency), ticketing date, booking class, and detailed
information about each flight associated with the ticket, e.g., departure and arrival
dates/times; origin, destination, and connecting airports; total travel time; connecting times;
flight numbers; equipment types and associated capacities; and operating and marketing
carriers. ARC classifies tickets into five product categories: First, Business, Unrestricted
Coach, Restricted Coach, and Other/Unknown. This product classification is based on tables
provided by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that associates booking
classes for each carrier with these five product categories.
       The ticketing database provided by ARC contains tickets that have at least one leg that
departed in May of 2013. May was selected because it is a month with average demand that
falls between off-peak and peak seasons. Given the majority of these tickets are for travel that
originates and terminates within the Continental U.S., we restrict our analysis to these
markets. Only tickets with six or fewer legs representing simple one-way or round-trip
journeys were included in the analysis. More than 93% of all tickets in the ARC database can
be classified as simple one-way and round-trip tickets. A simple one-way ticket does not
contain any stops. A stop occurs when the time between any two consecutive flights is more
than six hours. A simple round-trip itinerary represents a journey in which the individual
starts and ends the journey in the same city and makes at most one stop in a different city.
Round-trip itineraries can include multiple airports that belong to the same city, e.g., an

                                                6
individual who flies round-trip from San Francisco to Chicago can fly from San Francisco
(SFO) to Chicago O’Hare (ORD), make a stop in Chicago, and then fly from Chicago
Midway (MDW) to Oakland (OAK). We excluded tickets that had directional fares of less
than $50 to eliminate tickets that were (likely) purchased using miles or by airline employees.
We also calculated the 99.9th fare percentile for four product classes: First, Business,
Unrestricted Coach, Restricted Coach/Other and eliminated the top 0.1% of observations from
each product class. This process, which is consistent with that used by ARC, was done to
eliminate tickets that were (likely) charter flights.
        Our final database used for model estimation contains 3,265,545 directional
itineraries, representing 10,034,935 passenger trips.


2.2. Variable definitions
Table 1 defines and describes the independent variables included in our final itinerary choice
models. Among those variables included in our models, the definitions and descriptions for
elapsed time, number of connections, equipment type, and carrier preference (also referred to
as carrier-specific constants) are straight-forward to interpret. Variables used to define direct
flights, departure time of day, price, and marketing relationships merit additional discussion.
                                    [Insert Table 1 about here]
Direct itineraries
We include nonstop, direct, single connection, and double connection itineraries in our
analysis. Figure 1 can be used to visualize the distinctions among these different types of
itineraries. A nonstop flight consists of a single flight and does not have any stops. Both direct
and single connection itineraries consist of two flight legs and a single stop. For a single
connection itinerary, the flight numbers and aircraft used for each leg differ whereas for a
direct itinerary, the flight numbers for each leg are identical and the aircraft used for each leg
is (typically) the same. The airport in which the intermediate stop occurs (shown as “xxx” on
Figure 1) is not shown in the ticketing database; i.e., only a single ticketing coupon for the
direct flight UA 548 from ORG to DST is recorded. Coupons for customers traveling from
ORG to xxx on UA 548 and xxx to DST on UA 548 also appear in the database, which allows
us to identify that UA 548 from ORG to DST is a direct flight.
        Although we recognize that the terminology of a “nonstop” and “direct” can be
confusing, this distinction is critical for practice. In particular, given the limited number of
flight numbers that can be assigned to a flight, airlines often need to create direct itineraries
(or “reuse” the same flight number). Given a direct itinerary is more attractive to customers

                                                 7
than a single connecting itinerary (as customers typically stay with the same aircraft and do
not need to disembark and reboard at the intermediate stop), it is important for the airline
industry to model how demand differs for direct versus single-connecting itineraries. For
these reasons, we follow the approach used by other researchers (e.g., see Coldren et al.
(2003), Coldren and Koppelman (2005a,b), Koppelman et al. (2008)) and distinguish between
single connection and direct itineraries.
                                     [Insert Figure 1 about here]


Departure time of day preferences
There are multiple approaches that can be used to model departure time preferences. The first
approach uses a set of categorical variables to represent non-overlapping departure time
periods, e.g., one variable for each departure hour. However, the use of categorical variables
can be problematic for forecasting applications when the difference in coefficients associated
with two consecutive time periods is large (e.g., for the departure periods 9:00-9:59 AM and
10:00-10:59). In this case, moving a flight by a few minutes (e.g., from 9:58 AM to 10:02 AM
can result in unrealistic changes in demand predictions. The second approach overcomes this
limitation by using a continuous specification that combines sine and cosine functions. We
model time of day preferences using a continuous time of day formulation and follow the
approach originally proposed by Abou-Zeid et al. (2006) for intracity travel and adapted by
Koppelman, et al. (2008) for itinerary choice models by including three sine and three cosine
functions representing frequencies of 2𝜋, 4𝜋, and  6𝜋.1
        For example, the sin2𝜋 term is given as:
                sin2𝜋 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛 2𝜋×departure  time /1440
where departure time is expressed as minutes past midnight and 1440 is the number of
minutes in the day. Similar logic applies to the sin4𝜋, sin6𝜋, cos2𝜋, cos4𝜋, and  cos6𝜋  terms.
One of the main contributions of our paper (which is possible due to the size of our analysis
database) is that we allow departure time preferences to vary according to several dimensions
including the length of haul, direction of travel, number of time zones crossed, departure day
of week, and itinerary type (i.e., outbound, inbound and one-way itineraries). More precisely,
we create ten segments based on the length of haul, direction of travel and number of time
zones crossed. For each segment, we estimate separate time of day preferences for departure

 Carrier (2008) uses four sine and four cosine functions to model departure time preferences for European
markets.

                                                   8
day of week and itinerary type. Thus, our model includes 1260 departure time preference
variables.
         In a related paper (Lurkin, et al, 2016a), we compared the use of a discrete time of day
formulation with two continuous time of day formulations: one that was based on a 24-hour
cycle and the other that was truncated (or less than 24-hours) based on observed flight
departures for a particular segment. The results from the three time of day formulations are all
similar. The discrete distribution fits the data slightly better, but results in a large increase in
the number of time of day parameters. This increase makes it prohibitive to estimate refined
time of day curves by day of week and type of itinerary. That is, whereas the number of time
of day parameters required for the continuous formulation is 1,260 (6 sine/cosine x 7 days of
week x 3 itinerary types x 10 segments), the number of time of day parameters using 18
discrete intervals would be 3,780. Given the continuous time of day specification provides a
similar model fit and provides more realistic forecasts, we use the continuous time of day
formulation for our itinerary choice models.
         In developing a model for United Airlines, Coldren and colleagues (2003) estimated
16 separate MNL models for Continental U.S. markets, one for each time zone pair (e.g.,
itineraries that start and end in the Eastern time zone (EE), itineraries that start and end in the
Central time zone (CC), etc.) The authors note that, aside from time of day preferences, the
estimated coefficients for other itinerary characteristics were similar across these 16
segments. We modify the segmentation approach proposed by Coldren and colleagues to: (1)
distinguish between short and long distances within the same time zone; and, (2) combine
time zone pairs that correspond to the same direction of travel and number of time zones.
Descriptive statistics for our ten segments are shown in Table 2. The table provides
information about the total number of city pairs, choice sets, itineraries, and passengers
associated with each segment. The mean, minimum and maximum distance travelled in each
segment as well as the mean, minimum and maximum number of alternatives by choice set
are also shown. This detailed segmentation allows us to estimate time of day preferences that
vary as a function of distance, direction of travel, and the number of time zones traveled (in
addition to the itinerary type (outbound, inbound, or one-way) and the departure day of
week).

Price
The ARC ticketing database contains ticket-level price information linked to specific
itineraries and the time of purchase. This price included on the ticket includes only the base
fare (which corresponds to the revenues the airline receives) and does not include information
on additional ancillary fees (such as fees for checking baggage or reserving a seat).
Information about taxes and fees applied to the base fare are included in the ARC ticketing
database. In the U.S., domestic air travel taxes and fees include four main categories: a
passenger ticket tax (7.5 percent of the base fare); a flight segment tax ($3.90 a flight
segment); a passenger facility charge (up to $4.50 a flight segment); and a federal security
fee, also called the Sept. 11 fee ($2.50 a segment). These taxes and fees are not revenues the
airline receives. The first two taxes go to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which finances
the Federal Aviation Administration. Passenger facility charges are passed on to airports and
security fees finance the Transportation Security Administration.
        Our discussions with industry practitioners revealed differing (and often strong)
opinions as to whether the “price variable” included in itinerary choice models should include
or exclude these taxes and fees. We discovered that multiple U.S. airlines and aviation
consulting firms do not include these taxes and fees in their “price variable.” Two primary
reasons were offered for this practice: (1) these firms believed models that included taxes and
fees provided results similar to those that excluded taxes and fees; and, (2) these firms noted
that airlines receive revenues only from the base fare. Conversely, those firms that did include
taxes and fees in their “price variable” noted that: (1) including taxes is critical for
international itineraries, as the taxes and fees can be quite large and exceed the base fare; and,
(2) customers do not see the base fare, but rather the “total” price of the itinerary, thus models
that represent the “price variables” as the sum of the base fare, taxes, and fees better reflect
customer behavior.
        As part of our modeling exercise, we estimated models that included taxes and fees
and compared them to models that excluded taxes and fees. Results were similar for the two
price formulations; however, the model that included taxes and fees fit the data slightly better.
We include a price variable that includes the base fare as well as taxes and fees in our
specifications as this variable better reflects the prices considered by consumers.
        There are several other assumptions we used to create our price variable. Although we
have detailed, ticket-level data in our analysis database, it is important to note that due to
antitrust concerns, airlines do not have access to this same information for their competitors.
For example, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Origin and Destination Survey

                                               10
Databank 1A/1B (U.S. DOT, 2013) provides a 10% sample of route-level prices, i.e., the
actual price paid for a ticket is known but it is not linked to the time of purchase (number of
days in advance of flight departure) or specific itineraries (e.g., flight numbers and departure
times). Given our focus on demonstrating how we can address price endogeneity in itinerary
choice models representative of those used in practice, we include an “average” price variable
that is similar to that used by industry. Our price variable represents the average price paid by
consumers for a specific itinerary origin, destination, carrier, level of service (i.e.,
nonstop/direct, single connection, double connection), and product type (i.e., high-yield or
low-yield). Also, consistent with industry practice, for round-trip itineraries, we assume the
price associated with an outbound or inbound itinerary is the ticket price/2.


Marketing relationships
A codeshare is a marketing relationship between two airlines in which the operating airline
allows its flight to be sold by a different carrier. Codeshare relationships can be determined
from the ARC ticketing database using information about marketing and operating carriers.
Each flight leg in the ARC ticketing database has a marketing carrier, marketing flight
number, operating carrier and operating flight number. The marketing carrier is the carrier
that sold the flight. The operating carrier is the airline that physically operated the flight. A
codeshare itinerary is one that has the same marketing carrier for all legs, but different
operating carriers. As an example, consider a ticket purchased from US Airways for travel
from Seattle (SEA) to Dallas (DFW) through Phoenix (PHX); the first leg is sold as US flight
102 and is operated by US Airways (as US102) and the second leg is sold as US flight 5998
and is operated by American Airlines (as AA1840). In this example, the marketing carrier for
each leg is the same because two US Airways flight numbers are used to sell the ticket –
US102 and US5998, i.e., American and US Airways have established a marketing agreement
that allows US Airways to sell tickets on AA1840.
       Individuals can also purchase an itinerary that has two operating carriers that do not
have a marketing relationship. We define an interline itinerary as one that has different
marketing carriers. An interline itinerary is less attractive than a codeshare itinerary because
there is no coordination – or joint responsibility – between the two operating carriers. For
example, if a bag is checked, the passenger will need to exit security at the connecting airport,
retrieve the bag, and re-check it on the airline operating the second leg. Unlike a codeshare, if
the first leg is delayed, the airline operating the second leg has no obligation to accommodate
the passenger on a later flight.

                                               11
        An itinerary that is neither a codeshare or interline itinerary is an online itinerary. An
online itinerary is one that has the same marketing and operating carrier for all legs of the
itinerary.


2.3. Construction of choice sets
The ARC database provides information on the itinerary that was purchased by an individual;
however, in order to model itinerary choices using discrete choice models, we also need to
know what other alternatives were available and not chosen by the individual. There are two
main approaches that are used in practice to generate the universal choice set. The first
method uses a schedule file (which contains the set of all flight legs) and constructs
connecting itineraries using minimum connection, maximum connection, circuity, and other
rules. Minimum and maximum connection rules determine the minimum and maximum
connection times between two consecutive flight legs, respectively; these rules often depend
on whether an international connection (that requires passenger to clear customs) is involved.
Circuity rules are used to prevent circuitous routing, e.g., if a nonstop flight operates between
New York JFK and Miami MIA airports and has a distance of 1,093 miles, a circuity rule of
“1.2” could be used to generate single connecting itineraries that have a distance of 1,093 x
1.2 = 1,312 miles or less (representing by the sum of distances for each flight leg). This helps
prevent unreasonable routings, such as flying from New York to London to Miami or New
York to San Francisco to Miami.
        The second method used in practice to construct the universal choice set is to use the
set of observed purchases. It is generally assumed that any itinerary purchased on a particular
day of the week was available for purchase on all other similar days of the week in the month.
That is, if an itinerary was purchased during the second Monday of the month, it is assumed
that the itinerary is part of the universal choice set for all Monday departures in the month.
        In both methods, it is common to use a “representative week” from each month to
evaluate schedule profitability, instead of daily schedules. Intuitively, this is to ensure that the
profitability of a given route (and decision whether to purchase an aircraft with a particular
capacity) does not depend on special events or peak periods. The same concept is frequently
used in the design literature, e.g., when determining how many lanes to build on a highway,
engineers do not design for the busiest travel day of the year but rather representative peak
periods. Designing for the busiest travel day would result in the highway being under-utilized
for many other days of the year. The same concept applies to our problem.


                                                12
        There are advantages and disadvantages associated with each method. The first
method is advantageous from a forecasting perspective, i.e., given a future flight schedule the
universal set of choices can be easily generated. However, the first method often results in a
large number of itineraries that are contained in the universal choice set, but have no
corresponding purchases in a booking or ticketing database. An analysis based on an itinerary
file we obtained from a major U.S. airline revealed that many the domestic U.S. itineraries
they generated for May 2013 departures had no corresponding purchases in our May 2013
ticketing database. For these reason (particularly when the underlying research objective is
focused on understanding behavioral relationships, as it is the case in our application), it is
common to use the set of observed choices to generate the universal choice set. From a
theoretical perspective, the first method is preferred as using observed choices to create the
choice sets could bias parameter estimates. However, this bias becomes less of a concern as
the size of the input dataset increases (as it is the case in our application), as the probability of
excluding infrequently-chosen alternatives from the choice set (and potentially biasing
results) becomes quite small. For these reasons, and because we did not have access to the
leg-level schedule files, we generated the universal choice set using observed choices.
        Formally, we construct choice sets for each OD city pair that departs on day of week d
using the revealed preferences from the ARC ticketing database. We assume that any
alternative purchased on day of week 𝑑! , 𝑎 = {Monday, Tuesday, … , Sunday} was also
available for purchase for all a days in the month, e.g., if an itinerary was purchased on the
first Monday in May 2013 we assume that the itinerary was available on all Mondays in that
month. We need to select a representative Monday that we can use to populate schedule
attributes (except for marketing relationships). We follow the convention of United Airlines
(Garrow 2004) and define the representative week as the week beginning the Monday after
the ninth of the month. This corresponds to May 13 – May 19, 2013 in our data. If an itinerary
was not purchased during the representative week, we populate itinerary attributes (except for
marketing relationships) based on the first day of the week in the month the itinerary was
purchased. In our MNL model, the number of passengers who chose an itinerary represents
the total number of passengers who traveled on day of week 𝑑! in May 2013 on that itinerary.
        We define a unique itinerary as follows: Given m legs, a unique itinerary departing on
day 𝑑! is defined by the {legm origin airport, legm destination airport, legm operating carrier,
and legm operating flight number} for m=1,…,3. We assume that if any of the itineraries
meeting this definition was sold as a codeshare during the month, that the unique itinerary is a
codeshare.
                                                 13
       We performed a sensitivity analysis on each variable in the utility function to ensure
the assumptions we used to populate schedule attributes were reasonable and did not result in
large measurement errors due to using a representative week. The percentage of itineraries in
our analysis database that have a measurement error is small (we estimated these errors to be
less than 2 percent for any given schedule attribute.) An example of the process we used to
construct choice sets is included as an Appendix.
       Finally, to improve computational efficiency, we only included OD pairs that had
more than 30 passengers in our analysis. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our MNL
model to ensure this assumption was innocuous. Specifically, we estimated a MNL model
based on itineraries with an origin in the Eastern time zone and a destination in the Western
time zone with all OD pairs and compared it to one that only included OD pairs with more
than 30 passengers. Excluding intercept terms, the parameter estimates between these two
models differed by at most 5 percent and did not impact behavioral interpretations.


2.4. Representativeness of data
The ARC database is a stratified sample of ticket purchase, where the stratification is based
on distribution channel. Specifically, our estimation database contains tickets purchased
through travel agencies. Brick-and-mortar agencies include firms such as Carlson Wagonlit
Travel and online travel agencies include firms such as Expedia as well as “ultra-low cost”
firms such as Priceline. Ticket sales made through direct channels for some carriers, such as
southwest.com and delta.com are not represented in the ARC database. As shown in Table 3,
which compares carrier market shares between the ARC and DB1B databases, the stratified
sample does result in some carriers (most notably Southwest) being underrepresented in the
analysis database; however, there are still observations from “all” major carriers in our
database, and we have no reason to believe that the customers who purchase through direct
sales channels (which include the carriers’ websites and phone reservation systems) have
different itinerary preferences than customers who purchase through other distribution
channels, with the possible exception of carrier preferences, which are explicitly accounted
for in our model.
                                  [ Insert Table 3 about here ]
       Although the sample is not representative of the population in every way, this is less
of a concern when the purpose of the sample is to uncover relationships among variables (as it
is here) than when it is purely to describe a population (Babbie, 2009; Groves, 1989, Chapter
1). For example, if we were using the sample to estimate the true share of various carriers in

                                               14
the population it would be problematic, but a model based on the sample can properly predict
itinerary choice given distribution channel. In particular, when the model is a multinomial
logit model (MNL), Manski and Lerman (1977) showed that under certain conditions, the
MNL parameter estimates obtained from a stratified sample would be consistent and unbiased
relative to the MNL estimates obtained from a simple random sample. Thus, we do not expect
that parameter estimates for the variables shown in Table 1 will be impacted by the non-
representativeness of our estimation database.


3. Methodology
This section reviews the multinomial (MNL) logit model and describes how we used a control
function to account for price endogeneity.


3.1. Multinomial logit model
We model the itinerary choice 𝑦!" that an individual 𝑛 chooses alternative  𝑖:
            1  𝑖𝑓  𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙  𝑛  𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑠  𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑟𝑦  𝑖  
𝑦!" =   
                          0  𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒    
Each choice set is modeled as the set of all directional itineraries between each city-pair for
each day of week 𝑑. For example, all Monday itineraries between Atlanta and Chicago
constitute a choice set. This choice is a function of itinerary, carrier, and product
characteristics. We exclude socioeconomic information as we have no information about the
individual who purchased the ticket.
           For cases where 𝑦!" represents discrete outcome, as in the current situation, it is
natural to model the probability that 𝑦!" takes on a given value, using a discrete choice model
such as the MNL (McFadden, 1974). The majority of prior studies have used MNL models
for itinerary choice applications, including those that describe models used in practice (e.g.,
see Coldren, et al., 2003). Given the focus of our study is on determining how we can correct
for price endogeneity and include price for representative itinerary choice models used in
practice, we thus follow this convention and use MNL models. In the MNL, the utility 𝑈 for
individual 𝑛 in choosing alternative 𝑖 from choice set 𝐽! is a linear function of 𝒙!" , 𝑈!"    =
  𝜷!! 𝒙!"    +    𝜀!" , where 𝒙!" comprises the itinerary, carrier and product variables described in
Table 1 and 𝜷!! is the transpose of the vector of coefficients associated with all variables. If
𝜀!" is distributed independently and identically with a Gumbel (or Extreme Value Type I)
distribution, the probability of individual 𝑛 choosing alternative i is given as:



                                                     15
                                      !
                                   ! 𝜷! 𝒙!"
       𝑃 𝑦!    =   𝑖   𝒙!" ) =            !
                                        𝜷! 𝒙!"
                                                   .
                                 !∈!! !

3.2. Price endogeneity
Many prior studies of airline demand have failed to properly address price endogeneity and
have assumed that prices are exogenous. Endogeneity occurs when correlation exists between
an explanatory variable and the error term (or unobserved factors) in a model. This correlation
means that the conditional expectation of the error term on the endogenous explanatory
variable will not equal zero, which violates a main assumption required to ensure estimator
consistency for most models (Greene, 2003).
       In demand models, prices are endogenous because they are influenced by demand,
which is influenced by prices (often referred to as simultaneity of supply and demand). Many
empirical demand studies have shown that price coefficients are underestimated if
endogeneity is not corrected, including recent studies that estimate: demand for high speed
rail travel (Pekgün, et al., 2013), household choice of television reception options (Goolsbee
and Petrin, 2004; Petrin and Train, 2010), household choice of residential location (Guevara
and Ben-Akiva, 2006; Guevara-Cue, 2010), choice of yogurt and ketchup brands (Villas-Boas
and Winer, 1999), consumer-level choice of and aggregate product demand for the make and
model of a new vehicle (Berry et al, 1995, 2004; Train and Winston, 2007), and brand-level
demand for hypertension drugs in the U.S. (Branstetter et al., 2011).
       There are multiple methods that can be used to correct for price endogeneity. Guevera
provides a nice overview of different methods to treat endogeneity in discrete choice models
(Guevera-Cue, 2010; Guevera 2015). He notes that the two-stage control function (2SCF)
method that accounts for endogeneity using instruments (Heckman, 1978, Hausman, 1996) is
particular relevant in applications, such as ours because it “corrects for endogeneity even
when it occurs at the level of each alternative, making it more practical … when compared to
the method proposed by Berry et. al. (1995) which can only correct for endogeneity when it
occurs at the level or markets or large sets of alternatives.”
       An instrument is a variable that does not belong in the demand equation, but is
correlated with the endogenous price variable. Instruments that satisfy the following two
conditions will generate consistent estimates of the parameters, subject to the model being
correctly specified: (1) instruments should be correlated with the endogenous variable, and (2)
they should be independent of the error term in the model (Rivers and Vuong, 1988; Villas-
Boas and Winer, 1999). Therefore, we need to find instruments that are correlated with


                                                       16
airfares but not correlated with a customer’s purchase or choice of an itinerary. Validity tests
are used to statistically determine whether the instruments are correlated with airfares, but not
correlated with the error term of the demand model (i.e., customers’ purchase or choice of a
flight).
           Mumbower et al. (2014) review instruments that have been or could potentially be
used in airline applications and classify these instruments into four main categories: (1) cost-
shifting instruments; (2) Stern-type measures of competition and market power; (3) Hausman-
type price instruments; and, (4) BLP-type measures of non-price characteristics of other
products. Cost-shifting instruments help explain why costs differ across geographic areas
and/or product characteristics. Stern-type measures of competition and market power focus on
the number of products in the market and also the time since a product (and/or firm) was
introduced into the market (Stern, 1996). Hausman-type price instruments are based on prices
of the same airline in other geographic contexts (Hausman et al., 1994; Hausman, 1996). BLP
instruments, introduced by Berry et al. (1995), are based on the average non-price
characteristics of other products.
           We use two instruments to correct for endogeneity: the first is a Hausman-type price
instrument, the other a Stern-type competition instrument. The Hausman-type instrument is
calculated for itinerary i as the cube of the average price of all itineraries having the same
carrier as itinerary  𝑖. For Stern-type competition instrument, we use a measure of capacity,
i.e., the cube of monthly seats flown in an origin-destination pair by carrier and product type
(i.e., high-yield and low-yield).
           The first-stage of our two-stage control-function (2SCF) model is an ordinary least-
square (OLS) regression, Equation 1, that uses price as the dependent variable. As noted by
Guevara and Ben-Akiva (2006), the purpose of the price equation is not to make a precise
forecast of the price but to correct for endogeneity. Explanatory variables include the set of
instruments along with all other exogenous regressors (except for price) used in the discrete
choice model. The residual, defined as the difference between the actual and predicted price
𝛿!" = 𝑝!" − 𝑝!",   from the first stage regression is introduced in the second-stage discrete
choice model regression, Equation 2. The first-stage regression model and second-stage
discrete choice model are formulated as follows:
           Stage 1: Estimate price by ordinary-least-square (OLS)
                      !             !
           𝑝!" = 𝛼! 𝐼𝑉!" + ⋯ + 𝛼! 𝐼𝑉!"    + 𝜸!! 𝒙!" + 𝛿!"                                    (1)
           Stage 2: Estimate the choice model using the residuals from Stage 1


                                                       17
        𝑈!"    =    𝛽! 𝛿!" + 𝛽! 𝑝!" +    𝜷!! 𝒙!"    +    𝜀!"                                      (2)
where
        𝑝!"       is the average price associated with alternative i for individual n; all itineraries
                  that have the same origin and destination, product type (i.e., high-yield or low-
                  yield), carrier, and number of stops have the same average price. Note that
                  nonstops and directs have zero stops, single connection itineraries have one
                  stop, and two connection itineraries have two stops.
          !
        𝐼𝑉!"      is the kth instrumental variables included in the price equation for alterative i
                  for individual n.
        𝛼!        is the coefficient associated with the kth instrumental variable.
        𝜸         is the vector of coefficients associated with all exogenous regressors,
                  excluding price, from Stage 1.
        𝛿!"       is the difference between actual and predicted prices from Stage 1, 𝑝!" − 𝑝!" .
        𝛽!        is the coefficient associated with the difference between actual and predicted
                  prices from Stage 1.
        𝛽!        is the coefficient associated with price from Stage 2.
        𝜷         is the vector of coefficients associated with all other exogenous regressors,
                  excluding price, from Stage 2.
        As noted by Guevera-Cue (2010), the estimation of 2SCF in two stages has two
important implications. First, estimates are in general inefficient which implies only the ratios
of coefficients can be interpreted. Second, “the standard errors cannot be calculated from the
inverse of the Fisher information matrix, which prevents the direct application of hypothesis
testing. The need for correcting the standard errors comes from the fact that the second stage
of the method treats the residuals of the first stage as if they were error free, which they are
not” (Guevera-Cue, 2010, p. 34). Guevera-Cue reviews methods that can be used to address
this problem and notes that bootstrapping the observations in the first stage is often the most
viable approach (2010). Given in our application the number of observations is quite large
(more than three million), the standard errors from an uncorrected model are similar to those
obtained from a model that corrects for standard errors using bootstrapping. We verified this
is the case by bootstrapping observations in the first stage using a reduce model specification
with six time of day parameters and conducting 100 bootstraps. The standard errors between
the corrected and uncorrected model differed by at most 0.001 units.



                                                             18
        We performed several diagnostic tests that are used to verify that endogeneity is
present, that instruments are valid (i.e., correlated with price) and strong (i.e., not correlated
with itinerary choices). First, we test the null hypothesis that price can be treated as an
exogenous regressor using the t-statistic associated with the residual from Equation 2. If the t-
statistic is significant at the 0.05 level the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that price
should be treated as endogenous (Rivers and Vuong, 1988). This is indeed the case for our
problem, the t-statistic associated with 𝜹 is 118.60 (which is significant at the 0.001 level),
which implies that endogeneity was present in our model.
        Next, we use several diagnostic tests to verify that our instruments are valid. As shown
in Table 4, which reports the results of the first-stage OLS regression for the two price
instruments we used to control for endogeneity, the parameter estimates associated with both
instruments are significantly different from zero at the 99% confidence interval level (p-value
< 0.001). In addition, the F statistic (F-stat > 99,999), is well above the critical value of 10
recommended as a rule of thumb by Staiger and Stock (1997).2 Finally, the 𝑅! of the
regression is equal to 0.3699. We conclude from these statistical tests that both instruments
are valid.
        Finally, we test the null hypothesis that the set of instruments are strong (uncorrelated
with the error term) and correctly excluded from the demand model using the Direct Test for
discrete choice models proposed by Guevara (Guevera and Ben-Akiva, 2006; Guevara-Cue,
2010). To use the Direct Test, an additional (or auxiliary) discrete choice model is estimated;
this auxiliary model is identical to the one used in Equation 2 but includes k-1 instruments.
The log-likelihood (LL) values between these two models is small, the null hypothesis is
rejected, indicating the instruments are valid. The intuition behind this test is as follows. If the
instruments are correlated with price but not demand, then the inclusion of any instrument as
an additional variable into the corrected Stage 2 model, Equation 2, should produce a non-
significant increase in the log-likelihood variable. Due to identification restrictions, only k-1
of the k instruments can be included in the auxiliary discrete choice model. Formally, given k
instruments,
                                                                  !

  Staiger and Stock (1997) have focused on the 2SLS method but Guevara and Navarro (2013) suggest that
similar thresholds are applicable in the case of the CF in logit models.

where the number of restrictions (NR) is equal to k-1 and the significance level of 0.05 is
used. Given two instruments, the difference in log-likelihood values between the two discrete
choice models can be at most 3.84. For our data, we find that
                                                                             !

We therefore conclude that our instruments are exogenous, or are strong instruments.

4. Model results
Table 5 shows results for two MNL models. The first “uncorrected” model does not account
for price endogeneity whereas the second “corrected” model does. Our presentation of results
is organized into two sections. The first section provides behavioral interpretations for non-
price attributes and the second focuses on pricing results.
                                  [ Insert Table 5 about here ]


4.1. Interpretation of non-price estimates
The results of the MNL itinerary choice model are intuitive, and overall the model performs
well. The 𝝆𝟐 , which provides a measure of overall model fit, is 0.1966. This is reasonable,
particularly in light of the fact that the 𝝆𝟐 will be affected by the number of alternatives in the
choice set; in general, the greater the number of alternatives, the smaller the 𝝆𝟐 . When
interpreting the results, it is important to note that the coefficients in Table 5 are not directly
interpretable because there is a change of scale (Guevara and Ben-Akiva, 2012) and,
therefore, the ratios of the coefficients and/or elasticities are the only valid means of
information (Tables 6 - 8).
       From a behavioral perspective, individuals strongly prefer nonstop itineraries and have
a slight preference for direct itineraries compared to connecting itineraries as shown by the
direct itinerary parameter estimate of -2.3311 compared to the number of connections
parameter estimate of -2.5582 in the corrected model (nonstops are the reference category and
have a utility of 0). This is consistent with expectations, since nonstop itineraries do not have
any stops and although direct and single-connecting itineraries both have a single stop,
passengers traveling on to the final destination do not typically need to change planes at the
intermediate stop location for a direct itinerary. In terms of equipment type, individuals prefer
larger aircraft over regional jets and propeller aircraft. The marketing relationship variables
are also intuitive and reveal the benefits of code-share agreements. Itineraries sold by multiple
carriers via code share agreements are more likely to be purchased than itineraries sold by a

                                                20
single airline (or as an online itinerary). In this sense the marketing relationships are capturing
a level of advertising presence. As expected, interline itineraries are the least preferred type of
itinerary (as these involve the lowest level of coordination in baggage, ticketing, and other
services across flight legs that are operated by different carriers).
       Departure times of day preferences are also intuitive. Figures 2 and 3 show the results
of the departure times of day preferences for two (out of the ten) segments, specifically for:
(1) itineraries less than 600 miles that travel westbound and cross one time zone; and, (2)
itineraries that travel westbound and cross three time zones. The curves for Monday to Friday
departures show distinct morning and evening peak preferences for both segments. These
peaks differ depending on itinerary type. For example, the morning peak is strongest for
outbound departures (particularly for those on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday). The
afternoon peak is strongest for inbound itineraries (particularly for the Wednesday and
Thursday departures). These preferences are consistent with people who travel for business
(who can depart early in the morning, gain one hour after traveling westbound, and arrive to a
meeting early in the day and then return home later in the week). Departure time preferences
for Saturday are similar with a strong morning peak for outbound departures (likely
corresponding to the start of leisure trips). Departure time preferences for Sunday are the
weakest, but show a slight preference for Sunday evening departures (likely corresponding to
the return of leisure trips and/or the beginning of a weekly business trip). Finally, the time of
day preferences for one-way itineraries are not as strong as those for outbound and inbound
itineraries (and typically fall between the two curves). This is expected, as the one-way
itineraries may represent either the outbound or inbound portion of a trip (but is unknown to
the researcher). Similar patterns are observed for different segments, although the exact
interpretation and peak periods differ depending on the segment.
       Also, it is interesting to note that the time of day preferences are in general stronger
for the segment representing short haul trips of 600 miles or less versus longer-haul trips of at
least 1,578 miles. That is, note that the scale of the y-axis for both Figures 2 and 3 are the
same. For the short-haul flights in Figure 2, the utility for the morning and afternoon peaks
often reaches (and in some cases exceeds) 1.250 whereas for the longer-haul flights in Figure
3, the utility for the morning and afternoon peaks is less, typically around 0.75 utils. This
suggests that time of day preferences are stronger in short-haul versus long-haul markets.
Intuitively, this makes sense given that individuals traveling longer distances effectively
“lose” most of the day traveling, and do not have as much time for participating in activities at
the destination during the travel day. For example, on short-haul flights an individual could

                                                21
leave the origin city in the morning and arrive at the destination in time for a 9 AM or 10 AM
meeting, whereas this is likely not an option for a long-haul trip (particularly eastbound
flights).3
                                         [Insert Figures 2 and 3 about here]
         The carrier constants reflect sample shares in the estimation database. Major carriers
(who are larger and sell more tickets) including Delta, United, American and US Airways
have non-negative carrier constants whereas smaller carriers and/or low cost carriers have
negative carrier constants. Several additional variables related to carrier presence were also
included in the analysis but were not significant and excluded from the final model
specification. Several studies have found that increased carrier presence in a market leads to
increased market share for that carrier (Algers and Beser 2001; Benkard, et al. 2008; Cornia,
et al. 2012; Gayle 2008; Nako 1992; Proussaloglou and Koppelman 1999; Suzuki, et al.,
2001). In addition, several other studies of itinerary choice models (particularly those based
on stated preference surveys), have been able to include customer-level information, such as
frequent flyer affiliation. Unfortunately, this and other customer-level information was not
available for our study. Finally, as part of our modeling exercise, we estimated separate
models for high yield and low yield segments; however, aside from the price coefficients, the
results were similar. We attribute this to the fact that the high yield and low yield products do
not directly correspond to business and leisure travel purposes. Our findings are similar to
those reported by Coldren, et al. (2003). In that work they find that aside from time of day
preferences, the estimated coefficients for other itinerary characteristics were similar across
their 16 segments (which are similar to our 10 segments and account for distance, direction of
travel, and number of time zones travelled). Thus, our segmentation is similar to that found by
other researchers.


4.2. Interpretation of price estimates
         Our itinerary choice model does not include a “no purchase” alternative. This is
because in practice, a separate forecasting module is used to predict market size, or the
number of customers who will travel by air during a certain time period (typically a month).
Thus, the elasticities reported in this section represent “market share” elasticities in the sense
that, given an exogenously-generated market size, the itinerary choice model predicts market
shares as a function of differences in relative prices across carriers.

parameter estimates and departure time of day charts for all segments).

        Tables 6 – 8 demonstrate the importance of correcting for price endogeneity. Table 6
shows the value of times associated with the uncorrected model and the model that corrects
for price endogeneity using a control function. Values of time for the high-yield segment are
calculated using the formula below (note that because elapsed time is expressed in minutes,
the factor of 60 is used to convert from minutes to hours). Similar logic applies to the
calculation of values of time (VOT) for the low-yield segment.

                                                  𝛽!"#$%!&  !"#$ ×60
                                 𝑉𝑂𝑇!" =
                                               𝛽!"#$!%#  !!"!  !"#$%  !"#$

        The values of time are overestimated in the uncorrected model: $126.03/hr for high-
yield and $64.81/hr for low-yield products compared to $83.30/hr and $43.36/hr, respectively
in the corrected model. This overestimate can lead to sub-optimal business decisions. For
example, a carrier that uses the uncorrected itinerary choice model would overestimate
customers’ willingness to pay for a new aircraft that reduces flight times. This could, in turn,
lead to overinvestment in capital expenditures in new aircraft.
        Tables 7 and 8 show price elasticity estimates for the high yield and low-yield
products, respectively, based on the mean fares for each segment (and the average across all
segments). Aggregate elasticities for the high yield segment are calculated using the formula
presented by Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985):

                                   !"             ! (!)    𝑤! 𝑃! 𝑖

                                                           ! 𝑤! 𝑃! (𝑖)
                                           !

                 is the disaggregate direct point elasticity with respect to variable 𝑥!" ,
        𝑤!       is the weight of individual 𝑛 in the sample,
        𝑃! (𝑖) is the probability that individual 𝑛 chooses alternative 𝑖.


        These differences are economically important. In Table 7, the segments for which
elasticity flips from inelastic (greater than -1.0) to elastic (less than -1.0), can lead to
completely opposite effects than which were intended by firms. For example, in the “Same
TZ, distance > 600 mi.” segment we report a mean low yield fare of $207.96 and an
uncorrected model elasticity of -0.7732. Using simple first principles and basic economic
theory, given this inelasticity a firm could raise price, quantity demanded would decline (as
would total costs) but total revenues would in fact increase. Such a move, with certainty,
would increase economic profits. However, results from the model that accounts for price

                                                    23
endogeneity indicate that low-yield products on that segment are in fact elastic. As such, a
price increase would cause total revenues to decline; quantity demand would also decline (as
would total cost). The resulting impact on economic profits is now uncertain.
       Again, using first principles, managers should never lower price on inelastic
consumers, as this will, with certainty, lead to lower revenues. In contrast, lowering price on
elastic consumers will result in the opposite, increased revenues. In Table 7 eight segments
are incorrectly identified by the basic model as being inelastic when in reality low-yield
products are elastic. For these segments, managers would incorrectly assume that they should
not decrease price in those markets. We see similar trends in Table 8 with the “3 Time Zone
Westbound” and “3 Time Zone Eastbound” segments. In general, the results in Table 8
demonstrate that high-yield products are not as inelastic as predicted by the uncorrected
model. In other words, consumers are more price-sensitive. Again, these results are
economically meaningful. For example, the uncorrected model reports an average elasticity
for high yield product of -0.5877; a 10% increase in price will lead to a 5.88% decline in
quantity demanded. In contrast, results from the model that accounts for price endogeneity
shows an elasticity of -0.8307; a 10% increase in price will lead to a 8.31% decline in
quantity demanded. This suggests that managers or revenue models would underestimate the
impact on quantity demanded by approximately 2.43%.

5. Limitations, contributions, and future research
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to control for price endogeneity for an
itinerary choice model that is representative of those currently used in practice. Our model
suffers from the same data limitations faced by industry. Our sample is non-representative in
the sense that certain distribution channels are under-represented. We are therefore implicitly
assuming that those customers who purchase tickets through direct sales channels (such as
southwest.com and delta.com) have similar itinerary preferences as those who purchase
through other distribution channels (such as travelocity.com, priceline.com, and brick-and-
mortar travel agencies). Our ticketing database provides no information about the customers
who purchased the ticket, preventing us from examining differences in preference based on
trip purpose and socio-economic factors. The lack of information about customers also
prevents us from modeling schedule delay, defined as the difference between an individual’s
preferred departure time and the scheduled departure time of an itinerary. We also assume that

                                              24
customer preferences and competition among alternatives can be represented using a MNL
model (which is the most common model used in practice); however more advanced discrete
choice models that allow for random coefficients and different substitution patterns across
product dimensions are clearly desirable.
       Nonetheless, our analysis provides an important contribution by demonstrating how
models representative of those currently used in practice can be enhanced to correct for price
endogeneity. Our results show that failure to account for price endogeneity leads to over-
estimation of customers’ value of time. This can lead to sub-optimal business decisions, e.g.,
a carrier that uses the uncorrected itinerary choice model would over-estimate customers’
willingness to pay for a new aircraft that reduces flight times (and potentially over-invest in
new aircraft). A second main contribution is that it is the first study to estimate highly refined
departure time of day preferences. The price elasticity and departure time of day preferences
results are not restricted to itinerary choice modeling applications, and can help support
evaluation of proposed airport fees and taxes, national departure and emission taxes, landing
fees, and congestion pricing policies.
       There are several research extensions. As part of our analysis, we used an average
price variable similar to that used by industry. However, prior research has shown that
customers’ price sensitivities vary as a function of how far in advance a ticket is purchased.
Extending the analysis to include advance purchase effects is one area of future research.
Prior research (e.g., Coldren and Koppelman, 2005a) has also shown that there are potentially
many layers of correlation within and across product attributes, with relationships extending
across airline, time of day, level of service (e.g., nonstop versus connecting), and potentially
other dimensions. Replacing the MNL with a simple nested logit choice model or a more
complex but flexible generalized extreme value (GEV) model such as the network GEV (Daly
and Bierlaire, 2006; Newman 2007) is another potential research direction. In particular, it
would be interesting to compare if the substitution patterns observed by Coldren and
Koppelman (2005a) using data from 2001 are also observed on more recent data. It would
also be interesting to determine if other product dimensions they did not consider for nesting
(such as high-yield versus low-yield product distinctions) or that they found to be
insignificant (such as level of service) are important to incorporate for models based on more
recent data.
       Finally, it would be interesting to compare the results from the corrected model we
developed in this paper that corrects for price endogeneity to one that incorporates advanced
modeling techniques found in the economic welfare estimation literature. For example,

                                               25
Armantier and Richard (2008) propose a method to account for the non-random nature of data
available for estimating airline itinerary choice models using distributions from publicly
available data such as DB1B (US DOT, 2013). As always, much remains to be done.

Appendix: Example of choice set generation process
An example illustrating the process we used to generate choice sets is shown in Tables A1
and A2. Table A1 contains five unique itineraries from ATL to SEA for Tuesday departures
in May of 2013. The final choice set, shown in Table A2, contains five itineraries. The rows
from Table A1 that were used to populate schedule attributes (with the exception of marketing
relationships and passenger counts) are highlighted. For itineraries 1, 2, and 4 the date falling
in the representative week (May 14) is used to populate schedule attributes whereas for
itineraries 3 and 5 the first date that itinerary was purchased is used since there are no
purchases that occurred on May 14.


                            [ Insert Tables A1 and A2 about here ]


       The number of passenger and marketing type associated with itinerary q in the final
choice set are calculated using information from all rows in Table A1 associated with
itinerary q. For example, the total number of passengers who purchase itinerary 1 is 23. The
marketing type for itinerary 2 is online because the marketing carriers and operating carriers
are always the same for all rows associated with itinerary 2. The marketing type associated
with itinerary 1 in the final choice set is a codeshare, because two tickets for travel on May 28
for Alaska operated flight 938 were sold by AA. The marketing type for itinerary 4 is an
interline because the marketing carriers for leg1 and leg2 differ.

Travel Time, Number of Connections, Connection, and Equipment Attributes
                               Elapsed time is defined as the difference between the arrival time at
                               the itinerary destination and the departure time at the itinerary
Elapsed time
                               origin. All arrival and departure times are reported in Coordinated
                               Universal Time (UTC), which accounts for time zone differences.
                               Number of itinerary connections. A value of zero indicates a
Number of connections          nonstop itinerary and a value of one (two) indicates a single (double)
                               connection.
                                A “direct flight” is one that has two flight legs. The operating
Direct flight                  carrier and operating flight number of the two flight legs are the
                               same. A direct flight is defined to have zero connections.
                               Equipment types include two categories. The first includes wide-
Wide- or narrow-body
                               body and narrow-body aircraft (no regional jets). The second
                               includes narrow-body regional jets and propellers. For itineraries
Regional jet or propeller
                               with more than one leg, the smallest equipment type is used.
Departure Time of Day
Sin2pi_DOW! _TripType!         Departure time preferences are modeled using 1260 terms. Three sin
                               (sin2pi, sin4pi, sin6pi) and three cosin functions (cos2pi, cos4pi,
…
                               cos6pi) apply to each departure day of week i=1,2,…,7 and three

Price
                                We calculate separate prices for high yield and low yield fare
                                products. We include First, Business, and Unrestricted Coach
Average high yield fare         products as high yield fares and the Restricted Coach and
                                Other/Unknown products as low yield fares. We calculate average
Average low yield fare          high yield and average low yield fares for each itinerary origin,
                                destination, carrier, and level of service (nonstop/direct, single
                                connection, and double connection).

                               An interline itinerary is one that has different marketing carriers.
Interline
                               Only itineraries with two or more legs can be interline itineraries.
Carrier Preference
                               For k=1,2,…,9 the indicator variable Carrier_k =1 if the itinerary
Carrier_1                      operating carrier associated with an itinerary is carrier k and 0
Carrier_2                      otherwise. The itinerary operating carrier is defined as the carrier
…                              that operates the longest flight leg. The first eight terms represent
Carrier_9                      carriers that each have more than 1% market share in the estimation
                               data. All other carriers are combined into the Carrier_9 term. .
