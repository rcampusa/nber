                                            ABSTRACT

We show a statistically significant and economically relevant effect of open capital accounts on
financial deepness and economic growth in a cross-section of countries over the period 1986 to 1995.
Countries with open capital accounts over some or all of this period had a significantly greater
increase in financial depth than countries with continuing capital account restrictions, and they also
enjoyed greater economic growth. The results, however, are largely driven by the developed
countries in the sample. The observed failure of capital account liberalization to promote financial
deepness among developing countries suggests potentially important policy implications concerning
the desirability of liberalizing the capital account.

1. Introduction

        By the end of the twentieth century, governments of industrial countries had

virtually eliminated all policies hindering the movement of financial capital across their

borders. Basic economic theory suggests ways in which capital account liberalization

may benefit a country: Free capital mobility offers the opportunity to realize the highest

return on saving, to borrow at the most favorable rates, and to diversify away country-

specific risk.1 A more subtle set of benefits, but ones that have increasingly been the

focus of discussion, pertain to the impact of capital account liberalization on the

efficiency and development of a country’s financial system. The potential relevance of

this channel is highlighted by recent work on the importance of financial development for

economic growth.2

        There are a number of channels through which capital account liberalization can

contribute to the development of a country’s financial system. Exposure to international

competition may improve the efficiency of the domestic financial system via the

introduction of international standards as well as through the potential threat of “flight to

quality” posed by foreign intermediaries. Subsidiaries or branches of foreign banks may

enlarge the absolute size of the national banking system, serve formerly neglected niches

of the market, and introduce financial innovation that directly broadens the scope of

financial services. These gains in the efficiency and scope of the financial sector may

  Empirical studies documenting the contributions of financial intermediaries to economic growth
include McKinnon (1973), King and Levine (1993), Rajan and Zingales (1998), and Levine,
Loayza, and Beck (2000). See also the review paper by Levine (1997). The theoretical
foundations of financial intermediation’s role in economic development are discussed by, among
others, Bagehot (1873), Schumpeter (1912), Hicks (1969), Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990) and
Bencivenga and Smith (1991).

increase the pool of available savings both by eliciting higher domestically generated

savings and by promoting capital inflows. And, in a virtuous cycle, increased savings

may in turn promote further efficiency by enabling intermediaries to reap significant

economies of scale and scope.3

        In this paper we examine whether there is evidence of a link from capital account

liberalization to financial depth and, through this channel, to overall economic growth.4

Using a wide cross-section of countries, we show that countries with open capital

accounts have significantly greater financial depth than countries with capital account

restrictions. Estimates indicate an economically important and statistically significant

effect of capital account liberalization on economic growth through the deepening of a

country’s financial market. We also show, however, that the significance of the link

between capital account convertibility and financial depth seems to be driven largely by

the industrialized countries included in the cross-section. Therefore, one possible

interpretation of our findings is that countries require a constellation of economic, legal,

and social institutions in order to have capital account liberalization translate into greater




3
  See de Swaan (1999). Addressing these points, Summers (2000) writes: “…to the extent that
international financial integration represents an improvement in financial intermediation, …
[perhaps] because institutions involved in the transfer of capital across jurisdictions improve
efficiency with which capital is allocated, it offers a potentially significant increase in economic
efficiency. …[F]inancial flows …finance real trade, … provide capital to local businesses on
what are often the best available terms … [and] are closely associated with the presence of
foreign businesses and foreign financial institutions, which themselves bring significant benefits.”
(p. 3)

  Two works related to ours include De Gregorio (1999) and Chinn and Ito (2002). De Gregorio
analyzes the effect of financial integration on financial depth and, through this channel, on overall
growth. Our study differs from his in that we use a wider set of countries, a different measure of
financial integration, and a different empirical specification. Chinn and Ito’s empirical analysis of
the effect of capital account liberalization on financial development is similar to ours. We differ
by using a pure cross-sectional approach, whereas Chinn and Ito rely on panel data techniques.

financial depth.5 These institutions tend to be present in industrial countries but are less

common among developing countries.

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the data used in the

empirical analysis. Section 3 examines the effect of capital account liberalization on

financial depth in a wide cross-section of developed and developing countries. Section 4

assesses the impact of capital account liberalization on overall economic growth through

the financial deepening channel by estimating a simultaneous equation model in which

financial depth and economic growth are jointly determined. Section 5 offers some

concluding remarks.



2. Measures of Financial Depth and Capital Account Liberalization

        It is difficult to construct a single quantitative measure that captures the extent to

which financial markets in a country fulfill their potential roles, a difficulty compounded

when studying a widely heterogeneous set of countries. Likewise, there are several ways

to gauge the ease with which assets are traded across a country’s border. Our indicators

of financial depth and capital account liberalization largely follow those used in previous

research. Descriptive statistics of these data, presented in this section, foreshadow some

of the themes raised in the regression analysis, including differences between industrial

and developing countries and patterns of capital account liberalization.

        Financial Depth

        Several measures of financial development have been proposed in the empirical

literature. In our work, we focus on two indicators of financial intermediary development,
5
  The need for the presence of well-functioning economic, social, and legal institutions in order to
reap the benefits from opening an economy has been stressed by, among others, Rodrik (1999)
and Klein (2005).


                                                 3
with each indicator constructed in such a way that an increase reflects greater financial

depth.6

          The liquid liabilities indicator, LLY, represents the ratio of liquid liabilities to

GDP, where liquid liabilities consist of currency held outside the banking system plus

demand and interest-bearing liabilities of banks and non-bank financial intermediaries.

Thus, LLY is a typical measure of financial depth since it reflects the overall size of the

financial intermediary sector. It does not, however, distinguish between the allocation of

capital to the private sector and to various governmental and quasi-governmental

agencies. In an effort to isolate credit issued to the private sector from that issued to

governments, government agencies, and public enterprises, we also employ the indicator

PRIVY, which equals the ratio of claims by financial intermediaries to the private sector

to GDP. Typically, this is the indicator of financial development preferred in the

empirical literature.7

          We will study the effect of capital account liberalization over the period 1986 to

1995, and over the period 1975 to 1995, on a country’s average level of financial depth

during the years 1991-1995. We focus on this average level rather than the measured

level of financial depth in 1995, the last year of our sample, in order to minimize random

variations in our indicators of financial depth.8



6
  It is plausible, at least in principle, that financial integration has an impact not only on the
development of financial intermediaries, but also on the development of a country's stock and
bond market (Levine and Zervos 1998). We limit our analysis to indicators of financial
intermediary development since this allows us to consider a wider set of countries.
7
    See, for example, Levine, Loayza and Beck (2000).
8
  As we explain later in the text, the sample ends in 1995 because the measurement of our
indicator of capital account openness changed after this date in a way that makes the post-1995


                                                  4
        Table 1 presents summary statistics on LLY and PRIVY, both for the full sample

of countries and for the separate samples of industrial and developing countries.9 The

correlation between these two indicators is greater than 70 percent for both OECD and

non-OECD samples. Both measures of financial development indicate greater financial

depth among the 21 OECD countries than among the 74 non-OECD countries in our

sample. In addition, while the OECD countries experienced sizable financial deepening

over the period 1986 to 1995, there were much smaller increases in both measures of

financial depth among the countries that constitute the non-OECD sample. In contrast,

non-OECD countries experienced a faster rate of financial deepening over the previous

decade, 1976 to 1986, than did the OECD countries. This difference in the time-series

evolution of our indicators of financial depth is one reason for assessing the effect of

capital account liberalization on financial deepening over different sample periods.10

        Capital Account Liberalization

        Given the diversity in the intensity and scope of capital controls, it is difficult to

obtain a consistent measure of capital account restrictions across a wide range of

countries. We follow the majority of studies on capital account liberalization in using

annual data from the International Monetary Fund’s publication Exchange Arrangements




values of this series incommensurate with the earlier values. Furthermore, the rise of emerging
markets in the early 1990s makes this period a focus of interest.
9
  In this paper, OECD member countries are those that were in the OECD in 1986. The appendix
includes the list of countries and notes those that are classified as OECD members as well as
those that, for reasons of data availability, are not included in the 1976 – 1995 sample but only in
the shorter 1986 – 1995 sample.
10
  The results discussed here are robust to using the same sample for the shorter period as is
available for the longer period.



                                                 5
and Exchange Restrictions.11 One advantage of these data is that they provide a

consistent measure over a wide range of countries. Another advantage is that they are

available on an annual basis. Their major disadvantage is that, until 1996, they provided

only the broadest indication of a country’s stance towards the free movement of capital.

The indicators before 1996 did not distinguish between restrictions on different types of

capital flows or even between restrictions on inflows of capital and restrictions on

outflows of capital. The more recent (from 1996 on) IMF data include greater detail, but

it is still impossible to directly measure the intensity of controls or their efficacy. Also,

because we cannot reliably map the new classification system into a qualitative set of

indicators that matches the older classification system, our empirical analysis focuses on

the pre-1996 period.

        From the Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions we generate a

simple 0/1 indicator variable for each country for each year.12 This indicator takes the

value of 1 if the country had no capital controls in place. Then, for each country, we

calculate the variable KALIB, which represents the proportion of years in which the

country had unrestricted capital mobility. This method of taking the share of years over a

period during which the capital account was open has been used by Grilli and Milesi-

Ferretti (1995), Rodrik (1998), and Klein (2005), among others.

        Panel A of Table 2 lists the value of KALIB86-95 for countries included in next

section’s regression analysis that had some experience with open capital accounts (that is,

11
  Edison, Klein, Sløk and Ricci (2004) show that there is a high correlation between the indicator
of capital account openness used in this paper and the one developed by Dennis Quinn (1997),
which is the other indicator most often used in empirical analysis. The Quinn indicator is
available for a smaller set of countries than the indicator used in this paper.
12
  The appropriate information is in line E2 in the Summary Table of Exchange Arrangements
and Exchange Restrictions.


                                                6
KALIB86-95 ? 0) over the period 1986 to 1995. This panel shows that KALIB86-95 equals 1

for 9 OECD countries (out of a possible 21) and 7 non-OECD countries (out of a possible

74). While 58 non-OECD countries had restricted capital account for this entire period,

the same is true for only 2 OECD countries, Greece and Iceland.

       While the definition of KALIB does not necessarily reflect the timing of capital

account liberalization, the data in the table nonetheless show a correspondence between

KALIB86-95 and the actual years during which the capital account was open. For example,

all the countries for which KALIB86-95 = 0.1 had open capital markets in 1995 only; the

countries for which KALIB86-95 = 0.2 had open capital markets in 1994 and 1995; the

countries for which KALIB86-95 = 0.3 had open capital markets in 1993 to 1995; and so

on. This relationship generally holds across all values of KALIB86-95 with only two cases

of on-again, off-again capital account liberalization, Ecuador and Uruguay.

       Panel B of Table 2 shows that there were also no instances of on-again, off-again

capital account liberalization for OECD countries if we extend the sample period back to

1976. However, 10 of the 18 non-OECD countries that had some experience with

liberalized capital accounts in the period between 1976 and 1984, reimposed restrictions

at some time over the sample period.13 Thus, for non-OECD countries, there is a weaker

correspondence between the timing of capital account liberalization and the twenty-year

indicator, KALIB76-95 than is the case with the indicator based on the shorter sample

period, KALIB86-95. Because of this weaker correspondence, in the next section we

present regression results for the 1986 to 1995 sample period, as well as for the twenty-

year sample.

13
  The five non-OECD countries that had continuously open capital accounts over the period 1976
to 1995 are Bahrain, Indonesia, Malaysia, Panama, and Saudi Arabia.

3. Capital Account Liberalization and Financial Depth

       In this section we provide evidence of a systematic association between capital

account liberalization and financial depth, and show that such a result is robust to

different estimation techniques, to changes in the sample period, and to the inclusion of

variables controlling for other types of policy changes or cross-country differences in

institutional factors. However, we also show that the findings are largely driven by the

responsiveness of financial depth to capital account liberalization among OECD

countries.



Specification and Basic Results

       Financial depth is typically used as an exogenous regressor to explain economic

growth. The focus of this section, however, is to explain the determinants of financial

depth. In the absence of a theoretical model that offers a clear explanation of these

determinants, but with a focus on the possible role of capital account liberalization on

promoting financial depth, we use the following specification of the determinants of the

average level of financial depth in a country over the period 1991 to 1995,

                               s = β 0 + β 1 KALIB j + β 2 X + ε

1995 (that is, LLY1990 s or PRIVY1990 s ), KALIB j indicates country i’s stance in terms of



capital account liberalization over the period j, where j is either the period 1976 to 1995,

or the period 1986 to 1995, X i represents a vector of other explanatory variables, and ε i

is an error term. In our simplest specification, the vector of controls X i includes indicator


                                                8
variables for the regions of Africa and Latin America and an indicator variable

identifying oil producing nations, Oil.14 The vector X i also includes the variable Tradek,

representing the ratio of the sum of a country’s exports plus imports to its national

income for either k = 1976 (for the regressions that cover the period 1976 to 1995) or

k = 1986 (for the 1986 to 1995 sample). We include the initial level of trade as a control

in the regression because trade may be positively associated with both financial depth

(high openness to trade may require a more developed financial system) and an open

capital account (international financial flows may finance real trade). Moreover, there is a

range of other country-specific factors that likely influences financial depth. In an effort

to address the possibility of omitted variable bias, we include financial depth at the

                                             i            i
beginning of the period (that is, either LLY1976 or PRIVY1976 for the 1976 to 1995 sample,

       i            i
or LLY1986 or PRIVY1986 for the 1986 to 1995 sample) as an additional control in X i .

       Results based on this core specification are presented in Table 3. Columns 1 and 2

report OLS estimates using the 1986 to 1995 sample, for the regressions using LLY and

PRIVY, respectively, while Columns 3 and 4 present OLS estimates that use the 1976 to

1995 sample for these two measures of financial depth. The estimates in the table show a

positive relationship between a country’s degree capital account openness and its level of

financial development. In each of the regressions, the coefficient on KALIB is positive

and significant at better than the 98 percent level of confidence. This influence of capital

account liberalization on financial depth occurs while controlling for the initial level of




14
 The eight oil-producing countries in our sample are Algeria, Bahrain, Republic of Congo,
Gabon, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.



                                              9
financial depth, which is itself a significant determinant of the average level of financial

depth in the first half of the 1990s.

        One way to gauge the magnitude of the effect of capital account liberalization on

financial depth is to consider the estimated difference in financial depth between a

country that had a closed capital account throughout the period and one that had an open

capital account, holding constant the other variables included in the regression. For

                                           i
example, the estimated difference in PRIVY1990 s for a country that had an open capital


account, as compared to one that had a closed capital account throughout the period,

ceteris paribus, is 0.126. This represents the difference between a country at the median

               i                      th                                            i
level of PRIVY1990 s and one at the 64 percentile. A comparable calculation for LLY1990 s ,


using the estimates from the 1986 to 1995 sample, gives a difference between a country

                           i                      st
at the median level of LLY1990 s and one at the 61 percentile. The estimates from the


longer sample show an even larger gain for both indicators of financial depth.15

        We have shown in the previous section that virtually all OECD countries had

some experience with capital account liberalization, but there is a relatively small number

of non-OECD countries that liberalized their capital accounts at any time before 1995.

The question thus arises as to whether the finding of a significant and sizable effect of

capital account liberalization on financial depth reflects the influence of a restricted set of

countries or rather a more general tendency in the entire cross-section. Therefore, we next

investigate whether the responsiveness of financial depth to capital account liberalization

differs between the 21 OECD-member countries and the other countries in the sample by
15
   The results from the 1976 to 1995 sample show that the estimated difference attributable to
having an open, rather than a closed, capital account moves a country from the median value of
financial depth to the 64th percentile for LLY, and to the 71st percentile for PRIVY.



                                               10
introducing an interaction term between KALIB ij and a dummy variable that equals 1 for

each of the 21 OECD member countries. Results of this exercise are reported in Table 4.

These results indicate that, indeed, it is the experience of the OECD countries that

contributes to the significant effect of capital account liberalization on financial depth.

The coefficient on KALIB ij itself is not significant at the 95 percent confidence level in

any of the four regressions, while the sum of the coefficient on KALIB ij and the

coefficient on the interaction between KALIB ij and the OECD dummy variable is

significant at better than the 99 percent level of confidence in all four regressions

reported in this table.16

        The statistically significant results for the OECD countries also are of a

magnitude that gives them economic relevance. For example, Australia and Sweden had

comparable levels of financial depth in 1986, as measured by PRIVY86, which was 0.385

for Australia and 0.391 for Sweden. Australia had an open capital account in every year

of the decade 1986 to 1995 while the capital account of Sweden was only open over the

                                                                    i
final three years of this period. The predicted difference in PRIVY1990 s across these two


countries is 0.285 ×(1 – 0.3) = 0.200, which is close to the actual difference of 0.210.

        These results raise the question of what features enable OECD countries to benefit

from an open capital account. One possibility is that higher institutional quality in the

OECD countries contributes to the positive responsiveness of financial depth to capital

16
   One potential explanation for the lack of significant results in the non-OECD subsample is that
some of the countries had an on-again, off-again experience with capital account liberalization.
While this could account for the findings for the 1976 to 1995 sample, we here note that omitting
Ecuador and Uruguay (the only two countries with on-again, off-again liberalization in the post-
1985 period) from the 1986 to 1995 sample does not significantly alter the results reported in the
first two columns of Table 4.



                                                11
account liberalization. To investigate this possibility, we modify our baseline

specification by adding an indicator of a country’s institutional quality and an interaction

term between this indicator and KALIB ij to the regressors. The indicator of institutional

quality we use, labeled Govrep, is an index of the likelihood that a country’s government

will not repudiate contracts.17 The Govrep indicator has a range from 1 to 10, with larger

numbers indicating a lower likelihood of contract repudiation (for our sample, the actual

range is 2.68 to 9.77). The average value of Govrep is 9.11 for the 21 OECD countries

and 5.62 for the 50 non-OECD countries for which we have data.

        Regression results for this exercise are reported in Table 5. The bottom rows of

this table present the estimated partial derivative of financial depth with respect to capital

account liberalization for different percentiles in the distribution of Govrep.18 These

results provide support for the hypothesis that capital account liberalization is more likely

to promote financial depth when in the presence of better institutional quality. In three of

the four cases, capital account liberalization has a significant effect on financial depth at

the 95 percent confidence level or better. This occurs at levels of institutional quality

1986 to 1995 samples, and the values used in constructing the lower part of the table reflect the
percentiles for the respective regression samples.
19
  In a related vein, Klein (2005) shows that the effect of capital account liberalization on growth
depends upon institutional quality, with a significant and positive effect at higher (although not
the highest) levels of institutional quality.


                                                12
       In summary, the baseline results presented in Table 3 of this section show a

significant effect of capital account liberalization on financial depth. Further exploration,

as shown by the estimates in Tables 4 and 5, indicates that this effect is concentrated

among OECD countries, possibly because these countries enjoy better institutional

quality than the other countries in the sample. Thus, these findings suggest that the

benefits of capital account liberalization are not unconditional, but are likely to depend

upon the environment in which the liberalization occurs.



Robustness

       We now examine the robustness of our basic findings with respect to potential

endogeneity bias and omitted variable bias. Capital account convertibility is often seen as

the logical culmination of developing a deep, mature, and efficient financial system. If

this were the case, OLS estimates of β1 using specification (1) would bias the results

toward finding a positive relationship between capital account liberalization and financial

depth if countries experience a deepening of their financial system for reasons other than

an open capital account while their governments also undertake capital account

liberalization. Therefore, it is potentially important to instrument for our measure of

capital account liberalization. In what follows, we present instrumental variables

estimates of the effect of capital account liberalization on financial depth. We also

present other estimates drawn from a specification that includes additional variables

which are potentially important for the determination of financial depth and which might

be correlated with capital account liberalization.




                                             13
         The estimates in Table 6 report the instrumental variable analogues to the OLS

regressions presented in Table 4. Specifically, we adopt a two-step procedure that first

computes KALIB jfit ,i , the fitted value from an OLS regression of KALIB ij on the chosen

instrument and all the other explanatory variables included in equation (1). This fitted

value is then used to evaluate the effect of capital account liberalization on financial

depth by means of an OLS regression.20 The instrument for KALIB ij is the simple

average of an indicator of current account liberalization and an indicator of the

requirement to surrender export proceeds, with this average representing the value of the

indicators for the period 1979 to 1985 when j = 1986 to 1995, and the value of the

indicators for the period 1972 to 1975 when j = 1976 to 1995. 21 This instrument is

always highly significant in the first-stage regressions, with t-statistics higher than 4. As

mentioned in the previous paragraph, we would expect to see a smaller responsiveness of

financial depth to capital account liberalization if endogeneity plagued our results.

However, the instrumental variable estimates reported in the table offer evidence that this

is not the case, since the estimated coefficients for the OECD countries tend to be larger

than the corresponding OLS estimates. As is typically the case, the standard errors

associated with instrumental variables estimates are larger than those obtained with OLS.



20
  The standard errors for the estimates reported in Table 6 are too conservative because they d
not take into account that KALIB jfit ,i is estimated, and consequently measured with sampling
error.
21
  The indicators for current account liberalization and the surrender of export proceeds are
constructed as a share of the number of years considered, in the same fashion as the capital
account liberalization measure. We generate a simple 0/1 indicator variable for each country for
each year, according to whether the restrictions were in place or not. We use lines E1 and E4
from the Summary Table of the IMF’s Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions.



                                               14
        Table 7 addresses concerns of potential omitted variable bias by extending the

specification used in Table 4 with a range of additional variables appropriate for the

sample period. These variables include the logarithm of initial real per capita income

(either lnY76 or lnY86 ), the growth of income per capita over the sample period (either

∆ ln Y76−95 or ∆ ln Y86−95 ), the average inflation over the sample period (either π 76−95 or

π 86−95 ), and three dummy variables related to legal origin, LegalGermany, LegalFrance,

and LegalUK (thus, the omitted legal origin dummy variable is the one for Scandinavian

origin). All of these variables are potentially correlated with the dependent variable in our

regression. For example, previous research has indicated a link between inflation and

financial development (Boyd, Levine and Smith 2001). Legal origin, as well, has been

shown to be a determinant of financial development (LaPorta et al., 1997, 1998).

Likewise, a country’s level of financial depth may depend on a country’s growth

experience and development, with faster-growing or richer countries requiring a higher

degree of financial intermediation.22 Note, however, that omission of these variables will

bias the estimate for β1 in equation (1) only to the extent that these variables exhibit a

correlation with capital account liberalization.

        The estimates presented in Table 7 show that, even with the inclusion of these

additional variables, capital account liberalization retains its significant contribution to

financial depth. The estimated effect of capital account liberalization on financial depth

among the OECD countries is marginally smaller when the additional control variables

are included in three of the four cases, but in all four instances the coefficients remain


22
   This point will become important for the regressions presented in the next section, which draw
a link from capital account liberalization to financial depth to economic growth.



                                               15
significant at better than the 95 percent level of confidence. We also note that there is no

consistent pattern in the statistical significance of any of the variables added to the

specification in Table 7. For example, income growth is significant only for the

regressions that cover the longer sample period while inflation is only significant for the

regressions in which the dependent variable is LLY.

       Overall, we find that the results of the previous section are robust to the

modifications in the specification presented here. Capital account liberalization continues

to have an important role in the determination of financial depth for the OECD countries

included in the cross-section. We next turn to an analysis of the way in which capital

account liberalization, by promoting financial deepening, contributes to economic

growth.



4. Capital Account Liberalization and Growth

       So far, our results have established a link between capital account liberalization

and financial depth, holding constant a range of other possible contributory factors.

Ultimately, an important source of the interest in financial depth resides in its impact on

economic growth. In this section, we quantify the contribution of capital account

liberalization to economic growth through its effect on financial depth.

       The specification we use draws on the results presented above concerning the

effect of capital account liberalization on financial depth. The growth regression takes the

form

                                    Yi    
                ∆ ln Y76i −95 ≡ ln 95i

                                                                             i        i    i
                                                                                               (2)

where Y ji represents real per capita income for country i in year j (j = 1976 or 1995), Z i

includes Trade76, the log of secondary school enrollment in country i in 1976, School76,

and regional dummy variables for East Asia and Africa. This growth equation is

estimated jointly with an equation describing financial depth,

                        s = β 0 + β1 KALIB j + β 2 X + β 3 ∆ ln Y76 −95 + ε .
                   i                       i        i             i        i
                 FD1990                                                                   (1')

This is the same as equation (1) in the previous section, except for the fact that we allow

for potential feedback from growth to financial depth by explicitly including ∆ ln Y76i −95

among the regressors. As in the previous section, the vector X i includes indicator

variables for the regions of Africa, Latin America, and for oil-producing countries, in

addition to the initial levels of trade and financial depth. The system of two equations,

(1') and (2), is estimated using three-stage least squares. The results for the growth

regression (2), with one set of estimates using LLY and the other using PRIVY as

indicators of financial depth, are presented in panel A of Table 8.23 Panel B of the table

reports estimation results for the financial depth equation (1'), again for LLY and PRIVY

respectively.

        The results in Table 8 show that there is a significant and positive effect of

financial depth on economic growth for the period 1976 to 1995 in this cross section of

countries. This finding is consistent with previous empirical literature on the importance

of the role of financial depth for economic growth (e.g. King and Levine 1992). But the

focus here is on the effect of capital account liberalization on growth via financial

deepening. From equations (2) and (1'), it is possible to see that this effect is given by

23
  Data availability constrains us to 70 observations, rather than the 73 available when we only
run the financial depth regressions over the 1976 to 1995 period.

a1 β1 /(1 − α1 β 3 ). We then estimate that an increase in KALIB76−

                                                                    95 from zero to the mean


value in the sample of the non-zero observations of 0.40 would lead to a change in per

capita income growth over the years 1976 to 1995 of approximately 3.0 percentage points

when LLY is used as an indicator of financial depth, and to a change of 5.5 percentage

points when PRIVY is used. The economic relevance of these estimates is evident when

we compare them to the sample mean value of per capita income growth of 22.1 percent

over the period.

       Overall, the results in this section confirm an important link from financial

development to economic growth. However, the results of the previous section suggest

that capital account liberalization appears to positively affect financial depth, and

therefore economic growth, only in the subsample of highly industrialized economies.

Thus, the estimated economically sizable link from open capital account to increased

growth is not as likely to be present for a less developed country, at least when such a

link is presumed to work through an increase in financial depth.



5. Concluding Remarks

       In this paper we have shown a statistically significant and economically relevant

effect of open capital accounts on financial depth and economic growth in a cross-section

of developed and developing countries over the periods 1986 to 1995 and 1976 to 1995.

Countries with open capital accounts over some part or all of these periods enjoyed a

significantly greater increase in financial depth than countries with continuing capital

account restrictions.




                                             18
       We have also shown, however, that capital account liberalization may not provide

the same benefits to all. In particular, the positive relationship between capital account

liberalization and financial depth seems to be concentrated among highly developed

countries. There is little evidence of capital account liberalization promoting financial

depth outside of this group of countries. This may suggest that the benefits of capital

account liberalization are only fully realized if this policy change occurs in the presence

of adequate institutions and sound macroeconomic policies. A complete understanding of

the importance of the policy, institutional, and economic environment that is required for

successful liberalization and integration into the world economy, however, calls for a

more complete understanding of the manner in which openness alters the performance of

an economy.
