                                           ABSTRACT

Gold rushes are periods of economic boom, generally associated with large increases in expenditures
aimed at securing claims near new found veins of gold. An interesting aspect of gold rushes is that,
from a social point of view, much of the increased activity is wasteful since it contributes simply to
the expansion of the stock of money. In this paper, we explore whether business cycle fluctuations
may sometimes be driven by a phenomenon akin to a gold rush. In particular, we present a model where
the opening of new market opportunities causes an economic expansion by favoring competition for
market share, which is essentially a dissolution of rents. We call such an episode a market rush. We
construct a simple model of a market rush that can be embedded into an otherwise standard Dynamic
General Equilibrium model, and show how market rushes can help explain important features of the
data. We use a simulated-moment estimator to quantify the role of market rushes in fluctuations.
We find that market rushes may account for over half the short run volatility in hours worked and
 a third of the short run volatility of output.

Introduction

Sutter’s Mill near Coloma, California. January 24, 1848. James W. Marshall, a carpenter from
New Jersey, found a gold nugget in a sawmill ditch. This was the starting point of one of the
most famous Gold Rushes in history, the California Gold Rush of 1848-1858. More than 90,000
people made their way to California in the two years following Marshall’s discovery, and more than
300,000 by 1854 —or one of about every 90 people then living in the United States. The population
of San Francisco exploded from a mere 1,000 in 1848 to 20,000 full–time residents by 1850. More
than a century later, the San Francisco 49ers NFL team is still named for the prospectors of the
California Gold Rush. Another famous episode, which inspired Charlie Chaplin’s movie “The Gold
Rush” and Jack London’s book The “Call of the Wild”, is the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896–1904.
Gold prospecting took place along the Klondike River near Dawson City in the Yukon Territory,
Canada. An estimated 100,000 people participated in the gold rush and about 30,000 made it to
Dawson City in 1898. By 1910, when the first census was taken, the population had declined to
9,0001 .

Gold rushes are periods of economic boom, generally associated with large increases in expenditures
aimed at securing claims near new found veins of gold. An interesting aspect of many gold rushes
is that, from a social point of view, much of the increased activity is wasteful since historically
it mainly contributed to the expansion of the stock of money. In this paper, we explore whether
business cycle fluctuations may sometimes be driven by a phenomenon akin to a gold rush. In
particular, we present a dynamic general equilibrium model where the opening of new market
opportunities causes an economic expansion by favoring competition for market share. We call
such an episode a market rush. The market rush may mainly act to redistribute rents between
firms with little external gain, in which case the net social value of such a market rush would
be minor. The object of this paper is to present a simple model of a market rush that can be
embedded into an otherwise standard Dynamic General Equilibrium model, to evaluate whether
such a phenomenon is a significant contributor to business cycle fluctuations and to examine the
social desirability of such fluctuations.

To capture the idea of a market rush, we present an expanding varieties model where agents
compete to secure monopoly positions in new markets. However, in a first step and in contrast to
standard growth models (see for example Romer [1987] and Romer [1990]) and to some business
cycle models (see for example Devereux, Head and Lapham [1993]), we do not impose that an
expansion in variety induces productivity gains, and we treat the growth in the potential set of
varieties as technologically driven and exogenous. In this setting, when agents perceive an increase
in the set of technologically feasible products, they invest to set up a prototype firm (or product)

with the hope of securing a monopoly position in the new market. It is therefore the perception of
these new market opportunities that causes the market rush and the associated economic expansion.
After the initial rush, there is a shake out period where one of the prototypes secures the dominant
position in market. The long term effect of such a market rush depends on whether the expansion
in variety has an external effect on productivity. In the case where it does not have an external
effect, the induced cycle is socially wasteful as it only contributes to the redistribution of market
rents. In contrast, when the expansion of variety does exert positive external effects, the induced
cycle can have social value but will generally induce output fluctuations that are excessively large.
A potential example of such a process is the dot.com frenzy of the late 90s, where large investments
were made by firms trying to secure a position in the expanding internet market. At the end of
this process, there was a large shake out as many firms went bankrupt and only a small percentage
survived and obtained a substantial market position. The long run productivity gain associated
with this process are still unclear.

This paper explores whether expectations about new market could be a significant contributor to
macroeconomic fluctuations.2 Since expectations of new markets are not directly observable, we
need to set a demanding standard to evaluate such story. This is what we do. Not only do we
provide a model that is capable of explaining important features of a Consumption–Output Vector
Error Correcting Model (VECM) and their implication for hours, we also examine how well our
model does when it is forced to compete with alternative explanations.

We begin the paper by presenting, in Section 1, a set of properties of the data that any good model
of fluctuations should explain. Several of these features are well known and extensively discussed in
Cochrane [1994]. As shown by Cochrane [1994], in a bivariate Output–Consumption VECM of the
U.S. postwar economy, consumption is, at all horizons, almost solely associated with a permanent
shock recovered using a long run restriction. In contrast, the associated temporary shock of the
system is found to explain an important part of the short run volatility of output — i.e. the
business cycle. We show that this temporary shock also explains much of the fluctuations in hours
worked. We argue that these robust features of the data are quite challenging for business cycle
models since even temporary shocks generally imply some reaction of consumption. Furthermore,
the literature remains divided as to a structural interpretation for the temporary shock. As we
think that a market rush is a potential candidate, we develop in Section 2 a simple model3 which
    2
      This paper is related to several papers, both old and recent, which emphasize the role of expectations in affecting
business cycles. The newest embodiment of the literature (Beaudry and Portier [2004a], Beaudry and Portier [2004b],
Jaimovich and Rebelo [2006]and Christiano, Motto and Rostagno [2005a], Beaudry and Portier [2006]) emphasizes
the role of expectations regarding future productivity growth in creating fluctuations. However, anecdotal evidence
suggests that expectations about new market may be an important alternative.
    3
      The type of models we present are ones where nominal rigidities play no role. Our interpretation of such models
is that they can correspond to models with sticky prices in which monetary authorities follow rules that implement
the flexible price outcomes.

can be solved analytically and whose properties can therefore be clearly stated. In this model, we
show that current economic activity depends positively on the expectation of next period’s activity
and on the perceived opening of new markets. Hence, when agents believe that the economy is
starting a prolonged period of market expansion, this induces an immediate increase in investment
and an associated economic expansion. In contrast, when there are no new perceived market
opportunities, the economy experiences a slump. Given the tractability of the model, we can solve
it in the presence of a standard technology shock and our market expansion shock. The model puts
sufficient structure on the data to isolate the market expansion shock: it suggests that the market
expansion shock is the output innovation in a Consumption–Output VECM.

Since our simple analytical model performs well in explaining qualitative aspects of the data,
in Section 3 we construct and estimate a more general and richer model to see whether it can
explain quantitative features of the data. Since we allow for more than two shocks, the permanent
and transitory components recovered from the data in Section 1 do not have an easy structural
interpretation in this case, as they are combinations of fundamental shocks. We estimate the
resulting (more complex) model using a simulated method of moments. Our findings from the
larger model suggest that market expansion shocks are a non-negligible driving force underlying
business cycle fluctuations. Section 4 examines the robustness of our results with respect to allowing
for additional sources of fluctuations, such as investment specific technology shocks, temporary
technology shocks and preference shocks (in an appendix, we also discuss the potential role of
monetary shocks). Overall, we find that market rushes help explain a sizable fraction of hours
and output fluctuations even when allowing for these alternative explanations. Section 4 offers
concluding comments.


1    A Target Set of Observations

In this section, we present a set of observations which provides a rich though concise description of
fluctuations in output, consumption and hours worked. Some of these observations are well known,
and some are not. We believe that this set of observations captures many important features of
fluctuations that any business cycle theory should aim to explain. We will use these observations to
both motivate our interest in market rushes, and to test whether market rushes are a good candidate
explanation of these features. In particular, we will emphasize both qualitative and quantitative
properties of the data. After presenting the observations, we will begin by presenting a simple
analytical model of market rushes that is capable of explaining the main qualitative features we
highlight. It is in this sense that the empirical properties help motivate our interest in market
rushes as a potentially relevant contributor to business cycle fluctuations. In the following sections,
we explore the capacity of a model with market rushes to quantitatively explain the facts presented.


                                                  4
Our interest is in emphasizing important time series properties of output, consumption and hours
worked. We could do this by directly examining the trivariate process. However, as is well known,
such an approach can depend heavily on the treatment of hours worked as a stationary or non-
stationary process. We therefore choose an approach that is robust to the treatment of hours
worked. To this end, we begin by reviewing properties of the bi-variate process for consumption
and output. More precisely, we study a Consumption–Output system with one cointegrating re-
lation. The main properties of this system were originally discussed in Cochrane [1994]. As in
Cochrane [1994], we use two schemes to orthogonalize the innovations of the process: a long run
orthogonalization scheme à la Blanchard and Quah [1989], and a short run or impact scheme à
la Sims [1980] . At this point, these two schemes should be viewed as devices for helping present
properties of the data. There is no claim that these schemes identify structural shocks, and there
are no claims that these data should be explained by a model which only has two shocks. One of the
properties we will emphasize is that these two schemes deliver almost identical impulse response
functions (IRFs). As we will show, this property can be traced back to a particular feature of
the Wold representation for consumption and output, and we argue that this feature constitutes a
qualitative property that business cycle models should try to replicate.

We begin by documenting the impulse responses associated with using a long run othogonalizing
scheme à la Blanchard and Quah [1989], and show that almost all of the short run volatility of
consumption is associated with the permanent shock, while this shock only accounts for half of the
volatility of output. We then use a short run orthogonalizing scheme à la Sims [1980] to show that
the resulting output innovation does not explain the long run properties of the two variables, nor
the short run properties of consumption. We then formally test for the identity of the temporary
shock recovered using the long run scheme and the output shock recovered using the short run
scheme. This is done by showing that such an identity is in fact a zero restriction in the long
run impact matrix of the Wold representation. We then turn our focus on relating these features
with the behavior of hours and we show that the temporary/output innovation recovered from the
consumption–output VECM explains most of the short run volatility of hours.


1.1   Long Run and Short Run Orthogonalization

We consider quarterly data for the US economy. The sample spans the period 1947Q1 to 2004Q4.
Consumption, C, is defined as real personal consumption expenditures on nondurable goods and
services and output, Y , is real gross domestic product. Both series are first deflated by the 15–64
U.S. population and expressed in logarithms.4

    Consumption is defined as the sum of services and nondurable goods, while output is real gross
domestic product.   Each variable is expressed in per capita terms by dividing by the 15 to 64
population.   The series are obtained from the following links.   Real Personal Consumption Ex-

Standard Dickey–Fuller, likelihood ratio and cointegration tests indicate that C and Y are I(1) pro-
cesses and do cointegrate. We therefore model their joint behavior with Vector Error Correcting
Model (VECM), where the cointegrating relation coefficients are [1;-1] (meaning that the consump-
tion to output ratio is stationary). Likelihood ratio tests suggest that the VECM should include 3
lags. Omitting constants, the joint behavior of (C, Y ) admits the following Wold representation

Note that once Γ0 is known, all Γi are pinned down by the second set of relations. But, due
to the symmetry of the covariance matrix Ω, the first part of the system only pin downs three
parameters of Γ0 . One remains to be set. This is achieved by imposing an additional restriction.
We impose that the 1, 2 element of the long run matrix Γ(1) = ∞
                                                                P

choose an orthogonalization where the disturbance εT has no long run impact on C and Y (the
use of this type of orthogonalization was first proposed by Blanchard and Quah [1989]). Hence,
εT is labeled as a temporary shock, while εP is a permanent one. Figure 1 graphs the impulse
response functions of C and Y to both shocks as well as their associated 95% confidence bands,
obtained by bootstrapping the VECM. Table 1 reports the corresponding variance decomposition
of the process.

These results provide an interesting decomposition of macroeconomic fluctuations. The lower left
panel of Figure 1 clearly shows that consumption responds very little to the transitory shock, which
in turn accounts for less than 4% of consumption volatility at any horizon. Conversely consumption
is very responsive to the permanent shock and most of the adjustment dynamics take place in less
than one year. In other words, consumption is almost a pure random walk, that responds only to
permanent shocks and has very little interesting dynamics. On the contrary, short run fluctuations

          sumption and output that is attributable to the temporary shock εT in the long
          run orthogonalization and to the output innovation εY in the short run one, for
          k = 1, 4, 8, 20 quarters and for k −→ ∞. Those shares are computed from
          a VECM (C, Y ) estimated with one cointegrating relation [1;-1], 3 lags, using

in output are mainly associated with the temporary shocks, which explain more than 60% of output
volatility on impact.

Now we consider an alternative orthogonalization that uses short run restrictions

                                   e 0 be equal to zero. Therefore, εY can be called an output
we impose that the 1, 2 element of Γ
innovation, and by construction the contemporaneous response of C to εY is zero.

Figure 2 graphs the impulse responses of C and Y associated with the second orthogonalization
scheme. The associated variance decompositions are displayed in Table 1. The striking result from
these estimations is that the consumption shock εC is almost identical to the permanent shock to
consumption (εP in the long run orthogonalization scheme), so that the responses and variance
decompositions are very similar to those obtained using the long run orthogonalization scheme.
This observation is further confirmed by Figure 3, which plots εP against εC and εT against εY .
It is striking to observe that both shocks align along the 45◦ line, indicating that the consumption
innovation is essentially identical to the permanent component.

We now want to link the behavior of hours worked to the above description of output and con-
sumption. In particular, we want to ask how much of the variance of hours worked is associated
with the temporary shock (or quasi–equivalently the output shock) versus the permanent shock re-
covered from the consumption–output VECM. It is of interest to evaluate the contribution of these
two shocks to the volatility of hours since it allows us to see whether hours can best be described

as moving with the temporary component or the permanent component. To do so, we adopt the
following approach. Once the innovations εP and εT are recovered from the bivariate C–Y VECM,
we regress hours worked (in levels or differences) on current and lagged values of these two shocks
plus a moving average error term denoted εH , which we call an hours specific shock.5 An attractive
feature of this approach is that it delivers results which are robust to the specification of hours
worked (level or difference)6 . More precisely, we run the regression

      It is well known (see for instance the discussions in Gali [1999], Gali and Rabanal [2004], Chari, Kehoe and
McGrattan [2004], Christiano, Eichenbaum and Vigfusson [2004]) that specification choice (levels versus first differ-
ences) matters a lot for VARs with hours worked. Results show that our procedure is robust to this specification
choice.

             rived from the estimation of a VECM (C, Y ) with one cointegrating relation [1;-
             1], 3 lags, using quarterly per capita U.S. data over the period 1947Q1–2004Q4.

table clearly indicate that hours worked are primarily explained by the transitory component at
business cycle frequencies.

To summarize, there are four properties of the data that we want to highlight: (i) the permanent
shock (εP ) recovered using a long run restriction in a consumption–output VECM is essentially
the same shock as that corresponding to a consumption shock (εC ) recovered using an impact
restriction, (ii) the response of consumption to a temporary shock is extremely close to zero at
all horizons, and there are almost no dynamics in the response of consumption to a permanent
shock, as it jumps almost instantaneously to its long run level, (iii) the temporary shock (or the
output shock in the short run orthogonalization) is responsible for a significant share of output
volatility at business cycle frequencies and (iv) hours are largely explained by the transitory shock
at business cycle frequencies. These facts emphasize that a substantial fraction of the business
cycle action seems to be related to changes in investment and hours worked, without any short
or long run implications for consumption. We have investigated the robustness of these findings
both against changes in the specification of the VECM — by estimating rather than imposing the
cointegration relation, adding additional lags or estimating the VECM in levels — and against the
data used to estimate the VECM — we considered total consumption rather than the consumption
of nondurables and services, output as measured by consumption plus investment only — and
in all these cases we found no major changes in patterns.7 Since we have emphasized the quasi

equivalence between the shocks recovered using a long run restriction, and shocks recovered using
an impact restrictions, in the next subsection we provide a formal test for the equality between εY
and εT .


1.2   Testing the Equality of εY and εT

This section proposes a test for the equality between εY and εT (or equivalently between εC and
εP as the shocks are pairwise orthogonal). We show that, for the VECM under consideration, this
equality corresponds to a particular zero in the long run impact matrix of the Wold decomposition.
Consider the Wold representation (1), and consider the following representation of the process:
                                                         

               P∞        i
where B(L) =     i=0 Bi L    and the variance covariance matrix of (ν1 , ν2 ) is the identity matrix. We
want here to perform an overidentified orthogonalization and impose at the same time that (i) the
shock ν2 has no impact effect on C and (ii) no long run effect on C and Y . More precisely, we look
for a matrix S such that µ = Sν and Bi = Ai S. Imposing a zero impact effect of ν2 on C implies

                                                 s12 = 0.                                            (7)

                                                                                    a12 = 0 —
when either k or b
                 a11 are zero — the long run and short run constraints are simultaneously satisfied.
This suggests that a convenient way of testing whether both the short and long run constraints are
satisfied is to test for the nullity of a particular coefficient of the long run matrix A
                                                                                        b of the Wold
representation of the process, b

case where the two series need not cointegrate.

Proposition 1 Consider a bivariate process whose Wold decomposition is given by

                                  ∆Xt1
                                                      
                                                    µ1,t
                                           = A(L)          ,
                                  ∆Xt2              µ2,t
                P∞       i
with A(L) =      i=0 Ai L ,
                          with A0 = I, where the covariance matrix of µ is given by Ω, and where the
                          b = A(1) = P∞ Ai is non singular. Consider a structural representation
matrix of long run effect A             i=0

                                      ∆Xt1
                                                           
                                                         ν1,t
                                               = B(L)           ,
                                      ∆Xt2               ν2,t
                P∞        i
where B(L) =      i=0 Bi L ,   the covariance matrix of ν is the identity matrix and µ = Sν. Then, the
two following statements are equivalent


(a) If the second structural shock ν2 has no short run impact on X1 , i.e. s12 = 0, then it has no
      long run impact on X1 , i.e. bb12 = 0, and conversely.

(b) The (1, 2) element of the long run effect matrix of the Wold decomposition is zero, i.e. b
                                                                                             a12 = 0


Proof :    We first prove that (a) implies (b). Assume that
                                                                                   !
                                       s11 0                            bb11 0
                              S=                         and B
                                                             b=                          .
                                       s21 s22                          bb21 bb22

Inverting S, we obtain                                                      
                                                       1/s11           0
                                       S −1 =                                    .
                                                    −s21 /(s11 s22 ) 1/s22

The long run effect matrix of the Wold decomposition is A b × S −1 and one can easily check
                                                        b=B
that b
     a12 = 0.

 We then prove that (b) implies (a). We have the relation ASb = B. b We assume that b a12 = 0. Then,
bb12 = b
       a11 s12 . As A                               a11 6= 0, so that bb12 = 0 ⇐⇒ s12 = 0. Q.E.D.
                    b is assumed to be nonsingular, b

To formally test whether εP = εC , we test for the nullity of b
                                                              a12 . The confidence intervals are
obtained from 1000 bootstraps of the long run matrix. The coefficient b
                                                                      a12 = 0 takes an average
value of 0.2024 with a 95% confidence interval [−0.2, 0.8]. At a 5% significance level, one cannot
reject the hypothesis that the consumption shock is identical to the permanent shock.




2    An Analytical Model of Market Rushes

In this section, we present a simple analytical model of market rushes. The main element is that, in
each period agents receive information about potential new varieties of goods which could become

                                                          13
profitable to produce. In response to these expectations of profits, agents invest in putting on the
market a prototype of the new good. Since many agents may invest in such startups, they engage
in a winner takes all competition for securing the market of a newly created variety. The winning
firm then becomes a monopolist on the market. This position may then be lost randomly at an
exogenous rate. Expansion in variety may or may not have a long run impact on productivity, so
that the market rush is not forced to satisfy the gold rush analogy. We first present the model,
then characterize its solution and discuss the equilibrium allocation properties. We contrast the
equilibrium allocations with those obtained from a social planner problem. Finally, we show that
a particular version of the model replicates the four properties of the data that we previously
highlighted.


2.1   Model

Firms :        There exists a raw final good, denoted Qt , produced by a representative firm using
labor ht and a set of intermediate goods Xjt with mass Nt according to a constant returns to scale
technology represented by the production function
                                                            Z    Nt                 1−α
                                                                                       χ
                                                  α
                                      Qt = (Θt ht )   Ntξ                   χ
                                                                       Xt (j) dj            ,             (9)
                                                              0

where Θt is an index of disembodied exogenous technological progress and α ∈ (0, 1). χ 6 1
determines the elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods and ξ is a parameter that
determines the long run effect of variety expansion. Since this final good will also serve to produce
intermediate goods, we will refer to Qt as the gross amount of final good. Also note that the raw
final good will serve as the numéraire. The representative firm is price taker on the markets.

Each existing intermediate good is produced by a monopolist. Just like in many expanding variety
models, the production of one unit of intermediate good requires one unit of the raw final good as
input. Since the final good serves as a numéraire, this leads to a situation where the price of each
                                                 1
intermediate good is given by Pt (j) =           χ.   Therefore, the quantity of intermediate good j, Xt (j),
produced in equilibrium is given by
                                                                         ξ−1+(1−α)/χ
                                                              1
                                      Xt (j) = (χ(1 − α)) α Θt Nt             α
                                                                                       ht .             (10)

and the profits, Πt (j), generated by intermediate firm j are given by
                                                                  ξ−1+(1−α)/χ
                                                                       α
                                           Πt (j) = π0 Θt Nt                    ht ,                    (11)
                                     1
                   1−χ
where π0 =          χ        (χ(1 − α)) α . Equalization of the real wage with marginal product of labor
implies
                                                             ξ+(1−α)(1−χ)/χ
                                                                   α
                                             Wt = AΘNt                          ,                       (12)

                                                             14
                        (1−α)
where A = α(χ(1 − α))     α     .

Value added, Yt , is then given by the quantity of raw final good, Qt , net of that quantity used
to produce the intermediate goods, Xt (j). Once we substitute out for Xt (j), and take away the
amount of Qt used in the production of Xt (t), we obtain
                                                 Z    Nt
                                    Yt = Qt −              Pt (j)Xt (j)dj
                                                  0
                                                  ξ+(1−α)(1−χ)/χ
                                                        α
                                       = AΘt Nt                     ht .                          (13)

Note that when ξ = −(1−α)(1−χ)/χ, an expansion in variety exerts no effect on labor productivity.
In this case, value–added reduces to
                                             Yt = AΘt ht                                          (14)

The net amount of raw final good can serve for consumption, Ct , and startup expenditures, St ,
purposes.
                                            Yt = Ct + St .                                        (15)


Variety Dynamics :       In each period, there is an exogenous probability ηt that a potential new
variety appears in the economy. In such a case, any entrepreneur who desires to produce this
potential new variety has to pay a fixed cost of one unit of the final good to setup the startup. In
order to obtain a tractable solution, we consider allocations for which it is always optimal to exploit
the whole range of intermediate goods. In practice, we assume that there is no difference between
the potential number of varieties and the actual one in equilibrium. We later check that the model
parameters are such that full adoption is indeed optimal. Let St denote total expenditures on setup
costs. A time t + 1 the startup will become a functioning new firm with a product monopoly with
an endogenous probability ρt . Likewise, an existing monopoly becomes obsolete at an exogenous
probability µ. Therefore, the dynamics for the number of products is given by

                                       Nt+1 = (1 − µ + ηt )Nt .                                   (16)

In the above, µNt represents the existing products that are destroyed, while there will be ηt Nt
openings which can be filled by startups. ηt follows a random process, with unconditional mean µ.
Note that η is a news shock, since it brings information about future profitable varieties but does
not immediately affect the production function.

The St startups of period t compete to secure the ηt Nt new monopoly positions. We assume that in
equilibrium St > ηt Nt , which can later be verified as being satisfied. The ηt Nt successful startups
are uniformly drawn from among the St existing ones. Therefore, the probability that a startup at
                                                                       ηt N t
time t will become a functioning firm at t + 1 is given by ρt =         St .

where 0 < β < 1 is a constant discount factor, Ct denotes consumption in period t and ht is the
quantity of labor the household supplies. The household chooses how much to consume, supply
labor, hold equity (Et ) in existing firms, and invest in startups (St ) by maximizing (17) subject to
the following sequence of budget constraints

                  Ct + PtE Et + St = Wt ht + Et Πt + (1 − µ)PtE Et−1 + ρt−1 PtE St−1 ,           (18)

where PtE is the beginning of period price of equity, prior to dividend payments and Wt is the wage
rate. Dividends per equity share are assumed to be equal to period–profits Πt .

This condition can be interpreted as a free entry condition, whereby the setup cost of a startup
(one unit of the final good) is equal to the expected discounted sum of future profits. Using the
labor demand condition (12) and the profit equation (11), the free entry condition (22) rewrites as
                                                                           

Using the labor demand condition (12) and the resource constraint (15), we get

The free entry condition can therefore we written as:
                                                                         

                 (ht − ψ ) = βδt Et ht+1 + βδt Et           − 1 (ht+1 − ψ ) ,                                       (25)
                                  A                    δt+1

where δt = ηt /(1 − µ + ηt ) is an increasing function of the fraction of newly opened markets ηt .

Equation (25) is a key equation of the model. It shows that current employment ht depends on
ht+1 , δt and δt+1 , and therefore indirectly depends on all the future expected δs. As δt brings
news about the future, employment is purely forward looking. The reason why future employment
favors current employment can be easily given an economic intuition: higher future employment
reflects higher expected profits, which therefore stimulates new entries today. Note that the model
possesses a lot of neutrality, as the determination of employment does not depend on either current
or future changes in disembodied technological change Θt .

By repeated substitution, the above equation can be written as a function of current and future
values of δ only. Given the nonlinearity of equation (25),8 it is useful to compute a log–linear
approximation around the deterministic steady–state value of employment h. The latter is given
by:9
                                                    ψ −1 (1 − β(1 − µ))
                                             h=                           ,
                                                  (1 − βµ πA0 − β(1 − µ))
and the log–linear approximation takes the form

                                             h − ψ −1
                                                      h               i
                           ht = γEt ht+1 +

                                                h

      ht now represents relative deviations from the steady state and γ ≡ βµ(π0 /A) + β(1 − µ)
where b
with γ ∈ (0, 1). Solving forward, this can be written as

                                                                 A − π0                X
                       ht =

                                     h                             A
                                                                                       i=0

Note that, as γ ∈ (0, 1), the model possesses a unique determinate equilibrium path.

Once the equilibrium path of h is computed, output is directly obtained from equation (13). Fi-
nally, combining labor demand (12) and labor supply (19), we obtain an expression for aggregate
consumption:
                                                           ξ+(1−α)(1−χ)/χ
                                                    A            α
                                             Ct =     Θt Nt               .                                         (27)
                                                    ψ
Equation (26) reveals that a positive δbt , – i.e. an acceleration of variety expansion, causes an
instantaneous increase in hours worked, output and investment in startups S. This boom arises
as the result of the prospects of profits derived from securing those new monopoly positions. This

    We show in the technical appendix to this paper that it is possible to obtain an exact analytical solution to the
model in the case of i.i.d. shocks.

    Note that we used the fact that Et (ηt ) = µ, which implies that δ = µ in steady state.

occurs irrespective of any current change in the technology or in the number of varieties. Such an
expansion is therefore akin to a “demand driven” or “investment driven” boom. In this analytical
model, consumption does not increase following a variety increase since total wealth is not increased.


2.3    Comparison to the social optimum

Optimality properties of those allocations are worth discussing, and it is useful to compute the
socially optimal allocations as a benchmark. The social planner problem is given by                      10

There are many sources of inefficiency in the decentralized allocations. One obvious source is the
presence of imperfect competition: ceteris paribus, the social planner will produce more of each
intermediate good. Another one is the congestion effect associated with investment in startups,
because only a fraction ρt of startups are successful. The social planner internalizes this congestion
effect, and does not duplicate the fixed cost of startups, as the number of startups created is equal
to the number of available slots.11 Because of these imperfections, the decentralized allocation
differs from the optimal allocation along a balanced growth path.

The difference between the market and the socially optimal allocations that we want to highlight
regards the response to expected future market shocks. It is remarkable that the socially optimal
allocation decision for employment (29) is static, and only depends on ηt (positively). This stands
in sharp contrast with the market outcome, as summarized by equation (25), in which all future
values of η appear. To understand this difference, let us consider an increase in period t in the
expected level of ηt+1 . We assume that full adoption is always optimal in both the decentralized
and the socially optimal allocations. In the decentralized economy, larger ηt+1 means more startup
investment in t + 1 and more firms in t + 2. Those firms will affect other firms profits in period
  10
     We assume again here that parameters are such that it is always socially optimal to invest in a new variety. One
necessary condition for full adoption to be socially optimal is that the long run effect of variety expansion is positive,
– i.e ξ > −(1 − α)(1 − χ)/χ
  11
     Note that we assume here that parameter values are such that it is always optimal to adopt all the new varieties.
Another potential source of sub–optimality would be an over or under adoption of new goods by the market. As
shown in Benassy [1998] in a somewhat different setup with endogenous growth, the parameter ξ is then crucial in
determining whether the decentralized allocations show too much or too little of new goods adoption.


                                                           18
t + 2 and onwards. Therefore, a period t startup will face more competitors in t + 2, which reduces
its current value, and therefore decreases startup investment and output12 . Such an expectation
is not relevant for the social planner, which does not respond to news about future values of η.
Therefore, in that simple analytical model, part of economic fluctuations are driven by investors
(rational) forecast about future profitability that are inefficient from a social point of view.13


2.4    A Gold Rush Configuration

We now make a set of specific assumptions on some parameters of the model. The objective is to
obtain a Wold representation of that simple analytical model that provides a structural interpreta-
tion to the shocks we recovered in Section 1. We first assume that disembodied technical change,
Θt , follows (in log) a random walk without drift: log Θt = log Θt−1 + εΘ
                                                                        t . Second, we assume that
variety expansion exerts no effect on productivity in the long run. This is achieved by setting that
ξ = −(1 − α)(1 − χ)/χ. The aggregate production function is then given by (14). Finally, we
assume that variety expansion shocks ηt follow an AR(1) process of the form

                                 log(ηt ) = ρ log(ηt−1 ) + (1 − ρ) log(µ) + εN
                                                                             t ,


where εN
       t are i.i.d. with mean 0. In this case, the solution for hours worked is given by

                                                            h − ψ −1 (1 − µ)(1 − βρ)
                               hbt = ω ηbt       with ω ≡                            .
                                                               h         1 − γρ
Under those assumptions, the logs of consumption and output are given by:

                                        log(Yt ) = ky + log(Θt ) + log(ht )                                       (30)
                                        log(Ct ) = kc + log(Θt ),                                                 (31)

where kc and ky are constants. Using equation (25) to replace ht with its solution, it is straight-
forward to write the M A(∞) representation of the system. For instance, ignoring constant terms,
we obtain
                                                                      εΘ                    εΘ
                                                                                          
                           ∆ log(Ct )                1    0            t                     t
                                             =            1−L                  = C(L)                .
                           ∆ log(Yt )                1 ω 1−ρL         εN
                                                                       t                    εN
                                                                                             t

This particular version of the model shares a lot of dynamic properties with the data. First of all
the system clearly shows that consumption and output do cointegrate (C(1) is not full rank) with
cointegrating vector [1;-1]. Second, it shows that consumption is actually a random walk, that is
only affected —in the short run as well as in the long run— by technology shocks, εΘ . Output is also
  12
     This is due to the typical “business stealing” effect found in the endogenous growth literature, for example in
Aghion and Howitt [1992], and originally discussed in Spence [1976a] and Spence [1976b].
  13
     The very result that it is socially optimal not to respond to such news is of course not general, and depends on
the utility and production function specification. The general result is not that it is socially optimal not to respond
to news about η, but that the decentralized allocations are inefficient in responsing to news shocks.


                                                            19
affected in the short run by the temporary shock, εN . Hence, computing, sequentially, our short
run and long run orthogonalization with this model would imply εP = εC = εΘ and εT = εY = εN .
Finally, it is the temporary shock εT (which is indeed εN ) that explains all the variance in hours
worked at any horizon. Such a model therefore allows for a structural interpretation of the results we
obtained in Section 1. Permanent shocks to C and Y are indeed technology shocks. Consumption
does not respond to variety expansion shocks, which however account for a lot of output fluctuations
and all the fluctuations in hours worked. Variety expansion shocks create market rushes that are
indeed gold rushes, generating inefficient business cycles as the social planner would choose not to
respond to them. In effect, these shocks only trigger rent seeking activities, as startups are means
of appropriating a part of the economy pure profits.

Although simple, this model illustrates how the market mechanism we have put forward has the
potential to account for what we observe in the data. In the next section, we consider an extended
version of the model in which we introduce capital accumulation, and real frictions. We use the
estimated responses from the long run orthogonalization scheme to estimate the size of the techno-
logical and variety expansion shocks. Once those parameters are estimated, we are able to assess
the ability of the model to account quantitatively for the facts we documented in Section 1, and
therefore decompose economic fluctuations in a meaningful way, using our model as a measurement
tool.


3       Quantitative Assessment

In this section, we first present the extended model before describing the calibration and estimation
procedure. Then we comment on the estimated parameters and derive some implications of the
estimated model. Finally, we discuss the quantitative success of alternative explanations of the
facts.


3.1      Model, Calibration and Estimation Procedure

Our emphasis in this work is on the existence of a new type of shock, namely a market rush.
In order to gauge the quantitative importance of this shock in the business cycle, we enrich the
propagation mechanisms of our baseline model, and estimate it with U.S. data.


The Extended Model:          We extend the model by including capital accumulation, two types of
intermediate goods and habit persistence in consumption. The final good is now produced with

with αx , αz , αh ∈ (0, 1), αx + αz + αh < 1 and χ > 1. We impose that ξ = −αx (1 − χ)/χ so that
variety expansion in intermediate goods X has no long–run impact, and that ξe = (χ(1−αx )−αz )/χ,
so that the equilibrium aggregate value added production function is linear in the number of
intermediate goods of type Z (Nz,t ). Θt denotes Harrod neutral technical progress, the log of
which is assumed to follow a random walk with drift γ > 1.

As in the analytical model, the numbers of available varieties evolve exogenously according to

                                       Nx,t+1     = (1 − µ + ηtx )Nx,t

In equilibrium, full adoption will always be optimal. We assume that the stochastic processes for
productivity and the market shocks are given by

where δ ∈ (0, 1) is the constant depreciation rate. The function S(·) accounts for the presence of
adjustments costs in capital accumulation. We assume that S(·) satisfies S(γ) = S 0 (γ) = 0 and
ϕ = S 00 (γ)γ 2 > 0. It follows that the steady state of the model does not depend on the parameter ϕ
while its dynamic properties do. Notice that following Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans [2005b],
Christiano and Fisher [2003] and Eichenbaum and Fisher [2005], we adopt the dynamic investment
adjustment cost specification. In this environment, it is the growth rate of investment which is
penalized when varied in the neighborhood of its steady state value. In contrast, the standard
specification penalizes the investment–to–capital ratio. The dynamic specification for adjustment
costs is a significant source of internal propagation mechanisms as it generates a hump–shaped
response of investment to various shocks.

Finally, we introduce habit persistence in consumption, and the intratemporal utility function is
given by

                                       τ =0

Note that introducing adjustment costs to investment and habit persistence, while not affecting the
main qualitative properties of the model we have presented in Section 2, will improve the ability of
the model to capture the shape of the impulse response function. The model then solves as in the
preceding section, except that no analytical solution can be found.


Calibration: Our quantitative strategy is to calibrate those parameters for which we have esti-
mates or that we can obtain by matching balanced growth path ratios with observed averages. The
time period is a quarter. The discount factor is set such that the household discounts the future
at a 3% annual rate. We assume constant markups of 20%, so that χ = 0.833. The depreciation
rate is equal to 2.5% per quarter, as is common the literature. We assume that the two sets of
intermediate goods differ only with regards to the long run impact of a variety expansion, and
therefore assume αx = αz .14 The parameters αh and αx are set such that the model generates a
labor share and a share of intermediate goods in value added of, respectively, 60% (Cooley and
Prescott [1995]) and 50% (Jorgenson, Gollop and Fraumeni [1987]). µ is set such that the model
generates a consumption share of 70%. The calibrated parameters are summarized in Table 3.

Estimation Procedure:                  We estimate the following seven parameters: the standard deviation
of the technological shock innovation σΘ , the persistence parameters ρx and ρz , and the standard
deviations σx and σz of the two market shocks, the habit persistence parameter b and the adjustment
cost parameter ϕ. These parameters are chosen in order to match the output impulse responses of
the long run VECM that we have presented in section 1, and that are displayed in Figure 1. As the
 14
      This assumption amounts to the choice of the relative variance σx2 /σz2 and can be made without loss of generality.


                                                           22
long run orthogonalization scheme cannot recover the model structural shocks (three shocks in the
model and only two innovations in the VECM), we cannot directly match the model’s theoretical
responses with the empirical responses to εP and εT . Therefore, we follow a simulated method of
moments approach. Let Ψ = (σΘ , ρx , σx , ρz , σz , b, ϕ) be the parameters to be estimated, and let M
be the column vector of estimated moments to match. We denote by M(Ψ) a column vector of
the same moments obtained from simulating the model with parameters Ψ. The set of estimated
           b is then chosen so as to minimize the distance D
parameters Ψ

                                       D = (M(Ψ) − M )0 W (M(Ψ) − M ) ,

where W is a weighting matrix that is given by the inverse of the covariance matrix of the estimators
of M . The simulated moments M(Ψ) are obtained by simulating the model over 20 times 232
periods,15 which is the length of our data sample.

The last issue concerns the choice of moments to match. We aim at matching the impulse responses
of output obtained from model generated data to both the permanent and the transitory responses
presented in Section 1 based on real data. We use the first twenty quarters of the impulse responses
in these exercises. We leave as tests of the model its capacity to reproduce the responses of output
to the short run orthonalization scheme and consumption in both scheme. Using the long run
scheme, the response of output to a permanent shock displays a hump,16 and for that reason, we
have supplemented the model with habit persistence and adjustment costs in investment. There
are therefore forty moments to match. We have two ways of testing our model. The first is by
making use of the over–identifying restrictions associated with the estimation procedure (seven
parameters for forty moments), by means of a J–test, following Hansen [1982]. The second one
is to check whether or not the estimated model possesses the properties of the data that we have
highlighted in Section 1, namely the identity between the short and long run orthogonalization
schemes and the importance of the temporary shock in explaining the short run patterns in output
and hours worked, but not of consumption. To do so, we will compute two distance statistics,
D(C) and D(C, Y ). D(C) is the a measure of the distance between the first twenty coefficients of
consumption IRF as estimated in the data and as estimated from the simulated data. The statistic
is computed as:
                                           b − M (C))0 Wc (M(C, Ψ)
                              D(C) = (M(C, Ψ)                   b − M (C)),

where M (C) is a vector collecting the impulse responses of consumption to both the permanent and
the transitory shocks obtained from the VECM, while M(C, Ψ)   b collects the same impulse responses
  15
       Michaelides and Ng [1997] have shown that efficiency gains are negligible for a number of simulations larger than
10.
  16
    Cogley and Nason [1995] have also proposed the estimation of a (C, Y ) VECM, and show that the response of
output to the temporary shock is hump–shaped. We find in this study that it is the response to the permanent shock
that is hump–shaped. This difference comes from the sample period and the choice of the output variable, that is
Net Domestic Product in Cooley and Nason and Gross Domestic Product(GDP) in our work. We prefer the use of
GDP as it is the most commonly used measure of output in the literature.

obtained by simulating the theoretical model for the estimated values of the parameters. Wc is the
inverse of the covariance matrix of these moments obtained from the VECM. Similarly, D(C, Y )
represents the distance between the model and the data for both consumption and output IRFs.


3.2   Estimation Results

Table (4) reports the estimated values of the seven parameters of interest, together with the values
of the J–statistics for over–identification. First of all note that the model is not rejected by the
data as the associated J–state is low. A key result is that σz is not significantly different from zero.
Market shocks therefore do not affect productivity in the long run, which makes market rushes
inefficient in the model.

          This table first presents the estimated parameters, as obtained from a Simulated
          Method od Moments estimation of the model. Standard errors are in paren-
          thesis. The last three lines display J–statistics and Distance statistics. These
          statistics are distributed chi-square, and the p–value for testing their nullity is
          given in brackets.



The impulse responses of the VECM estimated on the artificial data generated from the model are
presented on Figure 4, together with the ones estimated with the data. The confidence bands are


                                                  24
the one computed from the data. Note that the IRFs of the model lie within the confidence bands,
which confirms that the model does a good job not only on impact and in the long run (as shown
by the low level of the J–stat), but also for much of the dynamics. This is confirmed by the D(C)
statistic. This statistic is distributed according to a chi-square with 33 degrees of freedom under
the null hypothesis of equality between the IRFs obtained from the VECM on both historical and
simulated data for consumption. The test statistic value is 42.51 with an associated p–value of 12%.
The implications of the model for consumption dynamics are not rejected by the data. Similarly,
we perform the same test for the joint behavior of consumption and output. Again, the model is
not strongly at odds with the data (D(C, Y )=92.78 with p–value 6%).

The model already displays two of the three properties of the data that we put forward previously:
(i) there is virtually no dynamics in the response of consumption to the permanent shock, as it
affects permanently and almost instantaneously the level of consumption and (ii) the temporary
shock is responsible for a significant share of output volatility at business cycle frequencies.

It is now of interest to test whether the model also possesses the first property: (i) the permanent
shock to consumption εP is approximately identical to the εC shock recovered from a consumption–
output VECM. We therefore perform our test for the equality between εY and εT in the data
generated by the model. We then generate 1000 replications of the model simulations. In 87%
of the cases we have the property that the (1, 2) element of the long run effect matrix of the
Wold decomposition of a (C, Y ) VECM is not significantly different from zero. Figure 5 reports
the estimated impulse response functions as obtained from the VECM in the data and using the
simulated data of the model assuming a short–run orthogonalization scheme. Again, the fit is
extremely good. In Figure 6 we report the IRFs of output and consumption as obtained from the
short–run and long–run orthogonalization scheme of the VECM estimated with simulated data.
The figure clearly shows that the profiles of the IRFs are very similar. The model is therefore able
to reproduce those three salient features of the data that we have put forward in section 1.

Table 5 reports the variance decomposition of hours worked both in the data and in the model, as
computed from the same regression as equation (5). As can be seen from the table, hours volatility
is primarily accounted for by the transitory shock over the short run horizon. In fact the model
predicts that 65% of the overall volatility of hours can be accounted for by transitory shocks at
the one period horizon, to be compared to the 75% found in the data. Again the model seems to
perform remarkably well along this dimension.


3.3    Business Cycle Accounting

Once estimated, the model can be used to evaluate the importance of the market rush phenom-
ena in the U.S. business cycle. In effect, the model allows for a meaningful (structural) variance

           This table shows the k-period ahead share of the forecast error variance of hours
           worked to the temporary εT , the permanent εP and the hours specific shock εH ,
           as estimated from the data and from the simulated data. Those shares are
           computed using a two-step procedure. First εT and εP are derived from the
           estimation of a VECM (C, Y ) with one cointegrating relation [1;-1], 3 lags,
           using quarterly per capita U.S. data over the period 1947Q1–2004Q4 for the
           actual data and 232 periods for simulated data. Then hours worked (in levels
           or difference) depending on the specification) are projected on current and past
           values of those innovations plus a moving average term in εH . In the case of
           the model, those numbers are averages over the 20 replications used during the
           estimation process.


decomposition of fluctuations as reported in Table 6.

As expected from the estimation results, the market shock that exerts a permanent effect on output
does not contribute to the dynamics of the model. Indeed, the market shock that has no impact on
productivity, εx , accounts for more than one third of output volatility17 and about 85% of hours
worked on impact. On the contrary, and as expected, consumption is almost solely explained by
the permanent technology shock.

Figures 7, 8 and 9 show the theoretical responses of the main variables of the model to the structural
shocks. Note that responses are qualitatively different from one shock to another, which allows for
a proper identification of the contribution of each of them. The responses to the permanent shock
(Figure 7) display comovements of investment, output and consumption, as well as a negative initial
response of hours, explained by the role of habit persistence in consumption. The response to the
unproductive market shock (Figure 8) displays a boom in output, hours worked and investment in
the short–run, while consumption hardly responds. It is clear from this figure that such a shock
is likely to contribute to the identified transitory shock of the (C, Y ) VECM. The market shock
drives the discounted sum of expected future profits upwards, making it worthwhile to invest in
startups. This creates a boom in total investment, and also leads firms to raise their demand for
  17
     It is worth noting that the response of output to the transitory shock hinges on the response of all components
of investment except residential investment (see the technical appendix). We take this observation as an additional
fact in favor of our story in which entrepreneurs investment play a major role.

Furthermore, as this shock essentially creates a competition for rents, it is unproductive and con-
sumption almost does not respond. The response to the productive market shock (Figure 9) is
quite different, which again allows for a proper identification. First the shock exerts a permanent
effect on consumption, investment and output. Second, output does not move much in the short
run, which makes this shock unlikely to contribute to the temporary shock of the VECM.

3.4    Alternative Models

In this section we explore the robustness of the result of the previous section which indicated that
non–productive market shocks (market rushes) may be an significant source of macroeconomic
fluctuations. Our approach is to add alternative shocks to our model, one at a time, re–estimate
it and then see whether the resulting structural variance decompositions substantially change our
estimates of the relative contribution of market rushes for output, consumption and hours fluc-
tuations. We consider four types of shocks.18 First we investigate the implications of adding an

investment specific shock in our model. We examine this case in considerable detail since it has
received substantial attention in the literature and we recognize that the omission of investment
specific shocks could create a substantial bias in favor of finding that market rushes are important
even if they are not. The two other real shocks we consider are a temporary total factor produc-
tivity shock and a preference shock. A fourth possibility involves examining the role of a monetary
shock in a New–Keynesian type of model. As this fourth possibility requires writing a substantially
different model, we leave the exposition of the model and results to the technical appendix. As
can be seen in the appendix, we do not find that allowing a monetary shock to compete with our
market rush shock changes our findings regarding the relevance of market rushes for fluctuations.

One simplification we make in analyzing these cases is that we remove the Z shock (the market
shock with productivity effects), and thereby focus on models with three shocks: a permanent
TFP shock, a non–productive market shock and a third shock which can be either an investment
specific shock, a temporary TFP shock or a preference shock. The omission of the Z shock appears
reasonable since we saw in the last section that it is not playing any substantial role in fluctuations.
The production function therefore reduces to19

3.4.1    Investment Specific Shock

The first shock we consider is an investment specific shock à la Greenwood, Hercowitz and Krussell
[2000] or Fisher [2002]. We modify the resource constraint, which is now given by

                                               Yt = Ct + St + e−ζt It ,

where ζ is the investment specific shock. In his VAR study, Fisher [2002] argues that investment
specific shocks ought to exert a permanent effect and should be modeled as random walk. We will
consider both the case where the investment specific shock is modeled as a random walk and the
case where it is modeled as a stationary autoregressive process.

We first estimate a model with a permanent investment specific shock, our market shock and
a permanent TFP shock. As a first pass, the model is estimated by matching the response of
output to both the permanent and the transitory component, as was done in the previous section.
This experiment is labeled PIS–1 in Table 8 which reports the estimation results and in Table 9
which reports the associated variance decomposition. In this version the model fits the data very
comments during seminars.
  19
     An implication of this simplification is that the elasticity of output with respect to the intermediate good, αx , is
now greater as it is still calibrated to match on the share of intermediate goods in output. This implies a mechanical
reduction in the volatility of the market shock ηtx (see footnote 14).


                                                           33
well. The model does relatively well in accounting for the joint dynamics of consumption and
output (as indicated by the value of the D(C, Y )). What is interesting is that the volatility of
the permanent investment specific shock is estimated to be very close to zero. Its contribution to
output, consumption and hours worked volatility is essentially zero. In contrast, our market shock
remains a very important component in explaining hours and output.

We replicate the estimation of this model by now matching both output and consumption responses,
instead of only matching the output response. This experiment is labeled PIS–2 in the tables. The
model is not rejected by the data (p–value=0.86), and the volatility of the investment specific
shock is now close to that usually obtained by fitting the relative price of investment. Nevertheless,
the variance decomposition reported in Table 9 shows that the investment specific shock is not an
important source of business cycle fluctuations, while the market shock remains important. These
results suggest that our market shock is not simply picking up some component of output and
consumption fluctuations that is induced by permanent investment specific shocks.

These pessimistic results regarding the contribution of the investment specific shock to fluctuations
may come from its specification as a random walk. We therefore also consider a stationary repre-
sentation of the investment specific shock. The TIS–1 experiment then corresponds to a situation
where the model parameters are estimated so as to match the impulse responses of output. One
difficulty with this model is that it estimates a volatility for the innovation to the investment specific
shock that is about three times as high as in the data. The interesting result for our conjecture,
as shown in Table 9, is that the investment specific shock does not undermine the contribution of
the market shock to accounting for the business cycle. The market shock still accounts for 42% of
output volatility in the short–run while the investment specific shock only accounts for less than
5% of the output volatility at the same horizon. Furthermore, the same invariance result obtains
for hours worked and for consumption.

One may however be worried that the investment specific shock may not be well identified by this
procedure since it considers only output responses at the estimation stage. We therefore add the
impulse responses of consumption to our list of moments to match so as to add information to the
system. This experiment is labeled TIS–2 in the tables. This experiment still gives some strong
support to the model (p–value=0.87). Now the estimated process of the investment specific shock
is very much in line with what would result from an estimation from the relative price of investment
series. The key results in terms of variance decomposition are left unaffected. The market shock
still accounts for 40% of output volatility in the short–run while the investment specific shock only
accounts for less than 3%. Likewise hours worked are mainly explained by the market shock (94%
on impact), while consumption is only explained by the technological shock. In other words, the
investment specific shock appears to explain little of economic fluctuations when one allows for our
market shock, while the market shock continues to explain a substantial fraction of fluctuations

We further pursue our experiments with investment specific shocks by examining a model in which
the volatility of the market shock is constrained to be null and where only a permanent investment
specific shock is introduced to complement the permanent technology shock. The model is again
estimated by the simulated minimum distance estimation. In order to maximize the chances of
this alternative model to match the facts, the estimation aims at matching the impulses response
functions of both consumption and output over the first twenty quarters. We find that this model
is unable to fit the data very well (J–stat=271.4, p–value=0.00). This may actually come as no
surprise as the wealth effect of a permanent investment specific shock generates a strong reaction
of consumption in the short run.21 As a alternative, we also evaluate a model is which there is no
  20
     At first pass, these observations may appear at odds with the results in Fisher [2002] which suggest, using an
identified VAR approach, that investment specific shocks explain a substantial fraction of fluctuations. One way
to reconcile these two sets of observations is to recognize that the investment specific shocks identified in Fisher
[2002] may be capturing part of the effects we associate with market rushes. In particular, if changes in the quality
of equipment proceed and signal the opening of new markets, then the shocks identified in Fisher [2002] could be
generating macroeconomic fluctuations mainly through their effect on market rushes as opposed to working through
standard capital accumulation incentives.
  21
     In the technical appendix to this paper, we present an analytic model with investment specific shocks and show
that it cannot reproduce the four facts we have highlighted in the first section, regardless of the assumption that one



                                                           35
market shock and in which the investment specific shock is assumed to be stationary. The estimated
the model is again not well supported by the data (J–stat=99.3, p–value=0.03). More worrisome
is that the investment specific shock is estimated to be about seven times more volatile than its
empirical counterpart.22 As an final strategy, we impose the process for this shock as estimated
from the series of the relative price of investment. When we do so, the model obviously does not fit
the data very well, but the match is not overwhelmingly rejected by the data either (J–stat=106.1,
p–value=0.02). When evaluating the role of investment specific shocks in the resulting estimated
model, we find that they now can account for a substantial fraction of fluctuations in the very short
run. Hence, we conclude this subsection by recognizing that a temporary investment shock could
be responsible for a substantial fraction of output fluctuations, but that such an explanation does
not appear robust to the inclusion of our market shock.


3.4.2    Transitory Technological Shock

We now consider a version of the model in which we allow for a temporary shock to total factor
productivity in addition to a permanent TFP shock and our market shock. Technology is now
given by

where ζ is a stationary AR(1) autoregressive process. The parameters are estimated so as to match
the impulse responses of consumption and output. The experiment is labelled T.T. in the tables.
As can be seen from Table 9, the introduction of this shock does not undermine the contribution
of the market shock to output volatility in the business cycle. The market shock still account for
about 38% of output volatility in the short–run and more than 95% of that of hours worked. In
fact, the transitory technology shock acts as a substitute for the permanent technology shock in
explaining fluctuations. This can be seen from the variance decomposition of consumption that
clearly shows that consumption is mainly accounted for by technology shocks — about 93% in the
short–run — and that the split between the two shocks is about half–half. This can be explained
from the estimated AR(1) process of the technology shock that clearly shows that the persistence of
this shock is high (ρT = 0.91). Hence, it exerts a strong wealth effect on the consumption decision
and it is not surprising that this shock competes with the permanent TFP one.
makes about the stationarity or not of the two technological disturbances. This impossibility result in an admittedly
specific model translates into rejection in the richer model we are studying here.
  22
     When an AR(1) is fitted on the HP–filtered relative price of investment — the conventional measure of the
investment specific shock — we obtain a persistence parameter of 0.8444 and a volatility of the innovation process
of 0.0042. This series is the “total investment” deflator used in Fisher [2002]. We thank Jonas Fisher for kindly

3.4.3      Transitory Preference Shock

We now introduce a transitory preference shock that shifts the labor supply. Preferences are now
given by
                                  ∞ h
                                  X                                                i
                             Et          log(Ct+τ − bCt+τ −1 ) + ψeζt+τ (h − ht+τ ) ,
                                  τ =0

where ζ is the temporary preference shock, that is assumed to follow a AR(1) process. The model is
estimated so as to match the impulse responses of consumption and output. Again we find that the
market shock accounts for about 40% of output volatility in the short–run and does not contribute
much to the volatility of consumption (less than 15%). As far as output and consumption are
concerned, the introduction of the preference shock mainly undermines the role of the technology
shock. For instance, out of the 61% of output volatility not explained by the market shock about
35% is accounted for by the preference shock. The only dimension along which the preference
shock competes with the market shock is in the determination of hours worked. About half of
hours worked volatility can be accounted for by the preference shock. We however do not view it
as seriously calling into question the potential role of the market shock in the business cycle, as
the preference shock mainly reduces the explanatory power of the permanent shock rather than
undermining the role of the market shock.


3.5      Discussion

One important question relates to the interpretation of “a new market” and the associated empirical
observations with regards to its cyclical properties.23 Our metaphor of new markets describes
all new ways of introducing new products given existing technology or using new technologies,
although our estimations seem to favor the former interpretation rather than the later, as we do
not estimate any significant long run effect of new goods creation. Broadly speaking, a new market
ranges from producing a newly invented product (say cellular phones) to producing old goods with
newly developed uses (fiber–optic cable networks once the use of the internet has exploded) or new
ways of designing old products (say producing shirts of a fashionable new color). Given this broad
interpretation, it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive measure of our new market margin. In a very
narrow sense, one could associate new markets with new firms, and therefore look at Net Business
Formation. Net Business Formation is without ambiguity procyclical in the U.S., which is also one
of our model predictions if we literally associate N with the number of firms. The problem is that
the evidence suggests that smaller firms typically make up the majority of entrants and exits, which
is insufficient to account for a large share of hours worked and output variance at short horizons. A
less restrictive interpretation is to look at variations in the number of establishments and franchises
 23
      We have here benefitted from comments and discussion with Nir Jaimovich.



                                                         38
as an additional channel affecting the number of “operating units”. The Business Employment
Dynamics database documents job gains and job losses at the establishments level at the quarterly
frequency for the period between the third quarter of 1992 and the second quarter of 2005. Using
these observations, Jaimovich [2004] finds that more than 20% of the cyclical fluctuations in job
creation is accounted for by opening establishments, which is already a sizable number. Another
dimension which could be associated to the new market margin is variation in the number of
franchises. As Lafontaine and Blair [2005] show, numerous firms in a variety of industries have
adopted franchising as a method of operation. Sales of goods and services through the franchising
format amounted to more than 13% of real Gross Domestic Product in the 1980s and 34% of retail
sales in 1986. Jaimovich [2004] documents that the variations in the number of franchises are
procyclical at the business cycle frequency, which is again in line with the predictions of our model.
We take this empirical evidence, together with anecdotal evidence and the evidence obtained by
estimating our model, as supporting the idea that agents expectations about the possibility of new
markets is likely an important driving force of the business cycle.


4    Conclusion

This paper explores whether business cycles fluctuations may sometimes be driven by expectations
of new market openings. We first reviewed a set of observations showing that the business cycle is, to
a large extent, associated with a non-permanent effect on output and hours and that does not move
consumption at all. We then propose a structural interpretation to that shock, in a model where
the opening of new market opportunities causes an economic expansion by favoring competition
for market share. We call such an episode a market rush. We study a simple analytical model
that clearly displays the important qualitative features of the data we have previously highlighted.
Then, a quantitative model built along the same lines and estimated by a simulated method of
moments is exposed. The model suggests that market rush phenomenon is a significant contributor
to business cycle fluctuations and this is robust to the inclusion of many alternative shocks discussed
in the literature.
