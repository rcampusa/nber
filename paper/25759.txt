                                           ABSTRACT

For organizations focused on scientific research and innovation, workforce diversity is a key
driver of success. Blinded review is an increasingly popular approach to reducing bias and
increasing diversity in the selection of people and projects, yet its effectiveness is not fully
understood. We explore the impact of blinded review on gender inclusion in a unique setting:
innovative research grant proposals submitted to the Gates Foundation from 2008-2017. Despite
blinded review, female applicants receive significantly lower scores, which cannot be explained
by reviewer characteristics, proposal topics, or ex-ante measures of applicant quality. By contrast,
the gender score gap is no longer significant after controlling for text-based measures of
proposals’ titles and descriptions. Specifically, we find strong gender differences in the usage of
broad and narrow words, suggesting that differing communication styles are a key driver of the
gender score gap. Importantly, the text-based measures that predict higher reviewer scores do not
also predict higher ex-post innovative performance. Instead, female applicants exhibit a greater
response in follow-on scientific output after an accepted proposal, relative to male applicants. Our
results reveal that gender differences in writing and communication are a significant contributor
to gender disparities in the evaluation of science and innovation.

I.     Introduction

Diversity and inclusion are key goals for society at large and specifically within the scientific and

innovative communities across corporate, government, and academic organizations (Robinson and

Dechant 1997, Bilimoria et al 2008, Østergaard et al 2011). Diversity of individuals and ideas

leads to better outcomes (Azoulay et al 2011) and higher levels of productivity (Reagans and

Zuckerman 2001). This is particularly important in the context of innovation-driven organizations:

in such contexts, diversity offers not only the usual benefits of greater efficiency as bias is

eliminated, but also the potential to improve an organization’s innovative capacity as individuals

and teams benefit from the introduction of new ideas and perspectives (Tasheva and Hillman

2018). At the core of any attempt to increase diversity and inclusion lies the selection of projects

and people, which are the building blocks for any dimension of diversity. Organizations pursing

these goals must decide how best to structure their internal processes in such a way as to ensure

diversity and inclusion at all stages of selection – hiring (Fernandez and Fernandez-Mateo 2006),

promotion (Castilla and Benard 2010), and resource allocation (Boudreau et al 2016).

Organizations seek to design processes that maximize the selection of the best individuals, teams

and ideas, while minimizing opportunities for biased evaluation (especially bias based on

ascriptive characteristics). A wide range of approaches exist for improving selection: organizations

and individuals have generated superior outcomes by emphasizing objective measures of

candidates’ ability and past performance (Reuben et al 2014), building institutional support for

equality (Monroe et al 2008), mitigating the impact of differences in professional networks (Wold

and Wenneras 2010), increasing the diversity of evaluators (Kunze and Miller 2017), and adopting

accountability and transparency procedures (Castilla 2015).

While the above approaches are beneficial, they usually fall short of fully eliminating biased

evaluation. By contrast, within a variety of settings, blinded review has often been considered as


                                                 2
the ‘gold-standard’ process to remove opportunities for bias in evaluation and selection. In the

emerging literature on ‘blinded-ness”, more diverse outcomes have been predicated on the notion

that differences typically emerge from patterns of bias that can be identified from names (on CVs

or scripts, as in McIntyre et al 1980), or in person (musical auditions in Goldin and Rouse 2000,

entrepreneurial pitches in Brooks et al 2014); the introduction of blinded review can lead to a

significant increase in diversity and inclusion (Goldin and Rouse 2000). However, within the

scientific community – the community which pioneered double-blinded review as a central process

used to eliminate the role of biased perception in its own activities – evidence suggests that many

organizational practices do not in fact lead to unbiased evaluations (Shen et al 2013, Witteman et

al 2017). In light of this discrepancy, it is worth considering the impact of blinded review in the

context of innovation and scientific activity, as it seems to be a necessary condition for the

elimination of bias. We attempt to evaluate whether blinded review is sufficient to overcome all

aspects of under-representation, or whether there are significant barriers to diversity that remain

after its implementation.

Our paper explores the degree to which gender shapes outcomes even in a blinded setting, and

seeks to evaluate the drivers of gender disparity in science and innovation, in terms of both access

to key inputs and subsequent output. We take advantage of data covering a blinded grant-review

process from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that has several critical characteristics:

reviewers evaluate anonymous proposals, the reviewing process enables multiple individual

reviewers to provide independent scores, it provides scoring data at the reviewer-proposal level,

and it allows us to trace individual applicants’ later activities through scientific publications, NIH

grant receipts, and other measures of innovation.

Using a sample of 6,794 proposals submitted to the Gates Foundation between 2008 and 2017, we

analyze two major components of the interplay between diversity and innovation. First, we


                                                  3
examine the determinants of diversity in innovative organizations, by examining the role of gender

in explaining reviewer evaluations of innovative proposals. Second, we construct a difference-in-

difference estimator to explore the interaction between funding and applicant gender, in order to

identify the differential impact of funding across applicants. In these analyses, we focus on a

homogeneous sample of US-based life science researchers, and take advantage of the features of

our setting to identify the causal impact of gender on both reviewer scores and subsequent

outcomes.

Our results offer important new insights into the relationship between diversity and innovation.

We find that even in an anonymous review process, there is a robust negative relationship between

female applicants and the scores assigned by reviewers. This disparity persists even after

controlling for proposal topics, reviewer demographics, applicant publication histories, and

applicants’ prior applications. However, the gender disparity becomes insignificant after

controlling for text-based measures of applicants’ proposals. Specifically, building on the text

analysis methods of previous studies (Schmader et al 2007, Kaatz et al 2015), we show that female

applicants use fewer of the words favored by reviewers when describing their proposals, and more

of the words associated with low reviewer scores. Exploring this pattern further, we show that

female applicants have a tendency to choose more “narrow” (i.e. topic-specific), words and fewer

“broad” words. Both of these tendencies lead to lower scores for female applicants, with their use

of narrow words having the greater negative effect. After controlling for the impact of word choice,

the gender-based score disparity is no longer significant, and its effect size drops by over 50%.

Our findings therefore suggest that a focus on writing style and word choice can offer mechanisms

through which innovative organizations may seek to improve their evaluation and selection

processes.




                                                 4
Having shown how communication style influences the evaluation of innovative proposals, we

then turn our attention to follow-on innovative outcomes. Specifically, we explore how male and

female applicants differ in their innovative output subsequent to their application, across measures

such as academic publications and NIH grant awards. We begin by establishing that the text-based

measures which were a major driver of selection by (blinded) reviewers do not also predict an

increase in follow-on innovation. Most prominently, we show that the use of the broad words

favored by reviewers actually predict a decrease in ex-post outcomes, suggesting that reviewers

may be overly credulous to broad descriptions that are likely to reflect style more than substance.

Next, we find that across a range of outcomes, being selected by the Gates Foundation leads to a

bigger impact for female applicants, primarily through “leveling the playing field” relative to male

applicants. Specifically, female applicants are disadvantaged relative to male applicants if they are

not selected; by contrast, successful female applicants generate innovative outcomes that are either

indistinguishable from or better than those of successful male applicants. Indeed, the

disappearance of disparities after being selected and receiving Gates Foundation funding suggests

that from the perspective of impact, female applicants may well generate a greater “return” on

Gates Foundation resources. This effect is strongest for the outcome of NIH grant funding, where

successful female applicants not only catch up but significantly outperform their male

counterparts.

Overall, our results identify two major areas where gender and innovation interact: first, the choice

of (excessively narrow) words by female applicants to describe their innovations can lead to a

significant reduction in their perceived quality (even when the proposed innovations are actually

high-quality!). Second, the failure to be selected for funding acts as a disproportionate barrier to

the follow-on innovation of female applicants, while successful female applicants exhibit

outcomes that are either indistinguishable from or superior to those of their male counterparts.


                                                 5
These findings suggest that there is significant scope for improvement at innovation-driven

organizations, in terms of both increasing the selection of high-quality projects, and allocating

resources to the innovators for whom they would have the greatest impact.

II.    Diversity, Gender, and Innovation

       A.      Definitions: Diversity, Innovation, Efficiency, and Bias

Diversity and Innovation: In this paper, we approach the topic of organizational diversity by

focusing on just one of its many dimensions, namely, gender. While our analysis is on the level of

individuals, our findings on gender disparities can lead to increased diversity for any organization

where women are underrepresented. Indeed, this pattern exists for many knowledge-based

organizations, including our own empirical setting. In addition to identifying mechanisms that

increase diversity by expanding the inclusion of women in such organizations, we also seek to

estimate the impact of gender on innovative output. We measure innovation through a combination

of proposal-based metrics, article publications, and NIH grant awards. We also perform text-based

analysis using Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms in order to capture the direction of

innovation as well as its quantity and quality.

Equity, Equality, and Efficiency: It is important to differentiate between equity, equality, and

efficiency. The concept of equity is referenced most often in aid-focused organizations, which tend

to pursue the goal sending the most resources to places with the highest needs, e.g. by helping

eradicate malaria in Africa. Importantly, this is in contrast to the goal of equality, which would

dictate a similar level of resource allocation to all regions and projects, irrespective of need.

Finally, both equality and equity are distinct from efficiency, which is defined as allocating

resources to the most productive or promising projects, even if those projects do not necessarily

line up with the areas of greatest need. In most cases, a balance of both equity and efficiency is

required for an organization to effectively impact its priorities. In the case of the Gates Foundation,


                                                  6
the main target of impact is the quality of life of disadvantaged groups, with a particular focus on

health and infectious diseases in our sample. We measure progress toward these goals by tracking

the publications and grants that result from the Gates Foundation’s funding decisions.

Bias and Demographic Disparity: We take our definition of bias from Poppenhaeger (2017):

        The definition of bias is a positive or negative unconscious belief about a particular
        category of people. This allows quick, but sometimes inaccurate, processing of
        information...Biases are not the same as discrimination; discrimination can happen
        if a person actually acts on their biases...If biases go unchecked, they can have
        multiple detrimental effects for groups against which negative biases exist, for
        example in performance evaluations, hiring, and career progression.
Importantly, this definition highlights the fact that evaluators may be unaware of any potential bias

they possess. Prior work indicates that bias can interact with structural elements of organizations

(Murray and Graham 2007, Kelly et al 2010, Ding, Murray, and Stuart 2012) to generate

significant disparities in outcomes across demographic groups. If such bias-driven mechanisms

are the dominant driver of organizational demographics, one might expect that the adoption of

double-blind evaluations would suffice to overcome both explicit and implicit bias, and lead to

greater inclusion for women and other under-represented groups. However, bias, either explicit or

implicit, may not be the sole driver of demographic disparities. Differences in interests, experience,

risk tolerance, or other factors may generate a disparity across demographic groups, even under a

completely unbiased review process. Thus, while organizations should certainly aim to remove

bias from their evaluations, this may not be sufficient if their goal is to eliminate the demographic

disparities that have limited their diversity.

        B.      Diversity in Knowledge-Based Organizations

A number of recent studies have focused on the under-representation of women, racial minorities,

and other demographic groups in innovative fields (Cook and Kongcharoen 2010, Lincoln et al

2012, Bell et al 2017, Marschke et al 2018) and knowledge-based organizations (Fernandez and

Campero 2014, Gompers and Wang 2017). The academic attention has been complemented by


                                                  7
discussion of workforce diversity in the popular press, leading top technology companies like

Google and Apple to begin disclosing the demographic statistics of their employees. While such

reports can spur greater awareness of the lack of diversity in knowledge-based organizations, these

group-level statistics do not offer an opportunity to identify the mechanisms behind the patterns

of diversity, because they do not capture outcomes at the individual level. By adopting the

perspective of individual innovators, we add to the growing literature seeking to track the presence

and impact of demographic disparities over the course of individuals’ entire careers (McKown and

Weinstein 2002, Hengel 2017, Lerchenmueller and Sorenson 2018).

       C.      The Structure of Gender Disparity and its Potential Drivers

The structure of gender disparities has been the subject of considerable recent research, spanning

a wide range of contexts. Some studies have focused on direct mechanisms such as bias and

discrimination, where it is possible to observe that an individual belongs to a disfavored group

(Castilla 2008, Brooks et al 2014, Cook et al 2018), and this leads to a disparity in outcomes. This

stands in contrast to studies focusing on indirect mechanisms, where a disparity in outcomes exists

despite the lack of direct discrimination (Ginther et al 2016, Fernandez and Campero 2017). In this

latter group, disparities can be driven by self-selection, conforming to stereotypes, or avoidance of

competition, rather than the direct impact of ascriptive bias. Our own focus is on this latter form

of disparity: we are able to exclude the role of bias thanks to the blinded review process used in

our empirical setting. This allows us to not only estimate the magnitude of the gender disparities

that persist after eliminating traditional forms of bias and discrimination, but also to highlight the

precise mechanisms which drive any remaining gender disparities. Indeed, our setting is meant to

complement the approach described by Goldin and Rouse (2000), who show that anonymous

applications are sufficient to significantly reduce disparities faced by female musicians in

symphony orchestras. By contrast, in our setting, significant differences in outcomes persist even


                                                  8
under an anonymous evaluation process, suggesting the need for further analysis of the indirect

drivers of gender disparity.

           D.       The Interaction of Demography and Innovation

Innovation is a particularly challenging context for demographic diversity and inclusiveness:

unlike other fields, it has a number of features which make it difficult for standard efficiency-based

effects to push out discriminatory tendencies.2 Specifically, the following features of innovation

make it more likely than other fields to harbor a persistent lack of diversity:

       ● Outcomes are unpredictable, and there are long lags before success is realized

       ● Outcomes are only observable for funded or attempted innovations

       ● An individual’s contribution is hard to separate, esp. in cumulative innovation

       ● Teamwork is often required to push past the current state of the art, and some team

           members might prefer working with those similar to them

These challenges are significant, and innovative fields do often generate greater disparities than

other sectors (Magua et al 2017). At the same time, diversity, while lacking, may be uniquely

valuable in the context of innovation (Robinson and Dechant 1997, Østergaard et al 2011).

Innovative organizations would stand to gain not only the usual efficiency benefits from a

reduction in discrimination, but they would also have the potential to introduce new ideas, or

recombine existing ideas in new ways. We therefore seek to evaluate both sides of this question in

our context, as we focus specifically on the dimension of gender: what mechanisms can lead

innovative organizations to become more diverse, and what are the potential benefits of such an

increase in diversity?

III.       Data and Methods

    For a full discussion of the traditional perspective on discrimination and (in)efficiency, see Becker (2010).


                                                             9
       A.      Empirical Strategy and Regression Specifications

In analyzing the relationship between gender and innovation-related outcomes, there are a number

of challenges that normally interfere with attempts to estimate causal effects. To capture an

organization’s ability to evaluate innovations, an ideal empirical design would take ideas of

comparable ex-ante quality, and randomly assign each idea to multiple applicants across a range

of demographic groups. These applicants, also of comparable ex-ante quality, would develop and

submit proposals based on the ideas to the organization. If the proposals were submitted

anonymously, it would be possible to remove the direct elements of bias and identify any indirect

or underlying causes of gender disparity. Ideally, these proposals would then be (independently)

evaluated by a diverse set of reviewers, in order to examine the relative impacts of applicant and

reviewer demographics. We can approximate this ideal empirical design in our setting by

attempting to control for idea and applicant quality while comparing the scores that different

reviewers give to a single proposal. Thus, the regression specification we would like to estimate

is:

 !"#$"%"&_()*&"+,-
             = /0 0+,- + /1 2334$)5678"69"&, + /2 !"#$"%"&8"69"&- + /12 :67"&5)7$*6,-
             + ;+,-

In the above equation, we estimate the score of idea i, from applicant j, as evaluated by reviewer

k. The vector of covariates 0+,- varies by specification, and can include fixed effects for the time

of submission and the subject area of the idea, text-based measures of the idea’s title and

description, and a range of applicant and reviewer characteristics. The demographic variables

capture the gender for both applicants j and reviewers k, and the interaction term identifies the

impact of shared demographic characteristics between applicants and reviewers (e.g. a female

reviewer evaluating a proposal from a female applicant). The primary coefficient of interest in

these specifications is /1 , the impact of applicant gender on the score received from reviewers;


                                                10
specifically, we will track how this coefficient changes based on the inclusion of controls for

covariates that might be correlated with both applicant gender and reviewers’ evaluations.

Turning to the second portion of our empirical design, we encounter the additional challenge of

analyzing the relationship between gender and innovative outcomes. In an ideal research setting,

we would like to take a single idea and assign it to “twin” applicants of identical quality and from

the same demographic group, and randomly assign funding to one but not the other. We would

then want to compare the funded idea with the one that did not receive funding, and perform a

difference-in-differences analysis across demographic groups whose ideas also receive the same

random assignment of funding. In this context, we approximate this ideal design through a

regression-discontinuity approach. Specifically, we compare funded proposals to proposals that

received high scores from reviewers but did not receive funding. Our estimated equation becomes:

    :66*#57$#"<=7)*>"+,
                = /0 0+, + /1 ?=69$6@+ + /2 2334$)5678"69"&, + /12 :67"&5)7$*6+, + ;+,

In the above equation, we analyze our sample at the level of idea i from applicant j, and 0+, captures

key covariates including fixed effects for the time of submission and the subject area of the idea,

as well as key applicant characteristics such as innovative output during the ex-ante period. While

the direct effects of funding and applicant gender are valuable for interpreting the overall pattern

of results, the primary coefficient of interest is /12 , which captures the differential impact of

funding across applicant gender.3 In effect, this is a difference-in-differences estimator of the

impact of diversity on innovation, and allows us to draw conclusions regarding the efficiency of

the innovative process.

         B.       Empirical Setting: The Gates Foundation’s GCE Program



3
 In some specifications, we focus solely on applicants who successfully obtained funding; in this setting, rather than
a difference-in-differences approach, we instead draw conclusions from the direct effects of gender on innovative
outcomes.


                                                         11
In the previous section, we identified a set of ideal experimental settings that would allow

researchers to estimate the impact of diversity on innovation, both in terms of understanding the

drivers of diversity in innovative organizations, and in terms of the impact of diversity itself on

innovative outcomes. While the expectation of random assignment of funding is not likely to be

satisfied in any well-run organization, our empirical setting does offer a number of valuable

features that allow us to estimate the relationship between diversity and innovation. Our empirical

setting is the Global Challenges: Exploration (GCE) Program at the Bill and Melinda Gates

Foundation (subsequently, the Gates Foundation), providing a sample 6,794 anonymous proposals

submitted by US-based researchers from 2008-2017. While this program offers valuable internal

information on the decisions of individual reviewers, it also differs from more “traditional” grant

review institutions (e.g. the NIH or NSF): these organizations use a non-blind review process and

send proposals only to reviewers within the proposal’s narrow subfield. Further, traditional grant-

review institutions often engage in consensus-based collective decisions, where reviewers discuss

proposals together and at a collective evaluation representing the views of the entre reviewer panel

(NIH 2008). By contrast, the GCE Program implements a review process with the following key

characteristics: diverse panels of reviewers, anonymous proposals, and champion-based funding

decisions.

   ● Anonymous proposals - reviewers have no information on the candidate beyond the

       proposal details

   ● Diverse pool of reviewers - reviewers are drawn from a wide range of scientific fields and

       may be from non-academic backgrounds such as the private sector or government

   ● Independent evaluations - reviewers do not confer with each other when assigning scores




                                                12
    ● “Champion-based” review - rather than relying on consensus across multiple reviewers,

        strong support from a single reviewer can greatly increase the odds of being funded4, while

        strong negative reviews are treated as identical to neutral reviews

The above features reflect the priorities of the Gates Foundation in its search for solutions to major

challenges in global health and development. At the same time, they introduce a richness of

variation in both reviewers and proposals, allowing for detailed analysis of reviewer decisions and

project outcomes.

        C.       Data Sources and Key Variables

The data for our analysis comes from the first nineteen rounds of the GCE program, which includes

a total of 17,311 proposals focused on infectious disease research submitted between 2008 and

2017. In order to ensure a homogeneous pool of applicants, we focus on the 6,794 proposals

submitted by applicants who have both an academic or non-profit research affiliation and a US

contact address.5 These proposals, submitted by 5,058 unique applicants, were allocated across

subsets of 132 innovation-panel reviewers, leading to a total of 21,453 reviewer-proposal pairs.

From the Gates Foundation, we obtain identifying information on the identities of proposers and

reviewers, the substance of the proposals, and the reviewer scores and funding outcomes resulting

from the program. We calculate probabilistic measures of gender for both applicants and reviewers

using the techniques of Sood and Laohaprapanon (2018). Reviewer evaluations in our sample are

simple but highly skewed: from an average portfolio size of over 100 proposals per round,

reviewers can choose a single proposal to receive their highest level of support (categorized as a

“Gold” rating by the GCE program), and can award up to five other proposals with a high level of


4
  While a single reviewer can greatly increase the funding odds for any single project, their highest level of
endorsement can only be given to one of the approximately 100 proposals that they review during each round of the
program.
5
  In the interest of analyzing a homogeneous sample, we also drop the small fraction applicants that we identify as
members of under-represented minorities.


                                                       13
support (categorized as a “Silver” rating).6 Our empirical approach employs an ordered-logit

specification to capture this decision process. Based on these reviewer evaluations, a total of 635

proposals (~9.4%) received grants of $100,000 each during the first nineteen rounds of the GCE

program.

We use the identifying information on reviewers and applicants to obtain information on

institutional affiliation, gender, country of residence, and area of expertise. Notably, even at the

proposal stage, we find a significant gender gap: our sample of US-based academic applicants is

66% male. In addition to obtaining demographic information, we obtain applicants’ full

publication histories in order to estimate research productivity both before and after the peer review

process. Table 1 lists summary statistics for these and other key variables, while Figure 1 presents

the distribution of proposals and ratings across topic areas. Using this data, we proceed to

investigate the role of gender in the peer review process, and the ability of peer review to both

evaluate and select promising research projects and innovations.

Our results begin with Table 2, which examines the impact of gender on the scores received by

applicants’ proposals. Columns 1 through 4 evaluate the overall impact of applicant gender across

all reviewers in our sample, while column 5 decomposes the effect between male and female

reviewers by adding an interaction between applicant and reviewer genders. All specifications

include fixed effects by GCE round; specification 2 adds reviewer characteristics, and

specifications 3 through 5 include reviewer fixed effects. In addition, specifications 4 and 5 include

  It is worth noting that this rating system does not offer the opportunity for reviewers to send negative signals:
proposals not receiving support from a given reviewer all receive the same rating (effectively, a score of zero),
regardless of the reviewer’s degree of disapproval.


                                                        14
topic area fixed effects. In all specifications, we find consistent negative disparities for female

applicants: such applicants are significantly less likely to receive high scores from reviewers. The

effect size we estimate reflects our ordered-logit specification, reflecting a log-odds ratio that is

approximately 16% lower than male applicants. In separate calculations, we find that this overall

effect is driven by female applicants being approximately 15% less likely to receive a “silver”

rating and 20% less likely to receive a “gold” rating from reviewers. In specification 5, we also

include the interaction of female applicants and female reviewers; we find a strong positive effect

for this variable. Importantly, this should not be interpreted to conclude that female reviewers have

an affirmative preference for proposals from female applicants: the sum of the direct effect and the

interaction is positive, but not significantly different from zero.7 Effectively, the direct effect

captures the lower scores that female applicants receive from male reviewers, while the interaction

term indicates that female reviewers do not exhibit a similar disparity in reviewer evaluations

across gender.

Since the impact of applicant gender in Table 2 is robust to including topic-area fixed effects, our

results suggest that the gender disparities we observe are not driven by applicants choosing less-

valued areas of study. We explore this question further in Figure 2, which compares the prevalence

of female applicants against average proposal scores across the topic areas in our sample. We find

that there is significant variation across topics in both dimensions; further, we find a weak positive

relationship between the rate of female applicants and the average of reviewer scores across topic.

The patterns in Figure 2 therefore lend additional support that the choice of topic is not a significant

driver of the gender disparities in our sample.

7
 Only 20 of 132 (~15%) reviewers in our sample are female, and in combination with the low proportion of female
applicants, we lack the statistical power to precisely estimate the interaction between female reviewers and applicants.


                                                          15
In Table 3, we continue our analysis of demographic disparities in reviewer scores, adding explicit

controls for applicant quality using the measure of pre-period publications.8 Panel A explores a

range of publication-based metrics, and finds that the female applicants in our sample are at a

disadvantage relative to male applicants across all measures. We begin with career length in

specifications 1 and 2, where we find that female applicants are approximately 30% less senior

than male applicants, as measured by the number of years from an applicant’s first academic

publication. This result is robust to adding topic fixed effects in specification 2. We perform similar

analyses for the number of publications, and the share of top-journal and last-author publications,

all in the three years prior to applying to the GCE program. Across all three measures, we find that

female applicants are at a significant disadvantage, though this effect diminishes significantly after

controlling for topic-area fixed effects and applicant career length. Overall, these results suggest

the possibility that within our sample, female applicants have weaker publication histories, and

may therefore have less ability to generate a high-scoring proposals.

We evaluate the impact of this difference in prior publications in Panel B, where we repeat the

analysis of Table 2 while controlling for the details of applicants’ publication history. We find a

significant positive impact of prior publications on reviewer scores in specification 2; after

including additional measures, we find that the share of top-journal publications is the strongest

predictor of reviewer scores in our setting. Overall, we find strong evidence for the hypothesis that

applicants with a superior publication history tend to generate higher-scoring proposals. However,

even after controlling for a range of measures of applicants’ prior publications, we continue to find

a significant disadvantage for female applicants in all specifications. This pattern of results




8
    Specifically, we define the “pre-period” as the three years prior to the proposal’s application year.


                                                             16
suggests that the ex-ante differences in publication patterns across gender do not explain a

significant portion of the outcome disparities we find in the proposal-evaluation process.

                                            TABLES 3A & 3B HERE

         B.       Mechanisms Driving Disparity: Repeat Applications

Having presented evidence for consistent gender disparities in reviewer scores, we now proceed

to evaluate the mechanisms through which they might emerge even under a blinded-review

process. The first potential mechanism is that of persistence: might female applicants be more

easily discouraged if their first proposal is rejected? We evaluate this dimension in Panel A of

Table 4, where we find that female applicants are significantly less likely to reapply after an initial

rejection. This negative association becomes insignificant in specifications 3 and 4 after

controlling for career length, suggesting that experience can lead to increased persistence that

mitigates this aspect of gender disparity. We then proceed to evaluate the impact of this difference

in Panel B; we show that repeat applicants receive significantly higher scores than first attempts.

This effect is both strong and highly robust, persisting in all specifications as we include topic

fixed effects, publication characteristics, and interaction effects. Our results therefore serve as a

reminder of the value of persistence in the face of rejection; in light of the results in Panel A, this

is advice that is particularly important for female researchers and innovators at the early stages of

their career.9 However, controlling for this repeat-applicant effect does not meaningfully reduce

the gender disparity we identified in Tables 2 and 3. Thus, while repeat applicants are expected to

receive significantly higher scores from reviewers, this dimension does not explain a significant

portion the female score disparity in our sample.

                                            TABLES 4A & 4B HERE


9
 While repeat applicants receive a significant boost in terms of their expected scores from reviewers, the interaction
between female applicants and repeat applicants in specifications 5 and 6 are insignificant. Thus, there is no additional
boost to female applicants who re-apply after rejection, relative to male applicants who do the same.


                                                          17
       C.      Mechanisms Driving Disparity: Word Choice

A second potential mechanism to explain demographic disparities in an anonymous review process

is the set of words that applicants use to describe their proposals. Specifically, we analyze the

words present in the title and descriptions of applicants’ proposals, after removing standard

conjunctions, pronouns, and linking words. In Figures 3 and 4, we plot words based on their

relative rates of use by male and female applicants, and include 45-degree lines to clearly separate

“male” from “female” words in our data. We present the 100 most frequent of the remaining words

in Figure 3, in order to show that word use rates are strongly correlated across applicant gender.

While the overall correlation is strong, there is nevertheless significant variation in the gender use

rates of some words. Figure 4 highlights this trend by focusing on words that have a significant

correlation with reviewer scores, and also identifies the difference between “narrow” words (those

which appear significantly more often in some topics than others), and “broad” words (which

appear at similar rates in all topic areas). The latter figure suggests that male applicants tend to

favor broad words, while female applicants have a tendency to use narrow words. Overall, these

figures identify the similarities and difference in word choice across applicant gender, and set the

stage for analyzing whether the differences we find can explain the gender score gap in our sample.

                                      FIGURES 3 & 4 HERE

In addition to disparities in use rates across applicant gender, the frequent words in our sample

also have significant disparities in their tendencies to appear within high- and low-scoring

proposals. We highlight these score disparities in Figure 5, plotting frequent (i.e. top-100) words

that are disproportionately associated with male or female applicants based on their rates of use

within high- and low-scoring proposals. While there is a reasonable amount of variation across

words, the overall pattern suggests that words falling well below the 45-degree line (i.e. those with

strongly negative score disparities) are much more likely to be used disproportionately by female


                                                 18
applicants. By contrast, most “male” words are likely to be near or above the 45-degree line,

indicating a positive score disparity. We follow up the binary analysis of gender in Figure 5 with

a full two-dimensional exploration of gender- and score-based disparities in Figure 6. This figure

highlights the positive relationship between words used more often by male applicants, and words

associated with high-scoring proposals. Importantly, while most “male” words have a positive

score disparity, there are “female” words with both positive and negative score disparities. This

effect seems to be associated with the difference between broad and narrow words: the broad words

in Figure 6 seem to be driving the high scores of male applicants, while the narrow words seem to

be associated with the lower scores of female applicants. This suggests that there is significant

scope for female applicants to improve their scores by altering the words they use to describe their

proposals.

                                     FIGURES 5 & 6 HERE

In light of the patterns described above, we now proceed to explore the impact of word choice on

reviewer scores using a regression framework in Table 5. We begin with Panel A, which highlights

some of the basic patterns of word choice in our sample, focusing on the top 1,000 most frequent

words used in the proposals in our sample. We examine the differences in word use between male

and female applicants, and in specification 1, we show that the total number of frequent words

does not differ across gender. By contrast, we find significant differences across applicant gender

in all remaining word-choice measures: female applicants use fewer high-scoring words and more

low-scoring words in specifications 2 and 3, and this result is robust to identifying high- and low-

scoring words using only male applicants’ proposals in specifications 4 and 5. Finally, in

specifications 6 and 7, we classify words as “broad” and “narrow” based on whether they are used

at similar or different rates across topic areas, and show that female applicants use fewer broad

words and more narrow words when describing their proposals.


                                                19
Having established these basic patterns, we next construct text-based measures of each proposal’s

quality as perceived by reviewers. Specifically, we predict a proposal’s reviewer scores based only

on the presence or absence of the top 500 most score-influencing words in each proposal’s title

and description. Importantly, to avoid circular reasoning, we calibrate our text-based reviewer

score predictions using only the proposals from male applicants. Thus, the high-and low-scoring

words we identify are those with which male applicants receive high and low scores from

reviewers, with no information regarding the use of these words by female applicants. We

normalize score predictions to a mean of zero and unit standard deviation, and proceed to use them

as dependent variables in Panel B, and explanatory variables in Panel C.

In Panel B, we analyze the relationship between applicant gender and our text-based measures of

proposal quality. Specifications 1 through 3 demonstrate this result using the full set of 500 words,

while specifications 4 and 5 explore the division between high-scoring and low-scoring words,

respectively Finally, in specifications 6 and 7, we focus solely on broad and narrow words,

respectively. In all cases, we find strong evidence that female applicants use words that diminish

their chances of receiving high scores from reviewers. In addition, we find that female applicants

are at a greater disadvantage in their use of narrow words, compared to their disadvantage in the

use of broad words.

Having established the baseline result that female applicants’ word choices put them at a

disadvantage, we now turn to the impact of those word choices on reviewer scores in Panel C. Our

analysis begins in specification 2, where we control for a wide range of text-based metrics such as

the count of unique frequent words, grammatical composition, and the grade level10 of proposal

text. While a number of these measures have a significant association with reviewer scores, they



10
  Our measure of grade level is a composite rating based on the arithmetic average of the Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning-
Fog, and SMOG measures. See Hengel (2017) for details.


                                                       20
do not significantly reduce the observed gender gap in our sample. However, when we add the

text-based score predictions starting in specification 3, we see a large drop in the coefficient on

female applicants. The inclusion of the score prediction based on narrow words again seems to be

a major driver of the gender gap, as it renders the applicant gender effect insignificant, while the

score prediction based on broad words fails to do so. When controlling for both measures, we

continue to find no significant effect of applicant gender on reviewer scores, even as we add

controls for topic areas and applicant publications. Notably, these measures do not eliminate the

interaction between female applicants and female reviewers, which remains positive and

significant.11 Table 5 therefore highlights word choice as a crucial driver of gender disparities,

even under blinded review.

                                         TABLES 5A, 5B, & 5C HERE

Having covered a range of mechanisms individually, we now synthesize our prior analyses of

reviewer scores to examine the relative impact of each dimension in contributing to gender -based

disparities. Table 6 presents our results, beginning with the baseline analysis in column 1, which

controls only for the round of the program, reviewer fixed effects, and reviewer-cross-round

characteristics. Adding gender-based interactions between applicants and reviewers in column 2

increases the magnitude of the applicant gender effect, which now reflects the scoring patterns of

male reviewers. Moving to column 3, we add topic-area fixed effects, which reduce the magnitude

of the gender gap by approximately ten percent. In column 4, we add publication characteristics,

which lead to only a marginal 3% further decline in the gender gap. In column 5, we add the

mechanism of repeat applications, which also explains only 3% of the gender score-gap. In column

6, we introduce a range of text-based controls such as word count, grammatical composition, the


11
  Indeed, in this specification, the sum of the baseline effect and the interaction is positive and significant, indicating
that female reviewers have an affirmative preference for female applicants, after controlling for text-based score
predictions derived from male applicants’ proposals.


                                                           21
rate of scientific words, and the grade level of proposal text; these measures offer only a 2%

decrease in the gender gap. Finally, in column 7, we control for word choice in the form of our

text-based score prediction; this eliminates over 50% of the remaining gender score gap, and

renders the overall disparity insignificant. Importantly, these controls do not reduce the interaction

effect that we find between female applicants and reviewers, suggesting that female reviewers are

not influenced by word choice in the same way as male reviewers. Thus, the main conclusion of

Table 6 is that the gender score-gap is driven in large part by the choice of words female applicants

use to describe their proposals; after controlling for this dimension, the disparity falls by more than

50% and is no longer statistically significant.

                                          TABLE 6 HERE

       D.      The Impact of Gender on Innovative Outcomes

So far, our results have focused on explaining the disparities in reviewer scores received by female

applicants. While this is inherently valuable as a means of identifying the underlying causes of the

lack of demographic diversity in innovative fields, it does not address questions related to

efficiency: does the lack of gender diversity in high-scoring applicants reflect an inefficient

disparity and unreasonable barriers, or is it a reflection of the fact that female applicants face

challenges that are likely to interfere with their performance, even if they were selected by

reviewers? To address these questions, we analyze ex-post outcomes for our sample of applicants,

looking specifically at publications, NIH grants, and Phase-2 outcomes within the GCE program.

Our results begin in Table 7, which focuses specifically on funded applicants: conditional on

funding, how did different demographic groups perform? This “treatment-on-treated” analysis is

meant to capture the organizational perspective: did the evaluation process select the strongest

applicants, regardless of demographic characteristics? We consider a wide range of outcomes, and

show that in most cases, the review process did indeed select a pool where there were no significant


                                                  22
differences between demographic groups. In particular, in columns 1 through 7, after controlling

for proposal scores and pre-period outcomes, we find no ex-post disparities in publication-related

outcomes across applicant gender. By contrast, in columns 8 and 9, we find (weak) evidence of

gender’s impact on innovative outcomes. Focusing on the outcome of NIH grants in column 8, we

find that female applicants are slightly more likely to obtain such grants in the post-proposal

period; we also find a large but insignificant point-estimate for the high-value R01 grants that

cover multiple years of research in column 9. Importantly, all specifications also control for word

choice, which has a different impact here relative to our earlier tables. Previously, we highlighted

that male applicants seemed to benefit in terms of reviewer scores by using general words more

often, while female applicants tended to use topic-specific words, which tended to lead to lower

reviewer scores. By contrast, Table 7 suggests that while using broad words may help obtain high

scores from reviewers, such proposals do not tend to perform as well in terms of ex-post outcomes.

In effect, reviewers may well be overly credulous to the broad claims of such proposals, which

tend to under-perform across multiple measures if selected for GCE funding.

                                         TABLE 7 HERE

The focus on the sub-sample of funded applicants is valuable, but it is not always the correct

perspective for evaluating the relationship between demography and innovation. While Table 7

captures the effectiveness of the selection process, it does not offer insight into the impact of

funding on the applicants in our sample. It may well be the case that some of the applicants

receiving funding would have done just as well without it, perhaps because of access to other

sources of money or support. To evaluate the causal impact of funding, we therefore need to

compare funded applicants against those who (just barely) did not receive funding. In Table 8, we

establish a difference-in-differences estimator by focusing on the sub-sample of proposals, which




                                                23
received positive reviews from at least one reviewer. Within this “high-scoring” sample, we

examine not only the baseline impact of funding, but also its differential impact across genders.

We begin our analysis in columns 1 and 2, focusing on all published articles and on articles

published in top journals,12 respectively. We find that while funding has only a weakly-positive

and insignificant impact on publications, there is a significant positive interaction between funding

and female applicants, particularly for top-journal publications. This suggests that Gates

foundation funding has a significantly greater impact when it is allocated to female applicants,

relative to male applicants. The reason for this difference seems to be driven in part by the negative

baseline effect for female applicants: without funding, they under-perform male applicants, and

this effect is once again stronger for top-journal publications. A similar pattern appears in columns

3 through 5, which track novelty and exploration by tracking new journals, coauthors, and MeSH

terms derived from applicants’ publications. In all three outcome measures, we find that the

baseline effect of being a female applicant is significantly negative, indicating that unfunded

women are likely to perform worse than unfunded men. However, we also find positive interaction

effects between funding and female applicants, leading to no significant difference across gender

between funded applicants. Once again, our difference-in-differences results come not from

funded women outperforming men, but from unfunded women significantly under-performing

unfunded men. In effect, securing funding from the GCE program can “level the playing field” for

female applicants, and generates a larger impact than the funding devoted to male applicants.

In line with our earlier results on the importance of funding, we turn to the results focusing on NIH

grants in columns 6 and 7. The overall pattern of results is similar in both cases, but the strongest

effects can be seen in column 7, which focuses on the coveted multi-year R01 grants. For this



12
  We define top journals as those in the top decile of impact factor. Our results are robust to redefining top journals
as either top-5% or top-25% by impact factor.


                                                         24
outcome, we see negative but insignificant baseline effects for female applicants. More

importantly, we find strong positive interactions between female applicants and GCE funding, with

the positive interaction effects more-than-compensating for the negative baseline impacts of

demographics. We can therefore conclude that female applicants’ careers are more responsive to

funding in this outcome dimension: the GCE program’s impact is most beneficial to these groups

when it leads them to obtain additional funding from the NIH, especially through its R01 program.

This implies that GCE funding can lead to a “multiplier effect,” where it allows successful

applicants to be more effective at raising external funding as their careers progress.

Finally, revisiting the impact of proposal text, we once again find that the use of broad and narrow

words, do not predict an increase in any of our ex-post outcomes. By contrast, the metric of

proposal text grade level, which did not predict reviewer scores in Tables 5C and 6, is now a

significant positive predictor of virtually all measures of follow-on innovation. This suggests that

while communication style does offer valuable information on the quality of applicants’ ideas,

reviewers are focusing on the wrong metrics when evaluating the innovative proposals in our

sample.

V.     Discussion and Conclusions

In this paper, we addressed two primary research questions: first, how can innovative organizations

become more diverse along the dimension of gender, and second, what are the potential impacts

on innovation from an increase in gender inclusion? By taking advantage of our unique empirical

setting and its blinded-review process, we were able to eliminate the direct effects of bias and

discrimination, and focus exclusively on the indirect mechanisms that contribute to the gender

disparities in our sample. Our main contributions are the identification of word choice as an

important driver of negative outcomes for female innovators, and the finding that women may


                                                 25
offer a greater return on an organization’s resources, in terms of future innovative outcomes. Our

findings suggest a number of important outstanding questions for future research.

First, our analysis of innovative outcomes only offers a limited duration of ex-post data following

GCE funding decisions, particularly for applicants in later rounds. In this timeframe, we saw

evidence that female applicants were able to obtain significantly more additional NIH funding as

a result of a successful application. While obtaining funding from the NIH or similar organizations

is not an end-goal by itself, this additional funding can be reasonably expected to serve as an input

to future research and innovation. While our sample period is too short to capture these dynamics,

allocating more resources to female innovators may well lead to improved career trajectories and

greater innovative output, especially over longer horizons. Indeed, if the findings in our sample

apply to the broader scientific and innovative communities, it is likely that female innovators are

systematically under-funded relative to the quality of their ideas. Future work could explore these

patterns across longer time horizons and in other stages of the innovation ecosystem.

Second, our text-based analysis focuses on the relatively straightforward measure of the presence

or absence of commonly-used words; a more sophisticated analysis of a larger sample would offer

the opportunity to identify detailed patterns in the types of words that either help or harm

evaluations, particularly for female innovators. Finally, we were unable to effectively explore

dimensions of diversity other than gender in our sample, due to low number of applicants in other

under-represented categories (e.g. racial minorities.) More work is needed to determine whether

our results are generalizable to other dimensions of organizational diversity. Thus, we would

encourage future research to look to other dimensions of diversity, such as ethnicity, national

origin, and socio-economic status, as key drivers of the innovative process.

Table 5B: Applicant Characteristics and Text-Based Score Predictions
The dependent variable is the fitted probability of an ordered-logit regression predicting a proposal score from reviewers, based purely on the words
contained in the proposal's title and description, and calibrated using only the proposals of male applicants. Specifically, the outcome variable predicts
reviewer scores based on the presence or absence of the 500 frequent words with the greatest impact on reviewer scores, further subdivided across words
with a positive impact ("high-scoring") and words with a negative impact ("low-scoring") on reviewer scores in specifications 4 and 5, and across broad and
narrow words (based on the standard deviation of word use across topics) in specifications 6 and 7.

Table 5C: Impact of Proposal Text on Reviewer Scores
This table takes the outcome variables for "broad" and "narrow" words from Table 5A and uses them to predict reviewer scores alongside the effect of being a female
applicant. Importantly, the text-based score predictions are calibrated based only on proposals from male applicants, and then calculated for all proposals based on the
presence or absence of the 500 frequent words with the greatest impact on reviewer scores in each proposal's title and description, sub-divided into broad and narrow words
based on the standard deviation of word use rates across topics.
