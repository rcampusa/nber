                                           ABSTRACT

       This paper develops a simple new methodology to test for asset integration and applies it
within and between American stock markets. Our technique is tightly based on a general
intertemporal asset-pricing model, and relies on estimating and comparing expected risk-free rates

across assets. Expected risk-free rates are allowed to vary freely over time, constrained only by the
fact that they are equal across (risk-adjusted) assets. Assets are allowed to have general risk

characteristics, and are constrained only by a factor model of covariances over short time periods.
The technique is undemanding in terms of both data and estimation. We find that expected risk-free
rates vary dramatically over time, unlike short interest rates. Further, the S&P 500 market seems to
be well integrated, and the NASDAQ is generally (but not always) integrated. However, the

NASDAQ is poorly integrated with the S&P 500.

1: Defining the Problem

           The objective of this paper is to propose and implement an intuitive and simple-to-use

measure of asset-market integration. What does asset-market integration mean? We adopt the

view that financial markets are integrated when assets are priced by the same stochastic discount

rate. More precisely, we define security markets to be integrated if all assets priced on those

markets satisfy the pricing condition:



         p tj = Et ( m t+1 x tj+1 )                                                                (1)




where: p tj is the price at time t of asset j, Et () is the expectations operator conditional on

information available at t, mt +1 is the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (MRS), for

income accruing in period t+1 (also interchangeably known as the discount rate, stochastic

discount factor, marginal utility growth, pricing kernel, and zero-beta return), and xtj+1 is income

received at t+1 by owners of asset j at time t (the future value of the asset plus any dividends or

coupons). We rely only on this standard and general intertemporal model of asset valuation; to

our knowledge this Euler equation is present in all equilibrium asset-pricing models.

        Our object of interest in this study is mt +1 , the marginal rate of substitution, or, more

precisely, estimates of the expected marginal rate of substitution, Et mt+1 . The MRS is the

unobservable DNA of intertemporal decisions; characterizing its distribution is a central task of

economics and finance. The discount rate ties pricing in a huge variety of asset markets to

peoples’ saving and investment decisions. The thrust of this paper is to use asset prices and

payoffs to characterize important aspects of its distribution.




                                                       1
        The substantive point of equation (1) is that all assets in a market share the same marginal

rate of substitution. There is no asset-specific MRS in an integrated market, and no market-

specific MRS when markets are integrated with each other. Learning more about the MRS is of

intrinsic interest, and has driven much research (e.g., Hansen and Jagannathan, 1991, who focus

on second moments). Measures of the expected MRS also lead naturally to an intuitive test for

integration. In this paper, we propose and implement such a simple test for the equality of Et mt+1

across sets of assets. This is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for market integration.



2: Methodology

        We use the fact that in an integrated market, the MRS prices all assets held by the

marginal asset holder. Indeed what we mean by asset market integration is that the same MRS

prices all the assets. In other words, if we could extract mt +1 (or rather, its expectation)

independently from a number of different asset markets, they should all be the same if those

markets are integrated. As Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) show, there may be many stochastic

discount factors consistent with any set of market prices and payoffs; hence our focus on the

expectation of MRS, which is unique.

        Consider a generic identity related to (1):



         p tj = Et ( mt+1 x tj+1 ) = COV t ( mt+1 , xtj+1 ) + Et (mt +1 ) Et ( x tj+1 ).                 (2)




where COVt () denotes the conditional covariance operator. It is useful to rewrite this as



        x tj+1 = −[1 / Et (m t +1 )]COV t ( mt +1 , x tj+1 ) + [1 / Et ( m t+1 )] ptj + ε t j+1 ,   or


                                                                   2
          x tj+1 = δ t ( p tj − COV t ( mt +1 , xtj+1 )) + ε t j+1                                         (3)




where δ t ≡ 1 / Et ( mt+1 ) and ε tj+1 ≡ xtj+1 − Et ( xtj+1 ) , a prediction error.

         We then impose two restrictions:



1) Rational Expectations: ε tj+1 is assumed to be white noise, uncorrelated with information

    available at time t, and

2) Covariance Model: COV t ( m t+1 , xtj+1 ) = β 0j + Σ i β i j f i, t , for the relevant sample,




where: β 0j is an asset-specific intercept, β i j is a set of I asset-specific factor coefficients and f i ,t

a vector of time-varying factors.

         With our two assumptions, equation (3) becomes a panel estimating equation. We

exploit cross-sectional variation to estimate {δ } , the coefficients of interest that represent the

risk-free return and are time varying but common to all assets. These estimates of the MRS are

the focus of our study. We use time-series variation to estimate the asset-specific “fixed effects”

and factor loadings {β } , coefficients that are constant across time. Intuitively, these coefficients

are used to account for asset-specific systematic risk (the covariances).

         Estimating (3) for a set of assets j=1,…,J0 and then repeating the analysis for the same

period of time with a different set of assets j=1,…,J1 gives us two sets of estimates of {δ } , a

time-series sequence of estimated discount rates. These can be compared directly, using

conventional statistical techniques, either one by one, or jointly. Under the null hypothesis of

market integration, the two sets of {δ } coefficients are equal.



                                                                     3
Discussion

        We make only two assumptions; both are conventional in the literature, though we rely

on them less than most of the literature. It seems reasonable to assume that expectations are

rational for financial markets, at least in our limited sense that asset-pricing errors are not ex ante

predictable at high frequencies. Our assumption that the asset-specific covariances (of payoffs

with the MRS) are either constant or depend on a small number of factors is more controversial,

but standard practice. Rather than develop our own factor model, we rely on the well-known

three-factor model famously deployed by Fama and French (1996). We defend it on two

grounds. First, in applications we maintain the covariance model for only two months at a time

(though we have tried shorter periods with similar results); Fama and French assumed that the

same model worked well for thirty years. Second, our results are insensitive to the exact factor

model. If our technique were sensitive to the factors used to model {δ } , then the measure would

be no more useful than any of the individual factor models. Indeed, if the measure were factor-

model sensitive, it would be preferable to use the factor model itself as the object of

measurement. Nevertheless we stress that we must rely on some model of covariances.

        While we focus on (3), there are other moments that would help characterize the MRS,

{δ } ; see e.g., Hansen and Jagannathan (1991). We concentrate on this one for four reasons.

First, as the first moment it is the natural place to check first. Second, it is simple to estimate.

Third, our estimates and results are robust to the factor model that conditions the measurements.

Finally, the measurements are discriminating for market integration, yet they confirm our prior

beliefs and previous research (e.g., Chen and Knez, 1995). In the examples below, our measure

never rejects internal market integration for portfolios of S&P stocks priced in the NYSE and



                                                       4
seldom rejects for portfolios priced on the NASDAQ, but rejects strongly – by an order of

magnitude – integration between NYSE and NASDAQ portfolios.

        Our methodology has a number of strengths. First, it is based on a general intertemporal

theoretical framework, unlike other measures of asset integration such as stock market

correlations (see the excellent discussion in e.g., Adam et. al. 2002). Second, standard asset-

pricing models are completely consistent with our methodology, and the exact model does not

seem to be important in practice. We use the Fama-French workhorse (which subsumes the

CAPM), but find that our results are insensitive to the exact choice of model. Third, we do not

need to model the MRS directly. The MRS need not be determined uniquely, so long as its

expectation is unique. Fourth, our strategy requires only two assumptions; we need not assume

e.g., complete markets, homogeneous investors, or that we can model “mimicking portfolios”

well. Fifth, the technique requires only accessible and reliable data on asset prices, payoffs, and

time-varying factors. Sixth, the methodology can be used at very high frequencies and at low

frequencies as well. Seventh, the technique can be used to compare expected discount rates

across many different classes of assets including domestic and foreign stocks, bonds, and

commodities. Next, the technique is easy to implement and can be applied with standard

econometric packages; no specialized software is required. Finally, the technique is focused on

an intrinsically interesting object, the expected marginal rate of substitution.



3: Relationship to the Literature

          The literature is clear that asset markets are integrated when identical cash flows are

priced equally across markets (e.g., Adam et. al., 2002 and Cochrane, 2001). This is the asset-

market version of economists’ trusty “Law of One Price.” But since no two different assets have




                                                       5
identical cash flows, the integration definition must be extended to be useful. The standard holds

two asset markets to be integrated when risks in those markets are shared completely and priced

identically. One way to make this definition operational requires identifying the relevant risks.

Roll and Ross (1980) recognized the dependence of integration measures on risk identification.

They tested asset integration using the argument that two portfolios are integrated only if their

implied risk-less returns are the same; our test is similar to theirs in spirit. This simple

observation is powerful because it invokes the cross-sectional dimension where every asset in an

integrated market implies the same risk-free return.

           The literature on asset-market integration has grown along two branches. The first

branch, based on parametric asset-pricing models, has been surveyed by Adams et. al. (2002),

Cochrane (2001), and Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997). Along this branch, a parametric

discount-rate models to used to price two asset portfolios. Pricing errors are compared across

portfolios. If the portfolios are integrated, the pricing errors should not be systematically

identifiable with the portfolios in which they originate. Roll and Ross (1980) tested market

integration this way using an arbitrage pricing theory model, and a large literature has followed.

           The second branch of literature grows from the work of Hansen and Jagannathan

(1991) and is represented by Chen and Knez (1995) and Chabot (2000). Along this branch, data

from each market are used to characterize the set of stochastic discount factors that could have

produced the observed data. Testing for integration across markets involves measuring the

distance between admissible MRS sets, and asking if, and by how much, they overlap.

        Our work rests on the first branch, since we use parametric models to condition our

estimation. It differs from previous work in four ways.




                                                       6
        First, we diverge from the finance profession in treating {β } as a set of nuisance

coefficients. Rather than being of intrinsic interest to us, they are required only to clear the way

to produce estimates of the MRS.

        Next, we do not measure integration by the cross-sectional pricing errors produced by a

particular mode; this approach seems relatively non-specific and model-dependent. Instead we

measure integration by the implied first moment of the stochastic discount rate (MRS). The

condition we study, therefore, is a necessary condition for integration. Studying it will be

valuable only if it is a discriminating condition; it turns out to be so.

        Third, parametric pricing models are often estimated with long data spans and are thus

sensitive to parameter instability in time series long enough for precise estimation (e.g., Fama

and French (1996); an excellent discussion is provided by Cochrane, 2001). We minimize (but

do not avoid completely) the instability problem by concentrating attention on a parameter that is

conditionally invariant to time-series instability. The measure we use is a free parameter,

constant across assets but unconstrained across time. Our measure is therefore basically cross-

sectional, that we estimate precisely using a short time-series dimension.

        Finally, we do not assume that (3) holds for the bond market, or that the bond market is

integrated with other asset markets. When applied to a bond without nominal risk (e.g., a

treasury bill), equation (1) implies



           1= Et (mt+1 (1+i t ))                                                                (1’)




where: i t is a risk-less nominal interest rate, and mt +1 is a nominal MRS. The tradition inside

finance is to assume that the MRS pricing bonds is the same for all bonds, and identical to that



                                                        7
pricing all stocks (and other assets). If we make this assumption, δ t ≡ 1 / Et (mt +1 ) = (1 + i t ) .

We do not impose this assumption; rather we test it (and reject) it.



4: Empirical Implementation

        We begin by estimating a model with asset-specific intercepts and the three time-varying

factors used by Fama and French (1996). In practice, we divide through by lagged prices (and

redefine residuals appropriately):



         x tj+1 / ptj−1 = δ t (( ptj / ptj−1 ) + β 0j + β 1j f 1,t + β 2j f 2, t + β 3j f 3,t ) + ε tj+1   (4)




for assets j=1,…,J, periods t=1,…,T. That is, we allow {δ t } to vary period by period, while we

use a “three-factor” model and allow {β j } varying asset by asset. We normalize the data by

lagged prices since we believe that COV t ( m t +1 , x tj+1 / ptj−1 ) can be modeled by a simple factor

model with time-invariant coefficients more plausibly than COV t ( m t+1 , xtj+1 ) . The three Fama-

French factors are: 1) the overall stock market return, less the treasury-bill rate, 2) the

performance of small stocks relative to big stocks, and 3) the performance of “value” stocks

relative to “growth” stocks. Further details and the data set itself are available at French’s

website.1 For sensitivity analysis, we also examine two other covariance models: one with only

a single time varying factor, namely the overall market return; and the other without any time-

varying factors at all (but, as always, with an asset-specific intercept).

        Equation (4) can be estimated directly with non-linear least squares. The degree of non-

linearity is not particularly high; conditional on {δ t } the problem is linear in {β j } and vice



                                                                     8
versa. We employ robust (heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent “Newey West”)

covariance estimators.

         We use a moderately high frequency approach. In particular, we use two-month spans of

daily data. Using daily data allows us to estimate the coefficients of interest {δ t } without

assuming that firm-specific coefficients {β j } are constant for implausibly long periods of time.

         Our empirical illustration examines the integration of American equity markets. Large

American stocks are traded on liquid markets, which we consider a priori to be integrated. We

begin by examining daily data over a quiet two-month period, April-May 1999 (about a year

before the end of the Clinton bull market).2 Two months gives us a span of over forty business

day observations; this does not appear to stretch our reliance on a factor model of asset

covariances excessively, while still allowing us to test financial market integration for an

interesting span of data. We see no reason why higher- and/or lower-frequency data cannot be

used.3

         Our data set is drawn from the “US Pricing” database provided by Thomson Analytics.

We collected closing rates for the first (in terms of ticker symbol) one hundred firms from the

S&P 500 that did not go ex-dividend during the months in question. The absence of dividend

payments allows us to set xtj+1 = ptj+1 (and does not bias our results in any other obvious way).

         We group our hundred firms into twenty portfolios of five firms each, arranged simply by

ticker symbol. We use portfolios rather than individual stocks for the standard reasons of the

Finance literature. In particular, as Cochrane (2001) points out, portfolios betas are measured

with less error than individual betas because of lower residual variance. They also vary less over

time (as size, leverage, and business risk change less for a portfolio of equities than any

individual component). Portfolio variances are lower than those of individual securities,



                                                      9
enabling more precise covariance relationships to be estimated. And of course portfolios are

what investors tend to use (especially those informed by Finance theory!).

        Our first sample period consists of 41 days. Since we lose the first and last observations

because of lags ( ptj−1 ) and leads ( xtj+1 ) , we are left with a total of 780 observations in our panel

data set (20 portfolios x 39 days). Our data has been checked for transcription errors, both

visually and with random crosschecking.

        There is no reason that one cannot use more data (longer spans at different frequencies,

for larger number of firms and/or portfolios grouped non-randomly). We choose this sample

(only two months of daily price data for one hundred firms grouped randomly into twenty

portfolios) deliberately to illustrate the power of our methodology and its undemanding data

requirements. However, we also check for sensitivity with respect to the sample below.



5: Results

        We start by splitting our 20 portfolios into two sets of 10 portfolios each (simply by

ticker symbol) to estimate discount rates (i.e., estimates of δ t ≡ [1 / Et (mt +1 )] ). We provide time-

series plots of the estimated deltas from the first 10 portfolios along with a plus/minus two

standard error confidence interval in Figure 1. We also include the point estimates of delta from

the second 10 portfolios, estimated in precisely the same way but using data from the last set of

10 portfolios.

        There are two striking features of the graph. First, the time-series variation in delta is

high, consistent with the spirit of Hansen and Jagannathan (1991). As shown in Table 1, the log

likelihood of our equation estimated on the first 10 S&P portfolios is 1160. In April-May 1999,

the US 3-month Treasury bill rate averaged 4.4%, a daily return of 1.00017 (with little time-



                                                       10
series variation). The log likelihood for the default equation estimated with 1.00017 substituted

in place of {δ t } is only 1059. Under the null hypothesis of deltas that are constant and equal to

the T-bill interest rate, 2*(1160-1059) is distributed as a chi-square with 39 degrees of freedom,

grossly inconsistent with the null at any reasonable confidence level. (When we use all 20

portfolios, the analogue is 2*(2309-2136), again grossly inconsistent with the null.) That is, the

hypothesis that the MRS is equal to the short t-bill rate is wildly inconsistent with the data. The

MRS seems much more volatile than short-term interest rates.

        Second, the estimates of delta from the two different sets of portfolios are similar; the

deltas from the second set of portfolios almost always lie within the +/- 2 standard error

confidence interval of the first estimate of delta. That is, the two different sets of delta are

usually statistically indistinguishable on any given day, consistent with the null hypothesis of

integration within the S&P.

        What about the two sets of delta examined jointly? The ocular evidence leads one to

believe that the two sets of deltas are broadly equal. The statistical analogue is contained in the

cells at the top left of Table 1. The log-likelihood of (4) estimated from the first set of 10

portfolios is 1160; that from the second set of 10 portfolios is 1166. When (4) is estimated from

all 20 portfolios simultaneously so that only a single set of {δ t } is extracted, the log-likelihood is

2309. Under the hypothesis of integration (i.e., the same {δ t } for both sets of assets) and

normally distributed errors, minus twice the difference in the log-likelihoods is distributed as a

chi-square with 39 degrees of freedom; a likelihood ratio (LR) test. The test statistic is 36,

consistent with the hypothesis of integration and normal residuals at the .61 confidence level.

        It is well known that asset prices are not in fact normally distributed; Campbell, Lo, and

MacKinlay (1997). Rather, there is strong evidence of fat tails or leptokurtosis, and this certainly



                                                      11
characterizes our data.4 Accordingly, we use a bootstrap procedure to estimate the probability

values for our likelihood ratio tests.5 The bootstrapped p-value for the test of integration is even

more consistent with the null hypothesis of integration at the .90 level.

        To check for sample sensitivity, we also consider five other sample periods: July-August

1999, October-November 1999, and the same three two-month samples for the bear market of

2002. Results from these other sample periods are also included in Table 1 and are also

consistent with the hypothesis of integration inside the S&P 500 at standard confidence levels.

        What about the NASDAQ market for smaller stocks? We follow exactly the same

procedures, but using data drawn from the NASDAQ market. We group (again on the basis of

ticker symbol) data from 100 NASDAQ firms into 20 portfolios of 10 firms each, and test for

equality of deltas (between the two different sets of deltas, estimated from the two sets of ten

NASDAQ portfolios) using likelihood ratio tests with bootstrapped p-values. The results are

presented in Table 2, and are generally consistent with the null hypothesis of integration inside

the NASDAQ. However, one of our samples (April-May 2002) is inconsistent with integration

at the .03 confidence level (this is marked with an asterisk), while integration is overwhelmingly

rejected for Oct-Nov 1999 (two asterisks), shortly before the collapse of the NASDAQ. We

think of these as intuitive, reasonable results, possibly consistent with the existence of “irrational

exuberance” manifest in the NASDAQ just around the height of the internet bubble.

        Still, the most interesting question to us is: Is the market for large (S&P 500) stocks

integrated with the NASDAQ? It is easy to ask the question by comparing {δ t } estimates when

(4) is estimated with: a) the twenty S&P portfolios; b) the twenty NASDAQ portfolios; and c) all

forty portfolios pooled together (which is most efficient if the two markets are integrated). Our

LR tests (with bootstrapped p-values) for this hypothesis are presented in Table 3 and are grossly



                                                      12
inconsistent with the null hypothesis of market integration. The LR test statistics are an order of

magnitude bigger than those of Tables 1 and 2. That is, while the S&P always seems integrated

and the NASDAQ is generally integrated, the S&P is never integrated with the NASDAQ. This

result is similar to that of Chen and Knez (1995).

        Time-series plots of {δ t } estimated from all (twenty) S&P and NASDAQ portfolios are

provided in Figure 2 for all six sample periods, along with confidence intervals. Figure 3

provides scatterplots of S&P deltas against NASDAQ deltas. All these graphs indicate that there

is no single obvious characteristic difference between the S&P and NASDAQ deltas.



6: Sensitivity Analysis

        Thus far we have relied on the Fama-French model of asset covariances. That is, the

covariance of each asset’s return with the MRS is characterized by four parameters: an intercept

( β 0j ) and factor loadings on the market return minus the T-bill rate ( β 1j ), the difference between

small and large stock returns ( β 2j ), and the difference between returns of stocks with high and

low book to market ratios ( β 3j ). Are our results sensitive to the number of factors used? It turns

out that the answer is negative.

        In Table 4 we provide test statistics (and bootstrapped p-values) to examine tests of

integration within the S&P and NASDAQ and between the two markets, but using only the

return on the market instead of the three Fama-French factors (while retaining the portfolio

intercepts as well). The test statistics and conclusions are essentially unchanged.

        Table 5 goes even further and drops the market factor from our covariance model,

leaving only portfolios-specific intercepts ( β 0j ) but no time-varying factors. Again, the results




                                                      13
are essentially unchanged. This robustness is encouraging since it demonstrates the insensitivity

of our methodology to reasonable perturbations in the exact factor model employed.



7: Summary and Conclusions

        This paper developed a simple method to test for asset integration, and then applied it

within and between American equity markets. It relies on estimating and comparing the

expected risk-less returns implied by different sets of assets. Our technique has a number of

advantages over those in the literature and relies on just two relatively weak assumptions: 1)

rational expectations in financial markets; and 2) covariances between discount rates and returns

that can be modeled with a small number of factors for a short period of time.

        We illustrated this technique with an application to stocks drawn from the S&P 500 and

the NASDAQ, and found that a) the time-series variation in the Marginal Rate of Substitution is

high; b) the S&P always seems to be integrated; c) the NASDAQ is usually (but not always)

integrated; and d) the S&P and NASDAQ do not seem close to being integrated. Our results

seem reasonably insensitive to the exact sample and conditioning model used.

        If our finding of integration within but not across stock markets holds up to further

scrutiny, the interesting question is not whether financial markets with few apparent frictions are

poorly integrated but why? We leave that important question for future research.

  We choose these months to avoid January (and its effect), February (a short month), and March (a quarter-ending
month), but test for sample sensitivity extensively below.
3
  For instance, we could use data at five-minute intervals for a day, making our assumption of constant asset-
specific effects even more plausible; but the question of whether financial markets are integrated over hours (not
weeks) is less interesting to us.

  Jarque-Bera tests are inconsistent with the null hypothesis for {ε} at all reasonable confidence levels.
5
  Our bootstrap procedure is as follows. We estimate the deltas from (say) all 20 portfolios under the null
hypothesis of integration. This gives us an estimate of {ε}. We then draw with randomly with replacement from
this vector to create an artificial vector of {ε} which we use to construct an artificial regressand variable {x}. Using
this artificial data we then generate a likelihood ratio test by estimating the model from the first set of 10 portfolios,
the second set of 10 portfolios, and the combined set of 20. We then repeat this procedure a large number of times
to generate a distribution for the LR test statistic.
