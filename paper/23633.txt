It's a Cruel Summer: Household Responses to Reductions in Government Nutrition Assistance

                                          ABSTRACT

The appropriate size and scope of government nutrition assistance programs is a regular source of
debate among policy-makers, and with calls to reduce government benefits, a clear understanding
of household responses to any proposed benefit reduction is critical. Exploiting the design of U.S.
nutrition assistance programs, we examine how low-income households reallocate their budgets
following an exogenous reduction in nutrition assistance benefits. The magnitude of our results
suggests that the budget for an average low-income household with children is severely inflexible
and likely unable to absorb more than a $2 to $3 reduction in nutrition benefits per child per
week.

1         Introduction
A variety of state and federal nutrition assistance programs are currently available for
U.S. households meeting the relevant eligibility criteria, including the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the National School Lunch Program (NSLP),
and the School Breakfast Program (SBP). The largest of these programs is SNAP,
formerly known as the Food Stamp Program. As of 2016, over 44.2 million individuals
participated in SNAP at a total estimated cost of approximately $71 billion.1 Additional
benefits may be available through WIC for households with infants, young children, and
pregnant or postpartum women, and households with school-age children (SAC) may
also have access to free or reduced-price school meals through the NSLP and SBP.
Collectively, across these and other nutrition assistance programs, spending in 2016
totalled nearly $100 billion.
        Many households participate in one or more programs concurrently, and as such,
policy changes in one program will naturally influence the effectiveness of other pro-
grams. For example, children of SNAP households automatically qualify for in-school
nutrition assistance programs (Hoynes & Schanzenbach, 2015). SNAP benefit levels
(or allotments) are also determined solely by household size and net income, and oth-
erwise unchanged within a given year. As a result, households with SAC who also
participate in SNAP will receive additional benefits via in-school nutrition assistance
programs during the school year, and these additional benefits are suspended during
the summer. Such households must therefore pay for additional meals with the same
SNAP allotments during extended school breaks.
        The current paper exploits this interaction between NSLP/SBP and SNAP in order
to identify household responses to reductions in the overall generosity of government
nutrition assistance programs. For example, how do households reallocate their budgets

when confronted with an increased (out-of-pocket) food burden? Can households absorb
a decrease in nutrition assistance benefits, or are budgets sufficiently constrained such
that there is little to no flexibility to maintain pre-existing food expenditures? In
answering these questions, our analysis contributes to the growing literature on the
effects of government nutrition assistance; however, rather than studying the extensive
margin effects of program participation, we are interested in the intensive margin of
changes in overall generosity of government nutrition assistance. We are also interested
in the overall household response across several expenditure categories rather than the
change in a single area of expenditures.
   Our analysis is based on data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE), which
allows for a longitudinal analysis of household expenditures. To exploit the exoge-
nous change in overall benefit generosity during the summer months and to identify
effects on the intensive margin, we must limit our sample to households participating
in NSLP/SBP and some other nutrition assistance program(s). Since the CE does not
provide data on NSLP/SBP participation directly, we limit our sample to SNAP-eligible
households with SAC and SNAP-participating households with SAC, as such households
are automatically eligible for NSLP/SBP. We estimate the effects of an increased food
burden during the summer months using standard fixed effects (FE) regression models
as well as fractional multinomial logit (FMlogit) models, the latter of which account
for the inherent correlation in expenditure shares across different categories for a given
household (Papke & Wooldridge, 1996; Mullahy, 2011). We also consider the influence
of potential misreporting of SNAP participation with a Monte Carlo study in which
SNAP-eligible households who do not report receiving SNAP benefits are randomly
assigned as SNAP participants.
   We find significant increases in the share of household budgets spent on food at
home during the summer. This effect exists for all households with SAC, but the largest
effects occur for SNAP-eligible or SNAP-participating households. Among such house-
holds, we also estimate large reductions in expenditure shares on entertainment and


                                            3
“other” expenditures. Collectively, the results comport with standard economic theory,
wherein an exogenous reduction in nutrition assistance generosity leads to a reduction
in expenditures among relative luxury goods (in this case, entertainment and “other”
expenditures) and an increase in expenditures on food at home. However, the magni-
tudes of these effects are small, with less than a $2 per child per week increase in food
expenditures at home during the summer months. Assuming that SNAP households are
attempting to cover the cost of meals that would otherwise be provided through school
meal programs, the small magnitude of this effect suggests that households cannot fully
recover the cost of school meals from a reallocation in household budgets. Indeed, $2
per child per week falls well below the USDA’s estimated minimum cost per week of a
nutritious diet for a school-age child (over $30 per week),2 and similarly below the $25
per child per week value of school breakfast and lunch programs (Almada & Tchernis,
2015).
      While access to summer meal programs may help offset a reduction in benefits
experienced during the summer, programs such as the Summer Food Service Program
have historically only reached 17% of children participating in NSLP/SBP.3 Households
must instead absorb the benefit reduction through some other means. Recent research
from Moffitt & Ribar (2016) suggests a form of intra-household nutritional transfers,
by which the oldest children forego meals in order for younger children to maintain
some level of food security. Households may also rely more heavily on debt in the form
of credit cards or payday loans. For example, a 2012 survey from the Pew Charitable
Trusts found that 69% of households using payday loans did so for a recurring expense,
with 5% explicitly using the loan for food purchases.4 The nature of our CE data do not
allow a complete characterization of these different mechanisms; however, the magni-
tude of our estimated coefficient for expenditures on food at home is consistently small
across a variety of specifications, which we interpret as evidence of a largely inflexible

budget wherein households likely cannot maintain comparable levels of nutrition during
periods of reduced government nutrition assistance.
       Our analysis offers three important contributions to the existing literature and pol-
icy discussion. First, our results are not limited to a single government program but
instead reflect responses to an overall reduction in generosity of benefits across possibly
several nutrition assistance programs. As suggested in Millimet et al. (2010), nutrition
assistance programs do not operate in a vacuum, and examining the isolated effect of
a single program may offer misleading results.
       Second, understanding how benefit levels (as opposed to program participation) af-
fect overall household expenditures is highly relevant to current policy. For example, a
recent Institute of Medicine report calls for “further research examining food security
and access to a healthy diet among program participants and estimating the impact
of SNAP benefits on these outcomes” (Caswell et al., 2013). Our contribution to this
literature is threefold: 1) causal estimates are more cleanly identified due to exogenous
variation in benefit generosity induced by school breaks; 2) we consider other areas of
household consumption that may also be affected when food budgets are (exogenously)
tightened or loosened;5 and 3) we estimate the response to a decrease in benefit gen-
erosity, which is arguably most relevant given current policy debates. Although our CE
data do not allow a direct analysis of food security, our analysis of budget shares and
household expenditures has implications for a household’s ability to provide a healthy
diet following a reduction in nutrition assistance.
       Third, our analysis contributes directly to our understanding of SNAP-eligible and
SNAP-participating household behaviors during summer months. As has been estab-
lished in the literature, participation in NSLP/SBP tends to reduce food insecurity
(Gundersen et al., 2012), and conversely, food insecurity rates are higher and health
   5
    Prior studies in this area focus largely on changes in food expenditures following an increase in
SNAP benefits. In their survey article, Fraker (1990) estimate that households increase food expen-
diture by up to $0.47 on average for every dollar of SNAP benefits received. This upper bound has
largely persisted in future work (Fox et al., 2004).



                                                 5
outcomes lower for children during the summer (Nord & Romig, 2006; Franckle et al.,
2013; Baranowski et al., 2014). Policies attempting to resolve these issues are actively
being considered. For example, a recent USDA pilot program (Summer Electronic
Benefit Transfer for Children) was specifically developed to test effects of increases in
benefit levels among relevant SNAP households during summer break. But the full
effects of these policies naturally depend on how households reallocate budgets during
the summer months.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the
relevant literature and provides additional details on the structure of SNAP as well as
school breakfast and lunch programs. We discuss our data in Section 3, with econo-
metric methods and results in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.



2     Background and Identification Strategy
Identification of the effects of SNAP and other programs is typically complicated due
to endogenous and potentially misreported SNAP participation. We avoid these issues
by: 1) exploiting exogenous changes in nutrition assistance levels due to the underlying
design of U.S. nutrition assistance programs (specifically SNAP and SBP/NSLP); and
2) focusing on effects on the intensive margin among existing program participants.
Specifically, we focus on SNAP-eligible and SNAP-participating households with SAC,
which are automatically eligible to receive up to two free meals per day as part of
the NSLP and SBP. We define “SNAP-eligible” as households with incomes below
185% FPL. Such households, even if not SNAP participants, are also eligible to receive
free or reduced-price school meals. Notably, receipt of these additional food resources
during the school year does not impact the amount of SNAP benefits allotted to these
households.
    The SBP, established as a temporary program by the Child Nutrition Act of 1966
and permanently authorized in 1975, is a federally funded program administered by in-


                                           6
dividual states and overseen by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).6
The program initially provided categorical grants to schools and was replaced with a
per-meal subsidy in 1973. For 2014-2015, participating schools received a federal cash
subsidy of $1.62 per free breakfast, $1.32 per reduced-price breakfast, and $0.28 per
paid breakfast.7
       The NSLP was officially established by the National School Lunch Act of 1946,
although similar efforts have been in place since the Great Depression. Like the SBP,
the NSLP provides federal support for school lunches; however, the NSLP includes both
commodity support as well as a federal cash subsidy. In 2014-2015, schools received a
cash subsidy of $2.98 per free lunch, $2.58 per reduced-price lunch, and $0.28 per paid
lunch. Schools may also adopt a universal free breakfast and lunch program under the
Community Eligibility Provision (CEP).8 Funding levels are further increased by $0.02
per meal if a school’s NSLP participation rate exceeds 60%, with additional support if
the meals meet certain nutritional guidelines.
       Under both the SBP and NSLP, students are eligible for free or reduced-price meals
if their family incomes are below 130% of the FPL or between 130% and 185% of the
FPL, respectively, and children of SNAP-participating households are automatically
eligible for free school meals without any additional application or verification.9 For
some sense of the monetary values of school meals, Almada & Tchernis (2015) estimate
that school meals can increase household food budgets by approximately $100 per child
during a typical month in the school year. Comparatively, Nord & Prell (2011) and
Beatty & Tuttle (2015) each examine variations in SNAP benefits following the 2009

      Our discussion of the SBP and NSLP is adapted largely from Hoynes & Schanzenbach (2015).
   7
      Per-meal payments are $0.31 higher if a sufficiently high percentage of the school’s population is
eligible for free breakfasts.
    8
      Details of a school’s eligibility for CEP are discussed in Hoynes & Schanzenbach (2015). Im-
portantly, schools seeking eligibility through the CEP must provide free breakfast and lunch to all
students.
    9
      Although SNAP-participating households are automatically eligible to receive free school meals,
it is feasible that not all such households necessarily participate in NSLP/SBP. Nonetheless, Bartfeld
(2013) reports that 90% of school-age children who receive SNAP benefits also participate in NSLP,
with 72% participating in both NSLP and SBP.



                                                   7
American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA), which increased SNAP benefits
by approximately $80 per month for a family of four. The monetary value of meals
provided by school breakfast and lunch programs therefore far exceeds the temporary
increase in benefits legislated by the ARRA.
       Since SNAP households are automatically eligible for SBP and NSLP, the presence
of school breaks acts as an exogenous (albeit anticipated) change in nutrition assistance
benefits among SNAP-participating households with SAC. We exploit this exogenous
reduction to identify the intensive margin effects of government nutrition assistance.
Our focus on the intensive margin is similar to that of Almada & Tchernis (2015); how-
ever, they rely on variation in the proportion of SAC within households as a proxy for
variation in SNAP benefit levels. Our identification strategy instead exploits variation
in benefits during summer break, without a need for changes in household demograph-
ics.



3        The Consumer Expenditure Survey
Our data are drawn from multiple waves of the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE)
spanning 1996-2014. The CE is a two-component nationally representative sample of
the U.S. civilian non-institutional population administered by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics that provides detailed information on the spending behavior of all members
of a household who make joint spending decisions, or consumer units (henceforth re-
ferred to as households). We use data from the Interview Survey (IS) component, which
is a quarterly survey designed to collect information on relatively large expenditures,
such as housing, transportation, major durable goods, and other categories of expen-
ditures over the past three months. The CE consists of a rotating panel of over 7,000
households interviewed for five consecutive quarters. In addition to information on ex-
penditures, the CE also collects data on household socio-demographic characteristics
including household size, number of children in the household, age of the respondent


                                            8
and of the children in the household, indicators for race, gender, marital status, current
employment status, and household income, as well as the respondent’s level of educa-
tion. Lastly, the CE collects information on household welfare program participation,
including SNAP receipt.
       We are specifically interested in the longitudinal aspect of the quarterly Interview
Survey. The five consecutive quarterly interviews consist of an initial intake survey
primarily used to collect household demographic characteristics as well as up to four
additional surveys used to collect information on household expenditures. We use
these follow-up quarterly surveys to construct a panel of expenditure categories for
each household. We use the month of interview to identify households that report
expenditures during summer and non-summer quarters. For example, we can identify
household expenditures during the months of May, June, and July by examining survey
interviews conducted in the month of August. Similarly, households interviewed in
September report their expenditures for the past three months (that is, expenditures
during June, July, and August). The benefit of the longitudinal aspect of the CE data
is that it allows us to compare expenditures for the same household during periods
when children are mostly attending school to periods when children are mostly out of
school.
       Table 1 provides demographic summary statistics for the full sample and four sub-
samples of CE respondents who were observed during both summer and non-summer
quarters. In this setting, the full sample (column 1) corresponds to all respondents
who were interviewed in August (summer consisting of May, June, and July) and at
least one non-summer quarter.10 Our four subsamples include: (1) households with
school-age children (SAC); (2) households with SAC who were at or below 185% of
the federal poverty line (FPL) over the entire panel; (3) households with SAC who

    For some schools, particularly in the north, summer break extends from mid-June to early Septem-
ber. However, summer break for most schools in the south and west begins in late May or early June
and extends through early or mid-August. Including August as a summer month generates significant
spikes in Education expenditures during the summer, which suggests that school-age children of most
households in our sample returned to school in August.


                                                 9
reported participating in SNAP over the entire panel; and (4) households who reported
participating in SNAP and who were at or below 185% FPL over the entire panel.
Although the low-income sample (at or below 185% FPL) includes many households
who are not receiving SNAP benefits, school-age children from households at or below
185% FPL are eligible to receive reduced-priced school meals, and school-age children
from households at or below 130% FPL are eligible to receive free school meals. Note
also that our measure of household income incorporates all sources of income, including
SNAP benefits. Not surprisingly, we note from Table 1 that low-income households
with SAC and SNAP households with SAC have lower incomes, larger households with
more children, are more likely to be headed by a female, are non-white, and are less
educated compared to the full sample of households or all households with SAC.


                                         Table 1


   Our study considers several categories of quarterly household expenditures cover-
ing both food and non-food related goods and services. Specifically, we construct the
following ten categories of expenditure: (1) Food at Home (which includes SNAP expen-
ditures); (2) Food away from Home; (3) Education and Enrichment; (4) Entertainment;
(5) Housing; (6) Utilities; (7) Transportation; (8) Health Care; (9) Alcohol and Tobacco;
and (10) All Other Expenditures. Table 2 provides a more detailed description of each
expenditure category.


                                         Table 2


   Tables 3 and 4 provide seasonally-adjusted household expenditure and budget share
summary statistics, respectively, for each of the ten expenditure categories. Note that,
since our identification strategy exploits the summer school break as an exogenous
change in generosity of government nutrition benefits, we cannot adjust for seasonality
simply by including indicator variables for each season in our overall regression analysis.

                                            10
As an alternative, we form seasonally adjusted expenditures from a first-stage regression
of expenditures on fixed effects for each season, which we estimate using non-SNAP
eligible households. We then adjust observed expenditures for all households (including
SNAP households) net of these predicted seasonal effects, which reflects a seasonally
adjusted expenditure level. We perform this process separately for each of the ten
categories of expenditures.


                                        Table 3


   In dollars of expenditures, we observe that low-income households and SNAP house-
holds spend less across all expenditure categories compared to all households with SAC.
We also observe small decreases in expenditures on food at home among households with
SAC, but small increases among SNAP-participating households. Expenditure on edu-
cation and enrichment is significantly higher during summer months for all households
with SAC, but lower among low-income households. Similarly, spending on entertain-
ment is significantly lower during the summer for low-income and SNAP households,
while the full sample of households with SAC spends significantly more on entertain-
ment during the summer versus non-summer.


                                        Table 4


   In terms of budget shares, Table 4 shows a significantly higher share of house-
hold budgets spent on food at home among SNAP-participating households relative
to all other households, with similar relative differences on shelter, utilities, and edu-
cation/enrichment. Conversely, “other” expenditures constitute a much larger budget
share among all households with SAC relative to low-income and SNAP-participating
households. Differences between summer and non-summer months are also more pro-
nounced when examining budget shares versus raw expenditures. Here, we observe
increases in the expenditure share of food at home during summer versus non-summer

                                           11
across all sample groups, with particularly large increases for low-income and SNAP
households. Conversely, the expenditure share for food away from home decreases dur-
ing the summer for all groups considered. We also observe a significant decrease in the
share of expenditures on entertainment for low-income and SNAP households, with a
significant increase among all households with SAC.



4      Effects of Benefit Generosity on Expenditures
We are broadly interested in the effect of changes in nutrition assistance benefits on the
distribution of expenditures for a household. To estimate this response more formally,
we first consider several fixed effects models with expenditures or budget shares as our
outcome of interest. This analysis treats each category of expenditures separately but
easily accommodates unobserved, time-invariant household factors. We then extend this
analysis to allow for the inherent correlation across categories of expenditure shares;
however, incorporating household fixed effects into this analysis is less straightforward.
Details of these estimators and the results are discussed throughout the remainder of
this section.


4.1    Fixed Effects Analysis

Denoting our outcome of interest by yit , our fixed effects regression models are of the
form
                               yit = βxit + γbit + νi + εit ,                         (1)

where xit denotes a vector of time-varying household characteristics, νi represents a
household fixed effect, and bit denotes an indicator variable set to 1 if the expenditures
cover summer months and 0 otherwise. We estimate equation 1 separately for each
category of household expenditures, where we classify summer expenditures as those
during the months of May, June, and July (bit = 1 if individual i was interviewed in


                                            12
August).11
       Estimates of γ for expenditure in dollars (logged) and budget shares are presented
in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.12 In both tables, column 1 presents results among all
households with school-aged children (SAC), column 2 reflects results among households
with SAC and with incomes below 185% of the FPL, results specifically for SNAP
households with SAC are presented in column 3, and column 4 further restricts the
sample to SNAP households also with incomes below 185% of the FPL. All of our
regressions include controls for age, household size, number of children (0-17 years of
age), employment status, logged income and logged income squared, as well as year
indicators. Standard errors are clustered at the household level.


                                              Table 5


       The results examining seasonally-adjusted logged expenditures (Table 5) reveal sta-
tistically insignificant increases in food at home expenditures during the summer across
all samples. Although statistically insignificant, this estimated effect increases dramat-
ically as we consider low-income households (1.1% increase), SNAP households (2.9%
increase), and low-income SNAP households (3.9% increase). We also find that expendi-
tures on education and enrichment decrease substantially across all sample groups, with
particularly large decreases for SNAP households (decreases from 21% to 19%). Ex-
penditures on entertainment fall by 5.9% for low-income households and by nearly 15%
for SNAP households during summer months. Interestingly, we find that alcohol and
  11
      An alternative analysis could consider all households with an interaction between SNAP partici-
pation and summer months. This type of analysis, however, is subject to at least two central concerns:
1) SNAP participation is known to be heavily misreported, and we can mitigate to some extent the
effects of misreporting by focusing our analysis solely on SNAP households; and 2) in a fixed effects
setting and since the timing of treatment does not vary across individuals, estimates for this inter-
action term would only be identified for those who participate in SNAP during the summer and the
pre or post-summer quarter but who also switch SNAP status throughout the year. Our identifica-
tion strategy therefore complicates the interpretation and generalizability of an analysis based on the
full sample, and we instead focus our analysis separately on SNAP households and other subsamples.
Results based on SNAP “switchers” are nonetheless available upon request.
   12
      Estimates based on non-seasonally-adjusted expenditures and budget shares are presented in the
supplemental appendix.


                                                  13
tobacco expenditures increase by almost 10% during summer months for low-income
households (double that of all households with SAC), but find an insignificant negative
effect among SNAP households. Finally, we find that expenditures on utilities increase
across all groups, with larger increases among the lower income samples.


                                        Table 6


   Based on our fixed effects analysis of expenditure shares (Table 6), we find that the
share on food at home significantly increases during summer for low-income and SNAP-
participating households. Specifically, the share spent on food at home increases by 0.38
percentage points for low-income households and 0.84 percentage points for SNAP-
participating households. Similar to the logged expenditure results, we find that food
away from home expenditure share decreases for all households with SAC, although
this is imprecisely estimated among SNAP households. In regards to education and
enrichment expenditure share, the results are somewhat mixed, with a relatively large
and statistically significant increase among all households with SAC (0.20 percentage
points) and among SNAP households with SAC (0.26 percentage points), but with much
smaller magnitudes in the other samples. Regarding entertainment, the results show
a significant increase in budget share of 0.17 percentage points among all households
with SAC, with a significant decrease of up to 0.52 percentage points among SNAP-
participating households with SAC. We also find statistically significant increases in
the share of expenditures devoted to utilities, increases in expenditure shares on health
(although insignificant among SNAP-participating households), and large decreases in
shares on “other” expenditures.
   Collectively, our fixed effects analysis suggests that SNAP-participating households
with SAC must make significantly larger adjustments to their budgets during the sum-
mer months relative to other households with SAC (even other low-income house-
holds). In particular, expenditures on food at home dramatically increase among SNAP-
participating households, funded by a large reduction in entertainment and “other”

expenditures.


4.2    Fractional Multinomial Logit Analysis

Naturally, budget shares for a household are related across categories, as an increase in
one share requires a decrease in some other share(s). To more formally accommodate
this interdependency across shares, we estimate the effects of interest using a fractional
multinomial logit (FMlogit) model (Papke & Wooldridge, 1996; Mullahy, 2011). De-
noting household i’s budget share on the kth category of expenditure at time t by sikt ,
we assume

                                                      exp (zit βk )
                   E [sikt |zit ] = ξkt (zit ; β) = PK                 , and          (2)
                                                     m=1 exp (zit βm )

                        E [sikt |zit ] = 1, ∀t,                                       (3)
                    k=1


with the identifying normalization, βK = 0. Here, zit denotes a vector of household
characteristics including xit and bit from equation 1. Importantly, the FMlogit spec-
ification accommodates the requirement that shares across all expenditure categories
must sum to one, with no restrictions that individual shares be strictly non-zero or less
than one. Denoting by s∗ikt the observed budget shares, the resulting quasi-likelihood
function is

                                      i=1 t=1 k=1

   Results are presented in Table 7. Coefficient estimates are relative to the “shelter”
expenditure category and therefore difficult to interpret, both in terms of sign and mag-
nitude. We therefore present estimated effects from a discrete change in non-summer to
summer (at mean values of other covariates) in brackets. Similar to a linear probabil-
ity model, the estimates in brackets are interpreted as the predicted percentage point
change (in hundredths) in the share of a given category of expenditure. For example, the



                                              15
estimate of 0.007 for “Food at Home” among SNAP-participating households implies
that SNAP-participating households increase the share of their budget spent on food at
home by 0.7 percentage points during the summer. On a base of 23%, this represents
a 3% increase, similar to our initial findings when examining logged expenditures in
Table 5. This is funded in-part by a large and significant reduction in entertainment,
with SNAP-participating households reducing the budget share in this area by between
0.6 and 0.7 percentage points (or nearly 17%), as well as a large but statistically in-
significant reduction in “other” expenditures of between 0.4 and 0.6 percentage points
(or nearly 5%).


                                         Table 7



4.3    Fractional Multinomial Logit Net of Fixed Effects

Note that our estimation of β in equation 4 is essentially a pooled cross-sectional analysis
as it is infeasible to remove individual fixed effects via conditioning on the sum of
outcomes over time as in, for example, a fixed effects logistic model. In order to better
exploit the CE panel structure within the FMlogit model, we consider an additional
analysis that intuitively accommodates household-specific, time-invariant factors with a
two-step estimation process. In step one, we estimate the standard fixed effects model
as reflected in equation 1. From this, we obtain predicted values of the individual
fixed effects for each expenditure category, denoted ν̂ik , and we re-estimate the FMlogit
models including ν̂ik as an independent variable for each person and each expenditure
category.
   Results based on this additional analysis are summarized in Table 8 and largely sup-
port our initial FMlogit analysis. With regard to expenditure share on “food at home,”
the magnitude of the estimated reduction during the summer is largely unchanged
at 0.7 percentage points among SNAP-participating households, although these esti-
mates are less precisely estimated relative to Table 7. The magnitude of reduction in

                                            16
entertainment expenditures is also similar. Notable differences between these results
and our initial FMlogit estimates include the magnitude of the change in expenditures
on health and the change in “other” expenditures. Specifically, we now estimate a
large and significant increase in expenditures on health of 0.7 percentage points among
SNAP-participating households compared to 0.4 percentage points in FMlogit results
without fixed effects, along with a decrease of 1 percentage point (though statistically
insignificant) in other expenditures.

4.4    Influence of Misreported SNAP Participation

A common concern in this literature is the potential misreporting of SNAP partici-
pation. Since we focus our analysis on SNAP-participating households, rather than
including SNAP participation as a treatment indicator, our analysis is not subject to
misreported treatment as in Almada et al. (2016); however, misreported participation
may still introduce some selection bias since we limit the sample only to reported SNAP
participants. To examine the sensitivity of our findings to such misreporting, we con-
sider a Monte Carlo study in which we randomly assign SNAP-eligible households as
SNAP participants. Specifically, we assume that some portion of SNAP-eligible house-
holds misreport their SNAP participation status, stating that they do not participate
in SNAP when in fact they do participate. We then simulate a new set of SNAP par-
ticipants, consisting of all reported participants and some percentage, ρ, of additional
SNAP-eligible households. We consider values of ρ ranging from 10% to 100% in 10%
increments. The results offer some evidence as to the sensitivity of our estimates to
potentially misreported SNAP participation.
   For each value of ρ, we simulate 200 samples of SNAP-participating households,
and we re-estimate our fixed effects and FMlogit models for each simulated sample.
Denoting each individual sub-sample by k, we form our point estimate as the simple

                                          17
average across all M = 200 simulations,

where V̂β̂k denotes the estimated variance of β̂ within each kth sub-sample, and B̂M

   Results of our fixed effects analysis for household expenditures are summarized
in Table 9, with results of our FMlogit analysis for budget shares in Table 10. Ex
ante, we expect our initial results to be larger in absolute value if households who
report SNAP participation are the neediest (or most likely to benefit) households among
the SNAP-eligible group. Trends in our estimated coefficients for food at home are
consistent with this expectation, where the estimated increase in the expenditure shares
(Table 10) slightly decreases in magnitude as we allow for increasing prevalence of
misreporting. When allowing for misreporting, we therefore conclude that the true
increase in expenditures on food at home is likely smaller than originally estimated,
although still positive and statistically significant based on the FMlogit results.

5     Conclusion
This paper identifies the intensive margin effects of nutrition assistance benefits on
household expenditures by exploiting two specific aspects of government nutrition as-
sistance programs: 1) children in SNAP households are automatically eligible for school
breakfast and lunch programs; and 2) such school meals are necessarily unavailable dur-
ing extended school breaks. Based on data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey,
we then estimate the effects of interest by comparing expenditures in summer versus
non-summer months, with a focus on SNAP-participating households with SAC.
    Our fixed effects and FMlogit results are consistent in that we find significant in-
creases in expenditures on food at home during the summer among SNAP-participating
households relative to other households. These increases appear to be funded through
a reduction in entertainment and “other” expenditures. Households that do no partici-
pate in SNAP may still receive free or reduced-price school meals. Our results among all
low-income households suggest qualitatively similar effects, albeit of lesser magnitude,
relative to SNAP participants.
    The results suggest at least three possible avenues by which SNAP-participating
households absorb the reduction in benefits. First, since the timing of the reduction
in nutrition assistance benefits is known, SNAP-participating households may save in
advance in order to smooth food consumption during the summer break. Such savings
may derive from earned income tax credits (EITC) or other rebates received after a
household files their taxes; however, the literature in this area suggests that a large
portion of EITC is used relatively soon after receipt, rather than saved (Barrow &
McGranahan, 2000). Moreover, saving behavior or a similar argument that households
overconsume food during the school year is inconsistent with the growing evidence
documenting increased food insecurity among children during the summer.
    Second, due in part to the temporary nature of the reduction in benefits, households
may receive additional support during the summer in the form of local assistance pro-



                                           19
grams or other family/neighborhood support. For example, the USDA’s Summer Food
Service Program was designed specifically to offset a reduction in benefits experienced
during the summer; however, for the bulk of our time period covered in our analysis,
this program reached just 17% of children participating in NSLP/SBP.
      Third, households may not have sufficient flexibility in their budget to absorb a
meaningful reduction in nutrition assistance benefits, in which case households simply
do not consume the equivalent food supply during the summer as they did during the
school year. While we cannot definitively rule out any of these explanations, the low
average income of SNAP-participating households suggests that some combination of
additional summer support and overall reduction in food consumption likely occurs.
      Combining our regression coefficients with observed expenditure levels, we estimate
that SNAP households with SAC increase expenditures on food at home by less than
$15 per month on average. With between 2 and 3 children per household (see Table
1), this amounts to less than $2 per child per week. For some context, the USDA
estimated $32 per week to feed a 6-8 year old child in a household of 4 as part of its
thrifty food plan (TFP) in July 2014.13 The USDA describes the TFP as providing “a
representative healthful and minimal cost meal plan that shows how a nutritious diet
can be achieved with limited resources” and is based on national dietary guidelines,
food prices paid by low-income households, and data on food consumption and nutrient
content.14 Relatedly, Almada & Tchernis (2015) estimate the value of SBP/NSLP to be
$25 per child per week. If households are attempting to cover the cost of meals otherwise
provided by school meal programs, then the magnitude of our estimates suggests that
SNAP households are spending well below the minimum requirements for a nutritious
diet and well below what would be required to fully compensate for the value of school
meals.
      If we instead assume that 50% of the food burden previously covered by school meal

programs could be provided through other local programs and family/neighborhood
support, the average household would still be responsible for around $12 per child per
week. Our estimate of a $2 increase per child per week in food expenditures therefore
remains well below the required increase in expenditures to compensate for the absence
of school meals. With these statistics in mind, the magnitude of our estimates is at least
suggesting of limited flexibility in household budgets among SNAP participants with
SAC, and are consistent with the rise in food insecurity among children and low-income
households during the summer (Nord & Romig, 2006; Franckle et al., 2013; Baranowski
et al., 2014). From a policy perspective, our results call for a more comprehensive view
of federal nutrition assistance and highlight the difficulty of low-income households to
adjust to piecemeal policy changes.
