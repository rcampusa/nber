                                               ABSTRACT

Medical practitioners typically utilize the following protocol when advising pregnant women about
testing for the possibility of genetic disorders: Pregnant women over the age of 35 should be tested
for Down syndrome and other genetic disorders; for younger women, such tests are discouraged since
they can cause a miscarriage. The logic appears compelling. The rate at which amniocentesis causes
a miscarriage is constant while genetic disorders rise over a woman’s reproductive years. Hence the
potential benefit from testing – being able to terminate a fetus with a genetic disorder – rises with maternal
age. We argue that this logic is incomplete. While the benefits to testing rise with age, so do the costs.
While undergoing an amniocentesis always entails the risk of miscarriage of a healthy fetus, these
costs are lower at early ages, because there is a higher probability of being able to replace a miscarried
fetus with a healthy birth at a later age. We develop and calibrate a dynamic model of amniocentesis
choice to explore this tradeoff. For parameters that characterize realistic age patterns of chromosomal
abnormalities, fertility rates and miscarriages following amniocentesis, our model implies a falling,
rather than rising, rate of amniocentesis as women approach menopause.

1.     Introduction
        Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) are methods of diagnosing Downs

Syndrome and other genetic disorders. Amniocentesis and transabdominal CVS involve inserting

a thin hollow needle through a pregnant woman’s abdomen to remove fetal cells from the

amniotic sac (amniocentesis) or from around the chorionic villi (CVS). 1 Microscopic

examination of the chromosome size and banding patterns of these fetal cells allows medical

laboratories to identify and arrange each of the 24 different chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes

and one pair of sex chromosomes) (a karyotype), which then serves as a tool in the diagnosis of

genetic diseases. An extra copy of chromosome 21 in a karyotype identifies Down syndrome the

most common genetic disorder (National Center for Health Statistics, 1994).

        Children with Down syndrome suffer from general hypotonia (poor muscle strength and

elasticity), mental retardation, growth retardation, and are at significant risk for congenital

malformations of which heart problems are the most common. While some therapies are

available for specific malformations there are no proven therapies available to treat the cognitive

problems associated with Down syndrome (Dick, et al., 1996). In developing countries, life

expectancy for children with Down syndrome is approximately 35 years (Brazil) but advances in

medical treatment for specific conditions has increased life-expectancy in the U.S. to

approximately 55 years. 2 The lifetime economic cost of Down syndrome is estimated at

$410,000 per child based on U.S. cross-sectional data from 1988 (Waitzman, Romano &

Scheffler, 1994). This of course greatly underestimates the full cost to families which include

 Transcervical CVS involves inserting a thin tube through a woman’s vagina and cervix to the villi, and using
suction to remove a small sample of fetal cells. The risks involved in transcervical and transabdominal CVS are the
same and equally prevalent. For a concise discussion of CVS methods and risks, see

maternal depression and difficulties with marital and sibling relationships (Dick, et al., 1996).

Down syndrome accounts for about half of chromosomal abnormalities detected by karyotyping.

Spina bifida (an incompletely enclosed spinal cord) and anencephaly (the absence of a large part

of the brain and skull) are two less common but more fatal genetic disorders detected by

amniocentesis and CVS.

         Both CVS and amniocentesis provide very accurate diagnosis of Down syndrome in a

fetus, greater than 99%. However, both have important risks that a pregnant woman must

consider. The amniocentesis procedure results in a spontaneous miscarriage for 1 in 100 to 1 in

200 women and the CVS procedure carries an even greater risk of procedure-related fetal loss

(between 1% and 1.5%). 3 And while the fraction of pregnancies afflicted with Down syndrome

and other genetic disorders rises with maternal age, even at age 49 the vast majority of

pregnancies will prove to be chromosomally normal. What this means is that when

amniocentesis induces the loss of a fetus, the mother almost always looses a fetus that would

have developed into a healthy child.

         The current standard in obstetric practice is to recommend that women pregnant at age 35

or older have an amniocentesis or CVS but this is not recommended for pregnant women prior to

that age. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the College of Medical

Genetics and the Canadian Task Force on Periodic Health Examination all agree that a woman

who is pregnant and is 35 years old or older should be tested using either amniocentesis or CVS.

The recommendations for women who are pregnant and younger than age 35 varies, but

generally either the “triple marker” test or no test at all is recommended. 4 Using age 35 as an age

 The “triple marker” test is a screen of a pregnant woman’s blood for particular proteins and is an alternative to
amniocentesis and CVS. While this test carries lower medical risks, it is far less accurate and typically it detects only

to start testing is based on a compelling, but we argue, incomplete logic. Figure 1 graphs the

estimated number of fetuses afflicted with a chromosomal abnormality per 100,000 pregnancies

by maternal age. Figure 1 also displays an upper and lower bound estimate on the number of

fetuses lost for every 100,000 amniocenteses performed. It is clear that prior to ages 35-38 more

healthy fetuses would be lost from performing amniocentesis on all women than would be the

number of chromosomally abnormal fetuses detected. It is further argued that, after age 35-38,

when chromosomal abnormalities rise rapidly, the rate of successful detection of rate

chromosomal abnormal fetuses via amniocenteses exceeds the incidence of miscarriages

resulting from administering this procedure. It is the latter claim (and accompanying evidence)

that has led the medical profession to adopt age 35 as the threshold age for recommending

genetic testing to patients.

                                              Figure 1 here

        Economists have criticized this threshold-age approach. For example, Sicherman,

Bombard and Rappoport (1995) (SBR hereafter) point out that this approach makes sense from

an expected utility theory viewpoint only if the utility loss from a miscarriage due to having an

amniocentesis equals the utility gain from avoiding bearing and raising a Down syndrome child.

Clearly, women (parents) may differ with respect to how they value the “pain and loss”

associated with miscarrying a fetus, on terminating a pregnancy through abortion, and on how

they value having additional children, including the relative utility gained from a healthy child

versus one born with a chromosomal abnormality. SBR argue that a woman’s individual costs

and benefits of each outcome can be combined with the probabilities of those outcomes to better

aid women in their choice.


60% of Down syndrome fetuses. Some doctors will perform amniocentesis on women who test positive on the
“triple marker” test. Because of the extremely high false positive rate others will not use the test at all.

       Like SBR, this paper relies on an expected utility approach but differs from SBR in an

important way. While SBR set the expected utility model in a static context, our paper

concentrates on the dynamic decisions inherent in family planning. Specifically, we model a

woman’s choice about amniocentesis for a particular pregnancy within her lifetime choices over

the quantity and quality of children.

       There is a long tradition in demography that recognizes the importance of the outcomes

for one child or one pregnancy on future choices about childbearing. For example, demographers

have extensively studied changes in fertility in response to infant mortality, especially in

developing countries (Shultz, 1969, 1976; Ben-Porath, 1976; Preston, 1978; Sah, 1991; Wolpin,

1997). In our model, a procedure-induced miscarriage is viewed as in utero “infant mortality”

but women can partially control this risk by their decisions of whether or not to have an

amniocentesis. In particular, by not undergoing an amniocentesis, a woman can limit the risk of

this form of infant mortality. At the same time, by not having an amniocentesis, she increases her

chances of bearing a child with Down syndrome or another genetic disorder. In making her

genetic-testing choice, a woman is always cognizant that she can replace a miscarried fetus, with

some probability, at later ages. However, this option decreases as a woman approaches

menopause. As a result, the “cost” of an amniocentesis rises with maternal age. This is the key

different between our model and static expected utility models. In particular, the static model of

SBR implies that women will always have a rising propensity to choose to undergo an

amniocentesis because of her desire to avoid having a child born with a genetic disorder. In our

dynamic model, this propensity may or may not rise with maternal age, precisely because women

must balance the benefits associated with having an amniocentesis (avoiding having a child with

a genetic disorder) with the costs of such procedures (running the risk of a procedure-induced




                                                4
miscarriage of a healthy fetus).

       The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out a dynamic model

of amniocentesis. We show that if the rate of Down syndrome were constant over maternal age,

it would be optimal, in the sense of maximizing expected utility, for women to elect an

amniocentesis at younger ages rather than at older ages. Since genetic disorders do rise with

maternal age, this result makes clear that how the optimal choice changes with maternal age will

depend on the rate of increase in genetic disorders relative to the rate of decrease in the

probability of replacing a child lost by a procedure-induced amniocentesis. After laying out how

the rates of amniocentesis vary by age and birth parity in U.S. data in Section 3, we then solve

more realistic models, using numerical methods and plausible parameter values, to determine

what the age pattern of amniocentesis choice might look like under reasonable biological

parameters. The results of these simulations are presented in Section 4. Some implications of our

simple model are strongly rejected by the data. For example, the data shows a clear jump in

amniocentesis rates at age 35, the age threshold used by medical practitioners. However, other

implications of the model are consistent with the data in Section 3, including: (a) a decline in

amniocentesis rates as women approach the end of their reproductive years, (b) a higher rate of

amniocentesis for lower parity children at most maternal ages, and (c) a larger drop in

amniocentesis rates for lower parity children as a woman reaches menopause. Section 5 provides

concluding observations.


2.    Modeling Amniocentesis Choice
2.1   The Elements of a Dynamic Model

       Consider a model in which women, at each age t, t = 1,…,T, become pregnant. We treat

pregnancies as biologically (and exogenously) determined, occurring with probability pt, 0 < pt <



                                               5
1. Age T+1 is the age of menopause, after which woman’s probability of conception is zero (i.e.,

pT+1  0). Pregnant women confront three sequential choices at each age at which they are

fecund. First, a pregnant woman may choose to abort the fetus, prior to any genetic testing. Let

this choice be denoted by CtA , where CtA is either equal to Abort or ~Abort. Second, conditional

on not choosing to initially abort her pregnancy, a woman chooses whether or not to have a test,

, for a genetic disorder, i.e., an amniocentesis. Let this choice be denoted by Ct ~ A , where Ct ~ A

is either equal to Amnio or ~Amnio. We assume that the outcome on an amniocentesis ( = + or -)

is always accurate. Third, conditional on not initially aborting and having a positive test, women

choose whether or not to abort the fetus. Let Ct
                                                       A  &~ A
                                                                     denote this choice, where Ct
                                                                                                     A   &~ A
                                                                                                                    is

either equal to Abort or ~Abort. Those women who do choose to have an amniocentesis, Ct ~ A =

Amnio, may experience a (spontaneous) miscarriage, with probability m, 0 < m < 1. If the mother

chooses not to undergo an amniocentesis, the pregnancy will end in a normal birth with

probability q and a birth with a genetic disorder with probability (1-q). If she undergoes the

procedure, the result of the test will be negative (no genetic abnormalities) or positive with the

same probabilities (q and 1-q). The probability of a genetic disorder, (1-q), varies with the

woman’s age.

        The above set of actions and probabilistically-occurring events result in a set of potential

outcomes at each age. In particular, women may have: a normal birth at age t, denoted by nt = 1;

a birth with a genetic disorder (Down syndrome), denoted by dt = 1; a miscarriage, denoted by mt

= 1; an abortion, denoted by at = 1; or no pregnancy, which is (implicitly) recorded by nt = dt =

mt = at = 0. Let the cumulative values, or “stocks,” of these outcomes as of age t be denoted as Xt

= Xt-1 + xt, where X = N, D, M, and A correspond to the outcomes x = n, d, m, and a.




                                                   6
                   An essential feature of our model is that children, regardless of their type, are enduring

goods. Furthermore, a couple’s other choices may have long run consequences. As such, we

assume that parent’s instantaneous utility, ut, is a function of the accumulated choices and

outcomes. Furthermore, couples will differ on the utility value of each of these. For example,

some couples may get as much utility from a Down child as a healthy child, and other couples

(women) may face a large utility cost of abortion while other women face none. These

differences in tastes are known to a couple but are unknown to the econometrician. We model

the instantaneous utility function as the sum of the utilities derived over the accumulation of each

pregnancy event. That is, 5

where i = Present Discounted Disutility of the ith abortion;  iD = Present Discounted Utility of

the ith Down child;  iN = Present Discounted Utility of the ith healthy child; and i = Present

Discounted Disutility of the ith miscarriage. For example, the first healthy child will bring utility

 1N for every age after conception. Even though a woman can only conceive between t=1 and

t=T, we assume that a woman will enjoy the utility from a child forever. 6

                   We assume a couple (woman) will make their (her) decisions between t=1 and t=T,

looking to maximize their (her) expected lifetime utility function:

                                             T
              max                      U    s 1Es  us  .

                                s 1




5
 This specification of the utility function is quite general. We do not require that gains and losses have a symmetric
effect on parents’ (mother’s) utility. In particular, our specification can allow for forms of loss aversion.
6
  More generally, we only require that all fertility-related events of the same type (healthy, Down, abortion or
miscarriage) generate a flow of utility for the same number of periods, regardless of the age at which they were
experienced. For example, children can be enjoyed for many years, whereas the effect of abortions and miscarriages
could last for only a few periods.



                                                                 7
The additive separability of the utility function allows us to express the dynamic programming

problem in terms of the Present Discounted Utility (PDU) that will be enjoyed over the lifetime

from a particular event. That way, at each age, a woman’s contemporaneous utility is defined by

the decisions she takes (which affect the probabilities of the different outcomes) and the PDU

associated with each outcome (which depend on the state variables, Dt, Nt, Mt and At).

            The dynamic programming problem can then be written as

the woman’s decision problem at age t is illustrated as a decision tree in Figure 2.) Notice that

the probabilities are age dependent because some of the parameters, like the probability of

having a child with Down syndrome (qt), are age dependent. We assume that  iD   iN , for all

births, i.e., having a healthy child is always preferred to having a child with Down syndrome,

and that i  0 and i  0 , for all births, i.e., abortions and miscarriages are never utility-

enhancing.

2.2    A Simplified Version of the Model

        In this section, we consider a simplified version of this more general dynamic model to

illustrate the sorts of implications that it can generate. Assume, for now, that a woman desires

only one child. Assume that  1N = 1,  1D  1, and 1 = 0, 1 = 0, i.e., an abortion or a miscarriage

have no utility loss, a normal birth is normalized to a utility value of 1 and less utility is derived

from Down syndrome child than a healthy child (but utility could be positive or negative). It

follows that ut ( Dt  0, N t  0, M t , At ) = 0 prior to a woman’s first birth. At the time of a first

birth, a woman’s utility is either ut ( Dt  0, N t  1, M t , At ) = 1, if the child is healthy, or

ut ( Dt  1, N t  0, M t , At ) =  1D  1, if the child is born with Down syndrome. As the woman

desires only one child, we can assume that after the birth of her child a woman receives her

discounted utility payoff and then dies. If she does not have a child by age T (the age of

menopause), her utility is zero. Finally, for now, we assume that m, q, and p do not vary with

maternal age. While many of these simplifying assumptions are either unrealistic or factually

inaccurate, they allow us to simplify a woman’s fertility decision-making problem. For example,

it follows immediately from the above assumptions that in our simplified model we can abstract



                                                   9
from the choice of whether to abort a pregnancy prior to genetic testing ( CtA = Abort). 7 We

consider the two remaining choices and describe how this simplified model can be solved

recursively.

Last Stage, Age T

            Consider the last stage of the woman’s decision problem, at age T, after which she can no

longer become pregnant. Figure 3 displays the decision tree for this age. We first consider the

                                                                                   A   &~ A
abortion decision, given a positive outcome on an amniocentesis ( Ct                             ) and then determine

her optimal amniocentesis decision rule.

                                                      Figure 3 here

If a woman has had an amniocentesis, avoided a procedure-induced miscarriage and then tested

positive for Down syndrome, the woman will abort the pregnancy if the value of a Down

syndrome child is negative, since the only issue is whether a child afflicted with Down syndrome

will produce positive utility to the woman. Thus, it follows that the optimal abortion choice at

age T is characterized by the following decision rule:

    A   &~ A
                    Abort if  1D  0
C                                       .                                                                       (7)

    T                                D




            Given a value of  1D , a woman will know whether she will abort should she be faced with

a fetus with a genetic disorder and can make a choice at age T on whether to undergo

amniocentesis. If  1D  0, we know that the woman will not abort. We also know she will not

undergo an amniocentesis; doing so generates no present benefits (she will not abort if she tests

positive) and entails the risk of miscarriage. In contrast, a woman with  1D < 0 would abort a

 Since the choice to abort after genetic testing is available, and since abortion carries no disutility, a woman will
never abort prior to genetic testing if  iN > 0.

            1 q 

which is that level of utility, as of age T, at which a woman is indifferent between having an

amniocentesis and aborting if it tests positive and not having an amniocentesis. Thus,  T* is the

critical (utility) value that characterizes the optimal decision rule for a woman’s amniocentesis

choice at age T:

   ~A     Amnio if  1D   T* ,
CT                               .                                                             (11)
           ~ Amnio otherwise.

Note that it is possible that some women will decide to forgo an amniocentesis, even though

having a Down syndrome child would reduce their utility, i.e.,  1D < 0. This could occur because

while having an amniocentesis allow a woman to avoid having a Down syndrome child with

certainty, having the test comes with the risk of losing a healthy child due to a miscarriage.

           Before moving to age T-1, notice that the choice over amniocentesis only occurs among

women pregnant at T. Therefore, as of age T-1, the payoffs at age T are expected to be

                 
E uT  1D   T*  p ( q  (1  q) 1D )

and

depending on the relationship between a woman’s utility from having a Down syndrome child,

 1D , and its critical value  T* as of age T.

Choices at Age T-1

             Figure 4 displays the decision tree for a woman at her next-to-last fertile age, T-1. At this

age, women still have choices they can make when they reach age T and these potential actions

have option value as of age T-1. Recall that at age T any woman with  1D   T* would have an

amniocentesis and, hence, would abort a pregnancy that tested positive for a chromosomal

abnormality. Because the costs of amniocentesis rise with age – while the benefits will not so

long as q is constant – and the utility associated with not undergoing an amniocentesis is constant

                                                  ~A              A   &~ A
in this version of our model, 8 it follows that CT 1 = Amnio and CT 1        = Abort when  1D   T* .

If  1D   T* , the optimal abortion decision rule, at age T-1, for a woman who tests positive is

given by:

reach age T without a child and become pregnant at age T. Therefore,

Choices at Age T-2 and Arbitrary Ages T-s

          Continuing with this recursive solution strategy at age T-2, recall that at age T-1 any

woman with  1D   T* 1 would have an amniocentesis and hence abort a pregnancy that tested

positive for a chromosomal abnormality. Again, because the costs of amniocentesis rise with age

while the benefits do not (when q is constant), this immediately implies that CT ~2A = Amnio and

Abort for  1D   T*  s 1 . At age T-2, for  1D   T* 2 , the abortion decision rule for women who test

Predictions for the Simplified Model

              What are the dynamic patterns of choices, especially with respect to amniocentesis,

predicted by this simple model? Given the form of the decision rule for a woman’s

amniocentesis choice at any age T-s in (21), how amniocentesis choice varies with maternal age

depends upon how  T*  s varies with age, given the single-crossing property of (21). Therefore,

                             q 
when s=0 (at age T),  T* =       ( m) and as t  T (as a woman approaches menarche),
                            1 q 

 T*  s  1 . That is, our simplified model implies that all young women would choose to undergo

an amniocentesis and that the incidence of amniocenteses should decline monotonically with age.

              Clearly, the above prediction with respect to how amniocentesis varies with maternal age

is inconsistent with the advice given by the medical community. But how does it compare with

the pattern for observed life cycle patterns of amniocenteses? To address this issue, and to


                                                       15
determine what features of our more general model of amniocentesis choice need to be modified

to “fit the data,” we present, in the following section, evidence on the empirical relationship

between amniocentesis and age.


3.        Empirical Regularities on Amniocentesis and Maternal Age
           To investigate the relationship between age and amniocentesis, we use data from the

Detailed Natality Files (DNF) from the National Center for Health Statistics. The DNF include

all births occurring within the United States. Beginning in 1988, for nearly every state, both

congenital anomalies and a woman’s use of amniocenteses during pregnancy are recorded. 9

While some twenty-two congenital anomalies are recorded, many are not genetic in origin. 10 In

what follows, we concentrate on the data for three anomalies that are routinely discovered by

amniocentesis: spina bifida, Down’s syndrome, and “other chromosomal anomalies.” These

anomalies comprise more than half of all genetic disorders associated with newborns.

           The benefit of the DNF is that it is a census of births in the U.S. and provides sufficient

sample size to study choices of women pregnant at older ages. One potential issue is that this is a

sample of live births only and hence Down’s syndrome fetuses that are aborted do not appear in

the sample. However, it is possible to estimate the fraction of pregnancies for which

amniocentesis is performed from the sample of live births.

           From the DNF, we can obtain the following statistics:

            N rtBirth =       Total number of births of parity r occurring to women of age t;



9
  The following states did not record amniocentesis on a significant percentage of State Birth Certificates (between
1990 and 1994): Connecticut (16.6%), Maryland (20.4%) and Oklahoma (35.0%). The following states did not
record at least one of the three abnormal conditions of the newborn on a significant percentage of State Birth
Certificates: Rhode Island (20.08%), Connecticut (26.5%), Maryland (33.21%), Oklahoma (42.49%), New York
(92.07%), and New Mexico (100%).
10
     These include central nervous, cardiac, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal.



                                                            16
           N rtBirth & Amnio = Total number of births of parity r preceded by an amniocentesis occurring
                               to women of age t;

and

           N rtBirth &~Amnio  N rtBirth  N rtBirth & Amnio .

The rate of amniocenteses conditional on live births is defined to be:

                                N rtBirth & Amnio
Pr  Amniort brt  1                            ,                                                                 (22)
                                     N rtBirth

where brt = 1 indicates a live birth of birth order r to a woman of age t.

          For our purposes, we are interested in the rate of amniocentesis conditional on

pregnancies and only on “relevant” pregnancies. In particular, an amniocentesis is not a relevant

choice for a woman who would elect to abort a pregnancy, without regard to its genetic status, or

for a woman who has a naturally occurring miscarriage prior to the amniocentesis choice. 11 We

term relevant pregnancies as those that are wanted and viable and define them to include: (a)

pregnancies ending in births that are not preceded by an amniocentesis ( N rtBirth &~Amnio ); (b)

pregnancies resulting in births that are preceded by an amniocentesis ( N rtBirth & Amnio ); (c)

pregnancies followed by an amniocentesis that was positive and was aborted ( N rtAmnio & Abort ); and

(d) pregnancies followed by an amniocentesis that was negative but which induced a miscarriage

( N rtAmnio & Miscarry ). It follows that the total number of wanted and viable pregnancies is equal to

N rtW  N rtBirth&~Amnio  N rtBirth & Amnio  N rtAmnio & Abort  N rtAmnio & Miscarry
       N rtBirth&~Amnio  N rtAmnio qt (1  m )  N rtAmnio (1  qt )  N rtAmnio qt m ,                           (23)
       N rtBirth&~Amnio  N rtAmnio


11
  There are a variety of estimates for the rate of fetal loss by gestational age. Taylor (1969) estimates the rate of loss
(per 1000 pregnancies) by gestational age is approximately 28 (<7 weeks), 45 (8-11 weeks), 20 (12-15 weeks) and
less than 10 after the 15th week. Taylor’s estimates imply that 72% of miscarriages occur prior to week 16 of
pregnancy. Amniocentesis is not performed prior to week 16.



                                                                     17
where (1-qt) is the rate of chromosomal abnormalities at age t, m is the rate of miscarriage

induced by the amniocentesis procedures, and N rtAmnio is the number of amniocentesis procedures

performed. The substitutions of N rtAmnio qt (1  m) for N rtBirth & Amnio and N rtAmnio (1  qt ) for

N rtAbort & Amnio in the second line of (23) follow from invoking the following rational choice

assumption: women who test positive for a chromosomal abnormality will always choose to

abort their fetuses, while women who test negative will always choose to bring their fetuses to

term. The DNF suggests that it is very rare that a woman give birth to a Down syndrome child

after receiving amniocentesis.12 Finally, we substitute N rtAmnio qt m for N rtAmnio & Miscarry in (23) to

reflect the fact that technical problems can cause an amniocentesis to end in a miscarriage at the

rate m.

          It follows that the rate of amniocenteses conditional on wanted and viable pregnancies is

given by

  Among the live births that were reported to have Down syndrome between 1990 and 1994, 9.5% were preceded
by an amniocentesis, while 90.5% were not.

where N rtBirth & Amnio and N rtBirth &~Amnio are obtained from the DNF and we derive values for qt and m

from medical studies.

         Clearly, the rates in (25) may vary by more than just a woman’s parity (r) and age (t). For

example, these rates may vary by her education or race. For example, because Down’s syndrome

children are time intensive, one might expect that more educated women, who tend to have

higher market-based opportunity costs of time, have higher rates of amniocentesis than less

educated women. Further, more educated women may differ in the likelihood of becoming

pregnant by birth parity and age, i.e., women having a first birth late in life are likely to have

high levels of education. To deal such factors, one can calculate separate rates by these

demographic characteristics. Alternatively, one can “hold constant” other covariates when

calculating (25) by weighting one group to mimic the distribution of covariates of another. For

example, we might standardize all of our age-specific estimates to the educational distribution

for women who have a first birth at say age 21 in order to hold education constant across age.

Then our standardized (by education) age-specific estimate of the rate of amniocenteses would

be

         Figure 5 plots Pr Amniort pWrt  1 for maternal ages 20 to 48 and for first through fourth

parities. Several interesting patterns emerge from this Figure. First, regardless of parity, the rate

of amniocentesis is near zero for women under the age of 35, but there is a steep rise in the rate

of amniocentesis after that age for all parities. Second, the increase in rate of amniocentesis is

larger the lower the parity of the child. Finally, while amniocentesis rates rise until a woman

reach her mid-forties, they begin to decline after that age and they drop more precipitously for

lower parities (first through third) than higher (fourth) parities. In particular, between the ages of

46 to 48, the rate of amniocentesis drops from 31% to 20% for first births, from 28% to 14% for

second births, and from 45% to 23% for third births. In contrast, there is very little decline in the

corresponding rates for fourth births over this same age range.

         These age and parity patterns in rates of amniocentesis may be the result of changes in

the composition of women across these groups. As noted above, women having a first birth at

age 20 are likely to be less educated than those having their first birth at age 40. One easy way to

account for this compositional effect on these rates is to condition, non-parametrically, on the

                                                                           
educational attainment of women. Figure 6 plots Pr Amniort pWrt  1 for maternal ages 20 to 48

and for first through fourth parities for women whose highest level of educational attainment was

a high school diploma. What is clear is that the patterns described for all women persist although

the differences in the rates at any age across parity are reduced. Figure 7 plots

  Blacks, Hispanic, Others and Whites make up 11.0%, 11.6%, 6.0% and 72.4% of this population respectively.

Again, for the first through third children, the patterns remain.

                                                 Figure 6 here

                                                 Figure 7 here

        In summary, the data on the rate of amniocentesis in Figures 5 through 7 display the

following patterns:

   Almost no women undergo an amniocentesis prior to age 35.
   The rate at which women undergo the procedure rises rapidly after age 35, rising more the
    lower the child parity.
   At every parity, the rate of amniocentesis declines as a woman approaches the end of her
    reproductive years.

Presumably, the first and second of these patterns are heavily influenced by the “rules” that

health care providers and insurance companies follow with respect to what ages they advise

women to have an amniocentesis and the age-related restrictions that health care providers and

insurers place on the reimbursements of this procedure that were noted in the Introduction. But it

is less clear how to account for the third pattern, namely, that the incidence of amniocenteses by

birth parity decline towards the end of woman’s reproductive lives.

        As we already have seen, a simple version of a life cycle model of optimal amniocentesis

choice appears to be inconsistent with the first two of the above life cycle patterns observed in

the data for amniocenteses, although it does tend to characterize the third one. In the following

section, we consider the life cycle patterns that are generated by more complicated versions of

our dynamic model, examining how the model’s predictions concerning life cycle variation in

the likelihood of having an amniocentesis change as we vary the rate of discounting, the utility

costs of abortions and miscarriages and with age-variation in the rates of genetic disorders, such


and 40.3% respectively of this population respectively. 85.6% of this population is married. Figure 7 is constructed
through regression adjustments and then equation (25) is applied. In future versions of this paper these will be
constructed entirely non-parametrically.

as displayed in Figure 1. We contrast these predictions with those generated by a myopic model

of amniocentesis choice, exploiting the fact that such a model arises as a special case of our

dynamic model under the case where the future is completely discounted (i.e.,  = 0.0) when

women (couples) make their childbearing and amniocentesis decisions.


4. Varying Features of the Model and Tracking the Observed Dynamic
   Patterns of Amniocentesis Choice
           In this section, we examine how changes in the various features of our dynamic model of

amniocentesis choice affect our ability to “replicate” the age patterns found in the data on the

incidence of amniocenteses described in the preceding section. We pay particular attention to

contrasting our dynamic model with the special case in which women are myopic with respect to

these choices, i.e., do not take full account of the future in making their choices. In this

exploration, our goal is not to fit our model to data in a statistical sense. Rather, our goal is to see

whether our model, and its underlying features, is rich enough to characterize the dynamic

patterns of amniocentesis choice outlined above. We proceed by plugging in values for the key

parameters (or rates) for the model in Section 2 in an attempt to “calibrate” the model, assessing

how well we mimic the dynamic patterns of amniocentesis choice at different ages by plotting

how the critical value,  t* , for  1D varies with age. 14 To simplify our analysis, we normalize the

value of a (chromosomally) healthy child to one (  1N = 1), and specify the following parameters

of the model to be age-invariant and equal to the following values: annual pregnancy rate (p) to

0.3 and the rate of procedure-induced miscarriage (m) to 0.0067 (1/150). We then explore how

varying the following parameters affects  t* and thus the incidence of amniocenteses with age:


14
     That is, the incidence of amniocenteses at a woman’s age, t, is given by Pr( 1D   t* ) in decision-rule (21), where
 1D is treated as a random variable with a known distribution.



                                                             22
(i) the discount rate (); (ii) the utility cost of an abortion (); (iii) the utility cost of a

miscarriage (); and (iv) the rate of genetic disorders (Down syndrome) (q), where for the latter

parameter we consider specifications in which q is assumed to be age-invariant and to vary with

age as in Figure 1. 15

        The results of this exploration of our model are displayed in Figures 8 through 12.

Consider first the role that discounting plays in affecting the dynamic pattern of  * , and, thus,

the incidence of amniocenteses. Figure 8 displays how  * varies with age assuming that the rate

of genetic disorders associated with births is age-invariant (i.e., qa = q for all a) and there are

zero (utility) costs of abortions and miscarriages (i.e.,  =  = 0). Consider first the values for  *

when  = 0.0, i.e., the “myopic” model. In our characterization of the myopic model, a woman is

assumed to not take account of the possibility of “replacing” a current pregnancy with a future

pregnancy in her decision to get amniocentesis because she completely ignores the future.

However, we do assume that a woman takes account of the “durable” nature of children and of

abortion and miscarriage costs in making her childbearing, amniocentesis and abortion decisions,

via the “payoff values”  D ,  and . That is, we assume that women still take account of the

PDU she receives from her child and the PDU associated with any abortion or miscarriage she

experiences.

                                                Figure 8 here

        As can be seen in Figure 8, the value for  * at early ages increases—and thus the


15
   An annual rate of pregnancy of 0.3 is consistent with data from the Hutterites. The average number of births to
fecund women in this population is approximately 11. In our simulations, we use this age-invariant rate, despite
clear evidence that pregnancy rates tend to fall over time (see, for example, Leridon, 2008). Allowing for a
monotonically declining pregnancy rate with maternal age would tend to exacerbate the life-cycle effect, i.e. as
women approach menopause without having reached the desired family size, the disutility from an amniocentesis-
induced miscarriage would be greater as the probability of becoming pregnant again would be declining over time.



                                                       23
probability of having an amniocentesis increases, as we move from the myopic version of the

model to the two variants of the Dynamic Model ( = 0.50 and  = 0.95). This increase reflects

the “option value” of knowing about the genetic status of a fetus at early ages. When, in the

Dynamic Model, the future is taken into account in decision-making, forward looking women

have an incentive to learn about the genetic status of a fetus precisely because they realize that

they have the option of aborting such a fetus if the amniocentesis is positive and replacing that

fetus in the future. Women under the Myopic Model do not consider this option and, thus, have

no greater incentive to have an amniocentesis at early ages than they do at older ages. Note, too,

that the less a woman discounts the future—i.e., comparing the results for  = 0.95 with those for

 = 0.50—the greater is this incentive to have an amniocentesis at early ages. Finally, as women

age, there is no change in the value of  * under the Myopic model, but this critical value

declines with age under either specification of the Dynamic Model. Furthermore,  * converges

to the same value under all three specifications at age T, the end of the woman’s reproductive

life. This convergence follows from the fact that the decision rule at age T is identical under both

the Dynamic and Myopic model, since there is no future at that age.

       In addition, this decline in  * with age under the Dynamic specification reflects another

force within our model. As noted above, the higher the  1D (and  1N ), the greater the desire of

women to have a child, even if it is one that has Down syndrome. As women approach the end of

their reproductive careers, their incentive to have a child increases under the Dynamic

specification. As a result, childless women have an incentive to avoid actions that further

postpone births. This includes undergoing an amniocentesis, since the latter procedure is

assumed to increase the likelihood that a woman experiences a miscarriage. Thus, as one

approaches T, forward-looking women will have less incentive to undergo an amniocentesis in


                                                24
order to reduce the risk of a miscarriage, which would further postpone their chances of having a

birth prior to menopause. Note, that this age-dependent incentive is not present in the Myopic

model, precisely because it does not have women (couples) be forward looking when making

their choices over the life cycle.

       In Figure 9, the only change in the specifications of either the Dynamic or Myopic

models is to allow the probability of a genetic disorder to vary with age, following the pattern in

Figure 1. Several interesting implications emerge by comparing the age patterns for  * displayed

in this Figure 8 and Figure 9. First, both figures make clear that forward-looking women have a

greater incentive to have an amniocentesis at early ages compared to optimal choices under the

Myopic Model. Second, when women face a rising (with age) risk of having a child having a

genetic disorder, under either the Dynamic or Myopic model, their incentive to have an

amniocentesis is lowered at early ages. In the Myopic model, the rising pattern to  * simply

reflects a age-by-age response to the increasing risk of a birth defect with age; as the risk of a

birth defect goes up, the incentives to learn about the potential problems with a fetus rise. With

respect to the Dynamic models, the consequences of rising rates of birth defects for the age

pattern in  * depend on the extent of discounting. At the extreme, if women do not discount the

future at all, i.e.,  = 1.00, the likelihood of an amniocentesis does not rise with age. Rather, the

option value effect noted above dominates her (their) amniocentesis decisions, giving rise to high

rates of amniocentesis at early ages, while the risks of miscarriage associated with an

amniocentesis, causes their utilization to decline as the woman (couple) reaches the end of the

childbearing period.

                                           Figure 9 here

       In Figures 10 and 11, we examine how the predictions of our Myopic and Dynamic



                                                 25
models, respectively, are affected by changes in the utility costs of abortions and costs. As can be

seen from these figures, higher costs to either abortion reduces the critical value for

amniocenteses equally at all ages while higher costs for miscarriages tend to reduce the incidence

of amniocenteses more at younger ages than at older ones.

                                                Figure 10 here

                                                Figure 11 here

        Finally, in Figure 12, we summarize our findings by graphing the life cycle pattern of  *

for both our Dynamic and Myopic models, for both age-invariant and age-varying rates of

genetic disorders (1-q). While more work needs to be done in “calibrating” the Dynamic

models, 16 this figure suggests that a Dynamic model in which there is some, but not complete,

discounting of the future and which incorporates the age-varying rates of birth defects (1-q)

displayed in Figure 1 can generate the qualitative features of the observed age-patterns in the

incidence of amniocenteses. In particular, such a model is able to generate both the rise in the

incidence of amniocentesis with age and the decline in its utilization at older ages. In contrast,

the Myopic model we calibrate does not generate a decline in  T*  s – and, thus, in the incidence

of amniocenteses – as women approach menopause.

5.     Concluding Observations
        In this paper, we examine the appropriateness of the threshold-age approach in the

protocol for recommending amniocentesis testing to pregnant women, based on a dynamic model

of the decision making process. In particular, we consider the potentially welfare enhancing

16
  In particular, it would appear that we can achieve age-patterns that more closely accord with those in the actual
data for amniocenteses displayed in Figures 5 through 7 by increasing some combination of the disutility costs of

effect of fully informing women of the risks and benefits of such a procedure, irrespective of age.

       Based on our calibration exercise, it does appear that the features of our model may be

important in accounting for the observed life cycle pattern of amniocenteses. In particular, the

dynamic model of optimal amniocentesis choice outlined above, when it includes some, but not

total, discounting of the future and conditions on increasing rates of genetic disorders with age,

does appear to generate age-patterns consistent with the data. Moreover, it appears that Myopic

models fail to predict the decline in the incidence of amniocentesis with age that are found in the

data. While further exploration of the calibration of the Dynamic model is needed (for instance,

to account for endogenous desired family size or an age-dependent pregnancy rate) these initial

findings suggest real merit to develop and estimate a dynamic structural model of amniocentesis

choice of the sort outlined in this paper.

       These initial findings, if they hold up to further scrutiny, have potentially important

implications for medical practice and insurance company policies for the funding of this

procedure. In particular, our results suggest that the medical community and insurance

companies may be ignoring the option value of amniocenteses when women are young.

Currently, 80% of Down syndrome children are born to women under the age of 35. Our model

suggests that some of these young women, if informed of the full costs and benefits of the

procedure and given the option to have it, would undergo an amniocentesis and, upon learning of

the results of this test, would choose to abort a chromosomally abnormal fetus in favor of a

future pregnancy that could result in a healthy birth. As such, existing guidelines of health care

providers and insurance companies in setting policies for the ages at which amniocenteses will

be funded are potentially inconsistent with the choices some women would make for themselves

if free to acquire the information provided by this procedure. Further exploration and estimation




                                                27
of this model may help to inform medical practice and policy by explicitly accounting for choice

behavior among women (couples) that take account of the future consequences of their actions.
