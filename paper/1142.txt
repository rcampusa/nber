                      Debt and Equity Yields:    1926—80



                                  ABSTRACT



      The study is divided into four broad parts, beginning with an

exploratory analysis of the data on expost returns on corporate equities and

bonds for the 1926-80 period. In Part 2, we estimate the relationships

between one—month expost returns on corporate bonds and equities and

variations in Treasury bill rates, economic activity, and other variables.

The major other variable is unanticipated changes in new issue coupon rates on

long-term Treasury bonds. Parts 3 and 4 contain econometric investigations of

the determinants of one-month Treasury bill rates and unanticipated changes in

long—term Treasury coupon rates, respectively. These parts extend the

analysis of Part 2 by explaining variables that determine expost corporate

bond and equity returns and provide evidence on the determination of new—issue

yields on short - and long-term default-free debt. The last three parts of

the study report econometric results based on data from the 1953-83 period.

      A number of important issues are addressed in the econometric parts of

the paper. These include: the validity of the Modigliani-Cohn valuation—error

hypothesis, the measurement of Merton's "excess return on the market", the

relationship between real new-issue debt rates and real economic activity, and

the usefulness of the Livingston survey data in explaining financial returns.

          An important companion to a study of how corporations have issued and

investors have purchased debt and equity securities during the past half-

century is an examination of how these securities have been priced in this

interval. Both resource utilization and inflation have varied widely in the

American economy, causing sharp changes in security prices and thus enormously

diverse ex post returns on corporate equities and bonds. Even if we limit

ourselves to the Post-Accord (1951) years, the variation in returns is huge.

To illustrate, equities earned positive real returns in 1954, 1958 and 1975 of

54, 41, and 30 percent, respectively, but had -24 percent and -38 percent

returns in 1973 and 1974. Variations in real returns on high quality

corporate bonds were smaller, but in the double digit range nonetheless (plus

14 percent in 1970 and 1976 and —13 to —16 percent in 1969, 1974, 1979 and

1980) .     The primary purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of

the determinants of these variations.

          The study is divided into four broad parts. We begin with an explora-

tory analysis of the data for the 1926-80 period. It makes good analytical

sense to examine the data for any regularities without the imposition of too

much structure before studying the data in the confines of a particular model.

In Part 2, we estimate the relationships between one-month expost returns on

corporate bonds and equities and variations in Treasury bill rates, economic

activity, and other variables. The major other variable is unanticipated

changes in new issue coupon rates on long-term Treasury bonds. Parts 3 and 4

contain econometric investigations of the determinants of one-month Treasury
                                    —2—




bill rates and unanticipated changes in long-term Treasury coupon rates,

respectively. These parts perform two functions; they extend the analysis of

Part 2 by explaining variables that determine expost corporate bond and equity

returns and they provide evidence on the determination of new issue yields on

short— and long-term default-free debt. The first part of the study differs

from the others in that it consists of simple numerical analysis (plots,

calculation of means, etc), rather than formal econometrics, and considers

data from the entire 1926-80 period, rather than the 1953—80 span.

      A number of important issues are addressed in the econometric parts of

the paper. These include: the validity of the Modigliani-Cohn valuation-error

hypothesis, the measurement of Merton's "excess return on the market", the

relationship between real new-issue debt rates and real economic activity, and

the usefulness of the Livingston survey data in explaining financial returns.

      Three general data sets are analyzed. First, the expost returns on

bills, bonds and equities are those compiled by Ibbotson and Sinquefield

(1980); causality tests of relationship among these returns and inflation are

reported in Appendix A. Second, changes in the coupon rate on long-term, new

issue equivalent Treasury bonds and unanticipated changes in this rate are

based upon the work of Huston McCulloch and are described in Appendix B.

Third, unanticipated inflation and industrial production growth are derived

from the Livingston survey data, and they and the entire semiannual data set

utilized in the analysis of unanticipated changes in new issue coupon rates

are presented in Appendix C.



                        1. Exploratory Data Analysis

      This part of the study contains sections dealing with:   (1) inflation

and Treasury bill rates, (2) inflation and relative returns on equities, bonds
                                        —3—




and bills, and (3) the business cycle and returns on equities and bonds.

        Before turning to the analysis, a few words about the data are in order.

First, all of the underlying yield data compiled by Ibbotson and Sinquefield
——
     equities,   corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, and Treasury bills -- are

roughly representative of returns on economy-wide "market" portfolios and are

available monthly for the 1926-80 period. These yields are realized, rather

than expected, returns, except for those on Treasury bills which are both

expected and realized because their one—month maturity equals the period over

which the returns are calculated. Second, the returns—-income plus capital

gains (except for bills) --are before-tax returns. They are not truly

representative of what either highly taxed or tax-exempt investors actually

earned after tax (both investor groups presumably would have opted for

portfolios with relative income and capital gains components different from

the market average, and the former group, of course, paid taxes). Hopefully,

differential returns, at least, are roughly representative of those earned by

most investors.

       The inflation rate is the rate of change in the consumer price index for

the 1926-46 period and the rate of change in the consumer price index net of

the shelter component after 1946. The latter circumvents the erroneous

treatment of housing costs (especially mortgage interest) in the construction

of the basic CPI [see Blinder (1980) and Dougherty and Van Order (1982)].



11 Inflation and Treasury Bill Returns

       During the 1926—80 period there was a single episode of significant

deflation, 1930-32. In those three years the inflation rate ranged from —6 to

-10 percent. Modest deflation also occurred in 1926—27, 1938, and 1949. In

contrast, there have been three significant bursts of inflation-—the beginning
                                    —4—




of World War II (9 percent in 1941 and 1942) the postwar surge (18 percent in

1946 and 9 percent in 1947) and the Korean War scare (6 percent in 1950 and

1951) --and the prolonged post—1967 inflationary era. The current inflation

has ranged from slightly over 4 percent (adjusting for the impact of price

controls in 1971—72) to double-digit inflation in 1974 and again in 1979-80.

      The above overview of the 1926-80 period suggests that division of these

years into four subperiods might be useful. These are 1926-1940 (which

includes the Depression and all years of even modest deflation except 1949)

1941—51 (which includes the inflationary spurts of World War II, its after-

math, and the outbreak of the Korean conflict), 1952-67 (the era of stable

prices), and 1968-80 (the present inflationary period). The first two columns

of Table 1.1 present the mean and standard deviations for the annual inflation

rate for these and overlapping periods. The great differences in the mean

inflation rate and its variability are obvious.

      The next four columns list means and standard deviations for both the

nominal and real one-month Treasury bill rate. As can be seen, there is an

enormous difference in the variability of the real bill rate between 1926-51

and 1952—80. In the latter period the standard deviation of the real bill

rate, 1.5 percent, is only three-fifths of that of the nominal bill rate, 2.6

percent; in the earlier period, the former, 6.4 percent, is over five times

the latter, 1.2 percent. Division of the earlier interval into 1926-40 and

1941—51 reveals enormous variability in the real bill rate (and stability in

the nominal rate). The mean real bill was a full 2.8 percent in 1926—40 and

an incredible -5.4 percent in 1941-51. The negative real rate in the l940s

was due to the monetary authorities' policy of pegging nominal interest rates

at low levels during a period of significant inflation. The high real rate in

the 1930s is largely attributable to the combination of the general non-
                                                              -4a-

negativity constraint on the nominal rate and the existence of significant

deflation. However, it is noteworthy that the real bill rate exceeded 4

percent in all years in the 1926-30 period during which the nonnegativity

constraint was not binding (the nominal bill rate ranged from 2.4 to 4.7

percent).

            Figure 1.1 illustrates the marked difference between the 1926-51 and

1952—80 periods in the volatility of both the nominal and real bill rates.

In the former period, the nominal rate declines in the early 1930s and is then

flat; in the latter period this rate cycles around a sharply rising trend

(the 1980 average bill rate of almost 12 percent disguises variations in

monthly rates between less than 7 percent and over 16 percent). In contrast,

the real bill rate varied between +12 percent in 1931 and 1932 and -18 percent

in 1946. Its often—cited stability clearly refers to the post—1951 period
        1
only.



1.2 Inflation and Relative Returns on Equities, Bonds, and Bills

         The first two columns in Table 1.2 repeat the same columns in Table 1.1.

The third and fourth columns record the mean and standard deviation of the

difference between the annual returns earned on equities and corporate bonds.

As can be seen, the premium equities have earned over bonds have varied

widely. The premium was much greater in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s than in

the 1930s and l970s.2 It would appear from these data that there is no simple

relationship between the premium and either the mean or the standard deviation

of the inflation rate.3

        The last two columns in Table 1.2 report the mean standard deviation of

the difference between the annual returns earned on U.S. government bonds and

one-month bills. The difference was extraordinarily large, 3.8 percent, in

the 1926-40 period, and small, -2.5 percent, in the 1968—80 period. These

differences are due to apparently unanticipated movements in interest rates.4

To illustrate, if yields fall unexpectedly, then prices of long-term bonds

will rise unexpectedly, and the one-year return on bonds will be large. This

was apparently the case in the 1930s (the one-month bill rate declined from an

average of over 3.0 percent in 1926—30 to less than 0.5 percent in the 1933—40

period). In contrast, if yields rise unexpectedly, then prices of long-term

bonds will fall unexpectedly, and the one-year return on bonds will be low.

This apparently has happened in the post-1952 period (the one-month bill rate

rose from 1.5 percent in 1952—55 to 5 percent in 1967—69 to over 10 percent in

1979-80) .

      It   is important to note that only unanticipated movements in interest

rates have such impacts on the difference in realized returns on bonds and

bills. For example, if long-term bond rates were expected to rise during the

year, then bonds would be priced at the beginning of the year such that a high

income return would offset the anticipated capital loss. In this case, the

difference in ex post returns on bonds and bills would be independent of

observed changes in new-issue bond yields.

1.3 The Business Cycle and Returns on Equities and Treasury Bonds

      In this section, we explore the presence of a business cycle effect on

returns earned on investment in corporate bonds and stocks.    The reference

dates of the National Bureau of Economic Research are employed as a general

guide to the stages of the business cycle. In the 1926-80 period, 10½ cycles

have occurred (see Table 1.3) .   Excluding the 43 month depression, con-
tractions have ranged from 6 to 16 months and have had an average duration of

11 months. Excluding the 80 and 106 month wartime (World War II and Viet Nam)

expansions, upswings have varied from 21 to 59 months in duration and have

averaged 39 months.

      Annualized differences in ex post equity and bond returns over different

phases of the business cycle have been compared.6 For contractions, the first

and last 5 months (which overlap for contractions of less than 10 months

duration) were examined. For expansions, the first, second, third, and last

six months were studied (the last two periods overlap during the 21 month

upswing in the late l920s). The cycles were divided into the 1926-52 and

1953—80 subperiods, and means and standard deviations of the differences in

equity and bond returns were calculated for the 5 pre 1953 cycles, the 5½ post

1952 cycles, and all 10½ cycles. A cursory examination of the data revealed

that equities tend to earn a relatively superior return (i.e., greater than

the average 7 percent by which equity returns exceeded bond returns throughout

the entire 1926—80 period) late in contractions and early in expansions and a

relatively inferior return late in expansions and early in contractions.

      A systematic comparison of the return data is reported in Table 1.4. We

first divided the months between January 1926 and December 1980 into three

types of periods: those around troughs (in which equity returns appear to be

superior), those around peaks (in which equity returns appear to be relatively

inferior), and the remainder. The inferior periods are defined as the last

six months of every expansion and the first half (dropping fractions) or first

six months, whichever is less, of every contraction. The superior periods are

defined as the last half (dropping fractions) or last six months, whichever is

less, of every contraction and the first six months of every expansion. In

the second step in this comparison, the total 1926-80 period is partitioned

into eleven overlapping intervals that contain single adjoining peaks and

troughs and all the surrounding months that do not overlap with adjacent

superior and inferior periods. That is, the intervals extend from 6 months

after a trough to 6 months before the second following peak. These eleven

overlapping intervals are listed at the left in Table 1.4. Also listed are

the geometric mean returns (annualized) during: the superior periods within

the interval, the inferior periods, and all months excluding such periods.

The mean in the latter months is the normal" return to which the mean returns

around the trough and peak are compared.7

      Columns 4 and 5 are the differences between the superior and inferior

returns, respectively, and the normal returns. The extraordinary annual net

returns on equities around troughs average 26 percent (no net return is less

than 18 percent), and the standard deviation is only 11 percent. In contrast,

the extraordinary annual net returns on equities are negative around most

peaks, and these net returns average -13 percent. Here, however, the standard

deviation is a relatively large 17 percent.

      These results indicate that investors could devise superior trading

schemes involving transactions between equities and government bonds to the

extent that they were able to forecast the turning points of business cycles,

particularly the recession trough. Given the brevity of the post World War II

recessions, this would not appear to be difficult; when a recession is clearly

upon us, the trough is just around the corner. Unfortunately, such a trading

rule will lead to incredibly negative returns if the early l930s are ever

repeated.

2. Expost Returns and the Interest Rate and Business Cycles

      Our next task is to explain expost monthly returns on corporate bonds

and equities. The analytical framework, which follows Mishkin (1978, 1981),

is first developed and then empirical results for bonds and equities are

reported.
                                            -9—



2.1 The Analytical Framework

        The expost after-tax return on an asset equals the expected or required

return plus the difference between the expost and expected returns. With the

required return equal to the after—tax return on one—month Treasury bills plus

a risk/liquidity premium, we have




        (l-t)R1= (l—T)Rtl+ p + UNEX1,                                           (2.1)



where      is the premium required on the jth asset, and UNEXt+1 is the

difference between the expost and anticipated after—tax return on asset j that

occurs because of unexpected changes in variables relevant to the return on

asset j. Next p and UNEXt             are replaced by a constant plus a set of

responses to proxies for them (X) and an error term (ni)          to   obtain




        R1         + R1+ =2                    + n1,                            (2.2)




where      =   (l-T)/(l-T3)   .   The difficult problem is, of course, specification
of the X.s.


Unanticipated Changes in Treasury Coupons

        In section 1.2, it was suggested that changes in new-issue equivalent

20-year Treasury bond yields have been largely unanticipated during the 1952-

80 period. This proposition can be tested with data compiled by Huston

MCulloch. For the 1947-mid1977 period, McCulloch (1977) has meticulously

constructed monthly series for both (1) new issue equivalent (par value)

long-term Treasury bond yields and (2) cumulative unanticipated changes in
these yields.8 A regression of the monthly change in the 20 year new-issue

yield (AR2O) on the unanticipated change (UNA) over the January 1953-June 1977

period results in



      AR2O = 1.27 + .999    UNA,           R2 = .882    DW = 2.88
             (.34) (.021)                  SEE = 5.9 basis points


where the yields are at annual rates. The positive constant reflects the

generally upward 'slope" of yield curves, and the response to unanticipated

changes is clearly one-for-one. The adjusted R2 indicates that 88% of monthly

changes other than the constant are explained by the unanticipated change.

      In equation estimates reported below, variables based upon both AR2O and

UN will be employed (the latter in equations excluding data after June 1977).

The specific form of the variables depends on how an unexpected change in the

bond rate should affect the price of (capital gain on) the specific security

being analyzed. The percentage capital gain on a portfolio of n-year bonds

(CGb) is related to changes in the yield on the n year bond, AR, by



           AR ((1+R
                    n
   CG=-
    b




In the regressions reported below, n is set equal to 20. With CGb defined in

this way, its coefficient is expected to be near unity.

      For equities, the relationship between the capital gain component of the

yield and the unanticipated change in the new issue coupon rate is more

complicated. The perpetual dividend growth valuation model says that the

value of equities (V) equals current after-tax dividends [(l_Td)DI divided by

the required after—tax nominal return on equities (Ra) less the expected

Taking derivatives, the percentage capital gain on equities, dV/V, is related

                  -
      CGe




The issues are: how should R:- g be measured and what is the likely value of

the derivative of Ra g?

       Portfolio equilibrium requires that



                                            =              + p,
                                                (ltd)R2O                       (2.4)



where bonds and dividends are assumed to be taxed equivalently and p is a

required risk premium. Thus


          -                                 -
              g           (ltd)R2O + p          g,

and


              g)                                                              (2.4)
                          — 1 -        dg
      dR2O                        Td   dR2O




      Equation (2.4 ) suggests the following. First, if all changes in R20

are due to changes in expected inflation which are, in turn, reflected in g

(dg/dR2O = 1)              then d(R_ g)/dR2O equals -
                                                      Td and CGe is positive. Second,
                      ,



for low values of Tds R:- g is roughly constant. This joint hypothesis
                                             —12—



suggests the use of AR2O/0.06 as a regressor, with an expected positive

coefficient of T)° On the other hand, if x percent of changes in R20 are

due to changes in the real rate of interest and thus dg/dR2O = 1 -                  x,   then the

coefficient on the regressor would be -             (x -       Ta)
                                                                     Ideally, one would separate

changes in interest rates into nominal and real components and enter these in

the regressions separately. Such a separation of monthly changes would seem

to be near impossible and is not attempted here.

      An alternative view of equity valuation exists. Equation (2.4) assumes

that investors rationally compare nominal returns on debt and equities. In

contrast, Modigliani and Cohn (1979) have contended that investors compare

real equity returns with nominal debt returns and that this error has been the

cause of the dismal performance of equities during the 1966-80 period of

rising inflation. To test this hypothesis, (2.4) is replaced with


         —     = (l—Ta)R2O + p   .                                                    (2.4a)

In this case



          -
              g = (l_Ta)R2O + p - g      + iT.




Taking derivatives,


  d(R_) —1-                dg        +dir

   dR2O               Td   dR2O dR2O                     Td.




      If Modigliani and Cohn are correct, then the appropriate regressor is

AR2O/[ (lTd)R2O+.O4] -- we take the real component of g to be 0.02 -- and the

expected coefficient is -                   Whether changes in interest rates are

event) to investors and thus to equity prices. In the empirical work reported

below, both the rational and Modigliani and Cohn views will be tested. In

these tests, we shall set Td =   0.3 (see footnote 18 for results with other
values of Td).

      Of course, R20/.06 and R2O/[ltd)R2O + .04] are closely correlated,

being dominated by their numerators. Thus, if one "works," so will the other.

If neither works, then we will accept the rationality hypothesis with x =

If both work positively, then the Modigliani-Cohn hypotheses will be rejected.
If both work negatively, we will choose between the rationality and

Modigliani-Cohn hypotheses on the basis of the plausibility of the implied

estimates of x and Td•

Other Variables

        In section 1.3, it was established that equities earned extraordinarily

large returns relative to bonds around recession troughs, very likely because

of a turnaround in expectations regarding the growth of the economy. We would

expect this to generate capital appreciation on equities and possibly bonds

(if default premia decline). Based upon the earlier analysis, a turnaround

dummy variable is defined as:11

                    (1    last half (dropping fractions) or last six months,
                          whichever is less, of every contraction and first
           TURN =         six months of every expansion
                    1O    elsewhere.

    A final proxy is unexpected inflation. This variable is measured as the

difference between actual and expected inflation where the latter is based on

the Livingston survey data.12 More specifically, the variable is the

difference between the actual average monthly inflation rate between the

 the surprises should be expected to depress equity returns (and possibly bond

2.2 The Results for Bonds

         The results for corporate bonds are reported in Table 2.1. Equations

 (1) and (2) are for the l953—mid77 period and differ only in that (1) includes

the capital gains variable based upon the unexpected change in the 20 year

Treasury rate as a regressor while the variable in (2) is based upon the

total change.15 Given our earlier evidence that changes in the 20 year rate

are predominantly unanticipated, it is not surprising that the results are

quite similar. The bill rate coefficients are close to their expected value

of unity. On the other hand, the capital gain coefficients are only about

seventy percent of their expected unity value. The unanticipated inflation

and superior dummy variables enter with the expected signs, but only the

coefficient on the former is significantly different from zero at the .05

level.

         Equation (3) contains estimates for the entire 1953-80 period. The

coefficient on the bill rate is now quite close to the expected unity value;

and the explanatory power of the equation increases sharply (R2 rises from

0.56 to 0.68) .   The coefficient on the capital—gain variable, 0.76, is closer

to unity, but still significantly below, and the other coefficients, while

continuing to have the expected signs, are not significantly different from

zero. These coefficients are not small, however. Bond returns tend to be 2.3

percent less than normal in a year of 2.5 percent unanticipated inflation and

2.3 percent more in the year surrounding business cycle troughs.

 bond yield and Standard and Poor's dividend-price ratio moved in opposite

 directions throughout the l950s (they conjectured that a sharp decline in the

 relative risk premium required on equities occurred) but were positively

 correlated in the l960s and early 1970s. Consequently, the 1953-80 period is

 divided into the 1953-60 and 1961-80 subperiods and results are reported for

 these.

          Equation (1) in Table 2.2 illustrates the familiar, but hardly expli-

 cable, result that ex post equity returns were strongly negatively correlated
                                        16
with expected inflation in the 1950s.          The point estimate is an astounding

—16, indicating that a one percentage point increase in the bill rate

 (expected inflation?) induced a 16 percentage point decline in equity returns.

Equation (2) indicates the expected negative relationship with our

unanticipated inflation variable (the average monthly inflation rate between

the date the Livingston survey was taken and the date forecast less the

Livingston forecasted six-month inflation rate) and positive relationship with

the turnaround cycle dummy variable, but neither relationship is statistically

significant. Equations (3) and (4) include current and lagged one-month

values of the variables based upon changes in the long-term Treasury coupon

rate. The variables in equations (3) and (5) are the Modigliani-Cohn

nominal-rate versions defined as LiR2O/(.7 R20 + 0.04); the variables in

equations (4) and (6) are the real—rate versions defined as AR2O/0.06. A

one—month lag was tested because equities and new-issue bonds are not as close

substitutes as are corporate and Treasury bonds. Recall that the coefficients

in (3) are expected to be negative and sum to -0.7 if investors make the

Modigliani-Cohn valuation error (and the tax rate on dividends is 0.3),

and the coefficients in (4) can be interpreted as —(x —             where x is the

tax rate on dividends. A positive relation between equity returns and the

concurrent change in the bond yield is indicated, although the impact is

largely reversed the following month.17 This is inconsistent with the

Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis and supports the rationality hypothesis. The

implied dividend tax rate, assuming that changes in interest rates are

perceived as nominal (x =     0),   is 0.1 (when the lagged term is taken into

account) to 0.36.

      While the bill rate coefficient is still a startling -8 in equations (3)

and (4), it is not significantly different from the expected unity value. In

equations (5) and (6) this coefficient has been constrained to unity. As

anticipated, the decline in explanatory power is minor. The impact of changes

in Treasury coupon rates is unchanged from equations (3) and (4) ,     but   the

coefficients on unanticipated inflation and the turnaround dummy rise in

absolute value and statistical significance (the t-ratios are 1½ and 3,

respectively)

       Equations for the 1961-80 period are listed in Table 2.3. While the

Treasury bill rate enters negatively in equation (1), the coefficient is only

a tenth as large as that in equation (1) of Table 2.2. Moreover, when

unanticipated inflation and the turnaround dummy variable are included, the

bill rate coefficient is close (given its standard error) to unity. The

coefficients on unanticipated inflation and the turnaround dummy have the

expected signs and are significantly different from zero. Equations (3) and

(4) contain the change in coupon-rate variables. The coefficients in equation

(3) sum to -0.6, very close to the expected value of —0.7 in the Modigliani-

Cohn framework (further lagged values of the variable have essentially zero

coefficients), and the variables add substantially to the explanatory power of
                18

most of changes in long-term coupon rates (one-third plus the dividend tax

rate) have been perceived by rational investors (not Modigliani-Cohn

investors) as changes in real rates. The rationality of this perception,

during a period of rising inflation, is questionable.

      When the bill rate coefficient is constrained to unity [see equations

(5) and (6)], the other coefficients are little affected except for that on

unanticipated inflation which falls by a quarter in absolute value. Because

its standard error falls proportionately, the statistical significance of the

coefficient is unaltered.

      Comparison of equations (5) and (6) in Table 2.2 with their counterparts

in Table 2.3 indicates a close similarity of all coefficients except those on

the current change in the Treasury coupon rate. Given this similarity,

equations for the entire 1953-80 period have been estimated and are reported

as equations (1) and (2) in Table 2.4. The estimates are, of course, close to

those of the subperiods. The coefficients in equation (2) can be interpreted

in the following way. First, the constant term, which is 0.102 on an annual

basis, represents Merton's excess expected return on the market. Second, the

bill rate contributed an average 4½ percent return over the period, rising

steadily from under 2 percent in the early 1950s to over 10 percent in 1979—

80. Third, the continuing climb in the Treasury coupon rate lowered stock

returns by nearly 2 percent per annum on average during the 1953-80 period.

More importantly, the change in this rate has had large impacts in particular

years. To illustrate, the percentage increase in the coupon rate from 9

percent to 12½ percent between March 1979 and March 1980 generated a 15

percent expost decline in stock returns in that year, other things being

equal. Fourth, the coefficient on the turnaround dummy variable suggests that

equities have earned a 34 percent greater return in the year roughly

surrounding business cycle troughs than during other periods. Fifth, stocks

have earned sharply negative returns, ceteris paribus, during periods of

unanticipated inflation. More specifically, the roughly 4½ percentage point

unanticipated inflation in 1973—74 and 1979 translates into a 22 percent lower

annual return on equities than would otherwise be the case. Our

interpretation of this negative relation between equity returns and

unanticipated inflation is that the latter generates expectations of tighter

monetary policy and thus both higher interest rates and sluggish economic
            l8a
activity.

      As is well known, equity returns follow a strong political cycle. For

example, during the 1953-80 period equity returns averaged 3½ percent in the

two years following presidential elections, but 20 percent in the two years

leading up to the elections. Because the political cycle is so readily

predictable, such differences in returns must certainly be attributable to

other factors which, it just happens, have been correlated with the business

cycle in the past but might well not be in the future. Likely candidates for

these other factors are the interest rate and business cycles as reflected in

our change—in—coupon, turnaround, and unanticipated-inflation variables. To

determine whether our equations have captured the observed political cycle

impact, we have computed the annual errors from equation (2) in Table 2.4 and

averaged them over the first and second pairs of years of presidential terms.

Much to our surprise, the difference in these averages was a full 13 percent.

That is, our equation accounts for only 3 of the 16½ percent average

difference in average returns between the two years leading up to presidential

elections and the two following years.

      The last two equations in Table 2.4 include political cycle dummy

variables that equal one in months which fall in the second/third/fourth year

of presidential terms and zero in all other months. As can be seen, their
                                      —19—




inclusion raises the explanatory power of the equations. Moreover, the

hypothesis that the coefficients on the three political-cycle dunimy variables

are jointly zero can be rejected at the .05 level. Inclusion of these

variables does not affect the interest rate coefficients, but it does alter

the others by one-half (the turnaround dummy and the constant terms) to a full

(unanticipated inflation) standard error.'9



3. Treasury Bill Returns and the Inflation Rate



3.1 Theory

        Definitionally, the real rate of interest is the nominal interest rate

less the inflation rate. If we let r+1 and Rt+i be the real and nominal

interest rates earned over the holding period t to t+l, respectively, and

     be the inflation rate over the same time span, then



                                                                      (3.1)
        r+1 Rt+1 - 1t+]


Taking expectations of both sides of (3.1) contingent on information available

at t, so that expectations are formed rationally, (3.1) becomes



        r R —
     t t+l      t+l   t t+l ,
                       11
                                                                      (3.2)


where         is the real rate expected at time t to exist in period t+l,
                                                                            tt+1
is the inflation rate expected at time t to exist in period t+1, and (3.2)

utilizes the fact that the expected nominal interest rate is the expost rate

because Rt÷, is known at time t. In a world where lenders are required to pay

an income tax rate t on their nominal interest receipts and borrowers can
                                           —20—



deduct T   percent   of their nominal interest payments,




               (lT)Rt+i -
                             tt+l,                                          (3.2a)



where r÷i is the expected after-tax real short-term rate.

      The expected inflation rate is the difference between actual and

unanticipated inflation: tt+l +l - UNINFt+l.          With this substitution in

(3.2a), one can obtain



                                     +
      1t+l -r+1 + (l-T)Rt+l              UNINFt+i.



If the expected after—tax real short-term rate and t       are   constants and the

unanticipated rate of inflation is white noise, then it is appropriate to

regress 't+l      Rt÷1 and a constant. The equation is estimated with inflation

as the dependent variable and the interest rate as the independent because the

latter is predetermined while the former develops during the period.

Unfortunately, a large body of evidence rejects the assumption of a constant

real rate [see Garbade and Wachtel (1978), Mishkin (1981) and the references

cited in the latter], and the Livingston inflation survey data indicate

systematic inflation forecast errors. The purposes of our estimation are to

provide evidence on the determinants of the real short-term rate and to test

for the presence of systematic errors in inflation forecasts.



3.2 Problems with the Inflation and Interest Rate Data

     Fama (1975) regressed inflation on the bill rate on data from the

January 1953 -   July   1971 period. He ruled out the data from World War II and
its aftermath owing to both the low quality of the CPI prior to 1953 and to

the Federal Reserve's pegging of nominal interest rates. Given constant

nominal rates and highly variable inflation, the real bill rate varied widely.

Our earlier examination of the 1926-39 period suggests that there, too,

nominal bill rates were relatively stable (near zero in the l930s) and real

bill rates relatively volatile. Thus we also restrict ourselves to the post

1952 data.

      Fama did not extend his analysis beyond July 1971 because the CPI was

contaminated beginning in August 1971 by the Nixon price controls. Because

"true" inflation is relevant to the nominal bill rate, regressions of recorded

inflation on the nominal bill rate may give misleading results when true and

recorded inflation rates differ. Subsequently, many investigators, including

Fama, have proceeded to analyze data from the control period with no

adjustments. In order to utilize post July 1971 data in our tests, we include

a proxy for the difference between recorded and true inflation in our

regressions. In constructing this proxy, we utilize the results of Blinder

and Newton (1981). More specifically, we use the change in their Model I

measure of the impact of the controls on the nonfood, nonenergy consumer price

index as our proxy for the difference between recorded and true inflation.20

Their results suggest that the controls reduced the price level by 3

percentage points by early 1974, a reduction which was completely offset when

the controls were lifted in 1974.

      A more general problem with the consumer price index is the treatment of

housing costs (especially mortgage interest) in the construction of the index

[see Blinder (1980) and Dougherty and Van Order (1982)1. To circumvent this

problem, the inflation rate employed in this paper is the consumer price index

net of the shelter component. Such an adjustment is particularly important in
                                     —22—



 analyzing data after 1978.

       A final possible data problem follows from a phenomenon documented by

 Cook (1981). He notes that in 1973 and 1974 short-term bill rates became far

 "out of line" relative to short—term rates on large CDs, commercial paper, and

 bankers acceptances. During this period market interest rates rose sharply

 relative to ceiling-constrained yields on deposits. According to Cook, the

bill market was segmented from markets for private short-term securities.

Because only bills were available in smaller denominations, many households

were able to shift deposit funds only into bills. Corporations did not have

sufficient bill holdings to arbitrage between the bill and private security

markets (they drew their holdings down to zero in 1974), and commercial banks

and municipalities had nonyield reasons for maintaining bill holdings. Thus

bill rates fell relative to other yields. As a result, expected inflation was

not fully reflected in bill rates. In fact, the enormous disparity between

private and Treasury short-term yields in 1974 was the driving force behind

the creation of the money market fund, an entity that, in the absence of other

government regulations, should prevent such disparities from recurring21

      During the 156 month 1965-77 period, the spread between one-month prime

CDs and one-month Treasury bills was generally within the 30 to 80 basis point

range.22 Two major exceptions occurred.     During the 20 months from April 1969

to November 1970, the spread exceeded 90 basis points in 17 months and was at

maximum of 189 basis points in July 1969. During the 24 months from April

1973 to March 1975, the spread exceeded 90 basis points in 23 months, the

maximum being 431 basis points in July 1974. In the 4 years prior to April

1969, the spread was above 80 basis points in only 4 of 48 months and never

exceeded 110 basis points. In the 28 months between November 1970 and April

1973, the spread exceeded 81 basis points only once (85 basis points in July
                                       —23-




1972).     Finally, in the 39 months between April 1975 and June 1978, the spread

never exceeded 90 basis points.

         In the empirical estimates, then, we specify the inflation rate as the

CPI net of shelter, the price control variable CONT is included in regressions

using data from the August 1971 - December 1974 period, and both the observed

one month Treasury bill and an adjusted rate that moves with the CD rate when

the bill rate is out of line are utilized as regressors.



3.3 The Estimates

         Table 3.1 contains the regression coefficients (and their standard

errors, under them in parentheses), the coefficient of determination (and the

equation standard error, under it in parentheses), and Durbin—Watson ratio for

equations explaining the rate of change in the CPI net of shelter over the

January 1953 - December 1980 span.23 In the first two equations, it is

assumed that (a) the real after—tax bill rate is either a constant or a linear

function of the nominal after-tax bill rate and (b) unanticipated inflation is

white noise. As can be seen, the bill rate coefficient is significantly above

unity. This result is similar to that obtained by Fama and Gibbons (1981,

Table 1) in their study of data from the 1953-77 period. Because tax rates

cannot be negative, this estimate implies that the after-tax real bill rate is

negatively related to expected inflation (and thus to the after-tax nominal

rate).24 To illustrate, if r+1 =         - tt+l'   then the use of (3..2a) and the

inflation identity (inflation is the sum of its expected and unexpected

components) yields


         1t+l =   -   +         + UNINFt+1.                            (3.4)



The coefficient on the nominal rate will be greater than unity if >-r.25 A

negative relation between real after—tax debt rates and expected inflation is

hardly surprising when the use of historic-cost depreciation and FIFO

inventory accounting erodes after-tax real earnings of firms during periods of

rising inflation. Because firms are unable to pay constant real after-tax

returns to debtors and shareholders in the aggregate, the returns to each

would be expected to decline (Hendershott 1981, pp. 913—14)

        Examination of the residuals from equation (2) reveals that they tend to

be negative in the l950s and 1960s and positive in the 1970s. That is, the

equation overpredicts inflation in the early years and underpredicts it later.

Two possible explanations come to mind. First, the real bill rate may have

fallen between the l960s and l970s by even more than is captured by the high

coefficient on the bill rate and the increase in this rate. If real interest

rates are positively correlated with real economic activity, then the

relatively sluggish activity in the l970s would suggest a decline in the real
        26
rate.

         Second, possibly more of the higher inflation in the l970s was

unanticipated than was the case in the 1950s and 1960s. Comparison of actual

six-month inflation rates with the forecasts computed from the Livingston

Survey data suggests that this was the case (see Appendix C). Four periods of

prolonged unanticipated inflation (four consecutive large six month

forecasting errors) occurred: the four surveys from June 1956 to December

1957, January 1969 to June 1970, January 1973 to June 1974 and June 1978 to

December 1979. Not only did two of these come during the shorter period of

large positive residuals, but the average degree of unanticipated inflation

was 4½ percent (at an annual rate) in these two vis-a-vis 2½ percent for the

earlier episodes.

         Equation (3) is the result of including a proxy for unanticipated
                                      —26—




 inflation,   Of course, if the real bill rate were a constant and the proxy for

 unanticipated inflation were perfect, then we would be estimating an identity,

 the usefulness of which could be easily questioned. What is being tested in

 equation (3) is whether an unanticipated inflation variable based on the

Livingston survey data (see page 13 above) improves on the assumption of white

noise. The proxy enters with the anticipated positive sign and yields a

marked improvement in explanatory power. Moreover, the coefficient on the

bill rate is lowered below unity, although not significantly so. Equation (3)

is consistent with the joint hypotheses that the real Treasury bill rate was

constant during the 1953-80 period (at a 1.2 percent annual rate) and that the

Livingston survey data are slightly high estimates of unanticipated inflation.

      In equation (4) we test the hypothesis that real bill rates are related

to real economic activity. As a proxy for real activity, we follow Carlson

(1979) and Hendershott and Hu (1981) in using the Federal Reserve's capacity

utilization rate for manufacturing. Because this rate is available only

quarterly, we assign this value to the middle month of the quarter and

interpolate linearly between mid-quarter months. This series, lagged one—

month and divided by 100, less its mean value over the 1953—80 period of 0.834

is the regressor. This variable enters with the expected negative sign and

has a t—ratio of 3,27 The coefficient on unanticipated inflation rises to

within a standard error of unity and that on the bill rate falls to nearly two

standard errors below unity.28

      Fama and Gibbons (1981), among others, have provided evidence that

expected real bill returns behave like random walks. If this is true of real

bill returns even after allowing for their positive relationship with real

economic activity, then the nominal bill rate is correlated with the error

term and thus its estimated coefficient is biased downward. Equation (5)
                                      —26—



provides estimates of the other coefficients when that on the bill rate is

arbitrarily constrained to unity. The standard error of the equation rises

ever so slightly and the coefficient on unanticipated inflation falls to 0.75.

The adjusted R2 indicates that one-sixth of the variation in inflation after

allowing for variations in the bill rate is explained by variations in

unanticipated inflation and capacity utilization.

        To this point, the coefficient on the price controls variable has not

been discussed. In equation (2), the coefficient is statistically different

from both its maximum plausible value of unity and its minimum plausible value

of zero. In subsequent equations, the coefficient is about 0.2 or only one

standard error from zero. Although the controls variable is nonzero in only

the August 1971 - December 1974 period, its coefficient could affect the

coefficients on the other variables because all variables move sharply in this

period. To test this sensitivity, equation (4) was rerun with the controls

coefficient arbitrarily constrained to unity. Equation (6) indicates that

only the coefficient on unanticipated inflation is affected, declining to

0.75.

        Our last experiment tests an adjusted bill rate variable which takes

into account the fact that bill rates were out of line relative to private

open—market rates during much of the April 1969 - March 1975 period. In April

1975, the first month after bill rates returned to the normal relationship

with private rates, the one-month bill rate was 0.004347. The bill rate was

almost precisely the same in November 1968, shortly before it got out of line.

In this month, the one-month CD rate exceeded the bill rate by 0.00047. The

adjusted bill rate series is defined as the CD rate less 0.00047 during the

November 1968 - March 1975 period and the bill rate otherwise. This adjusted

series replaces the observed bill rate in equation (7). Relative to equation
                                    —27—




(4), the coefficients on the price controls and unanticipated inflation

variables decline by a standard error, and the explanatory power of the

equation rises slightly.



3.4 Summary

      Three findings should be emphasized. First, the existence of price

controls and out-of—line bill rates in the early and middle l970s do not have

an important impact on the estimates. Inclusion of the price controls

variable or adjustment of the bill rate improve the explanation of inflation

slightly, but the values of the important regression coefficients are largely

unaffected.

      Second, the real bill rate is shown to be systematically related to the

level of real activity as measured by the capacity utilization rate. With the

coefficient of the latter equal to -0.009, the real bill rate is 2½ percentage

points higher (at an annual rate) when the utilization rate is 90 percent than

when it is 70 percent.

      Third, the estimated responses of actual inflation to both expected

inflation (as reflected in the bill rate) and unanticipated inflation (based

on the Livingston survey data) are close to unity. The bill-rate coefficient

point estimate is 0.85, while that of the unanticipated inflation varies

between 0.74 and 0.88. Although the lowest of these coefficients is two

standard errors below unity, we do not emphasize this because there is reason

to believe that the coefficients may be biased downward. Unfortunately, the

tax rate of the representative investor cannot necessarily be inferred from

the bill rate coefficient. For example, an estimate of unity implies a zero

tax rate if the real bill rate is independent of the expected inflation rate,

but a positive tax rate if the real bill rate is negatively related to
expected inflation, a relationship that would be reflected in the estimated

bill rate coefficient. The significance and empirical importance of the

unanticipated inflation measure suggests that the Livington survey data, which

indicate a significant underestimate of six month inflation throughout much of

the 1969—80 period, may well have accurately reflected the expectations of

market participants. This underestimate of expected inflation explains why

nominal bill rates failed to move one-for-one with actual inflation during the

1952—80 period.



4. The Determinants of Unanticipated Changes in Treasury Coupon Rates

      In Part 2, expost returns on corporate bonds and equities were shown to

be strongly influenced by unanticipated changes in long-term new issue

Treasury coupons (or by total changes which were shown to be largely

unanticipated). The last stage of our study is an investigation of the

determinants of these unanticipated changes.29 We begin with the analytical

framework and then report some equation estimates.



4.1 The Framework

      Unanticipated changes in long-term Treasury rates are caused by changes

in long-run expected inflation, which are unanticipated by definition, and

unanticipated changes in the long-term real rates. Of course, neither of

these is observable. Thus the problem is to specify proxies for expected

inflation and the expected real rate and, for the latter, to distinguish

between anticipated and unanticipated changes.

      The results of Parts 2 and 3 give us some guidance here. From the

Livingston survey, we have estimates of expected short-run inflation. While

the validity of this survey data is questioned by some, the empirical
                                         —29—




significance of the measure of unanticipated inflation based on these data in

both the equity-return and inflation regressions suggests that the data have

empirical content. It seems reasonable that long-run inflationary

expectations would be revised upward in response to unanticipated short—run

inflation.

      The inflation equations also implied that real Treasury bill rates are

related positively to the capacity utilization rate. Short—run changes in

this rate, in turn, must be closely correlated with the growth rate of

industrial production. As a consequence, it is reasonable to hypothesize that

unanticipated changes in long-term rates are positively correlated with

deviations between actual and expected growth rates in industrial production.

Fortunately, the Livingston survey also contains forecasts of industrial

production six months ahead.

      Because the Livingston survey data are available only semiannually (June

and December) ,   the   analysis of unanticipated changes in Treasury coupon rates

is conducted in a six-month time frame. That is, changes from December of one

year to June of the next, from that June to the next December, etc., are the

dependent variable in the analysis (the specific data are discussed and listed

in Appendix C). We denote the change from t-l to t as UNAt. This change is

hypothesized to depend on unanticipated industrial-production growth, UNIPtS

and unanticipated inflation, UNINFtI between t-l and t. These variables are

defined more precisely as



      UNIPt =     [IP — Eti(IPt)]/IPt1
      UNINFt      It - Et1(It),



where IP is the level of industrial production, I is the inflation rate (the
                                      -30—




subscript t denotes inflation from t-l to t) and E is the expectations

operator.

      Policy surprises must also be accounted for because they may provide

information beyond that incorporated in the above defined variables. This

would likely be true to the extent that policy surprises affect prices and

real income with a lag; if the full impact occurred instantaneously, it would

be reflected in the unanticipated inflation and industrial production growth

variables. The most obvious surprise in the 1955—80 period was the imposition

and removal of price controls in the early l970s. To proxy this surprise, we

specify a controls dummy variable that assumes the value —l in the second half

of 1971 when the controls were imposed, 1 in the first half of 1974 when the

controls were removed, and 0 in all other periods. To the extent that the

imposition and removal of controls, respectively, lowered and raised expected

long-run inflation, this variable, PCDUM, should have a positive impact on the

change in coupon rate.

      The fiscal surprise variable employed is that computed by von

Furstenberg (1981). This variable is defined as the difference between the

actual and "normal" surpluses of Federal, state and local governments, divided

by net national product. The normal surplus takes into account not only the

stage of the business cycle but also regular (forecastable) discretionary

policy actions taken over the course of the business cycle (regular tax cuts

during recessions, for example). This variable is denoted by FSUR. The

variable exceeds 1½ percent, in absolute value, in only three periods: 1960,

mid1966 -   midl968 (the Vietnam buildup), and the second quarter of 1975 (the

extraordinary tax rebate). A positive fiscal surprise (unusually large

surplus) would be expected to lower interest rates. The decline would be

relatively minor if the surprise does not lead to a revision in the "fiscal
                                        31—




policy" rule. Von Furstenberg argues persuasively that this was the case in

the 1955-78 period.

        The monetary surprise variable tested is the difference between the rate

of growth in the adjusted monetary base computed by the Federal Reserve Bank

of St. Louis and the growth rate in recent periods (say the previous two

years). The impact of this variable on interest rates is unclear.

Unanticipated monetary growth would tend to depress real rates (Milton

Friedman's "liquidity effect") but to an upward revision in the inflation

premia.3° Because the estimated coefficient on variants of this variable

never had a t—ratio greater than one or an estimated impact greater a few

basis points, equation estimates with this variable are not reported below.

        We would expect that the coupon rate would be linearly related to the

unanticipated inflation and price control variables as constructed. Because

the unanticipated industrial production and fiscal surprise variables are real

ratios, we would expect them to impact on the percentage change in the new

issue coupon rate. To reflect these considerations, the unanticipated change

in the coupon rate, unanticipated inflation, and the price controls variable

have all seen deflated by the lagged value of the twenty-year Treasury coupon

rate. Thus the estimated equations are of the form:


                                             -
UN/R2O1 =     O+           +

All variables enter significantly with the expected signs, the constant term

 is within a standard error of zero, and the equation explains a third of the

variance in the dependent variable. The sources of the cumulated 6 percentage

point rise in the new issue coupon rate over the 1955-78 period are

unanticipated six-month inflation and industrial production growth; both

averaged 1.3 percentage points per period in this span. Multiplication of 1.3

by 48 semiannual periods and the relevant regression coefficient yields 3.3

percentage points for the cumulative effect of unanticipated inflation. To

obtain the impact of unanticipated industrial production growth, we multiply

1.3 by 48, the regression coefficient (.0082), and the mean value of the

twenty-year Treasury coupon in this period, 5.4. The result is 2.8 percentage

points. A single 4½ percentage point inflation error, which occurred during

1973—74 and again in 1979, is accompanied by a quarter of a percentage point

rise in the coupon rate. The production growth forecasting errors exceeded

+0.06 in six semiannual periods between 1955 and 1978, but were never larger

than          the 0.0082 coefficient implies that a 0.08 underforecast of

industrial production growth is associated with a two—thirds percentage point

increase in the new issue coupon when it is at the 10 percent level. A

relatively large negative fiscal surprise, such as the 2½ percentage point

surprise during the mid66 - mid68 Vietnam buildup, is accompanied by a 15

basis point per period rise in the coupon rate. Finally, the imposition of

price controls appears to have lowered long-run inflation expectations by

nearly two-thirds of a percentage point.

       The second equation in Table 4.1 contains estimates for the full 1955-80

period. In this equation the fiscal surprise variable was arbitrarily set

equal to zero (the variable was 0.404 in the fourth quarter of 1978 and

averaged -0.187 during the 1955-78 period). Because there were not any
                                   —33-.




obvious surprises in the last two years of the Carter administration, this is

probably a reasonable approximation. The estimated coefficients are close to

those of the first equation with the exception of the response to

unanticipated growth which rises by half a standard error. The actual and

predicted percentage changes from this equation are plotted in Figure 4.1. As

can be seen, the equation seems to underpredict a number of large changes

(except those associated with price controls), but does capture major swings

in the new issue coupon (except possibly the most recent one).

      With the fiscal surprise variable still maintained at zero, our equation

significantly overpredicts the level of the Treasury coupon rate in 1981 and

1982, even allowing for the sharp decline in late 1982. This is to be

expected for two reasons. First, a substantial fiscal surprise has

undoubtedly occurred. While taxes are normally cut during recessions and the

1982 full employment deficit is not large by historical standards, the

combination of the July 1983 tax cut, the indexation of taxes in future years,

and the difficulties of controlling many expenditures leads to large "out

year" full employment deficits. This "permanent" surprise could have had a

quite large impact on interest rates. Second, the sharp 1981 cut in the

taxation of returns from business capital would be expected to raise real

interest rates by a percentage point or two (Hendershott and Shilling 1982).

      This study began with an examination of data for the 1926-80 period on

returns earned on one—month Treasury bills, long-term Treasury and corporate

bonds, and corporate equities. Relationships among the returns and between

them and inflation and the business cycle were identified. We then turned to

econometric investigations of the relationships between expost monthly returns

on corporate securities and bill rates and other variables, principally the

unanticipated change in the coupon on new issue Treasury bonds. We concluded

with an investigation of the determinants of the bill rate and the

unanticipated change in long—term Treasury coupon rates.

      The most general theme of the econometric work is the usefulness of the

Livingston survey data in explaining financial returns. Unanticipated

inflation, defined as the difference between short—run observed inflation and

the Livingston forecast, enters the equity-returns, inflation-rate, and

change—in—new—issue—coupon equations significantly. (When unanticipated

inflation is not included as a regressor in the inflation equation, the

estimates imply that real (bill) interest rates are negatively related to

expected inflation; when unanticipated inflation is included, this negative

relationship does not appear to exist.) In addition, changes in new-issue

coupon rates are positively related to unanticipated growth in industrial

production, defined as the difference between observed growth and the

Livingston forecast.

      The latter result is part of a secondary theme, a positive relationship

between real interest rates or returns and real economic activity. Expost

equity returns ("the market") are strongly related to expectations of future

economic activity. In every business cycle since at least 1926, the market

has risen sharply around cycle troughs (the last half or six months, whichever

is shorter, of recessions and first six months of expansions); other things

being equal, equity returns are 34 percentage points higher during this key

year of turnaround in expectations than these returns are at other times. In

addition, unanticipated inflation, which appears to lead to expectations of

]kwer real economic activity, deprssesequityivalues (by as much as 22

percent in 1973-74 and 1979), other things being equal. The investigation of
                                   —35—



new—issue debt yields lends supporting results. The real Treasury bill rate

is positively related to the capacity utilization rate with the real rate

being 2½ percentage points higher when utilization is at 90 percent than when

it is at 70 percent. Because more rapid growth in industrial production leads

to higher capacity utilization, the relationship between changes in new issue

rates on long-term Treasuries and this growth is implicitly a relationship

between the level of Treasury bond rates and capacity utilization.

      Unanticipated changes in new Treasury coupon rates (and 88 percent of

monthly changes during the 1953-77 period were unanticipated) are the dominant

determinant of expost monthly corporate bond returns and also strongly

influence equity returns. Regarding the latter, a 2½ percentage point

increase in new issue Treasury coupon rates is estimated to lower the market

by 10 percent. More generally, for the 1961-80 period the data are consistent

with the Modigliani-Cohn valuation-error model and a dividend tax rate of

about 0.4. Finally, a third of semiannual percentage unanticipated changes

in new issue coupon rates over the 1955—80 period can be explained by

unanticipated six-month inflation and industrial production growth, fiscal

policy "surprises," and the imposition and removal of price controls in the

early 1970s.

      The analysis of the present study can usefully be extended in two ways.

First, a switch to a semiannual data base for all parts of the empirical work

is called for in order to more appropriately utilize the Livingston survey

data. This switch might also allow some differentiation in the effects of

real and purely nominal unanticipated bond rate changes on equity returns.

Our analysis was not able to distinguish between Modigliani-Cohn irrationality

(there is no need to differentiate between changes in real rates and in

inflationary premia because investors only care about their sum) and
                                   -36-




rationality (with much of nominal rate changes being real changes) because it

is near impossible to identify inflationary premia in long-term bond rates on

a monthly basis. Second, the stability of the estimated relationships over

time should be tested. It would, of course, be useful to know if the

relationships have been altered by the change in Federal Reserve operating

procedures and the resulting increased volatility in financial markets since

October 1979. Preliminary examination of the movement in long-term Treasury

coupons indicates that a change has likely occurred.

                                                                 & Huang

 1The variability in the real bill rate in the 1952—80 period would likely have

been even lower in the absence of deposit rate ceilings. More specifically,

the large negative values in 1973 and 1974 are due to bill rates becoming "out

of line" relative to private short-term yields due to disintermediation (see

p. 22 below).



2The premium that equities earned over Treasury bills is similar to the extent

that returns on bonds and bills are roughly equal. As is indicated in the

last column of Table 1.2, government bonds outperformed government bills by

nearly four percentage points per annum in the 1926-40 period, with the result

that the equity premium over bills was significantly greater than that over

bonds. The reverse was true, although to a lesser degree, in the 1968—80

period.



3Nonetheless, many have attributed the poor performance of equities in the

1969-78 decade to increased inflation and/or uncertainty regarding inflation.

Feldstein (1980) has argued that biases in the tax law reduce share values in

inflationary periods, while Modigliani and Cohn (1979) have attributed the

reduction to an inflation-induced error of investors. Malkiel (1979) has

contended that increased uncertainty regarding future price and government

regulation changes has lowered share values by increasing the relative risk

premium demanded on equity investments. In contrast, one of us has argued

that these phenomena explain the relatively modest rise in promised new-issue

debt yields (decline in real after—tax yields), but not the sharp decline in

share values (Hendershott 1981).



4Shiller (1979) has suggested that changes in long-term bond coupon rates have
                                    —38—



been largely unanticipated.



5Huston McCulloch has constructed the unanticipated changes in long-term

Treasury coupon rates in the 1947-77 period. These data are discussed in

Appendix B and are employed in the econometric work in Parts 2 and 4 below.



6Th• comparison is reported in Hendershott (1982).



7The annualized geometric return over N periods on an asset earning R in

 period i is [II(l+R.)-l]'2.
             i=l    1



8Both of these series are described in Appendix B.




10
  We value (l_Td)R2O — g at zero and p at 0.06.




11Because there was also weak evidence that equities earned negative returns

relative to bonds around business cycle peaks, a negative turnaround dummy

variable was defined analogously to the positive one and tested. The

coefficient on this variable was never near a standard error from zero in any

bond or equity equation.



'2The Livingston survey data have been questioned by Pearce (1979) on the

grounds that they are not rationa1" and are less consistent with observed
                                        —39—




bill rates than are rational inflation expectations. On the other hand,

Mishkin (1981) is unsure that the the Livingston data are irrational, and

Carlson (1981) makes a strong argument that "irrationality" might not be

surprising.



13The precise series used equals (1. + UNINFA/lOOY1"12 - 1, where UNINFA is

from the semiannual data base listed in Appendix C.



'4When Carlson and Kling (1982) specify expected inflation from an ARIMA model

and test for lead or lags between unexpected inflation and real activity via

bivariate autoregressions, they, too, find price surprises leading real

activity negatively.



15The Durbin—Watson statistics for the equations in Table 2.1 vary between

2.25 and 2.45.



16See Bodie (1976), Jaffee and Madelker (1976), Nelson (1976), and Fama and

Schwert (1977).



17The Durbin-Watson statistics for the equity equations over the different

time periods vary between 1.95 and 2.15.



18The equation might be interpreted as suggesting a higher tax rate on

dividends; with t,R2O/(.55 R20 +.04) as the regressor, the coefficients would

sum   to   —.45. With AR2O/(R20 +.04) as the regressor, the coefficients sum to

—0.75.
                                      —40—




l8aThere is an alternative interpretation. Because unanticipated inflation is

greatest precisely when oil shocks occurred, this variable may be capturing

nothing more than the negative impact on share values of the unexpected

increase in energy prices. We will attempt to distinguish between these two

interpretations in future work.



19The "true" constant term which abstracts from political cycle effects is

obtained as the sum of the coefficients on the political dummies and four

times the estimated constant, all divided by 4. For equations (3) and (4)

the true constants are 0.0063 and 0.0059.



20The data are from their Table 2, p. 17.



21The spread between private rates and bills could also be affected by changes

in risk and in the level of interest rates. The latter could matter because

the income from private securities is taxed at the state and local level while

that from bills is not.



22
     The CD rates are first of month data recorded by Salomon Brothers.



       Cochraine—Orcutt semi—difference transformation --   with   a semi-difference

parameter of 0.15 to 0.25 —-    lowers the equation standard error for all of the
equations in Table 3.1 but hardly changes the coefficient estimates.
                                     —41—



24Thus the result is also consistent with Mishkin's findings (1981) for

quarterly data from the 1953-79 period. When the lagged inflation rate is

added to equation (3.2), the procedure followed by Mishkin, the coefficient is

0.3 and the coefficient on the bill rate declines by a similar amount.



25For the derivation of a non-zero    from a structural model, see Melvin

(1982)




26The Federal Reserve's capacity utilization rate for manufacturing averaged

84.3 percent during 1953-69 versus 81.4 percent for 1970-80. With a desired

ratio of 90 percent, this is a 50 percent increase in the shortfall.



27The result differs from Mishkin (1981) who does not find a significant

implied relationship between real bill rates and either real GNP growth, the

GNP gap, or the unemployment rate.



28When the lagged inflation rate is added to equation (4), a coefficient of

0.18 is estimated with a standard error of 0.05, and all other coefficients

decline by roughly 18 percent. That is, the result is consistent with a very

short lagged response (18 percent after the first month) to all variables.

                        Appendix A: Granger Causality Tests



         The purpose of this appendix is to investigate the information content

of past returns on bonds (equities) in determining equity (bond) yields after

accounting for past yields on equities (bonds). The role of the inflation

rate is examined in this context both by introducing it as a determining

factor for asset yields as well as by comparing the behavior of nominal and

real asset yields.

       The statistical tool we use here corresponds to a statistical test for

exogeneity commonly known as the Granger causality test. It should be empha-

sized that the word causality is used here only in the restrictive sense of

predictability. More specifically, we say that a time series X Granger

causes another time series                if we are able to better predict     in the sense

of a lower mean squared prediction error by using the past values of both X

and      than by employing only the past values of Y.

          Specifying the predictor to be a linear one, the test involves

regressing      on lagged Ye's and X's, i.e.,



          k1            k2
   Y =
    t
             c.Y
              it—i
                   +    Z .X
                           it—i      ..                                      (A)
         i=i           i=l




If the parameters .,     i=l,.   .
                                     ,k2,   are significantly different from zero, then

X Granger causes or is informative in the prediction of                  In order to test

the predictive content of             in determining X, the roles of         and X in (A)

are reversed.

      If, contrary to (A), the relevant information set contains variables other
                                  -I2-




than      and     then the above regression test may show spurious causality

between X and       if the other variable leads both X and Y. Given the

results of the previous section, it is therefore highly probable that a test

of the predictive relationship between corporate bonds and stocks will reveal

Granger causality; the causality being the result of shocks that are common to

both stocks and bonds.

          In our tests, we specify k1=k2=6. It is felt that 6 months is long

enough to reflect any price adjustments. A constant term and time trend are

added to (A) in the estimation to capture the presence of deterministic

components.

        In Table Al we report the results of the tests of the bivariate rela-

tionships between equity and debt returns. The overlapping sample periods

reported are the entire sample 1926-1980, the pre-Treasury Accord period

1926-1952, the pre-Treasury Accord period after the Great Depression 1933-

1952, and the post-Accord span of 1953-1980. Reported are the F-statistics

for tests of the null hypothesis that all the 's in (A) are zero. The tests

are performed for both the nominal and real rates of return.

       With one exception, returns on government bonds or bills contain no

informative content in the prediction of equity returns. The reverse is also

supported. The sole exception is the informativeness of government bonds in

predicting stock returns during the post-Accord period. As for common stocks

and corporate bonds, the latter Granger—caused the former when the whole

sample is utilized. However, when sub-periods of the entire sample are

examined, the causality is in the opposite direction with corporate bonds

leading stocks for the 1926—1952 period. When the Depression years are

excluded from the 1926—1952 period, no causality in either direction was

observed. Finally, both equity and corporate bonds appear to be valuable in

predicting one another in the Post—Accord period. These observations are

virtually unchanged whether real or nominal returns are used.

      In Table A2, we reexamine the results of Table Al by focusing on

nominal returns but with past inflation rates        added as a possible

additional source of information. The results indicate that past inflation

rates by themselves do not contain information content. Moreover, the same

conclusions drawn from Table Al with respect to common stocks and corporate

bonds can be drawn from Table A2 when the null hypothesis tested is that both

past X and I have no informative content in predicting Y once one has

accounted for past values of Y. Also similar to Table Al, in general no

distinct causal patterns emerges when government bonds or bills are used in

place of corporate bonds.

      To summarize, the results indicate the usefulness, in the post-Accord

period, of past corporate bond (stock) returns in predicting current corporate

stock (bond) returns even after allowing for the presence of past corporate

stock (bond) returns. This result is observed when either nominal or real

returns are used as well as when past inflation rates are added as additional

sources of information. As for government bonds or bills when examined with

stocks, no consistent lead or lag relationships were uncovered. It may very

well be that the Granger causalities observed for corporate bonds and stocks

are due to variables other than the inflation rate that affect both the

variables being examined.

                       Appendix B: The McCulloch Data

       Our analysis   of ex post bond and   equity   returns   employed changes

in   the long term, new issue equivalent Treasury bond rate arid the unanti-
cipated change in this    rate as regressors.        Both of these variables
have   been computed by Huston McCulloch (1975, 1977) who developed a

technique of curve—fitting the term structure of interest rates from

security prices so as to determine implicit forward interest rates as

precisely as possible. At each point in time for which Treasury security

prices are available, a discount function is estimated, using a cubic

spline tax-adjusted technique, to give the value at these points of

a promise to repay a dollar at alternative future dates. Before-tax

equivalent instantaneous forward rates, single payment yields, and

par bond yields were calculated from the parameters of the splire discount

curve for maturities sufficiently close to allow linear interpolation

to all desired intermediate points. The tax adjustment was especially

important in the late l960s and early 1970s when all long term Treasury

bonds were selling at substantial discounts owing to effective restrictions

against new issues between 1965 arid 1973 and the sharp rise in interest

rates after the mid l960s (see Cook and Hendershott, 1978).

       Except for tax-exempt and selected flower bonds (those whose

prices were determined by the flower bond characteristic), virtually

all U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds have been analyzed monthly since

January 1947 (McCulloch updates the file a number of times per year).

The data presented in columns (4) and (3) of Table             are the level and

change in the new issue equivalent semi-annual coupon yields on 20 year

Treasury   bonds or on the longest possible maturity computable with
                                                B2


MCulloch's       technique. During the 1952-81 period the longest maturity

was   below    19 years only in the 1970-72 period.

       Column       (1   of Table      contains McCulloch's        measure   of unanticipated

monthly changes in the longest term Treasury rates, ignoring liquidity

premia (MCulloch, 1977, Appendix 3). This is the difference between the

one-month forward par bond yield and the observed corresponding spot

par bond yield one month later.

       In our analysis of semiannual changes in long-term interest rates,

we have updated McCulloch's data on a semiannual basis. Here, we compute

the difference between six-month forward par bond yields (b*) and the

observed corresponding spot par bond yield six months hence (R201).

The   unanticipated change (tJNL) is thus

         UNL    =           -   b*,
                    R201

where   b* is the semi-annual coupon rate that will make the value of a

bond in six months, evaluateclat the current term structure, just equal

to par, discounted to the present using the current term structure. To make the

calculations, we use as inputs McCulloch's semi-annual coupons (y) on

six month (0.5 years) and 20 1/2 year bonds and continuous single-point

par discount yields (d) on the same maturity bonds. First, the semi-

annual coupons are converted to continuous equivalents


        c = 2 log(l +           y/2)   for maturities 0.5 and 20.5.


Second, the continuous forward par bond yield is computed as



                                  e05d0.5
                                            -       e2OSd20.
         -
                                                         -
               [1 -
                      e2Sd2O.5]/c20
                                                -
                                                    [1       e05d0.5]/c0'5
Finally, this continuous yield is converted to a semiannual coupon

equivalent:


     b* =   2(e2   1).



     Unanticipated changes for the first half of 1977 (December 1976--

average of beginning and end of month values- -to June 1977) through the

first half of 1982 are listed in Appendix C.

     The percentage changes in yields employed in the stock return

equations are the changes (R2O or UN) divided by the end of period

value of R20.

                                  Appendix C

                   Unanticipated Inflation and Growth in
             Industrial Production: The Semiannual Data Base




      Livingston collects data in May and November each year on the expected

levels of the consumer price index and industrial production in the following

December (for the May forecast) or the next June (for the December forecast).

The annualized anticipated inflation rate is then computed from the difference

between the forecasted price index and the level when the forecast was made.

These data have been kindly supplied by Donald Mullineaux of the Philadelphia

Federal Reserve Bank and have been calculated following the procedure reported

in Carlson (1977).

      Unanticipated industrial production growth between May and December,

say, is computed as the difference between the actual December level and that

forecast for December in the previous May, all divided by the May value. This

series is multiplied by 100 to convert it to percentage points. The actual or

observed data were collected from issues of the Business Conditions Digest and

the Federal Reserve Bulletin. The first published number was utilized and

care was taken to maintain consistency in base years in each calculation.

      Unanticipated inflation is the difference between the actual inflation

rate between, say, May and December, and that forecasted in May. On the

assumption that the April consumer price index was known at the time of the

December forecast, the actual inflation rate was computed as the compounded

inflation between May and December and then annualized and converted to

percentage points. More precisely,




    ACTINF = 100           (1 +
                                  15

                                     -C2 -




where I is the monthly inflation rate. The unanticipated inflation variable

employed in the monthly inflation and equity returns equations is obtained as

(1 +    UNINFA/l00)12     -1.

           The fiscal surprise variable is taken from von Furstenberg (1981, Table

9, p. 373) for the 1955-78 period. It is the difference between the actual

and normal government surplus divided by net national product and converted to

percentage points by multiplication by 100. The difference is the residual

from a regression equation in which the percentage GNP gap, the lagged change

in the unemployment rate and the difference between actual and officially

forecasted inflation rates are employed as regressors. The second and fourth

quarter values of the surprise variable are used for the June and December

data. For 1979 and 1980, this variable has been arbitrarily set equal to

zero.

        For the December 1954 to December 1976 period, the unanticipated change

in the new issue Treasury coupon rate is taken from McCulloch's data (see our

Appendix B). In order to center the data at mid June and mid December, the

change during the second half of the year is defined as one-half of the June 1

-   July   1 change plus the total change from July 1 to December 1 plus one-half

the change from December 1 to January 1. For the half year periods since

1976, we have extended McCulloch's data in the manner described in Appendix B.

        The annualized six—month inflation forecast (the 551 number refers to

the forecast for the second half of 1955 made in May), annualized

unanticipated inflation, unanticipated growth in industrial production (not

annualized), the fiscal surprise (percentage points of net national product),

the unanticipated change in the coupon rate, this change divided by the

beginning of period level of the new issue coupon, and the latter are all

listed in Tble C. All data are in percentage points.
