Evaluation of Exchange-Rate, Capital Market, and Dollarization Regimes in the Presence of Sudden
Stops

                                            ABSTRACT

The literature has not being able to identify clear-cut real effects of exchange-rate regimes on output

growth. Similarly, no definitive view emerges from the literature in regard to the effects of open

capital markets on macroeconomic performance. The paper attributes the failure of the literature to

fundamental flaws, consisting of ignoring non-linearities in the effects of exchange rate and capital-

market liberalization regimes, on the macroeconomic performance. The paper develops a

methodology consisting of accounting for the ““crisis-prone state of the economy””, summarized by

a projected probability of crisis, due to sudden stops in international capital inflows. We apply the

new methodology to a cross-country panel of 100 low and middle-income countries. Findings

indicate that the effects of exchange rate regimes, and liberalization regimes, on macroeconomic

performance go through two distinct channels: a direct channel via the real side of the economy, and

an indirect channel via the financial side, which influences the probability of sudden stops. We also

analyze how the projected probability of sudden stops affects the level of dollarization, and provide

estimates for the effect of dollarization on growth.

                                       I. INTRODUCTION

The choice of macroeconomic policies is traditionally cast in terms of the well-known tri-

lemma. This is a way of describing succinctly a choice among three policy goals: pegging the

exchange rate, keeping the capital markets open, or conducting a business-cycle stabilizing

monetary policy. The tri-lemma arises because only two of these policy goals can be

achieved at any point of time. But often there is an additional policy goal: keeping the

economy out of sudden stops to international capital flows, or other violent types of financial

crises. 2 The literature, however, often ignores this aspect of the policy-regime choice

problem.

We challenge two established puzzles in the international macroeconomics. The first puzzle

is the failure of the literature to find any systematic difference in the macroeconomic process

across exchange rate regimes. The second is the absence of any empirical relation between

macroeconomic performance and capital-account liberalization. We attribute the failure of

the literature to address these puzzles to a fundamental flaw. It consists of ignoring non-

linearities in the effect of exchange-rate regimes, and capital-account liberalization regimes,

on macroeconomic performance. Specifically, the literature ignores a latent crisis state of the

economy, which is summarized by an estimated probability of crisis. Our analysis focuses on

the evaluation exchange rate regimes and capital-market liberalization regimes, in the

presence of sudden stops.




2
    In fact, therefore, the policy choice problem is a Polly-lemma; rather than a Tri-lemma.

Macroeconomic theory has long recognized that there exist positive effects of the exchange

rate peg regime on macroeconomic performance. The idea is that by fixing their currencies to

international moneys (the dollar, the euro, or the yen), fiscally-disciplined emerging

economies, could rapidly accumulate exchange reserves through export growth, and maintain

a high saving ratio, which would provide certainty to business and profit margins to

investors. Such a policy environment leads to a low and stable domestic rate of interest, and

thus enables the economy to retain the confidence of international investors.



However, every major international economic crisis of the past 15 years (save Brazil in 2002)

has been rooted in rigid exchange rate regimes. As Stanley Fischer (2001) succinctly

observed: “Each of the major international capital market-related crises since 1994--Mexico,

in 1994, Thailand, Indonesia and Korea in 1997, Russia and Brazil in 1998, and Argentina

and Turkey in 2000--has in some way involved a fixed or pegged exchange rate regime. At

the same time, countries that did not have pegged rates--among them South Africa, Israel in

1998, Mexico in 1998, and Turkey in 1998--avoided crises of the type that afflicted emerging

market countries with pegged rates.”



Indeed, there has been a long-standing view that an emerging economy under a peg, with

government budget imbalances, trade deficits, and the presence of free-market policies that

facilitate the outflow of capital, is likely to become vulnerable to sudden stops of capital
                                                5




inflows, hence, to balance of payments crises. A “sudden stops” crisis often entails a

financial or currency crisis, accompanied by a sharp fall in output. 3

The idea, put forth in the present paper is that a fixed exchange rate, or open capital markets,

may be good, or may be bad, for macroeconomic performance, through multiple channels:

the traditional trade channel and the financial crisis channel. Therefore, a fixed exchange rate

regime may be bad if it generates a big increase in the probability of sudden stop crises, to a

degree that dominates the positive effect through the direct channel; and vice versa.



A related policy-evaluation issue is dollarization, and its effect on the macroeconomic

performance. The “original sin” concept, introduced by Barry Eichengreen and Ricardo

Haussman (1999), explain the consequences for emerging markets of abrupt departures from

an exchange rate peg regimes due to sudden stops in capital inflows. The “original sin”

concept underpins a crucial vulnerability of the economy under peg regimes. The phrase

refers to the inability of a country to borrow abroad in its own currency, because no foreign

creditor is willing to gamble on the potential exchange rate instability. A plausible

explanation for the widespread use in dollarized debt is that countries are forced into this

position because their monetary and fiscal policies lack credibility. If a country issued debt in

domestic currency, it would have an incentive to inflate its way out of debt. Investors, who

expect that the government will succumb to such temptation, refuse to buy domestic


3
  For an early analytical approach to the problem of sudden stops, see Calvo (1998). Among
recent papers on sudden-stops’ vulnerability, and its relation to fixed exchange rate regimes,
see also Calvo (2000), Calvo, Reinhart and Vegh (1995), Chang and Velasco (2000), Ghosh,
Gulde and Wolf (2000), Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995) and Williamson (2000).

currency-denominated debt papers. 4 In net terms, the foreign currency liabilities of residents

of developing and transition countries usually exceed their assets in foreign currencies,

implying that they are exposed to exchange rate risk on their balance sheets, as well as

through trade. Issues of both sovereign and corporate bonds on international markets are

overwhelmingly in foreign currencies, even in the case of an advanced economy such as

Korea, or a country whose exchange rate is strongly pegged to the U.S. dollar, such as

Argentina in the 1990s. 5



The organization of the paper is as follows. In section II we survey related empirical

literature. In section III we provide a discussion of a background theoretical framework,

which can serve as a guide to the empirical analysis. Section IV describes the econometric

methodology. In section V we describe the data. Section VI reports on the main econometric

findings concerning the role of the crisis probability in the evaluations of policy regimes.

Section VII provides an empirical analysis of the dollarization channel. In section VIII we


4
  Indeed, ninety seven percent of all debt, placed in international markets between 1999 and
2001, was denominated in five currencies: the US dollar, the euro, the yen, the pound sterling
and the Swiss franc. This feature of emerging markets' borrowing in the international market
leads to balance-sheet type of currency crises, as formalized by Krugman (2000), and
Schneider and Tornell (2000).

  Part of this exchange rate risk can be hedged, although only (in the aggregate for a given
developing country) to the limited extent that nonresidents are willing to hold local currency
exposure. Large cross-holdings of foreign assets and liabilities means that the valuation
channel of exchange rate adjustment has grown in importance, relative to the traditional trade
balance channel. In this context, see also Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2004), for an empirical
analysis of the inter-connections between capital account openness and the exchange rate
adjustment process.

bring inflation crises into the empirical analysis; we also perform robustness tests, by using

alternative classification of exchange rate regimes, and analyzing a sub-sample of the 100-

country sample. Section IX provides a diagrammatic exposition of the fundamental non-

linear effects of the exchange rate regimes, capital openness, and dollarization, based on the

estimation. Finally, section X provides conclusions, caveats, and extensions.



                               II. RELATED EMPIRICAL LITERATURE



Strikingly, the empirical literature has not been able to identify clear-cut real effects of

exchange-rate regimes on the open economy. Indeed, Marianne Baxter and Alan Stockman

(1989) and Robert Flood and Andy Rose (1995) find that there are no significant differences

in business cycles across exchange rate regimes. A recent study Frankel and Wei (2004)

explores how output lost in crises is related to various controls, including the exchange rate

flexibility, currency mismatch, FDI, etc. The exchange rate flexibility variable is not

statistically significant. 6



6
  See however a recent study by Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenneger (2001), who find real effects
of exchange-rate regime in cross-country data. Another exception is Rose (2000). In the
paper, Rose uses evidence from existing currency unions in the world economy to estimate
the effect of currency unions on international trade. Rose finds that a currency union (which
is an extreme form of a peg) expands bilateral trade between two average member countries
by a huge proportion (200%, and more). Rose's currency union effects were reduced
substantially when fixed country effects were incorporated in the analysis. Persson (2001)
challenged Rose’s analysis, but also finds a significant, albeit modest, effect of currency
unions. Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) demonstrated the importance of including
country fixed effects in gravity models. Although commonly estimated gravity equations
generally have a very good fit to the data, they show that they are not theoretically grounded
and prone to lead to biased estimation. They applied the method to solve the border puzzle.
                                                                                     (continued)

Similarly, no definitive view emerges as to the aggregate effects of capital account

liberalization. Eichengreen (2001) who reviews the literature, points to ambiguities in the

rather complex role played by capital account liberalization; and Rodrik (1998) finds no

significant statistical association between capital account openness and growth. A recent

study by Prasad et al (2005) finds that it is difficult to establish a robust causal relationship

between the degree of financial integration and growth performance for developing
             7
countries.



                     III. THEORY AS A G UIDE TO EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS


Paul Krugman (2000) proposes a stylized “sudden stops” model, based on the self-fulfilling

expectation equilibrium (sun spots’ equilibrium), to make sense of the number and nature of

the emerging market crises of 1997-98. Credit is constrained by the borrower’s net worth,

whose value is indexed to the real exchange rate, because of dollarization. The real exchange


They find specifically that borders reduce bilateral national trade levels by plausible though
substantial magnitudes.

  A more definite view concerning positives effects of capital account liberalization on
output, which is advanced by Fischer (1998), is supported by some evidence, provided by
Quinn (1997). The role of pre-existing policies, and of trade-account vs. capital-account
sequencing, in determining the effects of capital control liberalization on growth and
investment, is examined by Arteta, Eichengreen and Wyplosz (2001), Chinn and Ito (2002),
and Tornell, Westermann, and Martinez (2004). A recent evaluation of this literature by
Prasad et al. (2004) also yields inconclusive result. It shows no significant relationship
between financial openness and growth in real per capita income across countries, even after
controlling for a series of standard explanatory variables (initial income, initial schooling,
investment-GDP ratio, political instability, and regional dummies. See also Ariyoshi et al
(2000), Bhagwati (1998), Edwards (1999, 2000) and Kaplan and Rodrik (2000).

rate and aggregate investment are jointly driven by exogenous aggregate volume of exports.

The model is extended in Razin and Rubinstein (2004) to fit into a class of models with a

unique equilibrium (i.e., with no sunspots). The extension builds on the recent global-games

models (as in Morris and Shin (2000). The extended model posits an exogenous stochastic

process for the fundamentals (e.g., aggregate export volumes) that foreign creditors estimate

based on public and private information. The framework features a double guessing game by

the foreign creditors, who receive noisy signals. First, each foreign creditor assesses the

realized state of the domestic economy fundamentals; and, second, he/she guesses the

likelihood of the credit extension-withdrawal action that all the other foreign creditors are

going to take, given the signals they receive. A rational-expectations equilibrium of this

global game is the set of self fulfilling guesses so that the level of domestic investment

implicit in the credit offers must match the actual level of investment that takes place given

those offers. Importantly, the equilibrium is summarized by a unique projected crisis

probability, directly linked to the level of aggregate domestic investment. An essential

feature of the equilibrium is the existence of some thresholds in the value of some synthetic

index of fundamentals (e.g., aggregate export volumes) that separate “crisis states” from “no

crisis states”. Building on such global-games framework of crises implies that foreign

creditors decide whether to keep lending to the country (be long on foreign currency)

depending on whether their estimate of the fundamentals is above or below an endogenous

equilibrium threshold. The position of the threshold depends: (a) on the distribution of the

fundamentals; (b) on the stochastic features of the process through which information reaches

foreign creditors; as well as (c) on the policy regime. See Box 1 for a formal description of

the model of sudden stops.

                             IV. ECONOMETRIC M ETHODOLOGY


The dependent variable is the GDP growth rate, as an indicator of macroeconomic

performance. Policy-regime variables are modeled as dummy variables, capturing policy-

regime switches (whether a country switches from float to peg, or whether a country is

imposing capital controls). We use lagged policy-regime dummies as instruments. The state

of the economy is conceived as a continuous latent variable, capturing the strength of the

exogenous fundamentals; and indicating the “crisis-prone states of nature”. When this

variable moves beyond a certain threshold, there is a “crisis-prone state”. The latent variable

is derived via a probit model, assessing the probability of having a crisis in the current year.

The probit is specified using the same policy dummies as above, plus lagged sudden stops

crises, government budget deficit, initial GDP per capita, etc. In Box 2 we describe the

formal econometric model.

                                   [BOX 2 ABOUT HERE]

The main goal of this methodology is to capture the non-linear effect of policy on

macroeconomic outcomes, depending on the “crisis state” of the economy, as projected by

market participants. 8

  Nesting a probit estimate in a panel may raise in general issues in the distribution of the
error. Often, a noisy explanatory variable may bias the standard errors in the second-stage
growth regression. A bias in the standard errors exists when the latent variable, although
being known to the economic agent, is, however unknown to the econometrician. This issue
is mute in our case because the projected probability of the “crisis-prone state” is the same
                                                                                      (continued)
1     Box 1: Theory as a Guide to the Empirical

      Model
There are N domestic entrepreneurs, who are single mindfully engaged in wealth
accumulation, and N foreign creditors, who supply the credit necessary for do-
mestic investment. Let Ita denote investment in capacity by the individual
entrepreneur, and the leverage is speci…ed as times the entrepreneur’s net
worth, W. Let yt , Ft 1 ; and pt ; denote domestic output (produced by a Cobb-
Douglas technology with a capital input income share ); initial debt, indexed
to foreign goods, and the relative price of foreign goods in terms of domestic
goods (the real exchange rate), respectively.The foreign lender imposes a limit
on the entrepreneur borrowings so that the investment, Ita ; is constrained by
    Ita (1+ )Wt ,
    where, Wt = yt pt Ft 1 ; is the entrepreneur’s net worth.
    The real exchange rate which clears the goods market is given by:
    pt = [1 (1 )(1 ~ )]Yt (1 )It ;

gregate output, respectively; the coe¢ cient denotes the marginal propensity
                       ~
to import, and Xt denotes the stochastic volume of exports, expressed in terms
of foreign goods. Evidently, an increase aggregate investment spending trig-
gers real appreciation through a ”transfer problem” mechanism (see Krugman
(2000). The foreign creditor will extend credit to its domestic entrepreneur’s
counterpart, if
             pt
    (1+rt ) pt+1   (1 + r );
    where, r and r* denote the marginal productivity of capital and the foreign
interest rate, respectively. Figure B.1 shows the equilibrium outcomes for three
                           ~
values of exports, Xt , in the case of full public information. With high exports,
the equilibrium investment is governed by the rate of return conditions. In the
low export equilibrium, the entrepreneur is insolvent and the credit constraint
is binding. Thus, investment is equal to zero. In the intermediate case there are
multiple equilibrium investment outcomes, due to a expectations-coordination
failure.

  The equation of the latent variable, Y2;j;t , is a linear function of policy-regime
dummies (D1; D2 ) and a vector of controls (Z):

              Y2;j;t =   2 Zj;t   +   2 D1;j;t   +    2 D2;j;t   +   2 Y1;j;t       + "2;j;t ;   (4)
   where, "2;j;t is a country speci…c time variant i:i:d: random shock.
   The growth rate is a linear function of the policy regime indicators (D1; D2 ),
and a vector of standard controls (X) ; as follows.

              Y1;j;t =   1 Xj;t   +   1 D1;j;t   +    1 D2;j;t   +        ^

the best predictor by the market participants of Y2;j;t .
    Typically by latent we mean that the variable is not observed by the econom-
terician but is known to the market decision makers. This is not however the
case here. Both the economterican and the market participants do not observe
the "true" Y2;j;t . They use a projection of Y2;j;t based on the right hand side
of Equation (5). Accordingly, let Pj;t = Pr(Y2;j;t = 1 j ) be the conditional
probability that country j will face a crisis in period t: That is,

          Pj;t = Pr(        2 Zj;t   +   2 D1;j;t   +    2 D2;j;t   +   2 Y1;j;t    >    "2;j;t ):       (6)

   Assume that "2;j;t          N (0; 1) : Then, the equation for Pj;t is given by

                  Pj;t =       (   2 Zj;t   +   2 D1;j;t   +   2 D2;j;t     +   2 Y1;j;t ) ;             (7)

   We use lag variables to instrument policy regime dummies, D1;j;t 1 and

mate the following equation.

       Y1;j;t =   1 Xj;t   +       1 D1;j;t 1   +   1 D2;j;t 1   +      1

Equation (9) provides consistent estimates for the parameters of interest for the
                                                                     1 ^
economterican and the market participants. Note that the term           Y2;j;t is
the actual variable the market participants use in when making decisions.It is
not the …rst- stage estimate by the econometrician of what market participant
expectations. This is in contrast to the case where the market participants do
observe the latent variable whereas the econometrician does not. In other words,
the econometrician and the market participants share the same information
set, and the latent variable is not an econometric proxy for the true variable.
Therefore, in the 2nd stage of the regression analysis in our case, there is no
need to correct for the estimates of the standard errors.

Therfore, because the peg increases the crisis probability , and the imposition
of capital controls lowers the crisis probability, we get:

    Therefore, the IV estimate for the e¤ect of exchange-rate regime on growth
is equal to:

Similarly, the IV estimate for the e¤ect of the imposition of capital controls on
growth isequal to:

    Therefore, by ignoring the projected probability of sudden stops in the eval-
uation of the e¤ect of the peg and the imposition of capital controls, the econo-
metrician understates the direct e¤ects of these regime switches. In other words,
the estimators of the e¤ect of the peg and the imposition capital controls are
biased toward zero.

Our data set consists of 100 low-and middle-income countries (43 African countries, 26

Asian countries, 26 countries from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 5 European

countries). The list of countries is shown in Table 1. The main source of data is the World

Bank (World Development Indicators and Global Development Finance). The annual data
                            9
ranges from 1971 to 2002.       We implement a binary index based on multiple categories of

the IMF classification of exchange rate regimes, for the broad sample with the 100 countries.

We also implement a binary index based on the different multiple categories of the Reinhart

and Rogoff classification of exchange rate regimes, but only for a sub-sample of 58 countries

of the 100 countries. 10 Capital-account openness is also measured as a binary index based of

restrictions on capital account transactions, reported in the IMF Annual Report on Exchange

Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. 11

We measure sudden stops’ crises by a large annual depreciation in the real exchange rate. In

doing so we attempt to capture the effects of the crisis on the real side of the economy. 12 13

Evidently, unexpected fluctuations in the real exchange rate (rather than the nominal

exchange rate) are more likely to have significant balance-sheet effects and other real side

effects. Concretely, the sudden-stops crisis is defined by sharp changes of the real exchange

rate, with a 15 percent-per-year threshold (one standard deviation in our sample).

Table 1 provides a list of countries in our broad sample. Table 2 describes the frequency of

sudden-stops crises, exchange-rate regimes, and capital-account policy switches in the broad

sample. Overall, about 22 percent of the observations are associated with sudden-stops crises;

an average of 1 percent to 4 percent of the observations indicate a float-to-peg, peg-to-float,

switches to capital-controls, or switches to liberalization.




12
   Typically in the currency crisis literature sudden stops are measured by free falls in the
nominal exchange rate. However, this does not distinguish between domestic price crises and
balance-of-payments crises. In our indicator, crisis episodes do not include, therefore,
countries which suffer from bouts of high inflation and currency depreciation, but with a
relatively stable real exchange rate, because they do not qualify to be classified as balance-
of-payments crises. Evidently, the real exchange rate measure for crisis is strongly correlated
with sharp reversals in the current-account balance. See Milesi-Ferretti and Razin (2000). See
also Calvo, Izquierdo and Majia (2004) on sudden stops and real exchange rate
fluctuations.
13
   Calvo, Izquierdo, and Mejia (2004) find that real exchange rate fluctuations coming hand
in hand with sudden stops are a unique phenomenon in emerging-market economies. They
use a sample of 32 developing countries, to analyze the empirical characteristics of sudden
stops in capital flows and their relations to balance sheet effects. See also Bacchetta, Aghion
and Banerjee (2001), Krugman (2000), Allen, Rosenberg, Keller, Sester, and Roubini (2002),
and Eichengreen and Hausmann (1999).

                                        VI. M AIN EMPIRICAL FINDINGS


We begin by reporting on the estimated effects of a regime switch. We start with the effects

of policy-regime switch, float to peg, peg to float, liberalization to capital controls, and

capital controls to liberalization. We do so, with, and without country fixed effects. To

underscore the role of the probability of sudden stops, we estimate each specification twice;

that is, including and excluding the probability of a crisis. We report our findings in Table 3.



In the benchmark case where the crisis probability is absent from the growth equation, we

find negligible effects of peg and liberalization policy dummies on growth, with and without

fixed country effects; as expected from the traditional literature.



(i) Policy-Regime Determinants of Growth

Controlling for the crisis probability in the growth equation, in column (I) and (iii) of Table

3, the coefficients of the policy dummies are significant in the growth equation, with and

without fixed country effects. The coefficient of the crisis probability in the growth equation

is negative: barely significant without country fixed effects, but highly significant with

country fixed effects.

(ii) Policy-Regime Determinants of the Probability of Crisis

In the lower panel of Table 3 one can see that the probability of crises increases with a switch

to peg, and falls with the imposition of capital controls, by about the same order of
                                                14




magnitude (almost 30 percent). Note that the coefficients of the policy dummies in the probit

equation are highly significant, both with and without country fixed effects.

(iii) Reduced-Form Marginal Effect of a Switch in the Policy Regime

Observe that both the reduced-form marginal effect of a switch to peg, and the imposition of

capital controls, is small. 14 This is evidently consistent with the small coefficient of the

policy dummy in the benchmark growth equation. This is also a typical finding in the

traditional literature. In our case, however, the statement applies only to the sample average.

Because the probit equation is non-linear and the growth equation is linear, for any country-

specific and time specific cases, one effect may strictly dominate the other, or vice versa. The

non-linearity is illustrated in section IX.



We now address some potential econometric issues.

Is there a self-selection issue? When the crisis probability is very high, a successful switch to

peg can only be implemented by countries for which governments have some strong belief

about the health of domestic economic fundamentals (like the case of Hong Kong during the

Asian crises). Thus, the conclusion that a switch to peg is good for growth in state of very

high probability of crisis may not be valid because it may be based on a self-selection of

countries, from a pool of countries, where the same crisis probability presumably

corresponds to different fundamentals. This self-selection problem does not, however, arise


14
   The reduced-form marginal effect is calculated as follows. The coefficient of a policy
dummy in the probit is multiplied by the coefficient of the crisis probability in the growth
equation. The product is in turn added to the coefficient of the corresponding policy dummy
in the growth equation.
                                               15




in our case, because we control for country fixed effects. The country fixed effects

effectively capture the main characteristics of the health of the country domestic economic

fundamentals.

Is there an endogeneity issue, concerning the crisis probability in the growth equation?

The dependency of the growth rate on crisis probability originates in effect from the country

characteristics, which again are captured by the exogenous country fixed effects. That is, the

country fixed characteristics trigger slow growth or fast growth. At the same time they could

either increase, or reduce the crisis probability. Because country-fixed effects are exogenous,

the coefficient estimate of the crisis probability in the growth equation remains unbiased.



Table 4 provides some first-look results concerning the persistence of the effect of policy

regimes on macroeconomic performance. 15 We distinguish between the effects of regime

switch dummies and regime level dummies. This somewhat static methodology aims at

capturing persistent and transitory effects of policy regimes, in a sample which does not have

time series of other policy variables that enable full-fledged dynamic analysis. The main

findings are:

(i) Determinants of the Projected Crisis Probability

The coefficient estimates of policy regime switches, but not of the policy regime levels, are

found to be significant in the probit equation. This means that the crisis probability is




15
  Full-fledged dynamic analysis is not undertaken because the country characteristics do not
have considerable time-variation in the data.
                                                 16




sensitive to changes in policy regimes but not sensitive to whether the country is under peg or

float, or whether the capital account is open or not.

(ii) Determinants of GDP Growth

Controlling for the crisis probability in the growth equation, the coefficient estimates of both

types of the policy regime switch, as well as the two types of the policy regime level are

significant in the growth equation; albeit only in the case where country fixed effects are

excluded. Once we control for country fixed effects, only the coefficient estimates of the

policy regime switch are significant in the growth equation. The Durbin-Watson measure of

serial correlation in our regression analysis does not significantly deviate from 2,

strengthening the evidence of no level effect.

Thus, it is fair to conclude that in the broad sample of 100 countries, using the IMF

classification of exchange rate regimes, we do not have good evidence for persistent effects

of the policy dummies on growth.




                     VII. Dollarization and Sudden Stops



Different economies in our sample also have different levels of exposure to capital flow
                                                                                    16
volatility that can trigger unanticipated fluctuations in the real exchange rate.        We use the


16
     The link between dollarization and exchange rate regimes is driven by several alternative

mechanisms. Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2004) find that dollarization appears to

                                                                                          (continued)

ratio of the country’s foreign currency liabilities to its money supply (FLM), as a proxy for

the country’s foreign currency exposure to fluctuations in the real exchange rate. We address

the effect of policy-regime switch on dollarization, and the role of dollarization in the

macroeconomic process.



Table 6 provides estimates of the influence of policy-regime switch on dollarization. Column

(i) indicates that the policy regimes (a switch to peg, and the imposition of capital controls)

do not have a direct effect on dollarization. Column (ii) indicates a significant effect of the

crisis probability, as a single explanatory variable, on dollarization. Column (iii) indicates

that policy regimes do not directly affect dollarization, but only indirectly through the crisis

probability. The latter significantly explain the dollarization. With regard to the indirect

influence of policy regimes on dollarization through the effect of the regimes on the crisis

probability, recall that in Table 3 we demonstrate that a switch to a peg raises and the

imposition of capital controls reduces the probability.

We now turn to the analysis of how dollarization influences growth. Column (i) and (ii) of

Table 7 indicate that FLM, the dollarization measure, does not have any direct influence on


increase exchange rate pass-through. This mechanism may reinforce the claim that the “fear

of floating” is a greater problem for developing economies, with highly dollarized debt. The

role of balance sheet effects, the linkage between currency risk and country risk, and the

impact of dollarization on trade are analyzed in Levy Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003). See

also Calvo and Reinhart (2000).

growth, once we control for the actual realization of sudden stops’ crisis. The crisis, as

expected, reduces growth, and in a significant way. In column (iii) of Table 7 we introduce

the interaction between dollarization and the realized sudden stops. The coefficient of the

interaction term is negative and highly significant. This means that, although dollarization

does not have an independent influence on growth, the interaction between dollarization and

the actual crisis, tend to reduce the growth rate drastically.

This means that the following policy-regime induced mechanism may have been at work in

the sample. The imposition of capital controls tend to lower the probability of sudden stops;

and the decrease in the probability of sudden stops, in turn, tend to raise the level of

dollarization. If a crisis actually occurs, then the growth rate diminishes. If, however the

crisis does not materialize, then growth is unaffected.



                 VIII. Inflation Crises and Robustness Tests

The literature has been dealing extensively with the relation between inflation and growth.

Bruno and Easterly (1998) assume that inflation has substantial adverse effects on the

economy only beyond a certain threshold. They find that growth falls sharply during discrete

high inflation crises; then growth recovers quickly after inflation falls below the threshold.

The Bruno-Easterly methodology is based on the actual realization of inflation crises. Our

methodology points out to the role of a latent “crisis-prone state”, estimated by a continuous

crisis probability function. This means the even if the crisis does not materialize, the crisis

probability could be sufficiently big to affect the rate of growth. In this section we consider

the effect of domestic price crises in addition to sudden stops’ crises.
                                                19




With regard to exchange rate regimes, we switch, in this section, to the Reinhart-Rogoff

classification. The alternative classification applies to only a subset of the original sample of

100 countries. Accordingly, in this section we perform a variety of robustness tests: sample-

robustness, and regression-specification. Table 8 describes the frequency of currency and

price crises in the sub-sample. Sudden stops’ episodes appear in 65.5 percent of observations,

whereas domestic-price-crisis episodes occur in 46.1 percent of the observations. Table 9

describes the frequency of switches to peg, and switches to float in the sub-sample. Both

types of policy-regime switch occur in about 10 percent of the total of the sub-sample

observations.



Column (i) in Table 10 (using the Reinhart-Rogoff classification in the sub-sample ), is

analogous to column (iv) in Table 3 (using the IMF classification in the broad sample of 100

countries). Qualitatively, the findings are similar: a switch to peg has a positive coefficient, a

switch to capital controls has a negative coefficient, and the crisis probability has a negative

coefficient; all estimators are statistically significant. This serves as evidence for the

robustness of our methodological approach.



In column (ii) of Table 10 the sudden stops’ probability includes the effect of the domestic

price crisis. Notice that the effect of the crisis probability on growth is barely significant. In

column (iii) we include two types of a projected probability of sudden stops: one which

includes, and the other which excludes, the effect of the price crisis. Observe that the

coefficient of the latter type of projected probability is highly significant and negative. The
                                                20




estimated coefficient is larger in absolute value than the corresponding coefficient in column

(i), Table 10. The coefficient of projected probability of sudden stops which includes the

effect of price crisis, in column (iii), is however not significant. We interpret this as evidence

that a domestic price crisis affects growth through the sudden-stops probability channel.




               IX.     FUNDAMENTAL NON- LINEARITIES


Recall that to find any systematic difference in the macroeconomic process across exchange

rate regimes, the analysis has to account for non-linearities in the effect of balance-of-

payments policy regimes on growth.

The reduced-form marginal effect of a policy-regime switch from float to peg, which

incorporates both direct and an indirect effects (which is working through the crisis

probability), is plotted as a U-shaped graph in Figures 1, against the projected probability. In

the two extreme ranges (when the probability is relatively low and relatively high) the

marginal effect of the policy switch is positive. In this the regime switch does not trigger a

big change in the probability, and the direct effect on growth of the regime switch dominates

the indirect effect. In the intermediate range for the probability function, the reduced-form

marginal effect of a policy-regime switch from float to peg is negative because the policy-

regime switch does not generate a big marginal increase in the probability, and the indirect

effect of the regime switch dominates the direct effect. Similarly, Figure 2 demonstrates how

the reduced-form marginal effect of a switch from capital controls to capital-account

liberalization, which incorporates both the direct and the indirect effects, depends on the
                                                21




crisis probability. The U-shaped diagram implies that the marginal effect of the policy switch

is positive, in the extreme ranges of the projected probability function. In contrast, in the

intermediate range the marginal effect of the policy-regime is negative because the crisis

probability is very sensitive to the policy-regime switch. Figure 3 plots the reduced-form

marginal growth effect of the regime switch to peg against the probability of sudden stops;

with and without the imposition of capital controls. Notice capital controls transformed the

U-shaped curve to a downward sloping curve, except for small values of the crisis

probability. Figure 4 plots the reduced-form marginal growth effect of the switch to peg,

against the crisis probability, for two levels of dollarization (FLM = 0.75 and FLM = 0.1).

With smaller dollarization, the U-shaped curve is flatter than with large dollariztion,

indicating the dampening effect of dollarization on the probability of crisis.




                                X. CONCLUSION AND EXTENSIONS


Our estimation implies that the overall effect of balance-of-payments regimes on

macroeconomic performance works through the direct channel and the crisis probability

channel. The latter is intrinsically non-linear. There are ranges for the set of the main

explanatory variables, for which the effect of the policy regime on the likelihood of a crisis is

substantial, whereas in other ranges the effect is unimportant. The reduced-form marginal

effect of a policy-regime switch don growth depends on the magnitude of the probability of

sudden stops crisis, and on the degree of dollarization. This means the exogenous country-

specific shocks in the sample period imply that policy-makers faced different choices with

regard to the desired exchange rate, and capital-account liberalization, regimes.

We list a few caveats.

The data have little time variation concerning the country-specific fiscal and monetary

policies, which does not enable a full-fledged dynamic analysis. Accordingly, the

econometric methodology is effectively static.

The background theory posits that optimizing agents will design their portfolio strategies

based on expectations about policy rules. It is not necessary that a switch from float to peg

has the same meaning in different policy and institutional environments. On the other hand,

policy rules may be endogenous in an environment vulnerable to sudden stops.

To take care of the issue of the endogeneity of policy regimes we had to resort to lagged

policy regime dummies, as instruments.

Indicators of capital controls used in the analysis do not distinguish between controls on

inflows and outflows. These two types of controls may have quite different effects on capital

inflows, and therefore on the probability of sudden stops.

The IMF empirical definition of exchange rate regimes is based on formal government

statements. The Reinhart-Rogoff classification is based on an empirical algorithm, clustering

ex-post behavior. Both are not pure rule-based proxies, as our framework assumes.

We discuss two extensions.

It has been a well-discussed view that openness to trade makes countries less vulnerable to

sudden stops. Rose (2002) argues that the threatened penalty of lost trade is the answer to the

puzzle “why do countries seldom default on their international debt?”. He offers empirical

evidence that strong trade links are correlated with low default probabilities. But strong trade

links are expected also to correlate with growth rates. Thus trade openness may have two

reinforcing effects on growth: a direct effect on the growth process, and an indirect effect on
                                                23




growth through the probability of sudden stops. A useful extension is to apply our

methodology also to international - trade regimes.

Another extension is to consider also the choice between monetary policy rules. Different

rules influence the probability of bank runs (as in Diamond and Diving (1983)), and the

probability of stock market crashes, in different ways. Proper evaluation of monetary rules

(exchange rate target, monetary aggregates target, or interest target) can internalize the effect

of these rules on the probability of financial crises; similar to our analysis of the evaluation of

balance of payments regimes.
