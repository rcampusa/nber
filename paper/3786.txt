          THE THEORY OF ALLOCATION AND ITS IMPLICATIONS
              FOR MARKETING AND INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE


                            ABSTRACT

     This paper identifies a cost of using the price system and
from that develops a general theory of allocation. The theory
explains why a buyer's stochastic purchasing behavior matters to
a seller. This leads to a theory of optimal customer mix much
akin to the theory of optimal portfolio composition. It is the
ob  of a firm's marketing department to put together this optimal
customer mix.
     A dynamic pattern of pricing related to Ramsey pricing
emerges as the efficient pricing structure. Price no longer
equals marginal cost and is no longer the sole mechanism used to
allocate goods. It is optimal for long term relationships to
emerge between buyers and sellers and for sellers to use their
knowledge about buyers to ration goods during periods when demand
is high. This rationing cam take the form of refusing to sell to
new customers and putting established customers on quotas. The
evidence shows that this form of rationing, though foreign to the
thinking of most economists, characterizes several industries.
     The theory provides an important incentive for a firm to
exist, namely to facilitate trade amongst its customers. The
theory also provides a convincing explanation for the hostility
that new futures markets face from established firms in the
industry and shows that several practices, like price differences
amongst consumers and swapping product with rivals, can be the
result of competition and not market power.

              I,     Introduction

     Microeconomics is concerned with the efficient alloca-
tion of goods.        It is typical for economists to focus on the

price system as the mechanism used to achieve this efficient
allocation.        An impersonal auction system is often in the
back of most economistst minds when they think of efficient

resource allocation.       Other mechanisms to allocate goods
such as rationing are usually considered inferior to       a   price
system and are not given much attention1         The economists
exclusive focus on price comes from an implicit assumption
that use of the price system is costless.        After all, if it
is costless to use the price system to achieve an efficient

allocation,    why not use it?
     This paper explains that economistst faith in the price

system is misplaced from the viewpoint of both theory and
evidence.     Prices alone should not be viewed as the most

efficient way of allocating goods in many industries.          The
paper identifies a cost of using the price system and from
that develops a general theory of allocation that has sig-

nificant implications for optimal allocation and industrial

organization, The theory explains the role of market making
and marketing -— and thereby provides an explanation for

important features of the modern corporation, such as




1.   Coase (1937) and Weitzman (1974) are notable
     exceptions.
marketing and planning departments,          that have received rela-

tively little attention from economists.
        The theory explains how even the most physically homo-

geneous good can be quite heterogeneous from the seller's

vantage point depending on the buyer's stochastic purchasing
characteristics, This leads to a theory of optimal customer

mix much akin    to the theory of optimal portfolio composi-

tion.     It is the job of a firm's marketing department to put

together this optimal customer mix.           A dynamic pattern   of

pricing related to optimal Ramsey pricing emerges as the
efficient pricing structure. Price no longer equals margim—
al cost and is no longer the sole mechanism used to allocate

goods.     It is natural and optimal for long term relation-

ships to emerge between buyers and sellers and for sellers

to use their knowledge about buyers to ration goods during

periods when demand is high.        This rationing can take the

form of refusing to sell to new customers and putting estab-
lished customers on quotas.         This form of rationing, though

foreign to the thinking of most economists,          seems to charac-
terize several industries,     as    I   report later on.   The theory

provides an important incentive for a firm to exist, namely
to facilitate trade amongst its customers.           The theory iden-
tifies the incentives that firms have to invest in marketing
and plmnning.    Finally,   the theory provides a convincing

explanation for the hostility that new futures markets face
from established firms in the industry and shows that
                             -4-

several practices, like price differences to consumers and

swapping product with rivals, that are often associated with
market power can instead be the result of competitive market
forces.

       This paper is organized as follows   Section II ex-

plains why it is wrong to regard the use of the price system
as free and presents some puzzling facts that do not accord

with the economic intuition from price clearing theories of
market behavior.    Section III develops the theory of optimal
allocation in the presence of a cost of using the price

system under some simple assumptions.    Sections IV, V and VI
examine equilibrium and show how to modify the theory so as

to relax several of its simple assumptions.      Section VI

explains how a firm can facilitate trade amongst its custom-
ers.   Section VII reports on empirical evidence that sup-

ports the theory.    Section VIII discusses the implications
of the theory for the role of marketing, choice of customer

mix, capital investment,   attitudes toward the development of
futures markets and swapping with rivals.    Section IX

presents conclusions.



           II.   Organizing A Market That Clears By Price
                 is Costly, and For That Reason Many

                 Markets Do Not Clear By Price
                                 -5—

        Every   economics student learns      that price adjusts so as
to equate       supply and demand.    A   (fictional) auctioneer often
is used to explain how price is set.           This auctioneer
doesn't even earn the minimum wage. All firms are assumed
to have access to the price mechanism that allows them to
costlessly market their goods. There is no need for long
term relationships between buyers and sellers and non-price
rationing never occurs.
     Most economists recognize that there an relatively few
markets like the one I just described, yet this description
is the model that guides most economists' intuition. I will
soon describe why that intuition can sometimes be misleid-
ing. Before I do that, it is worth emphasizing the costs of
setting up an auction market based on the few actual exam-
ples we have of such markets. Once the costs of setting up
an auction market are recognized, it follows irediately
that other allocation mechanisms may be superior.
     One can learn a great deal about the cost of a price
system by    studying institutions whose business is       to create
such markets (see Carlton (1984))2. For example, if one

studies the Chicago Board      of    Trade one   observes the   follow-
ing I

        2.   many people involved in each transaction (e.g.
             brokers, floor traders, employees of       a   clearing-
             house,   consultants),
        3.   office buildings housing the people involved in
             each transaction, and

        4.   elaborate record keeping.

Undoubtedly the greatest cost is the time cost of all the

people involved.      A significant fraction   of the economy of

the City of Chicago is devoted to the making of markets.             If

a magic spell could be cast to make transactions costless,

the Chicago economy would be devastated, at least in the
short run.     This emphasizes how far from costless the making
of markets really is.
        Aside from the fact that there are costs to setting up
such markets, it is also true that many markets once created

fail.     Roughly one half of all successful futures narkets
fail within 10 years of their introduction         (See     Canton
(l984)).      Since markets clearly produce at least some bene-
fits to its creators, the high failure rate must indicate

the presence of significant costs of operation which out-

weigh these benefits.      Furthermore, only a small fraction of
products have ever had futures markets.        Again,   this empha-
sizes that there must be significant costs to the creation

of such markets, otherwise the benefits flowing from such

markets would suggest a proliferation of such markets.

     1n auction market generates positive externalities.         It

provides valuable information to non-participants without

charge.   But once it is recognized that it takes real re-
sources to create a market, the existence of the positive

externality guarantees that there is no reason to expect the
efficient number of markets to be created.4 Those who actu-

ally transact in such   a   market may be charged a brokerage

fee, or be faced with a bid-ask spread, or with asymmetric

information that allows brokers to trade profitably.      But
the point remains that the marginal charge for participation

may not reflect social benefits and therefore may      fail to

create incentives for the broker or market maker to continue

the market even when the social benefits are great.       Once it
is recognized that   a market     produces   a product-namely the

allocation of the good —    the   conclusion that there is not an
efficient incentive to create markets follows by analogy to

the work on optimal product variety.      See Spence (l976) and
Dixit and Stiglitz (1977)6.       If markets do not get created,

alternative mechanisms to allocate goods must be used.




4.   The existence of one market can affect the benefits of
     another. In such a setting, it is conceivable that
     either too many or too few markets get created.

       Aside from the relative paucity of auction type mar-

kets, there is considerable additional evidence that does

not square with the predictions that emerge from the usual
market clearing model.    I   have elaborated on some of this

evidence at length elsewhere (Canton (1986, 1989)), and so

only summarize the evidence here.
       For what appear to be homogeneous goods,8 there is

often a very low correlation in price movements across buy-

ers.    Moreover, buyers and sellers are often    married" to

each other for long periods of time (e.g. several years).
It is frequently true in some industries that price,     once

set to a buyer, does not change for periods in excess of one

or two years or more.    The degree of market concentration is

related to the rigidity of price.      There are frequent claims

in some industries that non-price rationing is occurring

when demand is high with regular customers receiving pre-

ferred treatment.9    Finally, the rise of the modern corpora-
tion in the late 1880's resulted in the need to have sales-

man and marketing departments whose responsibility was to

(l977))l.      This contrsl feature of the modern corporation

is not easily explicable in a world in which goods can be

costlessly sold on an auction market.

             III.   The Cost of Using the Price System


      in the absence of an suction market, a firm that sets a

price runs the risk that it has set the wrong price.          If the

price is to low, too much is demanded and the firm has to
ration customers.      If the price is set too high, then too

few customers purchase and the firm is stuck with excess

capacity.    By the time the firm figures out whether it has

set the wrong price,     it is too late --   the   customers have
already gone (if the price is too high) or have placed their
order at the low price( if the price is too low).         This then
creates a real cost of using the price system to allocate

goods.    More precisely, because of uncertainty as to the
level of demand, the firm is unable to set the market clear-

ing price.    The information set over which the firm can set

price ex ante is "coarser" than the ex post realizations of
demand.    (Later on, we see how this information set is

endogenously determined).

      Let   us illustrate this cost of using the price system

in the context of a simple model.          See Figure   1.   Suppose
that there is a firm whose production technology involves a

fixed cost F and a constant marginal cost up to a fixed

capacity K.      Suppose that the customers of the firm in ag-

gregate have a demand curve of either DL (the low state of

demand) or DH (the high state of demand) but the firm does
not know which of the two demand curves is applicable.  If

the firm knew that               it would charge a market
                   DH prevailed,
clearing price of XH while if it knew that DL prevailed, it
would charge a market clearing price of
                                                1L1' The firm     can,

by assumption,    choose only one price.       No matter which price
the firm chooses, there will be an allocative inefficiency.
If it charges a price above             it creates a deadweight loss
                                   XL
when DL prevails.  If it charges a price below
                                               XH it is
likely to create a deadweight loss when DH prevails since it
faces excess demand. For example, as Figure 1 illustrates,
if the firm charges         the firm would create a zero dead-
                       XH
weight loss when DH prevailed, but would create a deadweight
loss of ABCD when
                  DL prevailed.




11.   I will soon focus only on firms that compete with each
      other to attract customers. The statement in the text
      also holds true for a monopolist, provided the relevant
      marginal revenue curves intersect the marginal cost
      curve in its vertical portion.

                     Figure   1 -   Cost   of Charging




        Figure   1   illustrates the cost of using price to          allo
cate.    There may be an alternative method of allocatfon that

avoids or lowers this cost.                We usually never have occasion
to consider such an alternative because of the assumption of

costless use of a price system.
        To illustrate the point,            let me use an extreme example.

Suppose that the seller has perfect knowledge about the
relative demands of his buyers.                  For example, suppose that

the seller    knows that       he   has only two buyers, each of whom

are identical in their demands,                  Then, the firm knows

   the   efficient allocation even though it has no idea

whether the market clearing price is                   or       The firm
should give K of its output to each buyer.                  By using its
                 2
knowledge about its customers, the firm is able to achieve
the efficient allocation of resources even though it has no

idea of the correct market clearing price.                  It is precisely

this simple point --    that knowledge about buyers assists
efficient    allocation -— that is ignored in most analyses                but
                                 —   12   -




provides the   key to understanding the role of marketing

departments,   and the behavior of many firms and industries.
      The simplification used in the preceding example of

perfect rationing ability is obviously unrealistic.                 If it

is costly to use the price system to allocate,                it is likely

to be costly to use other non-price methods and vice versa.

But the simplification is a useful point to begin the analy-
sis and is relaxed later.        Notice that these simplifying

assumptions --   costly use      of a price system but costless use

of non-price methods --     is   the precise opposite of the as-

sumptions usually made.
      In the usual model, the price mechanism produces the

optimal allocation and simultaneously generates enough
revenue to finance the firm.'2            Once there is   a   cost to

using the price system, there is no longer a unique corre-

spondence between the achievement of the optimal allocation
and the financing of the firm.            For example, the firm could

theoretically charge a zero price and achieve the efficient
allocation in the simple model just presented.                However such
a firm would not have any incentive to remain in business.

      One solution to the firmts problem of raising suffi-

cient revenue in the context of the preceding example is to

have the firm charge          Notice, from Figure 1, that if the
                       XL




12.   See Sheshinski and Dreze (1976) for an analysis of
      competition in the presence of fluctuating demand.
firm charges     1,
                  L then     it does earn revenue in excess of

variable    cost and   its use of   the price system causes no

potential for deadweight loss.         As long as price is less

than or equal to       A,   no deadweight loss is created.   But
what if the revenue generated is not enough to cover the

fixed costs F of the firm and what financial incentives are

there for the firm to allocate efficiently?

      In order to begin to address these questions, let us

make the model of the firm a bit more realistic.         The pro-
duction technology of the firm will still be constant re-
turns to scale up to some capacity K and require the expen-

diture of   a   fixed cost F.    As before, there will be situa-
tions in which the firm must set a single price without

knowing whether the demand curve is DL or DR. If demand is
either DL or DH, we say that demand is in state 1, so that
state 1 contains two possible outcomes (low and high) for

demand.    As before, we continue to make the simplifying

assumption that the firm knows that its customers are iden-
tical so that the firm can, if it chooses to, achieve the

efficient allocation.        We also introduce another state of

demand, state 0, knowable in advance to the firm so that the
market clearing price can be set if the firm chooses to do

so.   The demand curve in state 0 is Do and is composed of
the same buyers as in state       1.   The configuration of the
demand curves in state 0 and state 1 is illustrated in Fig-

ure 2.    We assume that state 0 and state 1 occur with equal
                              -   14   -




probabilities   and that within state 1 that DH and       D occur
with equal probabilities.

     We want to investigate how the firm should price in
order to cover its fixed cost.         We first analyze how   a
social planner would solve this problem.        As usual,   competi-
tion will force precisely this discipline on firms.           The

problem we seek to solve can be stated as follows           choose   a

method of pricing goods in state 0 and state        1   such that
fixed costs are covered and deadweight loss is minimized.

This is a variant of a standard problem in public finance.
The new twist is that the price in state 1 is independent of

whether the demand realization is DH or
                                        DL.
     The optimal solution to this problem is to use lump sum
taxes and marginal cost pricing or some other non-linear

pricing scheme.   As in the usual public finance context,

this perfect theoretical solution is usually impractical and
is not common.      For example, when buyers pay lump sum fees,

there are incentives for buyers to merge and aggregate pur-
chases to avoid the lump sum fee.                    Here, I want to examine a

relatively simple and common form of pricing, the charging
of unit prices that differ over demand states.                                 The motiva-
tion for studying this form of pricing is that in my earlier

work (Carlton (1986fl13,            I    found it common that a buyer

would face a price and then would choose quantity.                                      I

discuss non-linear pricing later on.                      Let us now solve the

social planners problem --                   which should remind the reader
of the usual Ramsey pricing problem.

     The problem is to choose taxes,            to add to
                                     to and t1,
marginal cost c in each state so as to cover cost F and
create the minimum expected deadweight loss.                                 Mathematically
we have

      The first term in the objective function is the dead-

                                           There is no term corresponding to
the deadweight loss arising in state 1 -                     high demand   state.

That is because as long as the price is below                     ), the as-
sumption of perfect rationing guarantees that the firm allo-
cates its K units efficiently)4 The constraint expresses
the requirement that the overall expected revenues cover the

fixed costs.




14.   Under some circumstances, t, may be so high that the
      price in state 1 will exceed XH (see Figure 2), and
      there would be a third term in the objective function.
      We will in general obtain deadweight loss in the high
      state of demand in state 1 when we relax the perfect
      rationing assumption later on, and so here maintain the
      simpler assumption that the price in state 1 does not
      exceed X

      It   is straightforward to solve for                      the    optimal tax
rates.     (See Appendix Theorem 1.)                       The optimal tax rates,

      Notice that             f is   the ratio of K to                and therefore


always exceeds          1.      As t1 increases,               falls and hence f

rises.     Therefore, f becomes larger as the required revenue,
F, and required taxes increase.                       ?loreover, f increases the

15.   I have     assumed that the elasticity of demand is the

      same for the curves     and                            It is straightforward
      to relax this assumption.                       Q.

Eq    (2)       shows that in general it is optimal to cause a pric-

ing distortion in both state 0 and state 1 with the price in
state       I   exceeding that in state 0.
        It is straightforward to show that if there are several

states of demand, i, each of which contain pairs of demand
                     H and
curves,
                                       .

If    the states of demand are such that                                       increases with i,
then taxes will tend to increase with i since                                          will

increase with i.'6

        The preceding derivations produced very simple pricing
rules.          The reader may think that these rules come from the

simple assumptions                 I   have made about only two unobservable

demand curves in state                     1       and about the particular configura-

tion of these curves as shown in Figure                                       2.   It turns out

that the simple pricing rules just derived hold under much

more general assumptions -— as                                 I    now demonstrate.

        Let each demand state                           i   consist of a family of demand
curves indexed by n,                   (Q.         (P.      n)).      Let demand be increasing

in    n which        has a probability density function g.(n).                                Demand

is increasing in i in the sense that the probability density




16.    It appears possible that the optimal taxes could
       decrease with i depending on the behavior of marginal
       revenue from taxation relative to the marginal
       deadweight loss. (See Appendix Theorem 2). This would
       lead to the possibility of countercyclical prices.

      The first term in the objective function reflects the

deadweight lost from charging c+t0 rather than c in state
     The second term represents the deadweight loss from

charging    c+t instead of           c in state i.                      Notice that dead-

weight loss occurs only in state                       i   for n <            n1'.   The revenue
constraints has three components.                          First is the revenue
earned in state      0;       second is revenue earned in state i when
the amount demanded is less than K; third is revenue earned

in state i when the amount supplied in exactly K.

      Solving (4) for the optimal tax rates, assuming the
price elasticities of demand are equal across states, yields




17.   For  simplicity, I           have assumed that in state 0 demand
      is always     below      K   at price c.

From the assumptions made, it follows immediately that                            f.   >

0.    As noted earlier, it is expected that prices will vary

procyclically, but it appears possible that price could
actually move countercyclically depending on the rate at
which deadweight loss and marginal revenue from taxation

increase relative to each other as                        i   and t. increases.    (See

Appendix, Theorem 2).
      The model                I   have just worked out is a relatively simple
one but it contains three interesting implications.


       1,          The amplitude of price fluctuations tends to be

                       smaller than that which would occur in the usual
                   market clearing model, with price being higher in

                   low demand states and lower in high demand states.
      2.           Even under the perfect rationing assumption,                   there
                   is    a deadweight         loss that arises from using price

                   to raise revenue to finance the firm.                  This
                   deadweight loss rises the greater the 'spread' of
                   the family of unobservable demand curves in each

                   observable state,                Analocous to theories in public

                   finance, it follows that the firm may use                 non
                   linear pricing            schemes to finance its output.
                       —   22 —


     Since these schemes are difficult to enforce, a
     reason for vertical integration arises, provided
     the vertically integrated firm is better able to

     enforce a non-linear pricing scheme among its
     divisions than it could if it were charging non-

     linear prices to independent agents.
3.   The firm and customer benefit if there are more

     products for the firm to 'tax.'     This follows

     immediately from the theory of public finance
     which teaches that the deadweight loss from rais-

     ing a given amount of revenue declines as more

     products are taxed.    Therefore, there is an econo-

     my of scope in the financing of the firm.     This

     economy of scope is unrelated to both production
     and marketing considerations. A firm could

     achieve this economy of scope if it sold multiple

     products simultaneously or if it sold the same

     physical product at different points in the busi-
     ness cycle to the same customer.     This economy of

     scope provides one reason for buyers and sellers

     to be 'married' to each other for long periods of
     time.   The seller commits to supply the buyer and

     the buyer commits to purchase from the seller over
     an extended time period.     The implication is that
     a steady customer may well be treated differently

     than a sporadic one.

       So far,      we have examined the socially optimal behavior

of a mingle firm.          We now address the following questions:

              a)    how   is equilibrium determined?;

              h) what happens if rationing is not perfect?;

              c) how will the firm choose its customers when

                    cuatoners are not homogeneoua?;

              d) how can a firm invest to improve its rationing

                    ability?; and

              a) what determines the optimal     K   for a firm?,




              Iv,     Equilibrium

A.    Competition


       i   now describe the competitive equilibrium for the

simple model.         Equilibrium requires buyers and sellers to
contract with each other in advance for price and quantity.
The price and quantity allocations depend on the observed

state of demand.          Competition forces firms to offer a price
and ability to allocate that maximizes consumer surplus and

forces sirms to earn zero expected profits.18




18.   The equilibrium is a long run concept in which entry
      erodes profits and all buyers and sellers are married.
      A more general model could have an equilibrium in which
      a steady strean of transient buyers appear, buy in a
      spot market, end leave. These transient buyers would
      bear the cost of using the price system and would pay
      on average a higher price than the married buyers.
      Without the ability of married buyers and sellers to
                                         (Footnote Continued)

     In    order to focus attention on the key aspects of equi-

librium,   consider the demand curves,      d,   dL, and dH, of a
customer of an individual firm and the supply available to
serve that customer.        For simplicity, we initially take all

consumers to be identical.        If a firm's capacity is K, then

it is as if each of     N customers     of the firm have a mini-firm

with capacity of K/N.        As the number of customers served by

a firm decreases, the capacity available to serve each

customer increases. For example, the capacity devoted to

serving each customer rises from K/N to K/N-i as the number
of customers decreases from N to N-l.         See Figure 4.



             Figure 4   -   Per Capita Demand and Supply




             (9.



                                                                       dH




(Footnote Continued)
     monitor each other, problems with a core not existing
     could arise. See Telser (1978).
      A decrease   in the number of customers at a firm has two

opposing effects.    First, it means that there are fewer
occasions when rationing is recuired and during those tines
when customers are on allocation, more of each customers

demands can be satisfied.     This raises consumer surplus.

Second,   because the same amount of revenue must be raised to
cover the fixed costs regardless of the number of customers,

the   tax burden    on the remaining customers increases and

reduces their consumer surplus.          For some N*, the firm,

constrained to earn zero profits, maximizes consumer surplus

per customer.     See Figure 5.       Any firm with either fewer or
more customers than N* would be unable to successfully com-

pete for customers.    What is interesting about the equilib-

rium is that the size of a firm matters to its customers

because it affects the    firms ability       to finance itself and

efficiently allocate resources.          Shortly, we develop a theo-
ry of customer mix, once the assumption of identical consum-

ers is relaxed.     Once N* is determined, eq.      (3)   determines
the optimal pricing in equilibrium.

      One interesting comparative static exercise is to           com
pare the equilibrium to the one that results when use of the

price system is not costly.       i   mow explain why the optimal

customer size tends to be smaller when use of the price

system   is costless.19    (See Appendix Theorem 3 for more

detailed discussion)   .   Consider    the consumer surplus curve

in Figure 5



              Figure 5 - Per Capita Consumer Surplus




                                                        Number
      The curve initially rises because as the number of

customers     increases the gain in utility from a reduced per

capita tTtax burden exceeds the increase in deadweight loss
from having less output per customer to allocate.        Notice

that the allocative efficiency properties of a system with

perfect rationing could be identical to the (costless) price
system but for the financing constraint.        But the financing

constraint imposes a deadweight loss in each state of nature
because the tax causes a marginal distortion.        This marginal




19.   Although the analysis assumes a fixed K, it is possible
      to reinterpret the results as applying to a situation
      where each unit of capacity costs F and K is freely
      chosen,  All theorems would then apply to K/N.
                              27



distortion is not present when the price system is costless
and a different price can he charged for every realized

demsnd state,   Deadweight loss falls as the number of states
in which to charge taxes increases and the marginal distor-

tions fall on average.   Therefore, as more customers are

added,   the gain from being able to lower "taxes" saves more

deadweight loss when firms are using rationing (since exist-

ing average distortions are larger).    This creates an incen-

tive for these firms to be larger than they would be if

using the price system were costless.   This is especially

true the wider the divergence between the unobservable de-

mand curves within any one observable state of demand be-
cause that is a situation with large marginal distortions.

Therefore, the number of customers served by a firm tends to
decrease as the cost of using the price system falls, and
there will be more firms.   In this sense, a costless price

system and atomistic competition go hand in hand.

B.   Monopoly

      The monopoly solution is similar to the one just de-

rived.   A monopolist maximizes his profit by adopting   a
pricing scheme and quantity allocation that efficiently
allocates the goods he does sell.   This implies that the

monopolist!s prices, though generally higher than a
                                 - 28   -




competitors,      will also satisfy equations like (3)•20         A

monopolist charges higher prices than competitors,          and, as a

result,    he diminishes his need to rely upon rationing.             The

fact that the monopolist can charge higher prices than would

prevail under competition means that f in        (3)   is higher

under monopoly and, therefore, that there would tend to be
more procyclical price movement for a monopolist.



             V.   Relaxing the Assumption of Perfect Rationing

        The assumption that firms have the ability to perfectly

rank their customers' relative need for a good is obviously
unrealistic.      In reality,   a firm will have difficulty allo-

cating its output capacity, K, among its customers and will
not, in general, be able to duplicate the efficient alloca-

tion that would result if use of the price system were cost-

less.

        When non-price methods entail costs, then the problem

facing the firm becomes more complex.        Let R stand for the

firm's rationing ability.        It represents that fraction of

maximum consumer plus producer surplus that        a   firm can
achieve for any given demand curve.         For example, in Figure




20.     The monopolist maximize profits subject to a utility
        constraint. If maximum profits are 11k, then the
        optimal solution will maximize utility subject to the
        constraint that profits equal fl*• This maximization
        problem is similar to the one solved by (3).

6,   P.   is the fraction of ABCD       that     the firm can generate.    So

far, I have taken       P.   to equal 1.



              Figure   6 - Consumer Plus Producer Surplus




                  A




          There will be many factors that influence          P..   For exam-

ple,      R will depend upon the number and heterogeneity             of

customers,      the knowledge that a firm has about its customers

and the price      a firm charges. The more numerous and hetero-
geneous are customers, the more complicated it is for a firm
to know which customers have the greatest need for its prod-

uct.       The more knowledge a firm has about its customers, the

easier it is for the firm to allocate efficiently.                 One
function of salesmen is to understand the needs of their

customers,      and in times of shortage, make sure that those

customers who need the good the most obtain it.

          When it ia costly to allocate by non-price methods, the

efficiency of the non-price method of               allocation will   depend
                                 -   30   —




on the price      charged.   By reducing the amount of excess
demand in periods of shortages, a high price reduces the
number of customer (or units demanded) over which non—price
allocation methods are used.          It is as if price is used as

the first screen to identify the most likely candidates to
receive the good, and then non-price methods are used for

the final allocation.        As price rises,        the deadweight loss

from inefficiently reducing consumption in low demand states

(i.e.    the cost of using the price system identified in Fig-

ure 1) increases, but the cost of inefficiently allocating

by non-price methods the excess demand in high demand states
falls.        The general point is that it is efficient to use
both price and non-price allocations when each are costly to
use,

        To see this point, consider the following example il-
lustrated in Figure 7.        Suppose that one state of demand has
two unobservable states.        If a price              is charged and DH

occurs    ,   Q   units are demanded and the firm must decide
which K of those to satisfy.          If instead a higher price         P"
is charged and DH occurs,       only Q** is demanded. The firm
has a better chance of generating the maximum consumer plus

producer surplus in the latter case since the lower value
users have been screened out by the higher price.                 Notice
                                          **
that    although the higher price P             improves the efficiency
of the non-price rationing if                 occurs,   the higher price

creates a larger deadweight loss if DL occurs because the
                                    —   31   —




higher       price drives consumption farther below K.         This iden-
tifies the trade-off between the use of price and non-price

methods of allocation.           In general, it will be optimal to

use both price and non-price methods to achieve efficient

allocation when the use of each creates some deadweight
loss

       As a firm's rationing ability improves,             it tends to

rely less on price to achieve efficiency and its pricing
tends to become less procyclical.                To see this point intui-

tively, notice that if a high price is not needed for effi-
ciency reasons to help allocate goods in times of shortage,
then it pays to reduce    and shift taxes to the other (low-
                       t1
er) observable states of demand. More rigorously, the firm

faces the following problem:

where all terms have been previously defined.

The only difference between this problem and the one solved
earlier is the presence of                          (1—P.)     multiplying the last term
in the objective function.                          When R=l,                (6)       is identical to

the earlier problem.

                 yields the optimal solutions for (t0, t1).
            Solving      (6)

It is possible to prove that under certain assumptions

at      >    0 and at            <   0.       (See Appendix Theorem 4.)                           This means

that the firm relies less on price to clear markets in peak

demand periods as the firm's rationing ability improves.                                                          It
also implies that prices becomes less procyclical as ration-

ing ability improves.
            Since customers are no longer assumed to be identical
and since the firm has some knowledge about each customer,

it follows that the optimal price and allocation policy

varies from customer to customer.                               In an effort to obtain an

efficient allocation, the firm prices to screen out low

value demanders before it relies on non-price allocation

methods.              If a firm has different knowledge about each
consumer then the firm should charge each consumer a differ-

ent price.

      To understand this point, suppose that the firm is in a

neriod of shortage and that it has two customers.                  See Fig-

ure 8.

                     A has a demand curve that is either D1 or D3,

while Customer B has a demand curve that is D2. The optimal
allocation in the case where the demand curve of Customer A

is
     D1,
            is      to Customer A and         q to Customer B,   where        +

       K.        In the case where the demand curve of Customer          A    is

      the optimal allocation is                   to Customer A and          to

Customer B, where          q*   +
                                    q*   =   K.   If the same price were

charged to each customer and that price were below P1. then
the rationing efficiency of the firm is seriously impaired

when Customer        As    demand is high and equals D3.         The reason

is that so many units are demanded by Customer A that it

makes it difficult to allocate the goods amongst customers

when rationing is imperfect.                 In fact,   it is essential to
                              -   34   -




optimal operations that different customers pay different
prices when both rationing and the price system are costly
to use.    Different customers impose different costs on the
firms allocation ability    and, as should be expected, dif-
ferent costs should give rise to different prices.          The
stochastic buying characteristics of a customer affect the
cost of servicing that customer.           A steady customer imposes

less costs on a firm than one who has variable demands and

therefore should receive a lower price,           It is a consequence

of the relaxation of costless operation of the price system

that requires different customers pay different prices in

order to assure efficient operation. Price differences

among customers are a natural consequence of market opera-
tion when organized auction markets don1t exist.


            VI    The Role of the Firm       n   Facilitating
                 Trade Between Different Customers

       This section explores in more detail the effect of

differences among consumers. The main point is to show how

a firm acts to facilitate trade amongst customers when there

is a costly price system and when the firm can identify

different groups of consumers. This function of the firm

has received little attention in the current treatments of
the theory of the firm.    It is a role that could reasonably

be identified with the marketing departments         of large firms.
I   first allow customers to differ in the elasticity of
demand        in   state 0.   I   then introduce uncertainty in state         I

arid   analyze the implications of having a customer whose
demands are only partially correlated with the rest of the

population.



         A)        Different Elasticities

         Suppose that there are two groups of customers, Group A
and Group B, who differ in only one respect; they have dif-

ferent elasticities of demand in state 0.                  Their demands in

state     I are      perfectly correlated.         To fix ideas, suppose

that one group, Group A, has a perfectly inelastic demand in

state     0.       Suppose that a firm just has consumers from Group
A   as   its customers.           From the previous analysis, it follows

that the optimal solution is for the                 firtn to   charge a price
X in     state 1 such that          Q(X)K and      charge a large enough fee
in state 0 to cover the fixed costs.                  Moreover, these con-
sumers will have the              maine    consumption in the low state as in
the high state of state               1.     (Indeed, this solution is analo-

gous to one involving a two-part tariff.)
         Now consider a firm that caters solely to Group B.

These customers have a finite demand elasticity in state 0,
so that, as in the previously worked out inodels, they wind

up paying a price in state 0 in excess of constant marginal
cost, c, and their consumption in the low state in state 1

is below that in the high state in state 1.                     Compared to
firms catering to Group A, firms catering to Group B will
                               -   36



have less capacity per customer (K/N smaller) because they
are less efficient at raising money to pay for capacity.

       The question we now address is whether a firm should
serve both customer groups on the assumption that the firm

can separately identify each group.           That is, is there an

economy of scope in serving both groups?              The answer is

generally yes.   To see why, consider state I.            We know that

in the case of a firm serving only Group B there is excess

capacity in the low state of state       1.     This excess capacity

arises because one consequence of a costly price system is

that the price in the low state of state          1   chokes off too

much demand.

       Now consider   a firm catering solely to Group         A custom-
ers.    These Group A customers could well want to consume
more at a marginal cost of c than the amount that they are

currently consuming in that state.        Moreover,       the shadow

price of the Group B consumers in the high state of state 1
is higher than that of a Group A consumer (because K/N is

higher for the firm specializing in Group A consumers).

Hence, there are gains for trade if a mechanism could be
devised.    The obvious problem is that if the price system is

costly, it is hard for the two groups of customers to trade
in the two states of state     1   that by assumption       cant have
different prices because of the cost of creating markets.

It is precisely in this situation that the firm can step in

and facilitate trade between the two groups.
        Recall that although a firm cannot charge different

prices to a customer in the two unobservable states of state
I,   the   firm can use its knowledge of customers' needs when

rationing is heeded.         The optimal arrangement is for the

firm to serve the two groups, to use some of the available

capacity of     a   Group B customer in the low state of state 1
to serve a Group A customer,        and to switch the consumption

of a Group A customer to a Group B customer in the high

state of state 1.         But how can the firm find It in its fi-

nancial interest to do this?         After all, it can't vary price
between the two states in state        1,   The answer is that the

firm can now raise (or lower) the (lump sum) tariff in state
o to Group A customers.         These Group A customers can be

thought of as "buying consumption in the low state of state
1 and   paying for it by "selling" consumption in the high
state of state       1   and by paying (or receiving) money in state
C.   The point is that the firm serves the function of allow-

ing consumers to transact across states when the price sys-
tem is too costly to be used.          (The exact terms of how Group
A and Group    B fare will depend on their relative population

sizes.>     Therefore, in general, we expect to see firms serv—

ing multiple consumer groups with each group paying dIffer-
ent prices and being rationed differently.          As before, the
firm's rationing ability, R, will determine how efficient
the reallocation can be.         However, even if   Rl,   the firm

will not, in equilibrium,        reproduce the allocation of a
                                 -   38   -




costless   price system and it will still typically be the
case that the price in state 0, P0. will exceed c for the

Group B consumers.


     B)    Differing Stochastic Demands

     Suppose now that customers differ in the demands that

they have in state 1.      For example, each customer              i   could

have a random term that equals        Pj+         were   c   is a common

random component,        is an independent and identically dis-

tributed random variable, and        p.       is a correlation coeffi—
                                      1
cient   (0<Ip.<1) for consumer       i.

     Suppose first that p=O for all customers.                 By putting

together a diversified portfolio of all customers, the law
of large numbers guarantees that the likelihood of rationing
in state 1 will go to zero.          In this setting, P0 approaches

c and                                is the fixed cost of
        P1 approaches c+F*, where F*
capacity per customer which equals the average amount de-
manded in state   1.   Each firm has a completely diversified
set of consumers.      There is no benefit to a firm from being
skilled at rationing, just from being diversified.

     Now suppose            To fix ideas,         suppose that there are
                   p1O.
two groups, Groups     A and   B with p equal to             and
                                                                   p8 respec-
tively where PA>PB>O. Suppose c takes on just two values
with equal probability, -a and a  Then, the demand curve of

Group A lies above that of Group B when E>o and below that
of Group B when t<o.      Just as before, there may be gains for
                                        —   39   —




trade   between the two groups.               The firm will act to shift

more goods to Group A in the high state of state                    1   and to

Group B in the low state of state                    1.   The firm accomplishes
this reallocation by using its knowledge of customers and

its rationing ability.         Each customer pays a price in state

0 and faces a rationing rule and price in state 1.                      The

prices and rationing rule vary by                    p.   Notice that as long

ss         for the group of customers, then there will be

aggregate uncertainty in the demand curve facing the firm in
state 1 and the need for rationing will persist even when

each firm is diversified across customer groups.
      We have already discussed how R will be affected by the
number and heterogeneity of customers. As long as the need

for rationing persists, diversification is costly because it
affects R through the number of customers. This leads to a

finite firm size even in the presence of constant returns in

the building of capacity.               As a customer!s p increases, the

firm's ability to ration declines (because the customer adds
variance to demand, making more rationing necessary in the

high state of state 1).         We therefore should expect that

customers are charged for           p       so that their average price paid
rises with      p.    In summary,       a customer's stochastic buying

characteristics influences the price he pays.

      To illustrate these ideas, suppose Group A has                             and

         Such    a   group can use the price system efficiently
6A0
because there are no unobservable states in state 1.
                              -    40 -


Suppose Group B has    B>°    That group has to be rationed
sometimes for reasons already discussed. Half the time

Group B values the good more than Group A and vice versa in
state 1.     Group A would willingly join a firm that uses
rationing even though Group A's demand curve is unchanged
between the high and low state in state 1.              The reason is
that Group B can "trade" with Group A if they are in the

same firm.     The firm would charge Group        A   a price below c+F*

which allows them to expand their consumption in the low

state of state 1 but ration them in the high state of state

1.   This arrangement enables Group B to expand consumption
in the high state of state    1.    Again,   the firm is facilitat-

ing trade between two groups in a situation where the trade
could not otherwise occur because of the non-existence of a

separate price in each of the two states in state               1.

     This model emphasizes that in state 1, it is the firm's

rationing ability combined with the magnitude of the common
shock that determines the unavoidable inefficiency that

results   from having a costly price system.           Conditional on
receiving a large positive shock,         , the   system does poorly
in that this realization of   c is    one that creates lots of

deadweight loss ex post (though not ex ante in expected
value).    In response to large increases in demand, prices

don't rise and rationing does a poor job at allocating

goods.    If such shocks were common there would be more use

of prices.    Therefore, the consequence of having          a   costly
                               -   41   -




price system   is that the allocation mechanism is not very

good at coping with large unexpected positive shocks.L1



           VII.    Empirical Evidence

      In this section,   I   report on some available empirical
evidence that supports many of the key assumptions and im-

plications of the theory.       The main assumption and implica-

tions of the theory are as follows:


      1.   It is costly to use the price system for some

           goods so that rationing is optimal when demand is
           high.   Customers will be charged different prices

           depending on the stochastic nature of their de-
           mand.   For example, customers who buy only at peak

           times may not be able to obtain the good with the

           same reliability or at the same price as steady

           customers.

      2.   The amplitude of price fluctuations tends to be

           smaller than that which would occur in the usual
           market clearing model, with price being higher in

           low demand states and lower in high demand states.

      3.   The system Of market operation involving rationing
           is not sustainable during extended periods of




21.   Negative shocks do not raise the same problems because
      rationing replaces the price system in state 1 only for
      positive shocks.
                               -   42   -




           chronic excess capacity.         In such   a   case, price
           will fall to marginal cost because customers see
           no benefit to paying higher prices to guarantee

           supply in the future.
      It is difficult to obtain systematic evidence on the

importance of non-price rationing from published data sourc-
es because it would be impossible to examine data             on price

and quantity and infer rationing. Instead we must rely on

evidence more akin to industry studies of particular indus-

try and accounts in the business press.
      There have been several press accounts documenting the

imposition of allocations,    quotas, and non—price rationing.
By non-price rationing,   I   mean instances where customers are
put on allocation and are not able to obtain the full amount
of their demand.   For example, the Wall Street Journal re-

ported (7-7-87) that plastics producers (polypropylene) were

accepting no new customers and had placed quotas on their
deliveries to existing customers. Other industries where

non-price rationing has been reported include plastics,
computer chips, chemicals and various metals.22

      non-price rationing, see Iron Age, 1/6/75, p. 90

      There have been several studies documenting          a two-

tiered pricing system in many metal markets.23            For numerous

metals,   (e.g. aluminum, cobalt, copper, nickel, molybdenum)

it was typical that there were two prices           one for spot

buyers and one for steady buyers.          The price that the steady

buyer paid (often called the producer price) was typically
different than the spot price.        Consistent with the theory,

the spot price was much more volatile than the price to

steady buyers who comprised the bulk of the market.
      One of the rare reports analyzing these types of issues
          "
found:          producer prices have not       as a rule risen suf-

ficiently to clear the market during periods of scarcity,
and producers have generally limited their price cuts in

times of excess capacity. Because producers reward customer

loyalty, those who purchase from          a producer at   its posted

prices usually have access   to   product supplIes in times of

shortage, whereas those who rely on spot purchases risk

continued dependence on the spot market at those timesj'24
The report also found, consistent with the theory, that the

two-tiered system of pricing tends to disappear when excess

capacity is   expected to persists.     For example, in nickel,

copper, and aluminum, there has been excess capacity for
several years.     In those industries, the two—tiered pricing

System has vanished.
      The theory predicts that one determinant of a custom-
er's price is the correlation of that customer's demand with

that of the firm.    Schwieterman (1990)25 has tested this

theory for airline pricing.26    His findings are striking.

There is a strong relationship between fares and stochastic
demand patterns.    For example, someone travelling on a re-

stricted fare (Max Saver Fare> has a correlation with the
firm's demand of about one third that of other passengers

travelling on the sane flight.      The lower correlation   is

consistent with the passenger on a Max Saver Fare receiving

a substantial discount.27

26.   This airline case is a bit different from the model
      since there is no long run relationship necessarily
      between fliers and airlines (though frequent flier
      programs attempt to create such a relation). However,
      as long as tickets are purchased ex ante, the theory of
      the model implies that a buyer's stochastic buying
      characteristics should influence the price.

27.   I recently had the opportunity to use confidential data
      to test the theory for a manufacturing industry by
      running econometric regressions of the form:
           Price    f (product characteristics, volume of
                       buyer order, volume of one year of
                       buyer's orders, buyer's correlation
                       with firm's demand (p))
                                             (Footnote Continued)

           VIII.   Implications for Firm Behavior

     The models of costly use of the price system and costly

use of non-price allocations can be viewed as defining the

implicit technologies for allocation by price and non-price
methods.   Resources are used (i.e. costs imposed) when a

price system is used and when rationing is used,    Because we

know the technology used to allocate, we are able to under-
stand the incentives to improve these technologies.    I be-

lieve these incentives lead to an improved understanding of

several aspects of the modern corporation, especially the

marketing function.


P)   Optimal Customer Mix


      We have already seen in the previous sections how cus-

tomers who place different demands on a firms rationing

ability are treated differently and have examined the   ir,cen-

tive of a firm to put together a portfolio of different
customers.   The theory here is akin to the theory of clubs




(Footnote Continued)
      The econometric results relied on several thousand
      monthly observations across several hundred customers
      for a several year period.   The coefficient on p was
      statistically significant  and positive.  The magnitude
      of the coefficient indicated that different stochastic
      buying patterns of customers caused price paid to vary
      by as much as 10 to 15 percent.
                                -   46   -

in    which the size and composition of the club affect each
member's welfare.      To understand the         advantage   of a desir-

able customer mix, suppose there are several customers whose
demands are random but are uncorrelated so that the sum of

their demand curves is non-stochastic.              This enables the

firm to avoid the problem of being unable to know which

demand state prevails since by construction the total demand
curve is always same.

        In general,   when a firm is considering adding a new

customer, the firm calculates the additional cost that the
new customer would impose     on the firm's ability to ration to

others.     That cost tends to be greater the more positively

correlated are the demands of the new customer with existing
customers.     The gain to the firm is the additional revenue

(and hence reduced revenue burden on existing customers)

that the new customer provides.              It is the covariance of the

new customer's demand with aggregate firm demand that is the

key variable that determines how price is set to an individ-
ual customer.28 This theory of customer mix is analogous to

optimal portfolio theory.       It implies that "goods" are much

more heterogeneous than they may initially appear.               P pound

of product purchased steadily is a different product than a

pound purchased irregularly.         It also implies that one goal




28.    It is more complicated if the elasticity of demand
       differs among customers. Moreover, the variance of
       demand could matter if buyers are large.
                                -    47 -


of    the marketing department of a firm is to put together a

desirable customer mix.29

B)     Improving the Fir&s Ability to Allocate
        The knowledge that a seller has of its buyers plays a

crucial role in determining         P..   The longer   a seller knows

its buyers,    presumably the better the ability of the firm to
use non-price rationing.       By assigning each salesmen fewer
customers or by sponsoring occasions wherein buyers explain

their needs to sellers, the firm can improve its ability to

use non-price rationing.
        The firm can improve   its ability to use the price sys-

tem by improving its ability to distinguish among different

aggregate demand states.       By improving its overall sales and
marketing force, the firm can become increasingly refined in
its ability to discern different demand states and can

thereby charge different prices for the different demand
states.     By investing to refine its ability to distinguish
between various states of demand, the firm reaps the bene-

fits of being able to use price to allocate goods at low




29.     Buyers could band together into desirable groupings or
        be banded together by a third party (e.g. brokers,
        middlemen> to achieve the same desirable result of
        stabilizing demand. For example, advertising agencies
        often package together different demanders for TV
        advertising to produce a stable demand and then
        purchase for these demanders blocks of advertising time
        from TV networks.
                              -   48   -




cost.     That is, the firm invests in order to lower its cost

of using the price system.

        The incentive to invest in order to use the price sys-
tem more efficiently and to use non-price rationing more

efficiently explains the importance of the marketing and
sales function in modern corporations.        It is impossible to

tell whether a firm's investments in marketing are more

productive in improving its rationing ability or in lowering
its costs of using the price system.        A firm may rely more

or less on price as its marketing knowledge improves.            One

prediction is that a firm with many transient customers may
do better improving its ability to use price because it may
be easier to learn about aggregate demand than about custom-

ers' relative demands.     In contrast,    a firm with   a few

steady customers may find it easier to learn about relative
demands and improve its non-price rationing ability.           The
firms in my previous study (Canton (1986)) 30 that         I   cited
as evidence in support of non-price rationing were firms who

sold intermediate manufactured products to large steady

customers.



C)    Economies of Scope in Marketing
      A seller's knowledge of a customer is an important

influence in determining R.       If the firm knows the relative

demands of a customer for one product, it may well have




30.   See note 7, supra at 9.
                              -   49



insight    into his relative demands for related products.    For

example,    a lawn store has a high demand   for both grass seed

and fertilizer during peak demand times.      Because of this,
there is a natural economy of scope in marketing, and it

therefore makes sense for a single firm to be in charge of

the non-price allocation for several products when the prod-

ucts are complementary. This economy of scope is likely to
be most important when inputs are used primarily for one

industry so that the demands for the various inputs are

highly correlated.     The knowledge spillover also creates an

economy of scope when the price system is used.      As long as

demands for different products are correlated,     the firm

selling both products can do a better job of using the price
system than a firm selling one product because the firm
selling both products is able to improve its overall knowl-

edge about the state of aggregate demand about one product
by observing the demand of the other.     For example, market-

ing personnel may be able to pool information across prod-

ucts to better discern the current demand state of one prod-

uct.



D)     Hostility to Futures ?4arkets
       The knowledge that a firm possesses to use both price

and non-price methods to allocate goods is a valuable asset
and one on which the firm earns a return,       if an alternative

allocation mechanism were to appear, the firms valuable
                               - 50   -



asset would decline     in value.   Firms and organized markets
are competitors in producing "allocations8 and like any

competitor,     the firm does not like competition.    This phe-
nomenon explains the hostility firms often have toward the
introduction of a new organized futures market in their

industry.31


E)    Capital Investment
       The marketing knowledge that the firm possesses to

distinguish different states of demand and to determine the
relative demands of customers will affect the firm's deci-
sion of how much capital to invest in.       I   expect that firms
with higher values for R will have a higher ratio of capital
to customers,    will earn higher profits, and will have more

customers than firms with lower values of R.        This suggests
that new firms that will tend to have low values of R will

have an optimal scale below that of an established firm with
a high value of R.     Moreover, in contrast to established
firms,   entrants will have to rely more on price fluctuations

to allocate goods despite the large deadweight loss that

such fluctuations may entail.       Entrants may also rely on
more flexible production technologies even if they are more




31.   For an example of hostility to a new futures market,
      use the discussion of the reaction of aluminum firms to
      the establishment of the aluminum futures market in
      American Metal Market, January 6, 1978, p.9.
                                - 51 —



costly   than those used by established firms who have a
steadier customer demand.


F)    Swaps
       In several industries,   firms often swap product on an

equal tonnage basis.      For example, a paper firm with a cus-

tomer in New York but a plant in California may swap 10 tons

of paper with a firm with a plant in New York but a customer

in California.       These swaps often do not involve prices but

do require equal tonnages.      In fact, personnel in charge of

arranging swaps may have little or no price making authori-
ty.    There has been many reasons given for these swaps.
                                            32
(See Wiiliamson (1983) and Joyce (1983))         .   One reason for

swaps that emerges from the theory of this paper is that

swaps avoid requiring either firm to incur the costs of

ascertaining the market price.      This reason for swaps makes

sense only if prices are highly correlated in the areas

involving swaps and if it is not easy to determine the mar-

purpose   of marketing in the modern corporation.    Marketing
consists of investments designed to improve a firm's knowl-

edge about the level of aggregate demand and the relative
demands of customers. This improved knowledge lowers the

costs of using price and non-price methods of allocation.

Economics of scope in knowledge acquisition explain the

incentive for the firm to sell related products.     The mar-
keting ability of the firm will influence its investment
decisions and Its need to rely on price fluctuations.

            IX.    Conclusion

     Relaxation of the assumption of costless use of a price

system leads to a theory with several implications for opti-
mal allocation, market structure and industrial behavior.

The theory implies that rationing is to be expected and that

a customer's stochastic pattern of demand will influence his

price.    Marketing departments add value by putting together
a desirable portfolio of customers and by learning about

their customers'    needs and using that knowledge to allocate

goods.    The theory implies that one reason for a firm's

existence is to facilitate trade amongst its customers.
This theory explains some puzzling empirical evidence and
leads to an improved understanding of industrial structure

and the marketing functions of a firm,

Theorem 2:     If there are several states of demand,                    i,   and if

                     increases with i, then t                  could increase or
               decrease with i.

Proof:         The first order condition requires that

(A-3)          -t.        =    -X    [t.            +         +}j
               The LHS is the marginal deadweight loss (MDWL)

               from increasing taxes, while the right hand side

               is the marginal revenue (NP) from increasing

               taxes times (-A).                It is reasonable to assume
that

               MDWL is upward sloping in t and MR is downward

               sloping in t, as illustrated in Figure P-l.

        As   increases,   the MDr!L (t) curve could shift up or

down, as could the MR         (t)   curve.          Therefore, without further
assumptions,    it is possible for              t     to either increase or

decrease with 1.

        It is possible to identify conditions under which taxes

will move procyclically.            For example, if demands are lin-

ear, then it immediately follows that t1 increases with i

((-A) MR(t) curve shifts up;               MDL      (t) curve remains un-

changed).

Theorem 3:   The equilibrium size of a firm tends to be

             larger with rationing as compared to the case of
             costless use of a price system.


Proof:       The equilibrium   N occurs where average consumer
             surplus is maximized. There are two effects
             that determine the optimal N.       First as N

             increases, the capacity available to satisfy the
             needs of a single customer during peak demand
             falls.    This represents a cost.    Moreover,
             because demand curves slope downward, the

             marginal loss from increasing customer size
             increases as illustrated in Figure     A2.    The
             marginal gain from increasing the number of
             customers    comes from the reduction in the tax
             burden that results as the fixed costs are

             spread over more customers. The marginal gain
             from reducing taxes is likely to be greatest
             when there are already large taxes in place.

Therefore, the marginal gain              from lowering

taxes will tend to decrease with existing
size.   The intersection determines the optimal
N.



When there is no cost to using a price system,

then the firm can    'tax        in all configurations
                              L      H
of demand (i.e.. in             and Q1 separately) and

that means that any total tax burden can be

financed by causing less marginal distortions

in any one state on average,              than when there is
a constraint that taxes in two demand states

must be equal.     Therefore, for             any N,   the

marginal gain from financing              -   which depends on
existing    distortions       -   tends   to be lower under

competition.     This lower marginal gain from

financing is illustrated as the dashed curve in

Figure A-2.    The marginal loss from increasing

N will tend to remain roughly                 the same for any   N
whether or not the price system is costless
because of the perfect rationing assumption.                  As

Figure A-2 indicates, this implies that the firm
is smaller when use of the price system is

costless.

Proof:       One of the first order conditions for the

             problem specified in                       (6)        is:


             to       Q   =      A       [t        QT + Q01          or

(A-4)         00          =          A        ,    where     all terms were


             defined      previously.                   As    P.     increases, the

             marginal deadweight loss from increasing t1
             increases.              This causes the shadow price -X)

             associated with the financing constraint to
             increase.           From the above first—order condition,
                                                                          As
