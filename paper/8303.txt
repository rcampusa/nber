1    Introduction
What role, if any, do large traders and other highly leveraged institutions
(HLIs) such as hedge funds (HFs) and proprietary desks of commercial and
investment banks play in determining and propagating market volatility dur-
ing crisis episodes? Some policy-makers and analysts have expressed concern
that the activity of large players in small markets (‘big elephants in small
ponds’) may trigger crises that are not justified by fundamentals, destabi-
lizing foreign exchange and other asset markets, creating systemic risk, and
threatening the stability of the international financial system.
    A typical argument is that the presence of large agents is deemed to in-
crease a country’s vulnerability to a crisis because their short-term portfolio
strategies provide a ‘focal point’ for speculative behavior and induce small
investors, other things being equal, to be more aggressive in their position-
taking. Acknowledgedly, phenomena such as herding (buying or selling an
asset because other participants buy or sell at the same time), momentum
trading (buying an asset when its price rises and selling when its price falls),
noise trading, bandwagon effects, short-termism, etc. can occur in financial
markets even if all agents are small and atomistic. Yet, market power stem-
ming from size, reputation, and ability to leverage, may give large players a
unique role in affecting market dynamics with destabilizing consequences.
    Specifically, concerns about the aggressive, possibly manipulative, prac-
tices of large traders were expressed in 1998 by the authorities of a number
of small- and medium-sized economies. To assess these allegations, the HLI
Working Group of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) established in 1999
a Study Group on Market Dynamics in Small and Medium Sized Economies
which conducted a study of the 1998 market turmoil and the role played by
HLIs in six countries (Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,
Singapore and Malaysia).
    While the group could not reach consensus on the allegations of destabi-
lization and distortion of market integrity, the report found circumstantial
evidence of aggressive trading practices, pointing out a material role of large
players in some crises. Notably, the conclusions of the Market Dynamics
Study Group, published in April 2000 (FSF (2000)), were somewhat differ-
ent from a previous study on HFs by the International Monetary Fund (IMF
(1998)). The IMF study, limited to the events in Asia up to late 1997, had
concluded that HFs had not played a significant role in the early market

turbulence.
    In light of the results of these reports and, more generally, in light of the
policy and academic debate on the 1997-98 events, our contribution aims to
reconsider in detail, at both theoretical and empirical levels, the role that
large players can play in currency crises and market dynamics.
    This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present a stylized
model of speculative attacks, analyzing the effect of large investors on the
vulnerability of a country to currency crises. We first focus on a model
in which speculative attacks are the outcome of self-fulfilling shifts in ex-
pectations from ‘good’ to ‘bad’ equilibria, in situations where the economic
fundamentals are neither too strong (ruling out crises altogether), nor too
weak (so that a crisis is unavoidable).
    Next, we consider a model with asymmetric and private information,
building on the ‘global-games’ literature (Morris and Shin (2000), Corsetti,
Dasgupta, Morris and Shin (2000)). In this model, the impact of a large
trader on the market depends on the interaction of three elements: size,
reputation for quality of information, and the ability to ‘signal’ her portfolio
position to the rest of the market. The key result is that, in general, the pres-
ence of large investors makes all other investors more aggressive, in the sense
that they choose to liquidate their currency positions for stronger economic
fundamentals relative to the case in which there are no large investors.
    We conclude the theoretical section discussing several open issues and
extensions of the model. Do large traders destabilize markets? How ‘large’
must a trader be to have a significant impact on market behavior? Do large
players always benefit from signalling their trading? Or do they benefit from
trading quietly to avoid adverse movement of prices while building their
positions? Do they inhibit contrarian trade? Can large players manipulate
markets (through cornering, ‘talking one’s book’, spreading rumors, etc.)?
    On the basis of the results of Section 2, Section 3 provides an overview
and an extension of the empirical literature on the behavior of large investors
in currency markets. We first look at the evidence on the correlation between
exchange rate movements and major market participants’ net currency po-
sitions. We next consider a few recent case studies. A number of sources,
ranging from press articles to academic case studies, have suggested that
large HFs and HLIs played a role in several episodes of market distress in
the 1990s, including: the ERM crisis in 1992-93; the 1994 U.S. bond mar-
ket turbulence; the 1994-1995 Mexican peso crisis; the speculative attack on

                                       2
the Thai baht in 1997; the fall of the Korean won in 1997; the crisis of the
Malaysian ringgit in 1997-98; the ‘double play’ on the Hong Kong stock and
foreign exchange markets in 1998; the pressures on the Australian dollar in
June and August 1998; the unraveling of the ‘carry trade’ in the summer
of 1998 and the rally of the Japanese yen; the ‘Russia to Brazil’ contagion
episode in the summer-fall of 1998. We focus on a sample of these events and
we conclude by highlighting the links between our analysis and the findings
of the FSF (2000) study.
    There are two important premises to our assessment of the role of large
players in crisis episodes. First, in the context of our study a large player is
defined as an agent with market power. The influence of a large player on the
market outcome is not, however, mechanically related to her size, as measured
by the value of asset holdings or market share. Clearly, players with equal
size can differ in their ability to influence the portfolio strategies of other
agents in the market, owing to, for instance, access to superior information
and/or special forecasting ability. There are a number of reasons to expect
a positive association between a trader’s size and her reputation for quality
of information: for instance, traders controlling a large portfolio of assets
are able to devote more resources to data collection and analysis, thus are
more likely to obtain superior information. However, large traders need not
be better informed in all circumstances. If smaller market participants can
better exploit information asymmetries and other market inefficiencies, the
actions of large traders may have only limited influence. To shed light on
this issue, our analysis is carried out under different assumptions about the
precision of the large trader’s information relative to the rest of the market.
    Second, while herding may have exacerbated swings in capital flows and
the ensuing changes in asset prices, it was a large set of investors — do-
mestic and foreign, small and large, highly leveraged and not — who jointly
contributed to market volatility in the turmoil episodes of the 1990s. Thus,
while it is important to study the specific role that large HLIs might have
played in these episodes, it is crucial to understand their role in the broader
macroeconomic context in which these events occurred. In fact, most of the
crisis episodes considered in this study unfolded against the backdrop of dete-
riorating macroeconomic fundamentals, policy uncertainties, and structural
weaknesses.

2       Modelling the role of large traders in spec-
        ulative attacks
In this section we analyze leading theories of currency and financial crises,
with the goal of understanding the role of large traders in generating and sus-
taining speculative attacks. We consider two classes of models of coordination
games. The first allows for multiple instantaneous equilibria and sunspots,
therefore interpreting the crisis as a switch from one rational-expectations
equilibrium to another. The second focuses on games where agents rely on
private information in forming their beliefs about the fundamentals of the
economy, as well as about other agents’ beliefs and strategies. In these lat-
ter games — known as global games — the nature of crises is rooted not in
the multiplicity of equilibria, but in a stochastic flow of unobservable private
information.
    Our analysis focuses on static games, analyzing the decision process of
agents who have to decide, independently and simultaneously, whether or not
to attack a currency. A subsection deals with an example of dynamic game
with Bayesian learning (as discussed in Dasgupta (2001)), where agents may
choose to take a position before the rest of the market or to wait so as to gain
information by observing trading activity. We conclude with a discussion of
open issues, pointing at a new generation of models which synthesize desirable
features from different approaches.

2.1     A unified analytical framework
To begin, consider a small open economy where the central bank pegs the
exchange rate at some parity. The economy is populated by a continuum of
risk-neutral traders, each of whom can take an infinitesimal position against
the currency. In addition, there may be a single trader who can take a ‘large’
— that is, discrete — position against the currency.
    Let ` denote the mass of financial resources that are mobilized by (small
and large) speculators when attacking the currency. The variable ` varies
between 0 (nobody attacks the currency) and 1 (the whole market attacks
the currency).1 As a stylized way to model heterogeneity in agents’ size, we
    1
    To motivate the boundaries on ` one can think of factors such as credit constraints,
short-sale restrictions, or prudential guidelines limiting the size of speculative open posi-


                                             4
allow for a single large player who can mobilize resources up to λ ≤ 1. The
combined mass of resources available to small traders then amounts to 1 − λ.
    As the focus of the analysis is on speculative attacks, we abstract from
welfare-related considerations (a devaluation can be either good or bad for
the economy), so the reasons why monetary authorities decide to relinquish
the peg are not explicitly analyzed. It may be helpful to keep in mind
the textbook example of an economy endowed with a stock of international
reserves, where the central bank is willing to defend the exchange rate only
as long as reserves are above some predetermined critical level. The central
bank sets this level based on its assessment of the economic fundamentals
of the country, indexed by θ in our model. The critical level is low when
fundamentals are strong (θ is high): the central bank is willing to use a large
amount of reserves to defend the exchange rate. Conversely, the critical level
is high when fundamentals are weak (θ is low): even a mild speculative attack
can force the central bank to abandon the peg.
    The condition for a currency collapse is therefore:

                                         ` ≥ θ.                                      (1)

Since 0 ≤ ` ≤ 1, a collapse always occurs if θ is negative (the economic
outlook is so bad that the central bank has no incentive to maintain the peg
even if no attack materializes), and never occurs if θ > 1. A collapse may or
may not occur for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1, depending on whether the currency is attacked
by a sufficient mass of speculators.
    For simplicity, we assume that the ex-post payoffs to individual agents
are independent of the state of fundamentals.2 From the viewpoint of each
agent, taking a speculative position in the currency market entails a cost
t ≤ 1, including both transaction costs and the differential between the
domestic and the foreign interest rate. So, if an agent attacks the currency
but the currency does not collapse, her ex-post payoff is −t, that is the loss
due to transaction costs incurred when speculating. If, instead, the currency
collapses, the ex-post payoff is assumed to be 1 − t. If the agent does not
attack, the payoff is identically equal to 0. All these payoffs are measured
per unit of domestic currency.
tions in a currency market.

     As will be apparent in what follows, the extension to the general case would confirm
and strengthen our results.


                                           5
    Agents take their speculative positions independently and simultaneously.3
The timing is as follows: A) Agents have a uniform ignorance prior about θ,
i.e. θ is uniformly distributed over the real line.4 At the beginning of the
period, they receive a signal about the state of fundamentals. B) Agents take
their speculative positions in the foreign exchange market at given prices; `
is determined. C) The state of the economy θ is revealed. D) The central
bank either defends or devalues the exchange rate according to (1).

2.2     Models with symmetric information
2.2.1    Common knowledge and multiple equilibria
We now discuss models of currency and financial crises that stress the role of
multiple equilibria, focusing first on the baseline case in which all agents are
atomistic. Consider the following specification of the information structure:
previous to trading, all agents receive the same public signal y about the
fundamentals θ:
                            y = θ + τη        τ >0                           (2)
where Eη = 0 and the probability distribution function of η is symmetric
and smooth (we write H for the cumulative distribution function5 ). Note
that agents do not know the exact state of the fundamentals. Given the
uniform prior about θ, their posterior distribution of the fundamentals is H,
with mean y and standard deviation τ .
   To calculate the expected payoff for an individual agent i, one needs to
specify her conjecture about the positions taken by the rest of the market.
Consider the two extreme conjectures, which will be the relevant ones in
equilibrium. The first is that all agents other than i attack the currency.
   3
     In most of our study, we abstract from intertemporal considerations and focus on one-
period models. Below we discuss a model that allows for a sequential-move game among
speculators.
   4
     As pointed out by Morris and Shin (2000), improper priors make it possible to con-
centrate on the updated beliefs of the traders conditional on their signals without taking
into account the information contained in the prior distribution. In any case, results with
the improper prior can be seen as the limiting case as the information in the prior density
goes to zero. See Hartigan (1983) for a discussion of improper priors, and Morris and Shin
(2000, section 2) for a discussion of the latter point.
   5
     This implies Pr [η ≤ x] = Pr [η ≥ −x] = H (x).



                                            6
Conditional on ` = 1, the expected payoff from attacking for i can be written
as:                                                     ²     ³
                                                          1−y
          (1 − t) Pr [θ ≤ 1 | y] − t Pr [θ > 1 | y] = H         −t        (3)
                                                           τ
If the public signal is such that this expected payoff is non-negative, it is
optimal for i to speculate against the currency. Since all agents are identical,
this must be true for everyone in the economy: when the above expression is
non-negative, ` = 1 is an equilibrium.
    The second conjecture is that no one attacks. Conditional on ` = 0, the
expected payoff from attacking is:
                                                         ²     ³
                                                           0−y
           (1 − t) Pr [θ ≤ 0 | y] − t Pr [θ > 0 | y] = H         −t         (4)
                                                            τ

As before, if the public signal is such that the individual expected payoff is
negative, it is optimal for i not to attack the currency. As all agents are
identical, ` = 0 is an equilibrium. Note that (3) is larger than (4): individual
payoffs are strategic complements, i.e. given the signal y, they are increasing
in the action taken by other agents in the economy.
    For the sake of comparison with the global-game model discussed below,
we now rearrange (3) and (4) to describe the optimal behavior by individual
speculators in terms of ‘trigger strategies’. Note that, conditional on everyone
else attacking, the maximum value of the public signal at which an agent
optimally chooses to attack is:

                               y ∗ ≡ 1 − τ H −1 (t)                           (5)

Conditional on ` = 1, the optimal strategy pursued by any individual agent
is to attack if and only if y ≤ y ∗ . By the same token, if everyone else refrains
from attacking (` = 0), the threshold value for an agent to choose not to
attack is:
                                y ∗ ≡ 0 − τ H −1 (t)                           (6)
Thus, conditional on ` = 0, an agent refrains from speculation if and only if
y > y∗.
   Now, either threshold is a rational-expectations equilibrium. However,
what determines the choice of one threshold over the other is not explained
by the model. Simply, it is assumed that exogenous uncertainty — the

                                        7
same for all individuals — drives the threshold selection. Note that, since
y ∗ > y ∗ , the model predicts that an attack will occur for sure (irrespective of
which equilibrium threshold is selected) if y ≤ y ∗ , but it will never occur if
y > y ∗ . In the first case, the signal about fundamentals is so bad that each
individual’s expected payoff from attacking is non-negative regardless of the
action taken by the rest of the market: everyone attacks the currency. In the
second case, the expected payoff is negative even if everyone else attacks the
currency: no one speculates.
    When the public signal is in the range y ∗ < y ≤ y ∗ the economy may or
may not be hit by a speculative run on the currency, depending on which
threshold is chosen by the speculators.6 Note that for it is rational for each
individual to participate in the attack only if everyone else attacks the cur-
rency. As all agents choose the same threshold, this model assumes common
knowledge not only of the public signal on the fundamentals but also of the
actions undertaken by every individual in the market. This means that, in
equilibrium, each individual must somehow know that all the other agents
have simultaneously chosen to attack.

2.2.2    Large traders in models with symmetric information
We now recast the model to allow for a large trader. The presence of a
large trader does not affect the upper threshold y ∗ , corresponding to an
equilibrium in which all agents attack the currency. What does change is
the lower threshold y ∗ . When the signal on the fundamentals is positive but
weak, the speculative firepower of a large investor may be sufficient to force a
devaluation, even if no small agent participates in the attack. The expression
for the lower threshold (6) is therefore replaced by:

                                 y ∗ (λ) ≡ λ − τ H −1 (t)                                (7)

So, the larger the trader’s size λ, the larger the range of public signals that
trigger an attack and the lower the range of signals over which an attack may
or may not occur. The conclusion from this model is straightforward. The
presence of a large trader increases the vulnerability of a peg, as this trader
   6
    We should note here that a speculative attack by the entire market does not necessarily
coincide ex-post with a collapse of the currency, as this only occurs if the ex-post value of
the fundamentals θ is smaller than 1.


                                             8
trivially solves the ‘coordination problem’ in a speculative attack for signals
in the interval between 0 and λ.
    While in this benchmark model we cannot analyze the effects of varying
the relative precision of the large trader’s information (the signal is the same
for every agent), we can nonetheless derive an important result by varying
the precision of the public signal. From (7) and (5), it is apparent that (if t
is relatively small, i.e. t < 1/2) both thresholds y ∗ (λ) and y ∗ are increasing
in τ . Higher uncertainty, say, a mean-preserving spread of the distribution of
the public signal, leads all agents to raise the trigger for an attack, regardless
of the equilibrium on which agents coordinate.
    In equilibrium small traders always take the same side of the market as
the large one. To avoid misunderstandings of this model, we stress that this
does not imply that the large trader has ‘signalling’ ability or represents a
‘focal point’. For y ≤ y ∗ (λ) the currency is expected to collapse even if no
small trader attacks the currency. For y ∗ (λ) < y ≤ y ∗ the presence of a large
trader makes no difference: in this region, an attack by a large trader does not
represent a ‘focal point’, at least no more so than any other event relevant to
the coordination of agents’ expectations on a particular equilibrium. This is
not to deny that signalling and ‘focal points’ may be relevant in equilibrium
selection. But these elements require a different approach, possibly loosening
the assumption of common knowledge about the fundamentals.

2.3    Models with asymmetric information
We now turn to a class of coordination games according to which incomplete
information is the key element of a theory of speculative behavior. The
approach in this section is based on the mechanism of equilibrium selection
first analyzed by Carlsson and Van Damme (1993) for the case of two agents,
then in a series of papers by Morris and Shin for a continuum of agents,
including a contribution to the theory of currency crises (Morris and Shin
(1998)). Building on this approach, Corsetti, Dasgupta, Morris and Shin
(2000) have provided a comprehensive theory of the role of large traders in
a currency crisis. The analysis in this subsection discusses this contribution
in detail.
    The main feature of the global-games approach to speculative crises is
that agents do not share information about the fundamentals of the econ-
omy, but observe informative private signals about it. Even if the noise of the

                                        9
private signals becomes very small, individual information about the funda-
mentals never becomes common knowledge among traders. In other words,
upon receiving her own signal, the representative trader can only guess the
signals reaching the other traders, as well as their conjectures about each
others’ information and guesses. She cannot, however, count on the other
traders to know her information and conjectures — each agent forms her
beliefs based exclusively on her own information. This departure from the
assumption of common knowledge of the signal is crucial for the results that
follow.

2.3.1     The global-games approach to currency speculation
Once again, we start by abstracting from the presence of a large trader (i.e.
λ = 0). As in the previous section, agents have a uniform ignorance prior
over θ; however, here there is no public signal to all agents; rather, each small
trader in the continuum receives a private signal:

                                xi = θ + σεi           σ>0                                 (8)

where the distribution of εi is smooth and symmetric (we let F denote the
cumulative distribution function). While there is no public information about
θ, the distribution of the fundamentals θ as well as of signals xi is common
knowledge.7
   7
     To understand the logic of the model in the absence of common knowledge of the signal,
it is useful to look at an example in which the noise in the private signal is distributed
uniformly with a bounded support of size ±β around the realization of θ. Agent i knows
that the fundamentals are distributed in an interval of size β on each side of xi , i.e.
θ ∈ [xi − β, xi + β] . As the realization of θ may fall on an extreme of this interval, agent i
cannot exclude that the signal of agent j is equal to xj = xi + 2β. But if agent j receives a
signal as far as 2β from xi , she concludes that θ is in an interval of size 2β around xi + 2β
and, most important, cannot exclude that agent i’s signal xi is 4β distant from its actual
position. Iterating once more the argument above, we see that agent i cannot exclude that
agent j believes that agent i’s own beliefs about agent j’s signal are as far as 6β from xi ,
and so on. Note the paradox in this result. Agent i is 100 percent sure that θ is β-close to
her own signal. She also knows that all other agents get a signal within an interval of 2β.
Yet, the fact that agents do not have common information useful to locate the position
of the fundamentals makes them worry about the possibility that their opponents’ beliefs
about fundamentals and signals wonder quite far away from where the fundamentals and
the signals actually are.



                                              10
    Conjecture that, as before, all agents (optimally) follow a trigger strat-
egy: they attack if and only if their signal is below some optimally selected
threshold x∗ ; otherwise, they refrain from attacking. As noise is independent
of the fundamentals, the expected mass of agents attacking the currency is
equal to the probability that any particular agent receives a signal below x∗ .
So, for a given x∗ , the population of agents attacking the currency at θ will
be                                                ² ∗     ³
                       ∗                ∗           x −θ
                   `(x , θ) = Pr [xi ≤ x | θ] = F           .              (9)
                                                      σ
Now, we know that a crisis occurs when ` is at least as large as θ, that is,
when:                              ² ∗     ³
                          ∗         x −θ
                      `(x , θ) = F            ≥θ                       (10)
                                       σ
Thus, the maximum value of the fundamentals at which a crisis materializes
must satisfy:                     ² ∗
                                    x − θ∗
                                           ³
                       ∗ ∗
                    `(x , θ ) = F            = θ∗                    (11)
                                      σ
This means that, given x∗ , the peg collapses for any realization of the fun-
damentals below θ∗ , and survives otherwise.
    Next, if agents expect the currency to collapse for any θ ≤ θ∗ , the ex-
pected profit from an attack — conditional on receiving the signal xi —
is:                                                       ² ∗     ³
                         ∗                    ∗            θ − xi
        (1 − t) Pr [θ ≤ θ | xi ] − t Pr [θ > θ | xi ] = F           −t   (12)
                                                              σ
Since agents attack if and only if their expected profit is non-negative, the
minimum value of the signal xi at which they attack, x∗ , satisfies:
                             ² ∗
                               θ − x∗
                                        ³
                           F              −t=0                           (13)
                                   σ

Thus, given θ∗ , agents optimally choose to attack upon receiving a private
signal smaller or equal to x∗ as defined above.
    The expressions (13) and (11) represent a system of two equations in two
unknowns (x∗ and θ∗ ) that completely characterize the equilibrium of the




                                      11
model.8 Solving this system, it is easy to see that the equilibrium in trigger
strategies is unique. From equation (13) above, accounting for the symmetry
of the signal, it follows that:
                                  ² ∗
                                    x − θ∗
                                            ³
                              1−F              =t                         (14)
                                       σ
Comparing (13) and (14) the threshold value for the fundamental is:
                                        θ∗ = 1 − t.                                      (15)
Note that 1 − t is also the proportion of agents attacking the currency at θ =
θ∗ . Using this result in (11) yields a closed form solution for the individual
threshold:
                     x∗ = θ∗ − σF −1 (t) = 1 − t − σF −1 (t)               (16)
    Note that, if we let the noise in the private signal go to zero, the trigger
point tends to the threshold value for the fundamental: x∗ → θ∗ . As agents
become more confident about the information content of their signal, the level
of the optimal trigger tends to coincide with the threshold value θ∗ . A well-
known feature of this model is that not only its trigger-strategies equilibrium
is unique, but agents optimally select the trigger strategy characterized above
over any other possible strategy. The proof of uniqueness can be found in
Morris and Shin (2000).9
   8
      The system above is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium. According to the standard definitions,
a strategy for an agent is a rule that prescribes an action for each realization of her private
signal. A profile of strategies (one for each agent) is an equilibrium if, conditional on the
information available to each agent i, and given the strategies followed by other agents, the
action prescribed by the strategy followed by agent i maximizes her conditional expected
payoff (utility).
    9
      Two points are worth noticing. First, the equilibrium is unique in the sense that
agents choose a unique threshold for their signal. With a continuum of agents there is no
aggregate uncertainty, so there is also a unique level of the fundamentals that triggers a
crisis. In equilibrium, however, agents may and will choose different actions depending on
the specific realizations of their signals. In other words, there will be heterogeneity in the
behavior of investors — to be contrasted with the strong result in common-knowledge,
multiple-equilibrium models where everybody takes the same action in equilibrium. Sec-
ond, the structure of information is crucial to uniqueness. As shown by Morris and Shin
(2000), were agents to receive both a private and a public signal, there would be some
threshold for the relative precision of these two signals beyond which the equilibrium in
trigger strategies is no longer unique: despite the presence of private information, we are
back to the case discussed in the previous subsection.


                                              12
2.3.2    Large traders in models with asymmetric information
A large trader of size λ is now introduced in the economy. The small traders
keep receiving private signals xi with the properties stated above, and the
large trader receives a private signal denoted by xl :

                               xl = θ + σl εl         σl > 0                            (17)

where the distribution of εl is smooth and symmetric (we write L for the
cumulative distribution). Notably, σl can and will differ from σ. In other
words, the precision of the signal of the large trader (which is the inverse of
the variance of the signal σl2 ) can differ from the precision of the signal of a
typical small trader.
    This is a realistic feature of the model. On the one hand, as argued in
the introduction, it is widely believed that large traders tend to have access
to superior information. On the other hand, even if large traders are better
informed on average, under some circumstances the ranking of information
may favor small traders. It is therefore useful to analyze both cases. In
the model, it is assumed that all agents in the market are aware of their
relative information precision, i.e. the distribution of the signals, including
the relative size of σ and σl , is common knowledge.
    To derive the equilibrium, conjecture again that all players play trigger
strategies.10 From the previous subsection, we know that the mass of small
traders attacking the currency is equal to the probability that any particular
agent receives a signal below some optimal trigger x∗ , as in (9). Now, the
small traders amount to a percentage 1−λ of the market. Thus, the condition
for a crisis to occur as a result of an attack exclusively by the small traders
is equivalent to (10) rescaled by 1 − λ:
                                      ² ∗       ³
                                         x −θ
                            (1 − λ) F             ≥θ                         (18)
                                            σ

and the value of the fundamentals below which the currency collapses satis-
fies:                               ² ∗   ³
                                     x −θ
                          (1 − λ) F         =θ                        (19)
                                        σ
  10
     We refer to Corsetti et al. (2000) for a proof that trigger strategies will be optimally
selected even if agents were allowed to choose other types of strategies.


                                             13
    If the large trader attacks the currency as well, the financial resources
mobilized by speculators on the left hand side of (18) are increased by λ.
Following the same steps as above, consider the level of fundamentals θ̄ that
solves:                                ² ∗     ³
                                        x − θ̄
                         λ + (1 − λ) F           = θ̄                    (20)
                                           σ
Obviously it is θ < θ̄. When the fundamentals are below θ, the currency
collapses whether or not the large trader attacks. When the fundamentals
are between θ and θ̄ the peg collapses if and only if all traders, small and
large, speculate against the currency. To sum up, with a large trader we have
two thresholds for the fundamentals (θ and θ̄) instead of a single one (θ∗ ).
Note that the distance between the two is not equal to λ.
    Next, consider the expected payoff of the large trader. This agent knows
that, if she attacks, the currency will collapse for any θ ≤ θ̄. Clearly, she
chooses to attack as long as the expected profit conditional on her signal is
non-negative, i.e. as long as:
                                                   ²         ³
                ¢          £      ¢           £      θ̄ − xl
     (1 − t) Pr θ ≤ θ̄ | xl − t Pr θ > θ̄ | xl = L             −t≥0      (21)
                                                        σl

The highest value of the signal at which she attacks, that is her trigger x∗l ,
thus solves:
                                  θ̄ − x∗l
                                ²          ³
                             L               =t                          (22)
                                     σl
    To evaluate the expected payoff of the typical small trader is not as easy.
Small traders know that the currency will collapse for sure for any realization
of the fundamentals worse than θ. When θ is between θ and θ̄, a collapse
will only occur if the large player participates in the attack — that is, if and
only if the large trader receives a signal worse than x∗l . The expected profit
from an attack conditional on the signal xi must therefore be written keeping
these different regions of the fundamentals separated from each other.
    Conditional on the signal xi , we write the posterior density over θ for a
small trader as:                     ²        ³
                                 1     θ − xi

                                              θ

The analysis of the model can be considerably simplified with a change of
variables, using the following definitions:
                              θ − x∗      θ − x∗         θ − x∗
                    z≡               , δ≡        and δ ≡        .                        (25)
                                σ           σ              σ
It can be shown that both δ and δ are monotonically decreasing in x∗ . The
threshold for the large player (x∗l in (22)) can now be written as:

                                   x∗l = x∗ + σ δ̄ − σl L−1 (t)                          (26)

while the optimal threshold for the small players, x∗ , is the unique solution
to the following equation:
                          Zδ             ²                   ³
                                             σ       ¡   −1
               F (δ) +         f (z) L          δ − z − L (t) dz − t = 0                 (27)
                                             σl
                          δ

Once x∗ is determined,12 the large trader’s switching point x∗l and the two
thresholds for the fundamentals are also uniquely determined.

2.3.3    Does a large trader increase financial fragility? The role of
         size and information precision
In contrast to the model with small traders only, the model with a large
player has no closed-form solution. However, the key results can be analyzed
  11
      Note that this expression requires the signal of the large trader to be independent
from the signal of a typical small trader.
   12
      Observe that the function on the left hand side of (27) is continuous and strictly
increasing in both δ and δ, variables that are in turn continuous and strictly decreasing
functions of x∗ . Also note that the left hand side of (27) is positive for sufficiently small
x∗ , while becomes negative for sufficiently large x∗ . Thus, there is a unique x∗ solving
(27).


                                                      15
by focusing on its limiting properties, i.e. by letting agents become arbitrarily
well informed about the fundamentals.
    Consider the case in which the information of the large trader is arbi-
trarily more precise than the information of the rest of the market, that
is, lim σ/σl = ∞. Evaluating (27) under this maintained assumption, we
observe that for any θ ≤ θ̄ (that is, for any z ≤ δ̄) the probability that a
precisely informed large trader chooses to attack is equal to one. We can
thus write:
                                Zδ
                         F (δ) + f (z) dz = F (δ̄) = t                      (28)
                                     δ

This expression has a simple interpretation. If in the limit the noise in the
large trader’s signal is zero, small traders need simply guess the position of
the fundamentals, thereby forming their best estimate of the signal to the
large trader. Intuitively, a large trader with extremely precise information
does not ‘add’ any noise to the estimation problem of small traders: they
need not worry about the large trader’s errors.
    To solution of the model is then:
                                          ¡
               θ̄ = λ + (1 − λ) F −δ̄ → λ + (1 − λ) (1 − t)
              x∗ → θ̄ − σF −1 (t)                                         (29)
              x∗l = θ̄ − σl L−1 (t)

These expressions establish a first important result. In equilibrium, θ̄, x∗l and
x∗ are increasing in the size of the large player, λ. A larger λ makes the large
and the small traders more aggressive, in the sense that they optimally choose
to attack for higher values of their signals. In particular, since θ̄ > 1 − t = θ∗ ,
relative to the benchmark with small traders only, the presence of a large,
well-informed trader increases the fragility of the market by making small
traders willing to attack the currency for stronger fundamentals.13
  13
    A heuristic argument can help to clarify the latter point. As we observed in Section
2.3.1, without a large trader (λ = 0) the threshold for an attack by small traders only is
equal to 1 − t. This means that, at θ = 1 − t, a proportion 1 − t of traders attacks the
currency. Now, suppose that each small trader is taken away a share λ of her resources,
and that this share is given to a single large trader with arbitrarily precise information.
At θ = 1 − t, the amount of resources thrown into the market by small traders falls from
1 − t to (1 − t)(1 − λ). Yet, at θ = 1 − t, because of her arbitrarily precise information,


                                            16
    What if the information of the large trader is less precise than that of
the small players? Will the size of the large trader still affect the fragility
of the market (despite inferior information)? Interestingly, the answer is a
qualified yes. Referring to Corsetti et al. (2000) for details, when lim σ/σl = 0
the influence of an uninformed large trader on the small traders’ strategies
is either nul or moderate, depending on the size of λ. If λ is small enough,
varying λ does not affect the equilibrium strategy of small traders: intuitively,
the noisy behavior of the large trader is offset, in equilibrium, by the net
positions taken by the bulk of the market. If λ is large enough, the ‘erratic’
behavior of the large trader cannot be offset by the rest of the market. Her
presence still makes all traders more aggressive, but to a lesser extent than
in the case discussed above.
    We can now draw our main conclusions from this model by stressing two
key elements for a theory of speculative attacks with large traders. The first
element is size. In the model, λ is positively related to the small traders’ ex-
pected payoff, through its influence on the region of fundamentals in which
a collapse of the currency is possible. As the upper bound of this region, θ,
is increasing in λ, speculative attacks can be successful for stronger funda-
mentals. Consistently, the threshold x∗ — that is, the maximum estimated
value of the fundamentals at which small traders are willing to attack the
currency — is also increasing (in some limit cases non-decreasing) in λ.
    The second element is the relative precision of information, as indexed
by the ratio σ/σl . For a given λ, a high degree of large trader’s information
accuracy (i.e. an arbitrarily small σl ) reduces the uncertainty about the
behavior of the large player herself and increases the expected payoff of the
small agents for any given signal. Small traders thus become more aggressive
in the market (i.e. they attack at a higher threshold x∗ ). Interestingly, a
large player with relatively low precision of information can still exert some
influence on market participants’ behavior, but the extent of her influence is
much lower.
    Note the difference between the prediction of this model and the main
the large trader will always attack the currency, using the full amount of the resources
given to her. Thus, the overall amount of resources in the market increases from 1 − t to
λ + (1 − t)(1 − λ), so that 1 − t can no longer be the threshold of the fundamentals at
which the currency collapses. But this means that, in the presence of a large trader, the
region of the fundamentals where the currency is expected to collapse becomes wider, and
small agents are willing to follow a more aggressive trading strategy.


                                           17
conclusion of the model with multiple equilibria. In the latter model, a large
trader increases the vulnerability of a peg independently of the behavior of
small traders — recall that the presence of a large trader only affects the
lower threshold y ∗ of the signal, increasing it by an amount equal to her size.
However, for signals in the upper end of the region of multiple equilibria,
the large trader makes no difference. In the global-games model, however,
the impact of a large player on the market outcome depends crucially on
her influence on the behavior of small traders. Moreover, the large player
makes a difference for strong fundamentals: it is the upper threshold θ̄ that
is increasing in λ as, for a bigger λ, both the large and the small traders bet
against the currency for stronger values of their signals x∗l and x∗ .
    Thus, while multiple equilibrium models shed light on the effects of a
large trader when fundamentals are relatively weak, the global-games model
shows that the presence of a large trader may make a difference in economies
with relatively strong fundamentals. Together, these two classes of models
show that, in some circumstances, pegs that may not (or would not) collapse
in the absence of a large trader, may well be expected to crumble down if
one big elephant steps into a small pond.

2.3.4    Signalling and herding
An important lesson from the above model is that a large trader can increase
the fragility of a peg even when the market can at best guess her actual port-
folio position and information. Her mere presence influences the equilibrium
portfolio strategies in the market as a whole, especially when the large trader
has more precise information. We may reasonably expect this influence to
increase further if the large trader is given the opportunity to let the market
learn her positions and/or information.
    Consider the following problem of dynamic coordination with learning —
an example that can be framed in a modified version of the above model.14
After receiving their signals about the state of the fundamentals, both the
large and the small traders can now choose between ‘moving first’ or wait-
ing one period before taking a speculative position in the foreign exchange
market. The state of the economy θ is revealed after all agents have built up
their positions, and the payoffs are independent of the timing of the move,
  14
    We draw once again on Corsetti et al. (2000). The example is from a class of models
discussed in Dasgupta (2001).


                                          18
so that there are no costs to waiting. Late movers can observe the trad-
ing flow generated by early movers, raising the possibility of ‘signalling’ (by
assumption, there is no other form of communication).
      Should small traders ‘move first’ ? To the extent that their size is in-
finitesimal, small traders’ individual positions do not influence trading flows
in any appreciable way. As each small trader ignores the impact of her own
action on the market, she cannot hope to affect the market by moving first.
However, small traders may obtain some informational benefit by waiting.
Thus, it can be concluded that small traders will weakly prefer to be late
movers. It is plausible to assume that, if indifferent between being early or
late movers, small traders will move late.
      Now, since the large trader knows that small traders have no reason to
move early, she will never learn anything by waiting. Still, her portfolio
position cannot be ignored by the market. Instead, by letting people know
her portfolio position, she may increase the probability that her strategy be
successful. Thus, a large trader weakly prefers to move early. Once again, it
is plausible to assume that, if indifferent about the timing of the move, the
large trader will move early.15
      From here on, the analysis follows the same steps outlined in the previous
subsection but with an important qualification: now the decision taken by
small traders is conditional on the action taken by the large trader. Conjec-
ture that the large trader chooses to attack only if her signal is lower than
x∗l , where, as in (22), this threshold is defined by

                              Pr θ ≤ θ̄ | xl = x∗l = t
                                 ¢                £
                                                                            (30)

If the large trader does not attack, her inaction signals that, based on her
own information, she finds the economy to be strong (that is, xl > x∗l ).
Yet, those small traders that receive a bad signal about the fundamentals
may nonetheless choose to attack the currency, thinking that enough small
traders will join the attack and cause a collapse. So, there will be an optimal
threshold x∗ , below which small traders attack the currency even when the
   15
      A large trader’s incentive to move first is strong when her estimate of the fundamentals
is not too good or too bad, leading her to believe that an attack will be successful only
if many small traders join. Conversely, if the private signal xl is bad enough, the large
trader may expect a currency collapse regardless of speculation by small traders. In this
case, as there is no cost of waiting, she will be indifferent between attacking early or late
(the same consideration applies for signals xl that are sufficiently good).


                                             19
large trader has not taken a speculative position against it. This optimal
threshold is defined by

                         Pr [θ ≤ θ | xl > x∗l , xi = x∗ ] = t                       (31)

if a finite solution to this equation exists. Otherwise, if the left hand side of
the above equation is strictly larger (smaller) than the right hand side, x∗ is
set equal to +∞ (−∞).
    Of course, when the large trader attacks the currency, she signals to the
small traders a quite different assessment of the strength of the economic
fundamentals (as xl ≤ x∗l ). Relative to the previous case, small traders are
willing to attack for a wider range of signals they receive. The optimal trigger
conditional on an attack by the large trader, denoted x∗ , is defined by

                         Pr θ ≤ θ̄ | xl ≤ x∗l , xi = x∗ = t
                            ¢                          £
                                                                             (32)

if a finite solution to this equation exists. Otherwise, x∗ is set equal to +∞
or −∞, depending on whether the left hand side of the above equation is
larger or small than the right hand side.
    Through her influence on the trigger strategies of small traders, the large
investor induces some herding in the market: for a given distribution of
private signals, her position affects the number of agents taking the same
side of the market. The extent of herding will depend on the equilibrium
value of the two thresholds above. If these are not finite, there will be a
stronger form of herding: the position of the large trader will determine the
position of all other agents in the market.16
    To illustrate this point, suppose the signal of the large trader is arbitrarily
precise relative to the signals received by the rest of the market. In this case
there are no finite solutions for the triggers of small traders, but x∗ = −∞ and
x∗ = +∞, while θ and θ̄ converge to 0 and 1, respectively. In equilibrium, a
large trader with superior information effectively ‘leads the pack’ of the small
traders with no defection: each small agent ignores her own private signal
and always takes the same side of the market as the large trader (we return
to this in the next section).17
  16
     The thresholds of the fundamentals below which the currency collapses solve
(1 − λ) Pr [xi ≤¢ x∗ | θ = θ] = £θ if the large trader has not attacked the currency, and
λ + (1 − λ) Pr xi ≤ x∗ | θ = θ̄ = θ̄ otherwise.
  17
     See Dasgupta (1999) for a theoretical discussion of herding in coordination games.


                                           20
    In the limiting case σ/σl → ∞, herding does not depend on the size λ of
the large investor. As long as λ > 0, even a relatively small player can have
the strongest impact as long as the market regards her information is arbi-
trarily precise. That is to say, the only dimension in which size is important
is the signalling ability associated with it, i.e. the fact that the market does
not ignore the influence of her actions on the equilibrium outcome.
    Size makes a difference, however, when the large trader’s information is
less than arbitrarily precise, and becomes very important if the ranking of
information precision tilts in favor of small players. To see this, suppose
that a large player without precise information gets a relatively bad signal
on the fundamentals. By moving first and attacking the currency, she cannot
hope to affect significantly the beliefs of the other agents, who know that her
information is relatively inaccurate. Yet, by moving first, the large trader
can reduce the small traders’ uncertainty about her action in equilibrium.
Small agents will decide their optimal behavior knowing she has (or has not)
thrown her resources on the market. If she attacks, for a larger λ, a smaller
resource gap remains to be filled for a speculative attack to be successful.
    To summarize, the dynamic effects of a large trader are related both to
information about the fundamentals and to the size of resources already
devoted to an attack. In the limiting case (the information of the large
trader is extremely accurate), the first factor overshadows the second. But
for some lower degree of precision of information, we may expect the second
factor to dominate.

2.4     Open issues
2.4.1   Do large players destabilize markets?
In the long-standing academic and policy debate on whether speculation is
destabilizing, the role of large players is a particularly hot item. One view
is that large traders and arbitrageurs able to collect and process superior
information improve the efficiency of the price mechanism. Also, because
of their ability and willingness to take leveraged positions, HLIs can be an
important source of market liquidity. The alternative view emphasizes their
role as catalysts of market panic and short-termism. The literature provides
many example in which market efficiency is jeopardized by the behavior of
noisy traders even when they are atomistic, let alone when the size of their


                                      21
speculative positions make them primary suspects as market ‘agitators’.
    Indeed, an oft-voiced concern is that the presence of large players may
not just lead to short-term, high-frequency excess volatility of exchange rates
and other asset prices, but also to persistent and destabilizing deviations
of asset prices from their equilibrium values, with negative effects on real
economic activity. This is the case, for instance, if the actions of large players
can trigger currency crises that would have not otherwise occurred, or force
monetary authorities to prevent a currency collapse at the cost of hiking
interest rates and halting growth.
    In fact, it is rather hard to prove that any specific economy fits this
description. Some have however argued that Hong Kong in 1998 was the
nearest case of an economy whose fundamentals were generally sound, in
spite of some macro weaknesses, but came close to the collapse of its cur-
rency board regime as a result of aggressive speculation against its forex and
stock markets. In this example, only a controversial direct intervention of
the authorities in the equity market prevented a break of the peg and further
sharp falls in its equity market.18 But the effects of defending the peg with
high interest rates, likely exacerbating the recessionary effects of the Asian
crisis on the domestic economy, were quite costly. While it remains con-
troversial to assess whether the actions of large players have a destabilizing
impact (and counterfactuals are hard to assess when fundamentals interact
with complex market dynamics), the welfare costs of potential destabilization
have been a matter of concern for policy makers in small and medium sized
economies.
    In the models discussed above, the mere presence of a large trader makes
all other agents more aggressive, and ready to bail out for stronger values
of the fundamentals. While the analysis does not explicitly address welfare
issues, it is compatible with models in which the economy ends up being worse
off after a currency collapse. We should note that the above analysis rests on
the key assumption that the large trader profits in the event of a devaluation.
This may not be always the case. As large traders take speculative positions
in many different markets, it is plausible that, under some circumstances,
they may actually lose because of currency instability. To mention but one
example, in 1998 several large financial institutions were reportedly long in
Russian assets. Given the size of their portfolios, and the relative thinness of
  18
       See below, Section 3.4.


                                       22
the market for such assets, a precipitous unwinding of long positions would
have exposed these institutions to heavy losses. Attempts to hedge these
positions through forward purchases were thwarted when the fall of the ruble
led counterparts to default on their contracts.
    This example suggests that, in some situations, large traders may well
prefer exchange rate stability to a devaluation. To analyze this case in the
theoretical model presented in this section, one needs to allow for a more gen-
eral payoff function, reflecting the initial portfolio positions of large players.
In this case the presence of a large trader may end up making small players
less (instead of more) aggressive in the currency market, thus reducing the
likelihood of speculative attacks and sharp currency devaluations.

2.4.2    Do large players have substantial market impact?
One may claim that the estimated total size of large players’ activity (say
HFs’ net currency positions) is too small, relative to the depth of the forex
market and the amount of international reserves available to the governments,
to be a determining factor in a currency crisis.19 But if markets think that
large players have access to superior information, the model presented above
suggests that even modest short positions by HFs may lead a large number
of other investors to ‘herd’. As many investors mirror the behavior of large
funds, the overall build-up of short positions against a currency is a multiple
of the cumulative positions of these funds — indeed, large enough to trigger
a currency crisis.
    In this respect, the FSF (2000) study suggests that, in the 1990s, some
macro HFs had built a very strong reputation in terms of information pre-
cision and ability to forecast macro developments. In addition, anecdotal
evidence suggests that many financial institutions stood ready to provide
credit to HFs as well as services in executing forex trade, at least in part as
a way to track the investment strategy of these funds. Information about
what HFs were doing was indeed considered a valuable asset by a wide range
   19
      Note that another large player in any forex market dynamics is the monetary authority
that may affect currency values through its intervention in the forex market. What usu-
ally distinguishes monetary authorities from other large players is the objective function:
maximization of the country’s welfare function for the former; profit maximization for the
latter. However, in some episodes, even monetary authorities in emerging economies have
allegedly engaged in currency trading for balance-sheet purposes.



                                            23
of investors.
    We should note here that small agents may try to infer the action by
informed large traders even when they do not have information about order
volumes. Under the plausible assumption that large trades tend to affect
prices, small agents without knowledge of order volumes can exploit the in-
formation implicit in price movements, by buying when prices are rising and
selling when prices are falling. In other words, price changes are interpreted
as signals that large players are buying or selling. This case for positive
feedback strategies, however, crucially depends on the degree of asymmetric
information in the market. One may think that strong asymmetries are not
likely in foreign exchange markets, since the information about macroeco-
nomic variables is mostly public. However, in the case of emerging markets,
certain players with privileged access to policy makers are usually believed to
have better information than average market participants, as well as superior
skills in analyzing public data.
    Two factors play a key role here: leverage capacity and overall market liq-
uidity. As regards the first factor, some players such as HFs are less restricted
than others (such as institutional investors) in taking large leveraged posi-
tions. In a speculative attack, these agents could mobilize massive resources
up to a multiple of their capital base.
    As regards market liquidity, the evidence suggests that forex liquidity
drops significantly in periods of turmoil (see FSF (2000)). So, while the
overall cumulative short position by HFs may be small relative to the depth
and liquidity of the market in normal times, its relative size may increase
significantly when market liquidity shrinks during crisis periods. This effect
is particularly strong under institutionalized fixed exchange rate regimes such
as currency boards, as these regimes limit the overall degree of liquidity in the
financial system. Even medium-sized sales of domestic currency to purchase
foreign currency can dry up liquidity very quickly — leading to interest rate
spikes such as the ones in Hong Kong in 1998, and in Turkey and Argentina in
late 2000. It should be stressed that a drying up of liquidity is an endogenous
feature of an equilibrium with speculative attacks. In the model above, for
instance, it is an implication of the herding result, as the speculative position
by a large informed agent makes all agents take the same side of the market.




                                       24
2.4.3    Do large players intentionally foster herding?
The above theoretical analysis vindicates the view that large players can
effectively behave like market leaders by signaling their investment strategies
(‘talking one’s book’), driving a large number of traders toward shorting a
particular currency or asset market. Nonetheless, this result by no means
implies that herding is always in the interest of large players, nor that we
should expect them to engage systematically in signalling games, revealing
their positions and information to the rest of the market. In fact, major
market participants may well try to prevent herding while they build (or
unwind) their short positions. It is only when positions have been built
that herding by other agents (taking short positions or outright selling the
currency) may become advantageous, as a way to increase the pressure on
the exchange rate and push a currency peg to break.
    Suppose a large player is planning to short a currency or an equity index
on expectations of a future fall in prices warranted by weakening fundamen-
tals. In order to minimize any effect from her trading on current prices,
her preference would be to build her positions secretly. The same consider-
ation applies to the case of a large player who is trying to unwind her short
positions, as herding would generate adverse upward pressures on prices.
Actually, if anything, a large player who is shorting an asset or unwinding
a short position may prefer the other agents to take a contrarian trading
position, so as to minimize price movements.
    In other words, when building a position, a large player has a clear interest
in trading at prices that do not reflect her private information. Only after
she has built up her position does she benefits if her information becomes
public, as prices would then move in the desired direction. At that point,
there is a clear incentive to engage in signalling, as analyzed in the period
model presented above.20
  20
     This issue is in part debated in the literature on optimal trading strategy. In the
model by Easley and O’Hara (1987), for instance, large trading size signals that some
informed agent is trading on the basis of superior information. These authors argue that
an investor trading on superior information will nonetheless prefer to take large positions
at any given prices. The alternative view, presented by Barclay and Warner (1993), is that
informed traders do not want to let the market learn their information by observing their
position. Thus they engage in ‘stealth trading’ (for instance, they use multiple medium
size orders). Of course, the reaction by small players will crucially depend on which trades
(large or small) they perceive to be more informative — see Lee, Lin and Liu (1999) for a


                                            25
    We note here that the goal of building a speculative position without
moving prices is helped by the presence of public authorities committed to
stabilizing prices — as is the case in a fixed exchange rate regime. It is still
true that early herding may be bad news for speculators — early speculative
pressure on the currency may translate into higher interest rates and forward
prices, raising the costs of shorting positions in that currency. Thus, there
are still advantages from keeping ‘early moves’ secret. Yet, price stabilizing
schemes, such as fixed rate regimes, usually lead domestic authorities to pro-
vide a large amount of liquidity at current prices. Under a flexible exchange
rate regime, instead, attempts to build large short positions without affecting
prices requires other investors to take the other side of the market (playing
contrarian and being long) as monetary authorities are not committed to
providing foreign currency at a fixed price. Again, only once such positions
have been taken does noisy signalling become profitable by pushing exchange
rates down.

2.4.4     Do large players inhibit contrarian trade?
In the model discussed in Section 2.3.5, strong herding only occurs in the
limiting case when the large trader is arbitrarily better informed than the
rest of the market. Otherwise, there will always be some agents who are
willing to take contrarian trading positions based on their own beliefs about
the sustainability of the existing regime. It is worth stressing that small
agents do not necessarily lose when taking long positions in the currency
against the large one. Even when the large trader has superior information,
her private information may not reflect the true state of the economy.
    Indeed, there is circumstantial evidence that, on a number of occasions
during the 1997-99 period, some HFs experienced heavy losses as the ma-
jority of market investors traded against them. In some episodes the losses
followed HFs’ attempts to bet on exchange rate stability and/or appreciation
by taking long positions on currencies under speculative pressure (such as the
alleged long positions by some large funds on the Indonesian rupiah in the
winter of 1997). Clearly, it is possible that large investors engage in strategic
games against each other. If so, differences in information and beliefs about
the evolution of fundamentals in a market would play a much larger role than
discussion of this issue.



                                       26
a stylized theoretical model with only one large trader and a mass of small
traders may suggest.
    Still, one cannot rule out the possibility that, despite differences in infor-
mation and opinions, the size and reputation of large players taking aggressive
position in market may, at times, drive out contrarian investors. Vis-à-vis the
usually high leverage capacity of hedge and investment funds, for instance,
risk aversion and credit constraints may effectively limit the amount of sta-
bilizing speculation that individuals and other institutions can provide. In
other words, in a speculative attack against a currency, small investors who
are risk averse and credit constrained may refrain from contrarian trading,
even if they believe that fundamentals do not warrant a devaluation. Para-
doxically, these investors may end up taking the same short positions as the
large institutions initiating the attack.
    While plausible and realistic, these conjectures should nonetheless be an-
alyzed systematically in models of speculative attacks explicitly allowing for
credit constraint and risk aversion. Differences in leverage and attitude to-
wards risk need not mechanically imply that small investors stay on the
sideline, or follow a large player in a ‘lemming’-like fashion.
    The theory of speculative attacks with large traders should also be de-
veloped so as to explain, rather then assume, differences in the size of the
speculative positions taken by economic agents. When trading size is en-
dogenous, individual agents know that choosing a large position helps solve
the coordination problem inherent in a speculative attack — for the rea-
sons discussed above, the chances of success are increasing in the magnitude
of speculation. Yet, agents choosing a large speculative position have also
more at stake. The marginal willingness to speculate of a risk-averse agent
can decrease rapidly as her open position grows. There are therefore two
contrasting forces shaping the optimal speculative behavior of investors, one
suggesting larger, the other smaller portfolio positions.
    In general, herding phenomena result from the complex and, at times,
unpredictable interaction of decisions of a large number of players, both small
and large. Whether domestic and foreign investors herd, whether domestic
investors herd more or less than foreign ones, whether offshore (and highly
leveraged) foreign investors herd more or less than onshore foreign investors,
whether larger investors are leaders of the pack are all empirical questions
that have to be addressed in case studies.


                                       27
2.4.5   Can large players manipulate markets?
The basic question addressed by the literature on market manipulation is
whether it is possible for a trader to buy an asset, drive the price up, and
then sell the asset at such inflated price, thereby earning a profit.21 Although
most of this literature does not directly address large players, these studies
highlight potentially important issues to complement our analysis above.
    Conceptually, one can distinguish between three types of market manip-
ulation (see Allen and Gale (1992)):
    1. Action-based manipulation, based on actions that change the actual
or perceived value of the assets. This includes actions by insiders (such as
owners and or managers) as well as insider trading.
    2. Information-based manipulation, based on releasing false information
or spreading false rumors.
    3. Trade-based manipulation, which occurs when a trader attempts to
manipulate a stock simply by buying and then selling, without taking any
publicly observable action to alter the value of the firm or releasing false
information to change the price. This form of manipulation includes attempts
to corner the market for a good or an asset.
    Since investors do not control national policy-making, action-based ma-
nipulation seems unlikely in international currency markets. Information-
based manipulation (‘rumor spreading’) is a somewhat more interesting pos-
sibility. Information-based manipulation models, however, require that the
manipulators have a real or perceived information advantage. The presence
of ‘inside’ information pertaining to the value of corporate securities makes
this assumption highly plausible in stock markets, but is harder to envision in
foreign exchange markets. Still, even in these markets, there could be partic-
ular conditions in which rumors and leaks, say, about the actions of reputable
players, may have strong effects that do not occur in normal times.
    While trade-based manipulation is in principle the most relevant issue
for the purpose of this paper, it is not clear that such manipulation can be
profitable. Buying a stock tends to push its price up, while selling it tends
to push the price down. So, if a large trader who attempts to manipulate a
market through trade ends up ‘buying high’ and ‘selling low’, how can she
  21
   See e.g. Kyle (1984), Vila (1987, 1989), Jarrow (1989), Bagnoli and Lipman (1990),
Benabou and Laroque (1990), Kumar and Seppi (1990).



                                         28
make a profit?22 For a large trader with market power to profit from trade
manipulation it is necessary that other (small) agents trade on the opposite
side of the market. But if the manipulator makes net relative profits, these
agents will lose. Who would take a position that implies net expected losses
or negative risk-adjusted returns?
    Market manipulation appears to be profitable only in particular circum-
stances, when there are agents with an informational disadvantage, or agents
who have to sell/buy for some exogenous reason, perhaps getting benefits
that compensate them from the losses in the trade.23 In the contribution
by Allen and Gorton (1992), for instance, traders with superior information
can inflict losses on a specialist, thanks to exogenous trades by agents who
face binding liquidity constraints. The authors of this study correctly ob-
serve that the welfare implications of this example of trade-manipulation are
ambiguous: why should policy makers care if some investors make money at
the expense of less informed specialists?
    Market corners are another form of trade-based manipulation. For in-
stance, a trader may obtain the control of a sufficiently large share of the
supply of an asset which must be delivered in the futures or forward market.24
This type of manipulation may not be feasible in markets, such as the forex,
where the relevant assets are not in fixed supply. Finally, we should note
that the issue of collusion, alleged to be a factor in recent market dynamics
episodes, has not been systematically studied by the literature on manipula-
tion.
    Based on this overview of the literature, we can only attempt a prelim-
inary assessment of the theoretical case for market manipulation by large
players in the forex market. The key observation is that successful manipu-
lation requires relatively strict informational and behavioral conditions. For
example, an individual fund should be large enough or leveraged enough to be
able to corner the market for a particular currency. Alternatively, if no player
was large enough to affect markets by itself, manipulation would require col-
lusion among investors. In the absence of outright collusion, some HFs would
  22
      Indeed, Jarrow (1992) shows formally that profitable manipulation is impossible in an
efficient market.
   23
      Theoretical examples are given by Kyle (1985), Jarrow (1992), Allen and Gorton
(1992), Allen and Gale (1992) and Kumar and Seppi (1992).

have to lead the trading strategies of a sufficient number of traders — perhaps
by ‘verbal manipulation’, i.e. by ‘talking down’ a currency to encourage other
market players to sell short. While such convergence of strategies is possi-
ble, there is currently no evidence that it occurred in any of the turbulence
episodes of the 1990s.
    Manipulation is hard to prove even when it is clear that a large agent
‘talked down’ a currency or market. Suppose that a major market par-
ticipant, believing that a currency is overvalued, places global macro bets
shorting that currency and publicly announces her views to this effect. Since
there is a broad range of uncertainty on whether a currency is ‘overvalued’,
how can one prove that the large agent’s public statement is a form of market
manipulation? This is quite different from spreading false rumors about a
stock that might occur in the equity market.
    We conclude this section by noting that, while the social impact of ma-
nipulation of individual equities may be ambiguous (as it leads to a redistri-
bution of wealth from less informed specialists to more informed investors),
successful manipulation of currency markets may have serious welfare im-
plications. Price movements away from fundamentals could be associated
with large and undesirable real effects such as employment losses and fiscal
and monetary imbalances. Moreover, wealth would be redistributed from
vulnerable emerging market economies to powerful international investors.


3    Large players and currency markets: Em-
     pirical studies
A key lesson of the 1997-1999 episodes is that no single factor can entirely
explain the volatility in cross-border capital flows, nor the large swings in
asset prices that capital volatility sometimes causes. Corporate, financial,
and policy weaknesses in emerging markets are often exacerbated by adverse
monetary and macroeconomic developments in advanced economies; coun-
tries with different domestic fundamentals have been equally vulnerable to
shifts in market sentiment among international investors. As a result, small
countries that have been the recipients of international capital have also been
increasingly worried by forces beyond their control in international capital

markets.25 No wonder that the role of HFs and other HLIs in global financial
crises has been closely scrutinized and often criticized, especially during the
second half of the last decade.
    The evidence on the portfolio strategies of HFs and HLIs and their impact
in currency turbulence episodes is mixed. IMF (1998) finds some evidence
that HFs, acting as market leaders, helped precipitate the ERM crisis in 1992,
although they appear to have done so in response to economic fundamentals.
Regarding the same episode, Fung and Hsieh (1999b) show that the 25%
net asset value (NAV) gain of the Quantum Fund in September 1992 can
be explained by its positions against the British pound.26 But this episode
hardly proves that a single large player can cause the collapse of an otherwise
sound currency. It is generally agreed that the pound was overvalued in 1992
and that a devaluation was necessary to restore the competitiveness of the UK
economy.27 While specific HFs might have contributed to triggering the fall
of the pound, this episode hardly fits the view that speculators successfully
forced a devaluation not justified by fundamentals.28
    More recently, the authorities of a number of countries — such as Malaysia,
Hong Kong, Australia — have claimed that the HFs’ role was significant in
several recent crises: such funds have been accused of leading market dynam-
ics, intentionally causing herding, and manipulating currencies and other
asset markets. However, some studies, especially IMF (1998) and other
research,29 have expressed skepticism. A typical argument made in these
studies is that HFs were ‘at the rear of the herd of investors rather than in
  25
      See Schadler et al. (1993) and Mussa et al. (1999) for emerging market experience
with volatile capital flows and some possible policy responses.
   26
      The authors infer the directional exposure of the Quantum Fund to several currencies
from data on its weekly or daily net asset values.
   27
      The debate on the 1992-93 crisis of the European Monetary System is assessed in
Eichengreen and Wyplosz (1993), Buiter, Corsetti and Pesenti (1998a,b) and Eichengreen
(2000).
   28
      In other episodes, notably the 1994 bond market turbulence, IMF (1998) shows that
HFs as a group bet on a decline in interest rates, realizing substantial losses when they
instead rose. Fung and Hsieh (1999a) and Fung, Hsieh and Tsatsaronis (2000) show that
the Quantum fund took positions in anticipation of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar
against the yen in February 1994, then losing sharply as the yen appreciated. They also
consider the performance of several large macro HFs in the episodes of market turmoil in
1997-98. We return below on these case studies.
   29
      See Brown, Goetzmann, and Park (1998) and Fung, Hsieh and Tsatsaronis (2000).

the lead’. This view is partly at odds with the conclusions of the more recent
FSF official study (FSF (2000)) of the 1998 turmoil, focusing on a sample
of small- and medium-size economies such as Hong Kong, Australia, New
Zealand, South Africa, Singapore and Malaysia. Whereas the IMF study
concluded that HFs had played only a minor role in 1997, FSF (2000) found
a more significant impact of HFs and prop desks in the episodes of turmoil
in 1998.
     Some preliminary evidence about the performance of HFs for the period
1997-98 is presented in Figures 1-4, where we plot the time series of the
NAVs of four large macro HFs,30 in parallel with the S&P500 index and the
yen/dollar exchange rate.31 Over this period, large macro HFs were reported
to be taking substantial long positions in the U.S. equity market; they may
have also been involved in the ‘yen carry trade’ (borrowing in yen to finance
positions in other currencies or assets), as argued by Fung and Hsieh (1999b).
     For the Quantum fund, Figure 1 suggests a strong correlation between the
NAV and the S&P500 index in the first 11 months of 1997. The comovement
is loose afterwards. Parallel movements between the yen/dollar exchange rate
and the NAVs of the four HFs are apparent in the fall of 1998, in coincidence
with the rally of the yen. Over the same period, the NAVs of these funds
also seem to be affected by the fall in the U.S. equity markets following the
turmoil generated by the Russian crisis and the near-collapse of LTCM.
     A striking feature of the performances of these four funds during the 1997-
98 period is the size of fluctuations. The Jaguar Fund’s NAV rose by 100%
between the beginning of 1997 and August 1998, but lost 25% of its value
between August 1998 and the end of 1998. The Emerging Growth Fund rose
by 40% between January and May 1997, then fell sharply, remaining on a
downward trend until the end of 1998, when its NAV was about 40% below
the level at the beginning of 1997. The Quasar Fund was volatile but on
average rose by about 50% between the beginning of 1997 and August 1998;
after that, it plunged by 50%. By the end of 1998 its NAV was at the same
level as at the beginning of 1997. The Quantum Fund rose by about 30%
  30
     These are the Quantum Fund, the Quasar International Fund, the Emerging Growth
Fund of the Quantum Group and the Jaguar Fund. They were among the largest macro
HFs in the industry over the period considered. Data on their weekly (Wednesday) NAVs
have been collected from the Financial Times.
  31
     Similar charts appear in Fung, Hsieh and Tsatsaronis (2000), who consider the per-
formance of the HFs only up to 1997.


                                          32
between the beginning of 1997 and November 1997, but then it was mostly
on a downward trend, approaching, at the end of the sample, a level close to
the one at the beginning of 1998. Overall, the performance of three of these
four funds in the 1997-98 period was far from exceptional: two funds had on
average zero returns over the period, while one lost almost 40% of its value.
The fourth fund gained over 40% over the same period.
    In what follows we provide a reassessment of the foreign exchange strate-
gies of large players in light of our theoretical analysis. A few selected case
studies on turbulence episodes in emerging markets are preceded by an analy-
sis of the evidence on the aggregate foreign currency positions of large market
participants in advanced economies.

3.1       The Treasury Foreign Currency reports of major
          market participants
We have argued before that a number of elements may contribute to a finan-
cial institution’s market power — asset size and leverage ability, visibility
and reputation for superior information. In this section we investigate the
links among these elements, focusing on the currency market. Do large play-
ers affect the price of foreign currency? Can they have access to better
information than average market participants? Can they count on superior
forecasts of future exchange rate developments? Do they consistently take
long (short) positions in currencies whose value tends to appreciate (depre-
ciate) over time? To address these questions, at least on a preliminary basis,
we analyze the evidence on the foreign currency positions of the largest par-
ticipants in the U.S. forex market.
    Major foreign exchange market participants are required by law to file
weekly and monthly reports on their holdings of foreign currency.32 An
institution qualifies as a ‘major’ participant if, on the last business day of
either March, June, September or December during the previous year, it
had more than $50 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on its
books. Contracts include sales and purchases in the spot, forward, futures
and options markets. Actual currency holdings (deposits) and any other
foreign-currency denominated securities are not included in the reports. U.S.-
based institutions file a consolidated report for their domestic and foreign
 32
      31 United States Code 5315; 31 Code of Federal Regulation 128, Subpart C.


                                           33
subsidiaries, branches and agencies. Subsidiaries of foreign entities operating
in the U.S. file only for themselves, not for their foreign parents. Market
participants with foreign currency holdings of less than $50 billion but greater
than $1 billion need only file a quarterly report.
    In their weekly Treasury Foreign Currency (TFC) reports, major partic-
ipants indicate the amounts of foreign currency outstanding at the close of
business each Wednesday.33 The currencies included in the reports are the
Canadian dollar, German mark, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, pound sterling
and, since 1999, the euro. Also since 1999, reporting institutions approximate
‘all other’ currency positions under the aggregate entry ‘U.S. dollar’. Data
are organized into four categories (foreign exchange spot, forward, and fu-
tures purchased; foreign exchange spot, forward, and futures sold; net options
position delta equivalent value long or (short); net reported dealing position
long or (short)). The first two categories represent the outstanding amounts
of foreign exchange which the reporter has contracted to receive or deliver.
Contracts are reported on a gross basis, and when the contracts provide for
the exchange of one currency for another, both the purchase and the sale
are reported. Options (third category) are reported if the aggregate notional
principal amount of contracts purchased and sold exceeds $500 million equiv-
alent. Options are reported in terms of net ‘delta equivalent’, an estimate of
the relationship between an option’s value and an equivalent currency hedge,
that is, the amount of currency with the same gain or loss characteristics as
the option for small movements in the exchange rate.34 The fourth category
is defined as the actively managed net dealing position monitored and used
by each reporter for internal risk management purposes. Estimates of net
dealing position typically come from internally generated reports.
    Based on the TFC reports, since 1994 the Treasury Bulletin publishes
information on the weekly, monthly and quarterly foreign currency position
taken by all large players collectively. No information is released on single
participants’ positions, and data on their net dealing positions are unavail-
able even at the aggregate level. A previous study (Wei and Kim (1997)) has
used this dataset, covering the sample period 1994-1996. Our paper covers
  33
     The reports are filed no later than 12pm on Friday following the Wednesday to which
the report applies.
  34
     Technically, the ‘delta equivalent’ value represents the product of the first partial
derivative of an option valuation formula with respect to the price or rate of the underlying
contract, multiplied by the notional principal of the contract.


                                             34
the entire sample available at the time of writing, January 1994 - June 2000.
In 1996 there were 36 reporters who qualified as major participants; of them,
29 were commercial banks and the remaining 7 other forms of financial in-
stitutions including HFs. By 2000 the number of reporters was down to 25,
of which 18 were banking institutions.
    Table 1 provides summary statistics on major participants’ weekly posi-
tions, all expressed in million U.S. dollars.35 Gross sales and purchases of
foreign currency are rather large (for instance, sales of Japanese yen average
$1459 billion, and purchases of marks average $1252 billion) but net posi-
tions are relatively small across currencies (net positions in yen are about
$20 billion in absolute value, and net positions in marks are on average $7.5
billion). The limited size of net relative to gross positions is partly due to
large market participants’ role as intermediaries: reported foreign currency
transactions typically involve two offsetting operations, such as a purchase
of foreign currency from the market on behalf of a client and the sale of
foreign currency to the client itself. But limited net positions also indicate
unwillingness by major participants to maintain large speculative positions
at high (weekly) frequency. It is worth noting, however, that large players’
net positions have increased over time, on average, across all currencies in
the sample except the Canadian dollar.
    Figures 5-11 plot the weekly time series of aggregate net foreign currency
positions, defined as purchases minus sales of foreign exchange spot, forward
and futures, plus net options positions, all expressed in million of local cur-
rency (except for the contracts in yen, expressed in billion). The figures also
plot the relevant exchange rates, expressed as U.S. dollars per unit of local
currency. Visual inspection of these figures leaves the impression that the
two series tend to move in parallel: when a currency strengthens against the
dollar, large players systematically increase their purchases and reduce their
sales of that currency, unwinding their net positions in dollars.
    For example, in Figure 7, the weakening of the yen relative to the U.S.
dollar from the fall of 1997 through the summer of 1998 is strongly correlated
with increasing net short positions on the yen, rising from about JPY 2 tril-
lion (about $16 billion at the prevailing exchange rate) to over JPY 8 trillion
  35
    We consider data on positions in German marks only until the end of 1998. Since 1999
positions in marks are reported only if the institution manages the exchange rate risk of
the euro and the legacy currencies separately, otherwise all legacy currency amounts are
reported as euro-denominated contracts.


                                           35
(about $56 billion). The rally of the yen between August and October 1998
is also associated with a sharp and rapid unwinding of major participants’
short positions. In the case of the German mark (Figure 9), the cycle of ap-
preciation against the U.S. dollar in the first half of 1995 and depreciation in
the second half of that year appears to be correlated with an initial build-up
of long positions in marks and their subsequent reversal. Similar episodes
are noticeable for the pound, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Swiss
franc. There are, however, exceptions: notably, the weakening of the euro in
1999 (Figure 10) seems to be associated with larger short positions on this
currency until the summer of 1999 but not afterwards.
    Obviously, the direction of causality is not clear. On the one hand, large
players may affect the price of the currency simply because of the size of their
net positions. On the other hand, large players observe current exchange
rates and take into account the perceived strength or weakness of the cur-
rency in determining their net position at the close of business, substantially
extrapolating some persistence in the behavior of the exchange rate over the
very short term. Superior information by large players may also explain why
current positions appear at times to be associated with contemporaneous and
future exchange rate levels.
    To provide formal statistical evidence on these correlations, we regress
the current (Wednesday) exchange rate on the foreign currency position de-
nominated in local currency.36 For sensitivity analysis we exclude from the
sample outliers37 and consider two sub-samples, 1994-96 (as in the Wei and
Kim (1997) study) and 1997-2000. The first column of Table 2 reports the
results. In general, the regressions provide evidence in support of a strong
positive link between exchange rates and simultaneous net positions. The
results are particularly striking in the case of the pound, the Canadian dol-
lar, the yen, the Swiss franc and the euro. The link is weaker in the case
of the German mark, as the coefficient is statistically significant only at the
10 percent level; it is significant at the 5% level if we regress the exchange
rate on net positions expressed in U.S. dollars. Breaking the sample into two
periods does not significantly alter the results: in general the t-statistics fall
in the most recent sub-sample, with the notable exception of the yen.
  36
      For sensitivity analysis we also regress the exchange rate on currency positions con-
verted into U.S. dollars. The results are substantially similar.
   37
      The outliers are identified visually as: 5/19/1999 (Canadian dollar), 9/15/1999 (Swiss
franc), and 1/6/1999 (euro). Outliers play little role in our results.


                                            36
    The relation between the exchange rate and net position is also significant
when we introduce lagged values of the latter variable. In the second column
of Table 2 we report results based on regressing the Wednesday exchange
rate on current and one-week lagged net positions. The coefficients of both
regressors are significantly positive in the cases of the pound, the Canadian
dollar, and the yen. In other words, past net positions help predict cur-
rent exchange rates:38 large players tend to take long positions in currencies
which are and remain strong for a while — a result reflecting some degree of
persistence in exchange rates.39
    Are net positions associated with changes (rather than levels) of exchange
rates over time? If a significant relation were found between net positions
and movements of the exchange rate, two interpretations would be possible.
On the one hand, if large players had superior information, they should be
able to anticipate currency movements, selling short before depreciation. On
the other hand, large players could affect the movement of the exchange rate
simply because of the size of their trading.
    Table 3 reports the results of regressing the ex-post exchange rate depre-
ciation rate on lagged net positions. As above, for sensitivity analysis we
report estimates for the two sub-samples and excluding outliers. We con-
sider different time horizons for the rate of depreciation: one day (Thursday
on Wednesday), two days, three days (Monday on Wednesday), five days
(Wednesday on Wednesday), two weeks, four weeks, twelve weeks. The re-
sults are, to say the least, mixed.
    There is some indication that large players take positions against curren-
cies that tend to depreciate. At very short horizons (from one to three days)
there is at least one statistically significant, positive coefficient for the mark
and the yen (3 days). In the case of the pound the coefficient is significant
only at the 10% level and only in the 1997-2000 subsample. There is a statis-
tically significant relation, but with the wrong sign, in the case of the Swiss
franc. In many cases, the coefficients are not significant, and some have the
wrong sign. The picture does not change if we lengthen the horizon of the
  38
     Separate regressions, not reported here, show that the correlation between current
positions and future levels of the exchange rate holds significantly for horizons up to two
months for most currencies.
  39
     Also, this result is not inconsistent with an interpretation according to which large
players’ positions today influence other market participants’ behavior, leading them to
take similar net positions over time (a form of momentum trading).

depreciation.40 Comparing our results with previous studies, the evidence
that exchange rates changes are correlated with the net positions of large
players is only marginally stronger.41
    To sum up, while high-frequency noise in exchange rate changes may ex-
plain the weak correlation between net positions and short-term changes in
exchange rates, the level regressions point to persistent low-frequency move-
ments (‘long cycles’ of exchange rates) associated with aggregate net posi-
tions. Overall, the evidence suggests that the net positions of large players
are significantly correlated with exchange rates; this can be attributed to
either size or informational advantages.

3.2     The pressures on the Thai baht in the spring-summer
        of 1997
We now turn to case studies of currency crises in which HFs and other large
traders were alleged to have played a key role. The first episode we consider
is the attack on the Thai baht, whose fall in the summer of 1997 started the
Asian currency and financial crisis.42
    An assessment of Thai economic fundamentals suggests that the currency
was overvalued. The country had run large current account deficits for almost
a decade, and the currency had appreciated in real terms. External imbal-
ances had been financed through short-term unhedged liabilities, making the
country vulnerable to a liquidity run. Also, there were severe weaknesses in
the financial system that eventually led to a banking crisis. On the other
hand, high growth, high investment and savings rates and a prudent fiscal
  40
      When twelve weeks are considered, there is a strongly significant relation for the
pound, the Canadian dollar, the Swiss franc, the euro and the yen. The problem is
that, with the only exception of the Canadian dollar, the sign is always negative: i.e. large
players systematically take long positions in currencies that, on average, tend to depreciate
over the next quarter. One could interpret this result as implying some mean reversion in
exchange rate returns.
   41
      Wei and Kim (1997) do not find any significant positive association between large par-
ticipants’ position in a foreign currency and its subsequent appreciation. A non-parametric
approach finds some weak support for a positive association, but not on a systematic basis.
Recall that this study is limited to the 1994-96 period, while we extend the sample up to
the year 2000.
   42

policy suggest that the country was not seriously mismanaged.
    The analytical models discussed in the first part of this paper suggest
that a country with weak fundamentals may be vulnerable to the market
dynamics either generated or fed by short positions taken by large players.
Smaller players react to the actions taken by the large player by becoming
more aggressive in their speculative behavior. One issue is thus whether large
HFs were ‘leaders of the pack’ in this particular currency crisis episode. On
this issue, the IMF (1998) study is skeptical, arguing that the HFs were at
the rear rather than at the head of the pack.43
    This conclusion appears somewhat at odds with the very information
available in the IMF study, let alone other sources of evidence. For instance,
IMF (1998) shows that some large HFs had already taken significant short
positions against the Thai baht in the spring of 1997, presumably based
on a negative economic assessment of Thai fundamentals (stressing the size
and persistence of the current account deficit and the overvaluation of the
exchange rate). The estimated net short position of the HFs in Thailand was
about $7 billion.44 Fung, Hsieh and Tsatsaronis (2000) estimate that twelve
HFs had about $5 billion in short positions against the Thai baht at the end
of June 1997.45
    The evidence on HFs taking short positions before the eruption of the cri-
sis is indirectly confirmed by the econometric results presented in Table 4.A.
Using weekly data, we regress the NAV of four large macro HFs46 against
the S&P500, the yen/dollar exchange rate and the value of the Thai baht
in the period February 1997 through July 1997 — when the baht was under
  43
      See also Eichengreen and Mathieson (1999).
  44
      This is an estimate of direct forward transactions with the Bank of Thailand. Short
positions may have been larger as “hedge funds may also have sold baht forward through
offshore intermediaries, onshore foreign banks, and onshore domestic banks, which then
off-loaded their positions (commitments to purchase) to the central bank. Hence, there
is no way of accurately estimating their total transactions.” (Eichengreen and Mathieson
(1999)).
   45
      Estimated short positions are lower after July 1997 as such funds took profits on their
shorts and partially closed these positions. Thus, while HFs may have played a role in
triggering the initial collapse of the baht, they played a lesser role in the continued fall of
the currency throughout the summer and fall of 1997. For example, according to Hsieh
and Fung (1999) there is not evidence that the Quantum fund had shorted the baht during
September 1997 when this currency fell sharply.
   46
      These are the same considered in Figures 1-4 and Section 3.1.



                                              39
pressure.47 As argued before, the first two regressors control for the hypoth-
esis that these funds had significant investments in the U.S. equity markets
and may have shorted the Japanese yen to fund positions in other markets
(Fung and Hsieh (1999b)). The results show significant effects of the Thai
baht on the NAV of the four funds: the NAVs increase when the baht weak-
ens. The S&P index and the yen/dollar rater also enter significantly in these
regressions with the expected sign.48
    The overall short positions by large traders ($7 billion in the estimate
by IMF (1998)) represent only a quarter of the Bank of Thailand’s $28 bil-
lion forward book at the end of July 1997. This suggests that many other
investors — besides HFs — had built short positions in baht before the cur-
rency’s fall in July. According to the IMF study, while “HFs apparently sold
some long-dated forward contracts on the baht in February 1997, the bulk of
their forward sales to the Bank of Thailand seems to have occurred in May”
when significant speculative pressure on the currency started to build up and
Thailand introduced some capital controls to limit the speculation against
its currency.49
    On balance, the conclusion in the IMF study that HFs were at the rear
of the pack is not strongly supported by the data. While lack of information
prevents a full assessment of the sequence of events and movements by players
of different sizes, a plausible interpretation is that large macro HFs detected
rather early the fundamental weaknesses of the baht and the likelihood of a
devaluation. Since the build-up of short positions started in February and
continued through May, one could argue that HFs actually moved first, and
were followed by a wide range of domestic and international investors.
    On the basis of our analysis in Section 2.4.2, the argument that the HFs
were ‘small’ in the baht market (short positions for $7 billion against $25
billion at the central bank) needs to be qualified. If the HFs’ short positions
  47
      For the Jaguar Fund the sample period is the full 1997-98 period as we found significant
effects of all regressors throughout the sample.
   48
      The S&P index is not included in the Emerging Growth Fund as this fund invests
mostly in emerging markets. Indeed, the S&P regressor is not significant when included
in the regressions.
   49
      In one week in May, the central bank intervened by selling about $15 billion. Since
this intervention was in the forward market, this information did not become public until
August 1997. Smaller speculative attacks had occurred in January, February and March
(see Ito (1999)).



                                             40
had been built by the time of the May attack (after the May 15 capital
controls and the spikes in offshore rates it became much more expensive to
short the currency), they would have accounted for a large fraction of the
forward book of the central bank by the end of May. While the eventual
fall of the baht was certainly triggered by fundamental weaknesses in the
economy, the evidence is not inconsistent with the view that HFs moved
first and their presence made other investors more aggressive in their trading
strategies.

3.3    The ‘double play’ hypothesis in Hong Kong
In 1998, the currency and other asset markets in Hong Kong felt significant
speculative pressures as the Asian crisis worsened. Local authorities argued
that large macro HFs were attempting to influence Hong Kong’s forex and
equity markets.50 Allegedly, large traders were implementing a ‘double play’:
shorting the equity market, then shorting the currency, so as to lead monetary
authorities either to abandon the fixed exchange rate or to increase interest
rates sharply, or both, and profit from falling stock prices.
    In the view of the Hong Kong authorities, the ‘double play’ proceeded as
follows. First, HFs shorted the Hong Kong (spot) stock market as well as
the Hang Seng Index futures. HFs allegedly ‘pre-funded’ their Hong Kong
dollar needs via swaps with multilateral financial institutions that had heavily
borrowed in 1997 and 1998. Next, by using forward purchases of U.S. dollars
and spot sales of Hong Kong dollars, they tried to induce a devaluation.
Apparently, the size of the short positions of these HFs in the forex and
stock markets were very large.
    Suppose that, to defend the currency board arrangement, the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA) had intervened in the foreign exchange market
only, drying up market liquidity and causing a correspondingly large increase
in interest rates. The monetary tightening would have caused a sharp drop
in equity prices, to the benefit of the HFs and other investors who had taken
short positions in the stock market.
    Suppose instead that, to avoid this stock market collapse, the HKMA had
kept interest rates low, while allowing the exchange rate to devalue. Again,
 50

Bank of Australia (1999) and Tsang (1998).



                                      41
the HFs would have reaped large gains, this time through their positions in
the currency markets. In either scenario, speculators would have gained from
their positions in the stock market or in the forex market, or both.51
     The HKMA, however, chose a different and unconventional option, con-
sisting of monetary tightening to prevent devaluation, and, in August 1998,
sizeable interventions in the stock markets to support stock prices.52 In the
view of the Hong Kong authorities, this radical action was necessary to in-
flict losses on speculators and give them sufficient cause to be wary of future
attempts to corner the market. In the words of Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang the speculative attack “was a contrived game with clearly destructive
goals in mind [to] drive up interest rates, drive down share prices, make the
local population panic and exert enough pressure on the linked exchange rate
until it breaks” (Tsang (1998)).
     The FSF (2000) study supports the double play hypothesis. Large macro
HFs appear to have detected fundamental weaknesses early and started to
build large short positions against the currency. According to available esti-
mates, HLIs’ short positions in the HK$ market were close to U.S.$ 10 billion
(6 % of GDP), but some observers believe that the correct figure was much
higher. Several large macro HFs that had shorted the currency also took
very large short positions in the equity markets, and these positions were
correlated over time.53 When the news spread that large HFs were building
   51
      Chakavorti and Lall (2000) develop an analytical model of simultaneous speculative
attack on currency and equity markets that is designed to explain the ‘double play’ hy-
pothesis for Hong Kong. They identify the conditions under which a simultaneous shorting
of equity and currency/money markets is a potentially profitable strategy. The model sug-
gest that a simultaneous shorting of the two markets could result from an increase in the
probability that a devaluation may occur and poor economic fundamentals. They also
explicitly model the effects of central bank intervention in the stock market (as done in
Hong Kong).
   52
      In the two weeks between August 14 and 28, 1998, the HKMA purchased approxi-
mately US$15 billion of stocks and futures. This represented about 7% of the Hong Kong
market capitalization and about 30% of the free float in the market.
   53
      “Among those taking short positions in the equity market were four large HFs, whose
futures and options positions were equivalent to around 40 percent of all outstanding
equity futures contracts as of early august prior to the HKMA intervention. Position data
suggest a correlation, albeit far from perfect, in the timing of the establishment of the
short positions. Two HFs substantially increased their positions during the period of the
HKMA intervention. At end August, four hedge funds accounted for 50,500 contracts or
49% of the total open interest/net delta position; one fund accounted for one third. The


                                           42
short positions, other investors followed.
    Indirect evidence on the positions of HFs in the Hong Kong currency
and equity markets can be provided by regressing the NAV of the four large
macro HFs in our sample against the S&P500, the yen/dollar rate, the Hang
Seng equity index and a short-term interest rate measure in Hong Kong (the
3-month HIBOR) for the period May to September 1998. A negative relation
between NAV and the equity index is consistent with short positions of the
fund in the Hong Kong equity market. Also, since Hong Kong kept the
exchange rate fixed throughout the sample period, profitable short positions
in the currency markets would show up as a positive coefficient on the short
term interest rate: interest rate hikes lead to an increase in the forward
exchange rate, raising the NAV of a portfolio including short positions in the
currency. Results are presented in Table 4.B and C, where we find strong
and significant effects of the expected sign (negative on the Hang Seng index
and positive on the HIBOR) for one of the funds, and a significant effect of
the HIBOR for another fund.54
    According to the local authorities (HKMA (1999) and Tsang (1998)), un-
substantiated rumors and false information about the health of the financial
sector and the possibility of a devaluation were being spread in the local
press and in financial market — apparently to push down the stock market,
spike interest rates and put pressure on the currency. The FSF (2000) study
mentions circumstantial evidence of aggressive trading behavior in the forex
market: “Aggressive trading practices by HLIs reportedly included concen-
trated selling intended to move market prices, large sales in illiquid offshore
trading hours, and ‘spoofing’ of the electronic brokering services to give the
impression that the exchange rate had moved beyond the HKMA’s inter-
vention level. There were frequent market rumors, often in offshore Friday
trading, that a devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar or Chinese renminbi
would occur over the weekend”.55
    But the empirical findings do not provide, per se, evidence of ‘market
manipulation’. Macroeconomic conditions in Hong Kong and East Asia in
group’s meetings suggested that some large HLIs had large short positions in both the
equity and currency markets.” (FSF (2000), page 131).
  54
     The coefficients of the Hang Seng index on two other funds are significant but with
the wrong sign. It is possible that losses inflicted on short equity positions by the Hong
Kong intervention may account for this result.

the summer of 1998 (a sharp recession in Hong Kong, worsening financial
and economic crisis in the entire East Asian region, with a falling yen and
a threat of currency devaluation in China) were causing concerns among
investors about the Hong Kong’s stock market, while raising doubts about
the survival of the Hong Kong currency peg, in spite of the commitment by
the authorities to maintain the currency board. Shorting both the Hong Kong
stock market and its currency at that time could be interpreted as a rational
strategy for all investors, domestic and foreign, highly leveraged and not,
behaving according to normal market rules and conventions. In other words,
the hypothesis of rational investors taking short positions in two markets
(based on an assessment of economic fundamentals) and the hypothesis of a
double play (suggesting market manipulation) are observationally equivalent.

3.4     The Malaysian ringgit
The role played by macro HFs in the fall of the Malaysian ringgit remains
controversial. Local authorities have forcefully argued that their presence
made a significant difference. However, several studies (IMF (1998) and
Brown, Goetzmann, and Park (1998)) suggest that their role was minor.
    As in the case of many other currencies in the region, the pressure on the
ringgit was undoubtedly driven by fundamental weaknesses in the economy,
namely a large current account deficit and a structurally weak financial sys-
tem, as well as financial and trade contagion from the fall of other ASEAN
currencies. Nonetheless, there is an issue as to whether HFs were ‘leaders of
the pack’ in the circumstances that triggered the fall of the ringgit and the
continued pressures on the currency throughout 1997 and 1998.
    How large were HFs’ short positions against the ringgit? The afore-
mentioned IMF study suggests that their positions were relatively small at
the time of the devaluation of the baht — July 1997 — when pressures on
the Malaysian currency started to rise. Fung, Hsieh and Tsatsaronis (2000)
reach similar conclusions, estimating that the combined short positions in
the ringgit market by 12 HFs amounted to less than $1 billion in June and
July 1997.56
  56
   In related study Fung and Hsieh (1999) infer the directional exposure of the Quantum
Fund to several currencies from data on its weekly or daily NAVs. Analysis of Quantum’s
NAV for the third quarter of 1997 suggest that this fund was highly correlated with the
S&P index but not with the values of the Malaysian ringitt. There is no evidence that


                                          44
    A study by Brown, Goetzmann, and Park (1998) reaches analogous con-
clusions. Using returns data, these authors derive estimates of the positions
in the Malaysian ringgit over time by the largest ten currency funds. They
find that positions in the ringgit did fluctuate dramatically in the second half
of the nineties, but were not correlated with movements in the exchange rate.
More generally, they identify periods when the HFs had very large exposures
to Asian currencies, both positive and negative, but find no relation between
these positions and current, past, or future movements in exchange rates.
    Some aspects of this study, however, are problematic. Specifically, these
authors did not have access to data on net positions, but inferred them from
observed returns, so serious measurement errors are possible. For example,
some of their estimates imply that the gross foreign currency positions on
the ringgit were at times close to 200% of Malaysian GDP. For instance, in
February 1996 the estimated short position by HFs was greater than $200
billion. At the end of June 1997, when the pressure on the currency started
to mount, the estimated HFs short positions reached a new peak of $100
billion. Now, either these estimates are subject to significant measurement
error or, if correct, their size makes it difficult to argue that HFs’ portfolios
had no impact on the value of the Malaysian currency. Statistical tests
suggest that, for two of the four funds in our sample, NAVs were significantly
correlated with movements of the ringgit after controlling for the S&P and
the yen/dollar rate.57
    Ultimately, even accounting for the apparent gross mismeasurement, the
study leaves open the possibility that large traders built sizable positions at
the start of the speculative pressure against the ringgit (late June and early
July 1997). This is consistent with the view that HFs took large positions
before other domestic and foreign investors started to short the currency. In
this regard — and based mostly on circumstantial evidence — the FSF (2000)
study came to the conclusion that “the ringgit came under heavy selling
pressure around May 1997 during the pressures on the Thai baht. Leveraged
institutions reportedly had substantial short positions at this time. Pressures
Quantum had shorted the ringitt during September 1997 when the currency fell sharply.
The authors conclude that “the charges by Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Moham-
mad, that Quantum forced the devaluation of the Asian currencies, are not substantiated
by the evidence”.

3.5       The pressures on the Australian dollar in the sum-
          mer of 1998
The view that HFs played a significant role in the pressures on the Australian
dollar in the summer of 1998 has been presented in two papers (Reserve Bank
of Australia (1999) and Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Reserve Bank
of Australia (1999)). The Australian view is nuanced. The Australian au-
thorities accept that a moderate depreciation of the Australian dollar might
have been justified by fundamentals in June and August of 1998. In June,
the Australian currency was negatively affected by a weakening Japanese yen
and by concerns about the spread and deepening of the Asian crisis. In Au-
gust, the pressure on the Australian currency was triggered by the Russian
collapse and expectations of falling commodity prices in a global slowdown.
    While acknowledging the rationale for a depreciation in light of these
fundamental weaknesses, the Australian view was that large macro HFs ma-
nipulated foreign currency markets to force a depreciation well in excess
of what was justified by fundamentals. The Australian authorities argued
that, even though the Australian dollar exchange rate market was very liq-
uid and had one of the highest turnover rates among OECD countries, HFs
were nonetheless trying to manipulate it in different ways. First, HFs were
supposedly able to borrow large amounts of Australian dollar funds from
Australian banks in order to build speculative positions in the foreign ex-
change market. Second, a few large HFs were allegedly signalling their short
positions in the Australian dollar market, effectively becoming leaders for a
wide set of funds and financial institutions. As a result, by taking very large
short positions against the Australian dollar while inducing other investors to
follow a similar strategy, the HFs were effectively able to corner the market.
    Reportedly, the overall short positions against the Australian dollar were
sizable in the summer of 1998. Only a very aggressive intervention by the
Reserve Bank of Australia in June and August (and eventually the unraveling
of the yen carry trade) could stop what looked like a large speculative attempt
to cause an unwarranted collapse of the currency.
    An interesting feature of the Australian case is that the speculative attack
 58

                                      46
hit a flexible, rather than a fixed, exchange rate regime. FSF (2000) provides
a systematic study of the Australian episode, suggesting that HLIs built
up speculative short positions against the Australian dollar from late 1997
onward. The speculative activity intensified in April and May 1998: by the
end of May the currency had fallen 24% below its peak in late 1996. In June
1998, the pressures on the currency increased, with short positions by HFs
and other HLIs estimated at roughly $10 billion, about 2% of Australian
GDP.
    The study found evidence of aggressive trading, shrinkage of liquidity,
spread of rumors, contrarians moving to the sidelines, and herding along the
HLI positions. In particular, “having already accumulated large short posi-
tions, a few HLIs — primarily large macro HFs — according to some market
participants took actions in late May and early June to attempt to push the
exchange rate lower. These actions reportedly included spreading rumors
about an upcoming attack in the currency to deter buyers, and aggressive
trading. A key feature of this latter was to concentrate large amounts of
sales into periods of thin trading. These actions were reported by market
participants to be designed in part to cause those who might have taken con-
trarian positions to withdraw from the market. One consequence was that
exporters, who had been consistent buyers of Australian dollars at higher
levels, not only stood aside and stopped buying at this time but some even
began selling as the currency looked to fall to record lows”.59

3.6       Financial and currency turmoil in South Africa in
          1998
The case study of South Africa in 1998 is interesting for a number of rea-
sons. First, the country had a semi-flexible exchange rate regime, yet the
authorities heavily intervened in the forward market to defend the currency
when strong speculative pressures emerged in the spring of 1998. Second, as
in Hong Kong, investors may have attempted a ‘double play’. But in this
case the ‘double play’ was staged in the bond and forex markets, rather than
in the equity and forex markets. Third, according to FSF (2000), the main
role in financial market was played by proprietary desks of large international
financial firms, rather than large macro HFs.
 59
      FSF (2000), p.128.


                                      47
    As in previous episodes, macro policy was generally sound, but the econ-
omy was hit by a number of shocks at the time of the turmoil. In the
spring of 1998, the economy was suffering from a fall in the price of gold
and other export commodities, political uncertainty, and a confidence dete-
rioration leading to a downgrade of GDP growth forecasts. Until April 1998,
many non-resident investors — including HLIs — had built long positions
in South African assets (especially government bonds). A major reversal
of capital flows occurred in May/June 1998, with outflows by non-residents
estimated at about 24 billion rand.
    These speculative pressures led — between April and August — to a 25%
fall of the rand, a 40% plunge of the equity market, and sharp increases in
the yields on medium term bonds from 12.9% to 21.6%. The central bank
initially responded to the pressure on the currency by aggressively intervening
in the forward market (selling about $8 billion of reserves forward in May
and June). Total short foreign exchange positions were estimated to be
about U.S. $ 8-9 billion (approximately 7% of GDP), thus equivalent to total
forward interventions. At the same time, investors could easily build short
fixed-income positions in the government bond market by borrowing in the
large and liquid repo market. As reported in FSF (2000), some suggested
that a double play took the form of aggressive sales of the currency to spike
short-term interest rates and profit from short positions in the bond market.
    The fall in the rand accelerated in June after the Reserve Bank stopped
intervening. The publication of the forward book showed that the Reserve
Bank was then vulnerable to large losses from previous forward intervention.
Attempts to influence the course of market prices to HLIs’ own advantage
were once again reported to have taken place: “at times trading was reported
as very aggressive, including the sale of large parcels to the market at any
price and greater than normal trading in periods of illiquidity, sometimes
apparently with sustained price impact”.60

3.7       The conclusions of the FSF study on market dy-
          namics in turmoil episodes
In our analysis above we have often built upon the FSF (2000) study, an
extensive study whose overall results are consistent with the key implications
 60
      FSF (2000), p.141.


                                      48
of our theoretical analysis. The ambivalent conclusions of this study provide
an excellent summary of the complex and multi-faceted debate on the role
of HLIs in currency crises:

   • “Under normal market conditions, HLIs do not threaten the stability of
     medium-sized markets. Together with other market participants, HLIs
     can play an important role translating views about the fundamentals
     into prices and face the same incentives as other market participants
     to avoid outsized positions. Because of their ability and willingness to
     take leveraged positions, HLIs can be an important source of market
     liquidity and can, over time, contribute positively to market develop-
     ment.”

   • “From time to time, HLIs may establish large and concentrated po-
     sitions in small and medium-sized markets. When this is the case,
     HLIs have the potential to materially influence market dynamics. The
     size and duration of the effects can be amplified through herding or
     through other market participants moving to the sidelines and depend
     critically on the strength of the fundamentals and the behavior of ‘on-
     going’ transactors in the domestic currency.”

   • “The judgment as to whether HLI positions are destabilizing has to
     be made on a case-by-case basis. Several members of the study group
     believe that large HLI positions exacerbated the situations in several
     of the case-study economies in 1998, contributing to unstable market
     dynamics and significant spillovers. These members of the group are of
     the view that HLI positions and tactics can at times represent a signif-
     icant independent source of pressure. Some other group members do
     not think that there is sufficient evidence to advance such judgements
     on the basis of the 1998 experience, given the uncertainty prevailing
     in the markets at that time. They believe that the impact of HLIs on
     markets is likely to be very short-lived and that, provided fundamen-
     tals are strong, HLI positions and strategies are unlikely to present a
     major independent driving force in market dynamics.”

   • “The group is concerned about the possible impact on market dynam-
     ics of some of the aggressive practices cited in the case-study economies
     during 1998; it is not, however, able to reach a conclusion on the scale

                                     49
       of these practices, whether manipulation was involved and their impact
       on market integrity. Some group members believe that the threshold
       for assessing manipulation can be set too high and that some of the
       aggressive practices raise important issues for market integrity. They
       are of the view that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that at-
       tempted manipulation can and does occur in foreign exchange markets
       and should be a serious source of concern for policy makers”.61
    As a conclusion to the assessment of the 1990s crisis episodes, it is worth
recalling that foreign exchange market pressures rapidly diminished in the
late summer and early fall of 1998, when large HFs and other HLIs reduced
their activity following a number of events: the Russian devaluation and
default; the collapse of LTCM and the ensuing liquidity and credit squeeze
in the financial markets of advanced economies; the sharp appreciation of
the yen in September and October of 1998, that brought about losses to
those HLIs that had heavily shorted the yen and played the aforementioned
‘carry trade’. Also, ‘unorthodox’ policy actions such as the massive Hong
Kong intervention in its equity market, capital controls in Malaysia, and
intervention against bond-shorters in South Africa contributed to a squeeze
on the speculative short positions of HLIs.62


4      Conclusion
This paper has presented a theoretical and empirical analysis of the role
of large players in currency crises. Our study contributes to an analytical
literature that, while still in its infancy, is making significant progress in
understanding how the existence of large players may affect foreign exchange
market dynamics. On the empirical side, results are constrained by the fact
that detailed data on major market participants’ positions and strategies are
limited. However, the evidence presented in our paper and in a number of
recent studies sheds some light on the role played by large players in recent
episodes of currency turmoil.
    In sum, our analysis does not contradict the conventional wisdom that
large players: are better informed or perceived to be better informed; are
  61

able to build sizable short positions via leverage; tend to move first based on
an assessment of fundamental weaknesses; contribute to currency pressures
in the presence of weak or uncertain fundamentals; are closely monitored
by smaller investors prone to herd on their observed or guessed positions,
even when the small traders would act as contrarians based on the private
information available to them; may recur to aggressive trading practices.
Undoubtedly, future theoretical and empirical research will shed further light
on many of the aspects here discussed.
    We conclude with three observations. First, the role of large players in
financial markets may have recently changed. Some large macro hedge funds
and other HLIs have closed down or retrenched their operations.63 Perhaps
in part as a consequence of this retrenchment, there is now some concern that
liquidity in the forex market may have been reduced and greater asset price
volatility may have emerged. But it is still too early to assess whether such
liquidity shrinkage has occurred and what are its causes and consequences.
    Second, the disappearance of several large macro HFs after 1998 may in
part be the result of the ongoing phase-out of fixed exchange rate regimes;
one after another most non-institutionalized exchange rate pegs have been
abandoned (Mexico, Asia, Russia, Brazil). Large macro bets against a peg
are easier to make, since large short positions can be built at low cost when
the monetary authority provides foreign currency at a fixed price. With
flexible rates, instead, there is always two-sided currency risk, and the costs of
building short positions depend on whether, and to what extent, other agents
(other than the central bank) are willing to take the opposite side of these
transactions. Attempts to build speculative positions lead to continuous time
movements in the exchange rate, reducing the incentive to speculate, as well
as the scope for sharp (thus profitable) adjustment. Indeed, allegedly, large
macro directional bets on the flexible exchange rates of the G3 economies led
to losses in 1999 and 2000, contributing to the eventual demise of some large
macro HFs.
    Third, the policy implications of the role of large players in market dy-
namics are complex and multifaceted. The official sector started to address
  63
    LTCM was closed down following its near collapse in 1998; the Tiger Group funds
were closed down in 2000 following a period of poor investment returns; the operations of
the Quantum Group funds have been scaled down; the Moore Capital Group decided to
return $ 2 billlion of capital to its investors; several forex prop desks of large financial firm
have been either closed or scaled down in their operations.

these issues within the HLI working group of the Financial Stability Forum.
This group considered both the implications of HLIs for systemic risk in
global financial markets and the role of HLIs in market dynamics in small
and medium sized economies.
    Regarding systemic risk, the recommendations of the report of this work-
ing group mirrored many of the recommendations of the report of the U.S.
President’s Working Group on Capital Markets (1999). The recommenda-
tions included measures aimed at better risk management by HLIs and their
counterparties (better credit assessments, better exposure measurement, es-
tablishment of credit limits, collateral management techniques), better credi-
tor oversight (greater intensity on firms that are falling short, periodic reaffir-
mation of compliance with sound practices), and enhanced public disclosure
and reporting to authorities.
    Regarding the issue of market dynamics in small and medium sized economies,
the HLI report also made a number of recommendations. First, the report
noted that enhanced risk management practices could address some of the
concerns raised by emerging markets by constraining excessive leverage. Sec-
ond, it also noted that trading on organized exchanges, requiring market
participants to report to regulators and possibly requiring position limits as
well, could alleviate some of the pressures caused by large and concentrated
positions. Third, the FSF recommended that market participants themselves
articulate guidelines for market conduct in the area of foreign exchange trad-
ing. These market guidelines would address the concerns of smaller and
medium sized economies about the trading practices that might have con-
tributed to exacerbating market pressures in period of market turmoil.
