    Other chapters in this book examine the position of women in particular

regions and selected countries. This chapter sets the stage by giving an

overview of women's economic status throughout all areas of the world, empha-

sizing general patterns rather than details, breadth rather than depth. The

status of women has many varied dimensions, some not directly measurable. We

focus on a number of important measurable indicators which reflect primarily

women's economic position: labor force participation, occupational distribu-

tion, earnings, education and the allocation of time between the labor market

and the household. While we do not believe that these indicators summarize

all that is of interest regarding women's status in the larger society, we

believe progress in the economic sphere is necessary, though not sufficient,

for progress in other respects.

    in each case, attention is focused on women's status relative to men's so

that data are presented, for instance, not merely on women's jobs and wages,

but on gender differences in occupations and earnings. This approach implicitly

controls for differences across countries that affect both men and women

similarly and highlights the more significant gender differences which are apt

to affect women's control over their own lives, as well as their influence in

the family and the larger community. Large differences are found among

countries and regions in the size of the gender gap with respect to these

measures. Two generalizations, however, hold. Women have not achieved full

equality anywhere, but particularly in the advanced industrialized countries

for which data on the relevant variables are more readily available, there is

evidence of a reduction of gender differences in economic roles and outcomes.


                           LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION

    Women's   labor force participation is an important determinant of their
economic position, and is therefore examined first. Women who do not work
                                     —2—


outside the household benefit from whatever standard of living their families

reach, but they cannot expect to achieve status in their own   right,   and will

rarely have their own source of income or enjoy economic independence. As

Joekes (1967) observes, "It is increasingly accepted that receipt of direct

money earnings does indeed mark an improvement in status... Paid work is per-

ceived to make a higher contribution to the family's channeling of money to

the household and so goes along with a larger say in household decisions;

also, payment of money can carry conversely a threat of withdrawal of that

money, which gives the earner greater bargaining power within the household.

Increased status confers better material provision, that is, increased claims

on the share of consumer goods within the household, and so the link is

established between employment status and economic benefit. Aggregative

empirical analysis confirms this, in the shape of the contrast between Africa

and Asia, between Southeast Asia and South Asia, and between South and North

India, for example, where in each case the relative material position of women

is better in the first place than in the second, in association with a higher

rate of female participation in the recorded labor force. Numerous case

studies also point to the importance of outside employment in improving the

treatment that women get in society in general and in the household in

particular."1 Gainful employment may thus be regarded as a step in the direc-

tion of equality.

    Almost all countries publish data, at least intermittently, on the propor-

tion of women who are economically active. But comparing these statistics can

produce misleading results. Published data on labor force participation are

influenced by such factors as the age range of the population included, the

number of years young people spend in school, the typical retirement age, the
                                       —3—


age distribution of the population, and whether workers in subsistence agri-

culture are included. For comparative purposes, it is therefore advisable to

use the ratio of women's to men's labor force participation.2 Distortions

still result, however, because of differences in the treatment of men and

women. For example, women working in family enterprises, often classified as

"unpaid   family workers ,"   to work more hours in order to be included in
                              have

the labor force than men who are generally classified as self—employed.3
Because   the countries where female labor force participation is relatively low

are also the ones that tend to relegate women to the category of unpaid family

worker, rather than classifying them as self—employed, it is entirely possible

that differences in women's work between countries are overstated.4 Nonethe-

less, there can be little doubt that these are very substantial.

    Table 1 shows the data on participation for 1950, 1980, and 1985 to 1387

for countries grouped by region because of generally similar characteristics.

The range within each of the groups is also indicated. As measured by the

official statistics, labor force participation of women by region varies from

less than 10 percent to 90 percent of men's. The evidence is consistent with

the proposition that both economic and noneconomic factors help to determine

women's role in the labor market.

    A number of models have been developed concerning the relationship between

economic development and women's labor force participation. Several of these

are discussed elsewhere in this volume. One particularly plausible model

suggests that female labor force participation declines in the early stages of

economic development, then rises at later stages (Durand, 1975). Relatively

high participation by women may occur in pre—industrial economies because of

women's participation in family farms and enterprises, With industrialization,

the shift of the locus of employment out of the home and into the factory and

office tends to be associated with a relative decline in women's participation.

However with further development women are increasingly drawn into market

employment.

    At least two reasons for this positive association between female labor

force participation and economic development in later stages may be identified.

First, research in the U.S. and elsewhere has shown that an increase in the

wages which women can potentially earn in market employment increases the pro-

bability that they will enter the labor force.5 The tendency of women to

substitute market work for housework as their own wages rise outweighs the

positive income effect on the demand for leisure of their husbands' higher

earnings. Thus, the rising real wages of both men and women which occur in

the course of economic development tend to induce increasingly more women to

work for pay. Rising educational attainment of women and shifts from goods

producing to service economies tend to have similar effects because they

increase the potential wage women can earn in the market.

    Second, female labor force participation has been shown to be negatively

related to the number of children present, especially in industrialized coun-

tries where paid work is not readily combined with child care.6 Hence, as

birth rates decline in the course of development, female labor force partic-

ipation tends to increase. A related factor is that the market increasingly

provides many of the goods and services that were formerly produced in the

home. Both these changes tend to decrease the value of women's time spent in

the home and to encourage labor force participation.

    The •data in Table 1 are broadly consistent with this view of the relation-

ship between economic development and labor force participation. Between 1950

and 1980, the ratio of economically active women to economically active men

declined somewhat in Sub—Saharan Africa, composed of countries at a very early
                                     —7—


stage of economic development, while it increased to varying degrees in the

rest of the world. Particularly large increases occurred in the advanced

industrialized nations. While data are considerably more sketchy for the

L980s, it appears that with the exception of the Caribbean countries, the

trend toward rising participation has persisted.

    Government policies also appear to play a role. For instance, when there

is a progressive tax system, women married to men with high incomes have more

incentive to enter the labor market when husband and wife are taxed as mdl—

viduals, so that the tax rate of each is not influenced by the earnings of the

other, than when they are taxed as a couple. As another example, when child

care is subsidized by the government, mothers of young children are more

likely to seek employment. Such features of government policy most likely

contribute to the exceptionally high ratio of female to male labor force par-

ticipation in Sweden. In 1985, the ratio was 87.2 percent in Swedencompared

to an average of 65.8 percent for the advanced industrialized countries.

    The implication of such analyses is that the allocation of women's time

between home work and market work is a rational response to economic con-

ditions. This is not, however, the whole story. To the extent that education

and fertility are themselves influenced by labor force participation, they do

not really provide an independent explanation; to the extent that they are

independent and influence labor force participation, the issue remains why

they, as well as government policies differ as much as they do across

countries. No such problems arise with respect to wage rates as explanatory

variables, for they are presumably determined by economic conditions, includ-

ing the stage of economic development. The influence of wage rates on labor

force participation, however, varies considerably among countries (Mincer,

1986). Similarly, there are very substantial variations in women's labor
                                     —8—


force participation among countries with economies at a toughly similar stage

of economic development. For example, the ratio of female to male partici-

pation is considerably higher in the Caribbean (69.1 percent) and East Asian

(66.4 percent) countries than in Latin America (46.6 percent) despite roughly

similar levels of development. As another example, the participation ratio is

higher in Eastern Europe (79.7 percent) than in the advanced industrialized

nations (65.3 percent), although their level of development is on average

lower. Finally, there are the Group VII countries, comprised of North Africa,

the Middle East, and South Central Asia, which have an average participation

ratio (13.2 percent in 1980) far below that of any of the others.

    Some of these differences may be related to the nature of economic devel-

opment. This might explain, for example, the high ratio of labor force par-

ticipation of women to men in the Caribbean (69.1 percent) where tourism is a

major industry, and the low participation ratio in such countries as Iran

(11.9 percenti and Kuwait (33.6 percent), whose economies are dominated by oil

production. However, it is also extremely likely that noneconomic factors

like ideology and religion exert a considerable influence on women's labor

force status (Blau and Ferber, l986).

    Universalistic egalitarian standards, such as are professed in socialist

countries, generally appear to be positively related to women's role in the

labor market. Thus, a more equal distribution of income (Semyonov, 1980) and

a larger share of resources allocated to social welfare (Weiss, Ramirez and

Tracy, 1976) have been found to be associated with higher labor force par-

ticipation of women, as, for example, in the Scandinavian countries. Simi-

larly, Marxist ideology, which strongly advocates women's entry into the work

force, surely helps to explain the high participation ratios that have existed

in Eastern Europe.
                                      —9—


    On the other hand, Group VII with an average participation ratio of
                                                                            only
13.2 percent, consists entirely of Moslem countries which have   emphasized
women's roles as wives and mothers to the virtual exclusion of activities     out-

side the home. Similarly, Catholicism is the prevalent faith in Latin America

where the participation ratio is also relatively low (46.6 percent). For the

most part, women are also less likely to be employed in the Catholic countries

of Southern Europe than in the Protestant countries of Western Europe. The

unweighted average of the ratio of women's to men's labor force participation

in the eight countries where 80 percent or more of the population is Catholic

is 57.6; in the seven countries where 80 percent or more are Protestant, it is

72.2.



                           OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION

    Women's economic status is undoubtedly influenced not only by their labor

force participation per se, but also by their occupations, and how much they

are paid, two facets which are not unrelated. It is again women's occupa-

tional distribution compared to that of men that is of interest. Table 2

shows the extent of occupational segregation by sex,8 measured by an index

which equals the percentage of women (men) who would have to change jobs in

order for the distribution of men and women by occupational category to be the

same. The index is computed across the seven broad occupational categories

for which data are available. These categories include: professional, tech-

nical and kindred workers; administrative, executive, and managerial workers;

clerical workers; sales workers; farmers, fishermen, loggers and related

workers; craftsmen, production process workers and laborers (n.e.c.); service,

sports, and recreation workers.

    The degree of segregation varies a good deal, but is substantial in the

great majority of countries. U.S. studies suggest that the extent of measured

occupational segregation is greater when a more detailed occupational break-

down is used (e.g., Beller 1984; Baron and Bielby, 1984). Thus, the highly

aggregated nature of the occupational classification scheme used in Table 2

would tend to understate the magnitude of segregation. A particulaz problem

is that the category "farmers, fishermen, loggers and related workers"

continues to comprise a very large proportion of the economically active men

and women in many developing countries. For instance, the percent of the

labor force in this sector is 71 percent in Bangladesh, 64 percent in

Thailand, 56 percent in Indonesia, and 54 percent in Ghana. As a result, the

index of occupational segregation is very low in these countries, ranging from

LO percent in Thailand to 14 percent in Sri Lanka. At the same time agricul-

tural work encompasses many different kinds of tasks. The data do not show to

what extent there is gender differentiation among these tasks.

    It is also interesting to examine two of the advanced industrialized econ-

omies with very low segregation indexes. In Japan 10 percent of economically

active women, as compared to 7 percent of men, are in agriculture. In

Portugal this is true for 27 percent of women and 18 percent of men. It may

be because of this tradition of participation in physical work in the farm

sector that women in these countries constitute a relatively large minority

among production workers. In Japan 26 percent of women and 42 percent of

men, and in Portugal 21 percent of women and 43 percent of men are in the pro-

duction sector, as compared to 41 percent of men and only 11 percent of women

in the U.S.

     Among the four countries with unusually high indexes of
                                                               occupational
 segregation, the three Middle Eastern countries of 8ahrain, Kuwait and the

 United Arab Emirates have highly unusual
                                            economies, with virtually no agri-

 cultural sectors, and heavy concentration in the oil industry where virtually

no women are employed. The situation in the fourth country, Panama, is rather

different. The high degree of segregation there is due to the low represen-

tation of women both among agricultural and production workers, the two cate-

gories that make up 65 percent of male workers.

    Basically, we know little about what causes the wide variations in occur

pational. segregation shown in Table 2. The data show no clear    tendency for

segregation to be smaller in the countries where women's labor force
                                                                       par-

ticipation is greater, though it would be reasonable to expect male and female

occupational distributions to be more similar in countries where their    pat-

terns of labor force participation are more alike. For example,    among advanced

industrialized countries, the segregation ratio is relatively high in the

Scandinavian countries, where the participation ratio is 81.6 percent in

Denmark, 83.8 percent in Finland and 87.2 percent in Sweden, but is equally

high in countries with considerably lower participation ratios, such as

Austria with 60.7 percent, the U.K. with 58.7 percent, and Ireland with 44.7

percent. Similarly, among developing countries occupational segregation is

very low both in Thailand where the ratio of women's to men's labor force

participation is 89.6 percent and •in Indonesia, where it is 54.6 percent.

    While occupational structure plays a part in determining the extent of

occupational segregation, there are also considerable variations in the   repre-
sentation of women in the same occupation, and they are not necessarily

explained by differences in technology. For instance, the agricultural sector

is heavily mechanized in both North America and Eastern Europe,   yet women
                                     —13—


constitute a far larger proportion of agricultural workers in the latter.

Similarly, although agriculture is relatively primitive in both Sub—Saharan

Africa and in some of the Latin American countries, women are heavily repre-

sented in agriculture in the former, and virtually excluded from it in the

latter. Further, there is a very large representation of women among clerical

workers in most developed countries, while they are a small minority in many

developing countries. Neither economic factors alone, nor inherent differ-

ences between women and men can explain these incongruities. Again, tradi-

tions, norms, and even religious beliefs appear to play a part.

    What is the likely future of occupational segregation? There is, on the

one hand, evidence of some decline over the last 15 to 20 years in the U.S.

and other industrialized countries (Beller, 1984; Blau and Hendricks, 1979;

Blau, 1988; OECD, 1985). On the other hand, some occupations which have

experienced a rapid influx of women are now in danger of becoming segregated

anew as they are turning increasingly female (Reskin and Hartmann, 1986;

Strober, 1984). Overall, it appears that a reversal of recent downward trends

seems unlikely, but so does acceleration of the slow decline.


                               THE EARRINGS GAP

    How much women earn compared to men is one of the main determinants of

their status. Unfortunately, obtaining comparable information for men's and

women's earnings for different countries presents a number of difficulties.

Among those nations that provide any earnings data, some apply to workers in

all non—agricultural sectors, others apply to manufacturing only, and they

variously provide hourly, daily, weekly or monthly wages. Beyond that, espe-

cially for some of the developing countries, the ratio of women's to men's

wages varies so erratically over time, that one nust discount the reliability

of the information.
                                       —14—


    There are, however, a number of advanced industrialized nations that have

published reliable hourly earnings for male and female workers in manufac-

turing for several decades. These data, shown in Table 3, provide comparisons

for 16 countries for 1950, 1978 and 1987. Though in each instance men earn

more than women, the earnings gap is far from uniform even among this rela-

tively homogeneous set of countries. But they do have one thing in common:

between 1950 and 1987 the ratio of women's to men's wages rose iii every

instance for which the data are available albeit by no means to the same

extent. Estimates for the U.S. go back only to 1955, but they show no sign of

progress prior to the late 1970s or early 1980s (Blau and Ferber, 1986).

Thus, the U.S. along with Greece, is an exception among these countries, where

most of the change took place before 1978.

    The timing of the decline of the earnings gap in the U.S.—--which did not

occur until the late l970s or early 1980s——has led Smith and Ward (1984) to

argue that it did not reflect the impact of the government's anti—    -.




discrimination   efforts initiated some 10 to 15 years earlier. The implication

of this line of argument is that government interference is neither necessary

nor desirable. The facts are, however, open to the alternative interpretation

that it was in part earlier legislation that encouraged and enabled women to

improve their position in the labor market. Further, a number of studies of

some of the countries where the earnings gap closed considerably more rapidly,

including the United Kingdom and Australia, conclude that government policies

were clearly instrumental in bringing about this improvement in women's wages

(Chiplin, Curran and Parsley, 1980; Gregory, Daly and Ho, 1986; Kessler, 1983;

Sullerot, 1975; Vansgnes, 1971; Zabaiza and Tzannatos, 1985).

                                  EDUCATION

    Women's labor force participation,occupations and earnings are all

expected to be related to their level of education. There are a number of

determinants of cross—country differences in educational levels. Since more

highly educated women tend to get better jobs, earn more, and are less prone

to be unemployed, women who plan to be in the labor force have more incentive

to acquire education. Thus, the ratio of girls to boys in secondary schools

would be expected to vary by labor force participation. In the more affluent

countries, however, education at the primary and secondary levels is often

universally available and compulsory. In such instances there is likely to be

little gender difference in educational attainment at these levels regardless

of women's work rolesj° Indeed, in the U.S., girls were traditionally more

likely to complete high school than boys, probably because their opportunity

cost of attending school was lower due to their lower potential market wages,

though this gender difference has narrowed, as labor market options for indi-

viduals without a high school diploma have greatly diminished. There may, of

course, be differences by gender in field of specialization, related to the

substantial differences in occupations discussed earUerj2

    As can be seen in Table 4, there are large variations in the ratios of

boys to girls in secondary school both within and across regions. Our dis-

cussion above suggests that some of this variation is related to level of

income. That this is the case may be seen in the top panel of Table 5, where
                                                                             13
countries are grouped by level of per capita Gross National Product (GNP).

While 94 percent of countries with per capita CNP of $10,000 or more had a

ratio of girls to boys in secondary school of 90 percent or more, this was

true of only 34 percent of countries with per capita GNP below $2,000. Simi-

larly, while none of the high income countries had a ratio below 70 percent,

this was true of 41 percent of the low income countries. There is,

also considerable variation among low income countries. As the bottom panel

of Table S shows, among these countries gender differences in education, like

those in labor force participation, appear to be related to religion, and tend

to be largest in Moslem and Animist countries. While the ratio of girls to

boys in secondary school was 90 percent or more in 64 percent of the Christian

countries and 60 percent of the other countries, this was the case in only 5

percent of the Moslem countries and none of the Animist countries.


                                  HOUSEWORK

    So far, we have discussed work that is included in official labor force

statistics. This is generally work done for pay or profit, but most countries

also include subsistence farming. Housework, however, is excluded, even

though it provides goods and services that greatly add to the comforts of life

and are often crucialto its very maintenance. Some information is available

that shows women tend to do most of the housework, and that the total amount

of time expended on it is considerable.

    Table 6 shows the pattern of time spent on housework and on market work by

men and women in eight industrialized countries in various years for which

data are available. The pattern is broadly similar across countries. Men

spend considerably more time on market work and women spend far more on house-

work, while the total amount of time spent on both together is roughly com-

parable. Unfortunately, these data are not available separately by women's

employment status. However, data from the U.S. suggest that while employed

women spend less time on housework than women who do not work outside the home

they continue to do the bulk of the housework and to spend a considerable

amount of time on household tasks. At the same time, husband's time spent in

housework does not vary by the work status of the wife. To the extent that

this pattern is generalizable, and anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that

this is the case, it is reasonable to assume that the disparity in men's and

women's time spent in housework revealed in the aggregate figures prevails,

although to a lesser extent, for families with employed wives. This is of

concern because the additional time and energy that women spend at home is

likely to inhibit their progress in the labor market, particularly if they

accommodate household demands by working part—time.

    There are, however, considerable cross—country differences in the ratio of

men's to women's hours of housework ranging, for the most recent year, from

11.3 percent for Japan to 56.9 percent for Sweden. Swedish men spend nearly

15 hours more per week on housework than do Japanese men while average hours

of housework are similar for women in the two countries. In addition, in each

of the five countries where data are also available for a year 10 to 20 years

earlier——Denmark, Japan, Norway, the U.S., and the USSR——the amount of time

men spent on housework increased to some extent over the period while their

time spent in market work decreased. With the exception of Japan, the oppo-

site trends prevailed for women.

    These findings of cross—country variations and intertemporal trends

suggest that the allocation of housework between men and women is to some

extent responsive to changes in women's labor force roles, as well as to

government policiesJ4 In most of the countries for which data are available,

there appears to be some movement, albeit to varying degrees, toward greater

equality in the household, corresponding to the gradual increase in women's

opportunities in the workplace.'5 Only as this movement continues will women

be able to more fully take advantage of these opportunities.

    Information for developing nations is considerably more sparse, with

perhaps the best source being various essays in Goldschmidt—Clermont (1987),
                                     —22—


though even here data are provided for only five countries,'6 and these are

mainly based on small local or regional surveys. The number of hours per week

that women spend on domestic work ranges from 18.9 in Cameroon to 49.0 in

Mexico. The figures for men once again are considerably lower, varying from

1.4 in Cameroon to 18.9 in Mexico. Overall, there seems to be no reason to

doubt that throughout the world women do the bulk of housework. On the other

hand, it is also the case that women's labor force participation everywhere

tends to be lower than men's.


              SPECIAL PROBLEMS Of WOMEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

    Just as girls constitute a smaller proportion of students in secondary

schools in countries with a lower level of income, a number of studies in

developing countries where women have low status show that girls receive par-

ticularly inadequate care and nutrition (Ravindran, 1986; Waldron, 1986;

Weinberger and Heligman, 1987). These are only two illustrations which indi-

cate that women tend to be better off at a higher level of per capita income,

whether or not they have achieved a high degree of equality with men, and tend

to be doubly disadvantaged in poor countries when they are also the objects of

sex discrimination. Thus, the issue of equality is not merely an indulgence

of middle class women in affluent societies, but can be a matter of great

urgency for poor women in developing countries as well. At the same time, the

wasted potential of women who are not given the opportunity to develop and

fully use their productive capacity is a particularly serious loss in these

nations.

    A recent study (Ferber and Berg, 1987) of 144 countries confirmed earlier

research that showed a positive relation between women's labor force par-

ticipation and the ratio of women to men in the population. Unlike other

authors who have emphasized that it is a surplus of women as compared to men
                                      —23—


that causes them to seek employment (Cuttentag and Secord, 1983; Grossbard—

Shechtman, 1985; Ward and Pampel, 1985), this paper points out that women,

when they are in the main "only'1 wives and mothers, and not seen as economi-

cally active, are so short—changed in the allocation of resources that their

chances for survival are reduced. To the extent that these conclusions are

correct, they suggest that women's economic status is likely to be better when

they are employed than when they are full—time homemakers.


                                 CONCLUSIONS

    This chapter has provided a broad overview of women's economic status,

examining specifically such important issues as labor force participation,

occupational segregation, earnings, education, and the amount of time spent on

housework. The picture that emerges is complex. There are large differences

among countries and regions which make generalizations difficult. Nonethe-

less, two conclusions are warranted. Nowhere have women achieved equality

with men, but particularly in the advanced industrialized countries where data

on the relevant variables are more readily available, there is evidence of a

reduction in gender differences in economic roles and outcomes. It is quite

likely that these changes will continue and possibly accelerate over time as

alterations in women's, and to a lesser extent in men's work and family roles

reinforce each other. Nonetheless, there is also reason for concern both with

the slow pace of change, and how far it has everywhere fallen short of the

ultimate goal of equality.

    It appears that it is basic attitudes about gender roles and especially

about the roles of men and women in the family that are most deep—seated and

difficult to change. Economic conditions and laws, where appropriately

enforced, have increased women's opportunities in the labor market, improved

their access to education, and reduced the earnings gap. The division of
                                     —24—


household responsibilities and resources within the household, on the other

hand, is not as readily amenable to change. As long as women, but not men,

have "household responsibilities," whether or not they are also wage earners,

the goal of equality for women in the economy as well as in the home is likely

to remain elusive.

within the marriage, and increases her influence in decision making...

Couples in which both husband and wife work are more likely to share decisions

about major purchases and child rearing" (Nieva, 1985,   p. 164).

    2This is preferable to using the proportion of the labor force that is

female, because it •is not influenced by the sex ratio of the population.

    31t has been suggested that persons producing goods and services for use

within their own household should also be included in the labor force

(Beneria, 1981). A case can be made, of course, that providing goods and

services directly is no less productive than earning money in order to

purchase commodities. However, as is suggested in our discussion above, labor

force participation as conventionally defined confers greater relative status

on women because this enables them to gain control over money. It is pre-

cisely this enhancement of relative status which we wish to measure. Hence

the conventional definition is most appropriate for our purposes.

    41t may well be that women's participation in all types of family enter-

prises tends to be especially understated in societies where any role other

than that of wife and mother is frowned upon. However, Cunar Myrdal (1968)

observed that in Moslem countries, such as Pakistan, where measured female

participation is very low, women also play a less active role outside the

home, even in agricultural work. Similarly, Youssef (1971) suggested that
                                           —26--



women tend to avoid activities to which a stigma is attached. In Sub—Saharan

African countries, on the other hand, where measured participation is higher,

women do a very large share of farm work (Boserup, 1970).

    5For the most recent and comprehensive studies    see those in Layard and

Mincer (1985).

    6There is far less evidence of such conflict for developing countries.

See, for instance, Behrman and Wolfe (1984); Concepcion (1974); Kelley and de

Silva (1980).
    7
        See also Ferber and Berg (1987).

    81t is unfortunate that among the Eastern European countries the relevant

data are available only for Hungary.

    9For instance, the ratio is 82.4 in 1976, 96.9 in 1977 and 86.9 in 1978

for Burma; 63.1 in 1977 and 91.7 in 1978 for Egypt; and 77.4 in 1976 and 55.6

in 1977 in Kenya (International Labour Organization Yearbook, various issues).

    10Provision of education for girls when female labor force participation

is low is often rationalized as good preparation for their roles as wives and

mothers.
    11
         In 1900, only two—thirds as many boys as girls graduated from high

school (Blau and Ferber, 1986).

    12These points are illustrated by a recent OECD (1985) study which found

that in the advanced industrialized countries covered in the study there has

been very marked and near—universal growth of female enrollments in higher

education, but that in many countries rigid division by gender in terms of

field of specialization continues to be apparent (p. 10). In some countries,

however, such as the U.S., there has recently been a significant influx of

young women into career—oriented fields, presumably as their labor force

attachment has increased.

    13Gross National Product (CNP) is the market value of the   total annual

output of final goods and services produced by the residents of a country.

    14For example, Juster and Stafford (1990) suggest that tax policies, spe-

cifically individual vs. joint taxation of married couple earnings, may

explain cross—country differences in trends.
    15
      Juster and Stafford (1990) provide additional data on changes from the

1970s to the 1980s for Canada, Holland, Japan, Norway, the U.K. and the U.S.

(Table 5, p. 38). With the exception of Holland and Japan, women's time spent

on housework decreased while men's time increased during this period.

    16They are Bangladesh, Cameroon, Mexico, Napal, and Venezuela.
