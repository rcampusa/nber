                       Unemployment—Rate Dynamics and
                        Persistent Unemployment Under
                            Rational Expectations

                                    ABSTRACT




     This paper develops a model of unemployment rate dynamics that provides

an explanation   of   persistent cyclical unemployment that does not involve

persistent   expectational   errors or other nonoptimizing behavior. Our results

are based on the interaction of search dynamics and inventory adjustments. An

important element in these dynamics appears to be heterogeneity in the labor

force which can be characterized as consisting of a relatively small group of

high turnover individuals who comprise the bulk of normal unemployment and a

larger group of low turnover individuals who dominate movements in cyclical

unemployment. Our empirical results provide support for this theory as we

demonstrate that the appropriately measured probability of becoming employed

during a recovery falls relative to normal because of the unusually high

proportion of low turnover individuals who have lost "permanent" jobs. As a

result, recovery is much slower than is indicated by normal relationships

although each individual is searching optimally.

    Macroeconomists typically build models of the determination of real

output with unemployment—rate movements explained, if at all, by an appended

Okun's Law relationship. En this paper we show that this approach is

misleading because it misses important sources of persistence in cyclical

unemployment —— and hence —   real   output. In particular, we show that

unemployment—rate dynamics imply "humped—shaped" cyclical unemployment

characterized by persistence even though unemployed workers have faulty

information on wage rates for only a comparatively brief period of time. This

result is based on the interaction of two stock or state
                                                             variables —

              and cyclically unemployed workers —— which
                                                         result in a brief

     In the first section of the paper we develop the partial—adjustment

equation which governs the evolution of the unemployment rate. We show that

if individuals differ significantly in their probability of leaving unemploy-

individual probabilities are the same —— are used to demonstrate that the

unemployed differ substantially in their individual probabilities of leaving

unemployment. We can broadly characterize the labor force as consisting of
                                          of recent entrants into the labor market
two groups: The first group consists
                                                      individuals who have selected
who are in the process of job shopping and other

careers in sectors (occupational or industrial) that involve low accumulation

of specific capital. This group is characterized by high rates of entry into
                                                      in normal times, the bulk of
unemployment and high probability of leaving it;

 unemployment comes from this group. The second group consists of individuals

with high degrees of specific human capital and "permanent" jobs; so they

 rarely become unemployed but search for a long time to find a replacement job

 The slow search process of this second group implies that they dominate

 cyclical unemployment during the rcovery from recessions.

    Further empirical work reported in the third section of the paper

supports the following macroeconomic parable: Money shocks do not directly

effect the proximate determinates of unemployment but do so indirectly through

inventories. High inventories (relative to sales) lead to abnormally and

temporarily high rates of entry of both groups into unemployment.    The high

inventories also may mildly and temporarily depress the probability of leaving

unemployment. The excess unemployment among the high probability group is

quickly eliminated, but those who have lost permanent jobs take many months to
                                                                    of success is

no lower that would be the case in normal times. Thus, individual maximizing

behavior leads to substantially persistent effects on cyclical unemployment

and output.


                   I. Unemployment Dynamics and Persistence

     In this section we demonstrate that the logic of the standard search

model implies persistent cyclical unemployment as a result of a single—period

forecast error on the part of searching workers. In this theoretical exposi-
                                                 the notion that some of the
tion of unemployment dynamics we abstract from

unemployed may not be searchers, but instead may be on temporary layoff,

expecting recall. We do this in order to emphasize the separate role of

search dynamics in yielding persistent effects from uncorrelated errors.

Initially we assume that all workers are identical.



l.A. Identical Workers

      The dynamics of the unemployment rate can be described by a simple

discrete time model. Let u represent the unemployment rate,         s be the

number of unemployed searchers, and n be the labor force. By definition:

That is, the natural unemployment rate is the product of the normal search

rate 3 and adjusted duration of search (l/*).2 For example, suppose that
under normal conditions two percent of the labor force begins the search

                                             of finding employment in a month is one
process each month, the probability

third (i.e., the expected duration of search is 1/it or 3 months), and the

growth rate of the labor force is 0.002/month.                Then the natural unemployment

rate Is

This is close to the 6 percent rate which we would obtain by ignoring the

growth adjustment and simply taking the ratio                of • to      it.

That is, an abnormally high rate of new searchers, or an abnormally low

probability of finding an acceptable job tends to increase the unemployment

rate, but aside from these shocks the unemployment rate converges to its

natural rate with a constant partial adjustment factor

      To illustrate the implications of equation (7), suppose for simplicity

that an unexpected economic shock increases         and lowers 11* temporarily

until information on the change in policy can be incorporated in the expecta-

tions of entrepreneurs, searchers, and the public. Figure 1 illustrates the

behavior of the unemployment rate on the assumption that these expectations

effects on search flow and the instantaneous probability of employment last

for one period only. The figure shows that a one—period expectations error

implies a persistent effect on unemployment and hence on real output in the

standard search—unemployment model. In the second period, the probability

that each searcher finds a job is at the normal level, but the additional

unemployment engendered in the first period takes time to work off. If we

were to suppose that the initial effect of a restrictive demand shock is in

part to build up inventories and that these excessive inventories lead to

 4 > •    in   successive periods, the interval in which unemployment rates rise

would be prolonged.

      It may seem strange at first that when workers realize that they made a

mistake last period, ¶* returns only to its normal value rather than going

below ir to compensate for the error. A bit of overshooting is possible if


                                                                              in
         4The rate * is not necessarily constant over time, For example,
 the empirical work we show that it varies with the demographic composition of
 the labor force. For our imniediat purposes, however, we may assume that it
 is constant.

for inventories, investment projects in process, and other such state

variables. The persistent unemployment and output effects are not due to any

persistent errors on the part of workers or firms, but instead due to the

dynamic process of search in the labor market.    In Sections III and IV below,

we present empirical evidence that the, interaction of inventory and unemploy-

ment dynamics does produce a hump—shaped time path of the unemployment rate in

response to brief unexpected shocks.



LB. Heterogeneous Workers
                                                                        role in
     A second element of employment dynamics which plays an important

explaining the persistence of unemployment subsequent to a macroeconomic shock

is the heterogeneous nature of workers. As a general proposition, it has

become increasingly accepted that heterogeneity across workers is important

for understanding the behavior of unemployment.    Realization that workers in

different submarkets (e.g., demographic, industrial, occupational) may exhibit

different turnover behavior has led to a recognition that the natural rate of

unemployment will vary with the composition of the labor market (see for

example, Wachter 1976, Lilien 1982, and Haltiwanger and Plant l984). Hetero

geneity has also played an important role in the study of the distribution of

unemployment duration. Specifically, the presence of heterogeneity implies a

bias in using the observed (from the BLS household survey) uncompleted spell

distribution to measure the unobserved completed spell distribution (see, for

example, Salant 1976 and Akerlof and Main 1980).    Thus, we are clearly not the

first to identify heterogeneity as an important factor for understanding




     7We incorporate this idea into our measure of the natural rate of
unemployment in Section II.

the labor market. Rather our innovation is to examine the ramifications of

heterogeneity for persistence in unemployment over the business cycle. In

particular, in this section we demonstrate theoretically how heterogeneity is

potentially a source of persistence over the cycle and then in succeeding

      For simplicity, we can think of workers as being divided into two groups.

Those in the first group have little firm—specific human capital and they

experience unemployment frequently, but the length of these spells are brief.

 varies inversely with it so that low it

 Borjas (1980) and Carlson and Horrigan (1983). Alternatively, it might
 itself decrease as duration increased. As discussed below, we believe that
 the data are best explained by the sorting hypothesis.

to believe that exceedingly low values for                    could be socially optimal even

if they were privately optimal given our system of transfer payments. It is
not clear —— of course -— that stimulative monetary or fiscal policy has the
same power to reemploy group 2 workers as it does to disemploy them through
bankruptcies and permanent layoffs.

unemployed will be abnormally large which implies, from equation (9) that       ii




will be abnormally low       (IT < 0). As a result an analyst looking at only the

aggregate equation (7) might incorrectly conclude that convergence to the

natural unemployment rate u would be much faster were persistent expecta—

tional errors not keeping 11 negative. But we are considering a case in

which each individual always correctly perceives the wage distribution so that

it1 =
        ir     always. So persistence in aggregate   it may reflect expectational

error or significant heterogeneity in       it across individuals.1

        This   dscusson   of heterogeneIty suggests that considerable care must be

taken in defining the natural rate of unemployment. Movements in the

unemployment rate will be highly correlated with changes in the composition of

the pool of unemployed workers. So any measure of the natural rate that uses

weighted averages of normal levels of ir and             where weights are

unemployment shares (for example, /E —- irk)         will result in most movements

in u being explained by movements in the natural rate.12 Adjustment to

normal levels of unemployment is reflected in adjustments in the share of

unemployment among groups, and thus variations in shares should not be used to

capture variation in the natural rate of unemployment.




     URecall that in the case just considered the accounting identity (7)
will continue to hold although equation (13) is governing the convergence to
the natural rate.

     En the previous section, we demonstrated that the determinants of search

rate •,   the   employment probability            it,   and the labor—force growth rate y

were important in the analysis of the cyclical pattern of unemployment and

real output. In this section we first consider the measurement of ,                       11, and
y, then decompose the measured values into cyclical and normal components,

and finally obtain a measure of the heterogeneity of                   ir    across individuals.

At present, we are not able to measure (separately) values of 4 and r for

those on temporary layoffs and those who are searchers (all others))3 We

postpone the development of such measures to future research.



LEA. The Measurement of 4, it,              and    .
     Since the size of the labor force is a regularly reported statistic, we

have no difficulty in computing y, the growth rate of the labor force. To

measure • and        ¶   we would ideally like to have data that reports the gross

flows of the number of workers among three states: employed, unemployed, and

not in the labor force. Unfortunately complete data of this sort are not

regularly and reliably collected.14 However, we can obtain very good

estimates of    it   and    •   from the available data on the aggregate number, s,

unemployed each month and the number, O4, who have been unemployed "0—4

weeks.'




     131f we could, we would like to measure                      as the fraction of the labor
force beginning temporary layoff within the month and                         as the probability
of being recalled from temporary layoff within the month.

       Recall that the Current Population Survey is conducted each month during

the week which contains the 12th day of the month. Thus the typical year has

twelve surveys of which 8 are conducted 4 weeks subsequent to the previous

survey and 4 are 5 weeks subsequent to the previous survey. We find it

convenient to use standard months of 4.35 weeks (30.4 days =     365/12).   Since

0—4 reports the number of people unemployed 31 days or less, it is a good

measure of the people who have become unemployed over the last month.'5 The

number unemployed at the last survey is used to approximate s_i, the number

unemployed exactly one month earlier. The equivalence is exact whenever u1

equals the value 4         toward which the unemployment rate currently

converges as it would, for example, in steady—state equilibrium; otherwise the

error Introduced in estimating       it is bounded by 0.02 for plausible values of

the relevant parameters.'6 These data are sufficient to calculate ii as

unemployed person would be unemployed under current conditions: (1/it)

unemployed person only if the ratio of search flows, f 1/f2, equals the ratio

of the unemployment shares, 1'2• In steady—state equilibrium, for example,

 i/2 exceeds                   so that the average expected duration of newly begun

unemployment is less than the average expected remaining duration of the

currently unemployed.

        The corresponding measure of •        is

where        n is the civilian labor force. Note that this discrete time measure

of $ measures         the flow of people who become unemployed between monthly

observations and are still unemployed at this monthly observation. The

continuous—time search rate would be higher.17

        Monthly values of our estimates of $        and   ii are available from the

authors on request. Figure 3 plots quarterly averages of the monthly values

of     it.   The mean value of 0.46 is interpreted as saying that on average 46

percent of the people who are unemployed at the beginning of a month will find

a job, leave the labor force, or be recalled from layoff by the end of the

month. The vertical lines mark cyclical peaks (P) and troughs (T) on the

Note that the observed value of it is simply l—e8. Taking y = 0,               the
following correspondence are observed:

                          0.4          .511           .783

                          0.6          .916           .655

Thus the observed monthly probability of finding a job it is less than its
continuous time equivalent 6, and the observed monthly flow into unemploy—

NBER reference cycle chronology. We note first that the values of           it   tended

to be rather higher (around 0.6) during the Korean and Vietnamese eras and

also that the monthly probability of getting a job drops sharply during a

recession and rises in a boom. Our estimate of              is derived and discussed

in Section II.B below.
                                                                                       We

see that 4     generally       follows an upward trend although it is sharply below

trend in both the Korean and Vietnamese eras. The cyclical behavior is

sharply contracyclical ——        rising   in recessions and falling in booms.


11.8. Cyclical and Normal Components

       In equations (6) and (7) we analyze unemployment rate dynamics in terms

of normal values •,      ii,    y, and u and the corresponding cyclical components

4>,   ir, y, and u. In this section we develop estimates of these quantities.
Following Barro (1977, 1978) and Wachter (1976) we develop measures of ir,4>,

and y which reflect the effects of the military draft and the age—sex

composition of the labor force on the natural rate of unemployment and derive

a measure of    18

            might   be useful     to examine the effect of the industrial or
occupational composition of the labor market on ,             , and
                                                              y. This is of
interest because the recent work of Lilien (1982) suggests that the industrial
composition is important for measuring the overall natural rate of unemploy-
ment. However, to incorporate these ideas in this context, unemployment
duration data broken down simultaneously by age, sex, industry and occupation
would be required and such a four way classification of this data is not
available. Confronted with the choice of which decomposition matters most, we
chose the age—sex classification. This is because the age—sex breakdown of
the unemployment duration data is relatively more available and previous
studies (e.g., Wachter 1976, Haltiwanger and Plant 1984) have demonstrated
that the age—sex composition of the labor force is very important.

(January 1970 to December 1983), and equal to the ratio of the number of
military personnel to the male population age 16 to 34 in years in which a
draft was present. The draft after 1970 was a lottery draft. Following Barro
(1977, 1978), we include this in tte "non—draft" period since the incentives
to search were considerably decreased by this process of conscription.
Monthly data for this variable is available beginning 1953—58.

where the summations are over age—sex cells and                 is measured as the mean

of    the observed monthly growth rates for group i.

        Having measured                 and         for each group i, we can measure

equation (6) to obtain the aggregate normal unemployment rate 1 which rises

(see Figure 5) Until the late 1970s and then begins to drift downward.

            Examining Figures 3 and 4, we see that ir is relatively constant and the

key factor moving u is             4, which indeed increases during the l970s and then

falls off somewhat in the early 1980s. This can be explained by examining the

estimates of the            and         values.

            Table 1 reports the estimated normal values for irk, 4,,         and         by

age and sex.23 During the 1970s the labor force share of the young increased

and then decreased slightly in the early l980s as the baby boom generation

grew older. Since, as reported in Table 1, the young have relatively high

probabilities of leaving unemployment, this accounts for the small movements

in     iT    over this period.

            Figure 4 includes a plot of the quarterly averages of monthly values of

early to mid—l970s but falls off in the early 1980s. Since the 4,'s are




     231n a recent study of micro turnover data, Robert Topel (1984) found
results similar to those reported here. Namely, that as age and experience in
the work force increased, the likelihood of becoming unemployed (4,)
decreased but the likelihood of leaving unemployment ('it) decreased as well.

relatively constant over time, equation (20) indicates that this variation in

      must be the result of variation in labor force shares. Our examination of

the labor force share data reveals that the upswing in                      in the early to

middle l970s is accounted for by the influx of the young and women into the

labor force; both are relatively high turnover groups as evidenced by Table 1.

Accordingly, the falloff in        4'   in the early 1980s is accounted for by the

decreased share of the young in the labor force as the baby boom generation

grew older. The estimated               values move more dramatically than          ii because

of the much greater variation in            4,.        than in ir values.

        The adjustment of the aggregate measure of it to its equilibrium value,

it,   can be slowed by the presence of heterogeneity in the labor market. As we

showed in Section I.B, if there are two groups with different values of ir

and j.,     aggregate measures of         it      can show persistent deviations from ,

even though within groups there is no persistent deviation from equilibrium

values. Any attempt then to measure persistence in it, and thus u,

requires an empirical characterization of heterogeneity. In this section we

provide empirical evidence of heterogeneity in it.

       Let d denote the average duration of unemployment this month for those

who were unemployed last month and are still unemployed, and let                   d....1 denote

the average duration c,f unemployment in the previous month for all unemployed

workers. Suppose that all individuals have the same probability of exiting

unemployment,     it;   that is, there is no heterogeneity. Then:


(23)                    d =   d_1 + 1.

Given a uniform escape probability at any point in time, the average duration

of unemployment for those remaining unemployed in a given month should
                                                  27




increase by one month. However, if individuals are heterogeneous, and thus

have different values of          71,   then d will generally exceed d_1+1 because
a disproportionate share of high duration (low it)                           workers   remain unemployed

at the end of a month's time.

       Given a heterogeneous workforce, on average d will exceed (d_1+l) by

some positive value, call it h.               Thus,


(24)


Let d denote the average duration of people who became unemployed in the

last month. Then the average duration of unemployment in a given month, d,

is simply a weighted average of d and d:


                                                            0—4
                   d =    SS 0—4                       +             d
(25)                                    (d_1+l+h)

Solving (25) for h yields:


                         d—d       (s°4/s)
(26)               h=                          —d —l
                          l—(s          Is)


Data on all of the right hand side variables are readily available, except for

d which can be approximated and in our sample lies between 0.4267 and

0.4691.24 To compute the nan value of h over 1953:8 through 1983:12, we




     24Those who became unemployed within the month will have an average
duration of less than one half month because those who became unemployed
earlier in the month are more likely to have found a job than the more
recently unemployed. Assuming the Poisson distribution of note 17 above and
y0, the average duration of those who became unemployed within the month is

assume dn to be constant at 0.4495 which corresponds to the mean value of

it   of 0.45674. The resulting mean value, i, is 0.973. What does this value
imply about the extent of heterogeneity in the labor force?

       Suppose that the labor force can be characterized as consisting of two

groups as in Section I.B. It is straightforward to determine the steady—state

value of h for alternative values of         and       2 given that the steady—
state ratio of inflows f1/f2 adjusts so that the aggregate 11        is equal to

its sample mean of about 0.46.25 Candidate pairs of values of           and 112

are those for which the calculated value of t is close to 0.973. Table 2

reports these pairs together with the implied values of fl/f 2 and h. Note

that the h in our sample implies two groups with substantially different

values of

       We can get some idea of potential values for        and 112 from the range

of values reported in Table 1 for broad age—sex cells. These values range

from 0.31 to 0.57. Suppose that the average ir for 16—19 year olds of both

sexes — 0.55 ——    reflects   ,   because these youngsters have not yet formed

any permanent job attachments nor acquired specific human capital.26 Table 2

tells us that    it2 would be about 0.112. if the normal unemployment rate

among group 2 were about half the overall rate     —   say 2.75 percent * then

      would be 0.00308. Put differently the average duration of these

of it observed over 1953:8 — 1983:12 are 0.31 and 0.59 for which the
corresponding d values are 0.4691 and 0.4267, respectively.

       26The correct      could be even a bit lower than this if the average
high—probability individual has a lower probability than these youngsters of
getting a job. or leaving the labor force.

"permanent" jobs would be about 325 months or 27 years. This number is

consistent with the stylized facts about the labor market.27 A 112 of 0.112

would imply that during the recovery from a recession when 112 dominates the

adjustment rate, cyclical unemployment would fall by about a ninth in one

month, a third in a quarter, a half in a half year, and three quarters in a

year's time if all •'s and ii's were at their normal values. Such

persistence may be sufficient to explain the puzzle of why unemployment is

persistent without need for recourse to any substantially persistent

expectational errors which cause 111 and it2          to differ from theIr normal

values for long periods of time. This hypothesis Is considered further in

Section III.

      A final implication of using Ill = .55         and 2 = .112   is that normally

79% of the unemployed would be from group 1 and only 21% from group 2.28

However, if we assume that the ir values were at their normal          levels   when

ii   fell to 0.313 in November 1982, then we conclude that s1/s fell. to only

about 0.459. The unemployment rate of 10.7 percent at that time can be decom-

posed into 4.91 percentage points due to group 1 and 5.79 percentage points

due to group 2. Group 1 accounts for 4.77 percentage points of the 6.07 per-

centage point value of u, but for only 0.14 percentage points of the total

4.63 percentage points of cyclical unemployment.29 Group 2 accounts for the

remaining 1.30 percentage points of normal unemployment and 4.49 percentage

consistent with our theoretical analysis in Sections l.A and I.B: Normal

unemployment consists primarily of high turnover individuals, but cyclical

unemployment is dominated during the recovery from a recession by individuals

              III. An Empirical Model of Cyclical Unemployment

     The model of unemployment rate dynamics we have developed allows us to

identify four separate potential sources of persistence in cyclical unemploy-

ment, u. First, persistence could be due to the partial adjustment of u

toward u with ii,       • and    y at their normal levels. Such persistence is

pictured in Figure 1. Our estimation of ir in Section II imply that on

average 46% of the unemployed escape unemployment each month which would imply

that during recovery nearly half the cyclically unemployed would find jobs

within a month. However, as we demonstrated empirically in Section II, the

partial adjustment speed may be substantially reduced due to heterogeneity,

with individual   ii,   •, and    y at normal levels. We illustrated this

phenomenon in Figure 2 and the estimates we generated in Section II.C show

that only about one—ninth of the cyclically employed would find jobs within a

month. A third source of persistence might be autocorrelatlon in ir, 4 and

y due to equilibrium adjustments to changes in economic conditions. Finally,

autocorrelation in ii, $    and 'y may be associated with persistent expecta—

tional errors. The first three sources of persistence are consistent with a

rational expectations model of economic agents' behavior, while the fourth

contradicts such a hypothesis.

     In this section, we complement the measures of ,      4   and y developed

in Section II with equations that explain the movement of      ir, 4 and y

around those normal levels and with a supplementary equation which links the

movements of inventories and money. This preliminary analysis of the data

raises many questions for future research, but several messages are clear.

First, heterogeneity is an important source of persistence, which confirms the

empirical analysis just presented. Secondly, the data appear to be consistent

with equilibrium models of persistence, with little if any role for
                                                     33



autocorrelated expectational errors. Finally, within the simple model we have

chosen to describe, deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural level

are not caused directly by money shocks, but instead through fluctuations in

the level of inventories about its nan. Thus aggregate shocks that cause the

level of inventories to fluctuate, such as unanticipated fluctuations in the

money supply, will affect the cyclical unemployment rate.


III.A. Behavior of the Employment Probability ii

          The    standard       search model of unemployment states that     it    is   a function of

unexpected changes in aggregate demand and hence the derived demand for labor.

An unexpected increase (decrease) in aggregate demand shifts the                        actual   distri-

bution of wage offers right (left) relative to the expected distribution so that

it   is    increased (decreased) relative to normal. Another, possibly complement-

ary, theory posits that the probability of receiving any offer increases

(decreases) so that the probability it                of   an acceptable offer increases

(decreases). Following Barro (1977, 1978), we use unexpected money                               as an

indicator of shifts in aggregate demand. The strictest interpretation of

rational expectations, would posit that only the current value of g                         should
                      31
affect          it.        We   test this hypothesis by including in our   it     regression
specification a distributed lag on the current value and first 11 lags of                          L32


     31For such an interpretation, see McCallum (1979). The basic idea is
that all past information will be incorporated in current expectations and so
will have no effect on real variables except through past effects on current
state variables such as inventories, If lagged values of T were to enter we
would conclude (a) expectations are not formed rationally, (b) the relevant
horizon for forming expectations is longer than 1 month, or (c) some signif 1—
cant state variables have been omitted from the regression. In the latter
case, the lagged     coefficients would reflect past effects on the omitted
state variable(s) and current effects of the state variable(s).

      32We measure                  as the residual from an ARIMA(O,2,4) process fit to log
M. Our money series is the current Federal Reserve M1 series for 1959—1
                                       34



      The cyclical component I of the inventory—sales ratio may    affect   it




for   three reasons:33 First, our measure of ¶   is   actually a weighted average

of the probability that a searcher finds an acceptable job, the probability

that a searcher leaves the labor force, and the probability that a laid—off

worker is recalled. The probability of recall from layoff depends positively

on the extent to which excess inventories have been eliminated.34 Second,

when inventories are abnormally high, the discounted marginal value product of

labor is abnormally low. Optimal intertemporal leisure substitution implies



(fn. 32 cont.) ——   through 1983—12 which we have extended back to 1953—6 by a
ratio splice at 1959—1 to the old M1 series in Board of Governors of the
                                                                  rates in the
Federal Reserve System (1976). (This splice preserves the growth
two series which are practically identical in 1959.)  After allowing for

taking second differences, i     estimates are available from 1953—8. This
start date for estimating i was chosen for two reasons: (1) This avoids
essentially all of the period during which the Fed was pegging government bond
prices. The process determining money growth is potentially different during
that period; see Friedman and Schwartz (1963, pp. 613, 625). (2) This is the
latest start date for     for which availability of if observations does not
reduce the period over which we can estimate the regressions reported in this
section.

     33We measure I as the deviation from a linear trend fit to Citibase
data on the inventory—sales ratio for manufacturing and trade. This ratio —
the one—month lagged value of Business Conditions Digest series number 77 ——
has the beginning-ofmOnth total book value (in 1972 dollars) of manufacturing
and trade inventories as the numerator and manufacturing and trade sales for
the prior month (in 1972 dollars) as the denominator. This dating is
appropriate both with respect to the decislonmakiflg of the firm and for the
intertemporal decision—making of individuals.

     The linear trend was not estimated directly, but instead is that I
implied by our regression of I on both trend and cyclical variables (see
Table 5 below). The difference is not a substantive one: The correlation
cofficient between our I and the residuals from a linear trend regression is
0.95. Details of how to impute I      from the Table 5 regression are given in
footnote 42 below.

     34See Haltiwanger and Maccini (1984) and Topel (1982) for theoretical
results which support the discussion of the interaction of inventories and

that some searchers should then drop out of the labor force, but we expect

that in fact many of these individuals would be counted as unemployed due to

unemployment benefit rules. Finally, cyclical fluctuations in inventories

could shift the actual wage offer distribution relative to the expected

distribution.

      To capture these inventory effects, the                    equation also includes a 12

month distributed lag on I. Intertemporal substitution considerations would

suggest that             should enter because it is the most recent Information

available to workers during the month. From the point of view of firms,

lagged as well as current values of I could enter because if there were

adjustment costs associated with varying employment, it would be optimal for

firms to use inventories to buffer short—run monthly variations in sales.

However, given that there are also costs of varying inventories, successive

monthly variations in the inventory—sales ratio in the sai direction will

make it optimal for a firm eventually to change production and hence employ-

ment. To capture this optimal lagged response of employment to inventories we

include a distributed lag of I as determinants of                     it.



      To capture the effects of heterogeneity on ,r we use variables that

indicate how the composition of the unemployed has changed over time, In

particular, we are interested in changes in the share of the unemployed who

exhibit high turnover and low duration relative to the share of the unemployed

who exhibit low turnover and high duration. To characterize this simply, we

include the one period lagged share of unemployed who have been unemployed

less than 5 weeks as an explanatory variable in the r equation.

      The first column of Table 3 reports the results of OLS regressions of                ir



on the lagged unemployment share of low duration workers, and the 12 month

confidence level. Neither the current money shock nor all 12 coefficients as
a group are significantly different from zero.35 The coefficient on I is

negative and significant and the distributed lag on I is significant as

well.36 In the second column we report a regression which omits the

insignificant lags on money shocks. The I distributed lag is now

significant at the 1% confidence level.37

     We interpret these results as indicating that the primary factor

determining cyclical variations in the probability of leaving unemployment is

heterogeneity. Inventory innovations appear to play some role and

surprisingly money shocks have no significant impact. Money shocks may be

insignificant because they operate only through the I or because of measure-

ment error problems, but there is certainly no evidence here of persistent

expectational errors.

cyclical inventories and decreased by positive money shocks. High inventories

or low sales due to a negative f     present   the best time for firms to cull

their labor force of marginal workers; when these conditions are persistent,

layoffs (permanent and temporary) will result. In the opposite direction, low

I and high T would tend to induce firms to retain otherwise unsatisfactory
workers temporarily and would reduce the aggregate incidence of new layoffs

below its normal level. So as with ¶,         we include 12 month distributed lags

such heterogeneity that is associated with the age—sex composition of the

the distributed lag on I proved quite significant in explaining            The

large, significant, positive coefficients on I and I(—l) reflect the

increase in layoffs associated with high cyclical inventories. It is not

possible to decompose this into temporary and permanent layoffs, but the

signficant negative coefficient on I(—1l) suggests that variation in the

rate of permanent separations for marginal workers is involved: If a marginal

worker is fired earlier due to high cyclical inventories, +   will   decrease

below normal levels during the latter period when the worker would have

otherwise been fired. The sum of the coeffceuts .s postve confirming        the
notion that high cyclical inventories cause temporary layoffs of employees who

otherwise would never have been unemployed. A similar pattern of coefficients

appears in the distributed lag on   1.    A high value of   reduces the likeli-

hood that workers will be terminated in the first few months, but there is

essentially no effect over a year's time as indicated by the insignificance of

money shocks as a group.4° The right—hand column of Table 4 reports the

results of a regression which drops the insignificant 1 distributed lag.

The "S" shaped pattern of I coefficients is more pronounced than in the

previous regression. Again we conclude that lagged expectational errors from

money shocks account for no detectible persistence in the unemployment rate

except as it is incorporated in I.

III.C. Cyclical Behavior of I

     Given potential discouraged and added worker effects over the cycle, both

I and t might influence y. In regressions not reported here, we tried

regressing   y on 12 month distributed lags on these variables. The F

statistic on each group of parameters was insignificant and the   2 negli-
gible. We conclude that, while various subgroups of the labor force may have

cyclically sensitive participation rates, the overall growth rate of the labor

force is not sensitive to cyclical factors.



III.D. Cyclical Behavior of the Inventory-Sales Ratio I

     Our results so far indicate that to understand the cyclical behavior of

the unemployment rate the determinants of the inventory—sales ratio must be

understood as well. Much research on the cyclical behavior of I is already

underway; so, for our present purposes, it suffices to estimate a simple

partial—adjustment regression of I on time, the lagged dependent variable,

and a 12 month distributed lag on         as our indicator of aggregate demand

shocks. Since I is the ratio of beginning inventories to last month's

sales, the current money shock g occurs too late to affect its value. This

regression is reported in Table 5.

     Although the equation is a simple one, it in fact explains the behavior

of the inventory—sales ratio well. The coefficient on I indicates that 9

percent of cyclical inventories are eliminated per month; this corresponds to

25 percent in three months, 44 percent in six months, and 68 percent in a

year's time. The long—run effect of the time trend term is only 0.0004 per

annum.4' The distributed lag on       indicates that positive money shocks

significantly decrease inventories from the first through seventh month. The

gradual build up of production relative to final sales is consistent with

shock—absorber money demand and costs of changing production levels.42

                               IV. Conclusions
    This paper has demonstrated that the fraction 4,      of the labor force

becoming unemployed in a month and the probability   it   of leaving unemployment

over a month are useful con8tructs for understanding how the unemployment rate

fluctuates around its normal level. Furthermore, these variables have

empirical counterparts which we can readily calculate from the aggregate data

on numbers and duration of unemployment.

     In addition, we have shown that significant heterogeneity across

individuals in it implies a much slower convergence of u toward u than

would be hypothesized from current or normal values of     ii. We demonstrate

that this heterogeneity is quite substantial in the aggregate data.

     The hypotheses supported by our initial exploration of these new data can

be summarized by means of Figure 6. In this figure we distinguish between two

groups: the first is characterized by high. values of         and ir compared

to the second group. Money shocks do not directly affect the proximate

contemporaneous determinants (irk and        of each group's cyclical unem-

ployment rate       but do so indirectly through cyclical inventories I. A

restrictive monetary policy causes I to gradually build up. High I values

may depress the ltj directly, but their main effect seems to be on the

cyclical search rates        and $.   High values of the        (and perhaps

negative irk) build up        and especially u2 for a period of some months.

Then as the effect of the money shock on inventories is attentuated, u1

quickly returns to normal (u1 goes to 0). But the low turnover group is

characterized by a very low normal probability i2 and this value governs

the speed of adjustment of       (and eventually j) toward 0.

     Indeed, it appears that in normal times the bulk of unemployment is

comprised of group 1 individuals. Major recessions have the effect of

diseniploylag very large numbers of group 2 individuals who otherwise have

nearly permanent jobs. Their lengthy process of search for a new permanent

job appears to dominate the recovery period and explain substantial persis-

tence in unemployment. It is not that any individual is taking unusually long

to find a job; it is simply unusual to have so many slow searchers unemployed

at once.

     To return to Figure 6, we note that given exogenous labor force shares

and growth rates, we can infer the aggregate values of $, tr,    and u from

the corresponding values for each group. At present, we are constrained to

work with these aggregate data and infer compositional effects thorough

proxies and other indirect evidence. Our first task for future research will

be to develop new measures and evidence to permit us to observe more directly

the nature of labor—force heterogeneity and its influence on unemployment rate

dynamics.

      For now we conclude that the observed persistence iii unemployment appears

to be consistent with equilibrium models and rational expectations since we

are unable to detect any effect of lagged ——    or even current —   money shocks

on   it.   Inventories appear to be the key channel transmitting the effects of

money shocks to the proximate determinants of unemployment.

     The potential calendar bias in                   it        is associated with our estimate of

s_i which is supposed to be the number unemployed exactly one standard month

ago (4.35 weeks). However, in months in which there are 4(5) weeks between

surveys our estimates of s_] is actually the number unemployed 4(5) weeks

ago. Denote u_1, u41, and U51 as the unemployment rate 4.35, 4, and 5

Note first that there is no calendar bias in the stationary state. Moreover,

if as we believe is generally the case that (1—it) is approximately 0.5 and

either ((u_1/u) — 1)               or ((u_1/u1) — 1)                   is less than 0.04 in absolute

value then we can conclude that the calendar bias is negligible in

ntagnitude.43




          increase of 1 percent (.01) per day translates into a 30 percent
increase in the unemployment rate over a month. This would be 1.5 percentage
points on a base of 5 percentage points.

                      CALCULATIONS OF HETEROGENEITY STATISTICS



       We measure heterogeneity across individual              -values by h, the amount

by which the unemployment duration d of those currently unemployed since

last month exceeds 1 month plus the average unemployment duration of all

persons last month (cLi). This h, which is 0 if all it1 values are

equal, has a statistical interpretation in terms of the covariance between

duration and changes In shares by duration which can be useful for certain

problems.44 However, we need not be concerned with that interpretation to

understand the derivation of Table 2 in the text.

       The table is derived by considering the steady—state solution to the two

group heterogeneity model of Section LB. Define 01               and 02 to be the

continuous time equivalents of           and             respectively. Hence
                                                    2'
                                   —                        and 02 we can write
—log(l )        and   2 = —log(1       it2). Given
as:


(Bi)
                      —
                      1=   (l/12)(1/1)
                              —— —
                                           + 21'02)
                                                —
                            (f1/f2)101 +   1/02


which In turn allows us to write (f1/f2) as:




       44lndeed, it can be shown that
                     h =   d—
                              d_1
                                  — 1 = in
                                                cov(d1,_1,Aa)
where d_1 refers to one of the in durations observed last month and
refers to (a) the ratio of people with duration dj_1 + 1 this month to
total people with duration of one month or over minus (b) the ratio of
number unemployed last month with duration d1 —1 to the total unemployed
last month.
                                                             51




                                               o2—
(B2)                                            -u —
                                               02


Hence, (B2) defines the steady state ratio of inflows f11'f2 that is

consistent with given values of '                                  and it.

       Define            and a2       to   be the steady state average duration of group 1

and 2 respectfully. Then                        =            and d2 = 1/02•       Also, since all
                                                    1/01
individuals within each group are assumed to be homogeneous then                               =

+ 1 and d =         d    + 1. Define a as the steady state share of unemployed

from group 1. Then:


                             —1   ________________
(B3)                         a       —     —    —   —

                                  (f1/f2)/81              + 1/02


and a2      1. —   a1.       This allows us to write d as:


                                                                             +   (1/02)
                                  1 1               2 2       1/f2)/(01)
(B4)                         dad +ad
                                                            (?1a2)/ 81       + 1/82

Given (B2) and the definitions of °1 and 02 (B4) allows us to compute the

steady state value of d associated with any combination of                                '         and   it.



       In a similar fashion we can define a1 and                                 as the share of last

period's unemployed from groups 1 and 2 respectively. This, in turn, allows

us to write d as:

(B5)               d              + ad


                             [(1 +                  -                        ÷ [(1 + 02)(l -
                         =                               1)(f11f2)/(01)21
                                           [(1       —                       +
                                                          1)(f1/f2) /]           [(1
                                           52




Since     a   —   — 1,     using (B2), (B4) and (B5) we can calculate (f1/f2)

and h for any given combination of irk, 2' and i.         In   Table 2 we use the

estimated value of   ii   = 0.45674 and (f1/f2) and i are calculated in this

manner for the values of         and 112    as given.
