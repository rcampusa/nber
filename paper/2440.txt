    Changes in the Cyclical Behavior of Individual Production Series




                                   ABSTRACT



      This paper uses simple time series techniques to analyze changes in

the short-run behavior of 38 physical production series for 1889-1984.

The main finding is that fluctuations in these output series in the periods

1889-1914 and 1947-1984 are very similar, while those in the period 1922-

1939 are anomalous. Relative to the prewar era, the postwar era exhibits

only a slight damping of fluctuations and no increase in the persistence of

short-run movements. At the same time, the correlation between the growth

rates of the 38 goods is very low in both the prewar and postwar eras and

has declined slightly over time.

INTRODUCTION

      Burns and Mitchell's study Measuring Business Cycles (1947) is

considered by many to be the pioneering study in the identification and

measurement of economic fluctuations. Among the most outstanding and least

controversial attributes of this work is its use of disaggregate data in

the analysis of short-run movements in economic activity. In their

analysis, Burns and Mitchell examine the short-run behavior of over 200

production series as well as a plethora of other disaggregate economic

indicators. This detailed analysis of individual series allows them to

both examine common elements in the behavior of all series and to pinpoint

important differences in the behavior of series representing different

sectors of the economy.

       Though widely praised, the use of disaggregate data has been largely

abandoned by modern macroeconomists. Aggregate measures such as real CNP

or the index of industrial production are typically used in place of

individual output series in the analysis of short-run fluctuations. While

this reliance on aggregate data is characteristic of most empirical work on

business cycles, it is especially prevalent in studies of changes in

cyclical behavior over long time periods. Of the several studies in recent

years that have analyzed changes in the nature of economic fluctuations

between the prewar and postwar eras, nearly all of them have relied

exclusively on aggregate measures of production (see, for example, Baily

 (1978), DeLong and Summers (1986), Taylor (1986), and Zarnowitz and Moore

 (1986)).

       This paper breaks with current practice and revives the use of

disaggregate production data in macroeconomic analysis. It examines the
                                       2

 short-run behavior of 38 individual production series for 1889-1984. The

 series analyzed all measure the physical production of a particular good

 and appear to be consistent from the earliest years to the present. The

 data set covers a wide variety of commodities and is equally divided among

 manufactured goods, the output of mines and refineries, and raw

 agricultural products.

       The main focus of the analysis is on possible changes in the cyclical

 behavior of production. Two of the most important changes that are

 examined concern the volatility and persistence of short-run movements in

 real output. The disaggregate data are used to analyze whether short-run

 fluctuations have become less extreme or erratic over time and whether

the tendency of shocks to have permanent or transitory effects has changed

between the prewar and postwar eras.

      Using good disaggregate data to analyze these possible changes is

crucially important because traditional aggregate measures of production

are not consistent over time. Romer (l986a and l986b) shows that prewar

estimates of GNP and industrial production exaggerate the size of short-run

fluctuations. As a result, using such measures may lead one to mistake

changes in the quality of the data for genuine changes in cyclical

behavior. In contrast, the individual production series appear to be very

consistent over time. Hence, they may provide an alternative way of

assessing whether the volatility and persistence of fluctuations have

changed between the prewar and postwar eras.

      An additional change in cyclical behavior that is examined in the

paper concerns the correlation of short-term changes across sectors. Does

the production of various goods move together and have there been changes

in the size and sign of the correlations over time? This is obviously a
                                      3


change that can only be analyzed using disaggregate data.

      Though the paper focuses on changes in the volatility, persistence,

and correlation of short-run fluctuations in the individual production

series, an important byproduct of the analysis is a description of the

short-run behavior of these series within various eras.     This is useful

because there has been so little analysis of the behavior of disaggregate

production series even within the postwar era. As a result, the analysis

is able to provide new evidence on such topics as the relative importance

of aggregate and industry-specific shocks in causing fluctuations in the

output of individual goods, and the degree to which such fluctuations are

permanent or transitory within a given period.

      While the data used in the paper are similar to those used by Burns

and Mitchell, the techniques used to identify changes in cyclical behavior

are quite different. Burns and Mitchell use measures such as the mean

cyclical amplitude and the length of cycles to identify changes in the

 short-run behavior of output. In contrast, I use simple time series

 analysis of the standard deviations, autocorrelations, and cross-

 correlations of the first differences of individual production series to

 identify possible changes in short-run fluctuations.

       The data set and the time series framework used to analyze changes in

 the short-run behavior of output are discussed in Sections I and II. The

 findings concerning changes in the volatility, serial correlation, and

 cross-correlation of the 38 production series are analyzed in Sections III,

 IV, and V, respectively. The importance and implications of the changes

 identified are discussed in the conclusion.

I.    DATA

      Because much of what is unique about the analysis of cyclical changes

presented in this paper stems from the use of good disaggregate production

data, it is crucial to discuss the data set thoroughly. The data set

consists of 38 individual production series that span the entire period

1889-1984. Most of the series reflect the physical production of

individual goods such as raw steel, pig iron, coal, corn, and wheat. A few

of the series, such as cotton consumed and silk imported, reflect the

consumption of raw materials in the production of manufactured goods.

      As the above examples indicate, the 38 series included in the data

set cover a wide range of goods. Approximately one-third are conventional

manufactured goods. Another third are the products of mines and

refineries. Some of these goods are quite processed (such as pig iron and

coke) and are conventionally included in indexes of industrial production.

The remaining third are agricultural products.

      With two exceptions (pig iron and cotton consumed) the individual

production data are available through 1970 in Historical Statistics of the

United States (1975). My contribution has been to sift through the

hundreds of production series given in this volume to determine which ones

are reasonably accurate and consistent over time. The series that appeared

to be consistent were then checked more thoroughly and revised when

necessary. They were then extended through 1984 on the basis of more

recent primary and secondary publications.

      Three criteria were used to choose the series to be included in the

data set. The first criterion was that the series represent the physical

production of a mineral, agricultural, or manufactured good. That is, the

series should represent such things as the tons of steel or the bushels of
                                      5


corn produced, rather than the value of this production. This requirement

was designed to eliminate the measurement error that might result from

trying to convert a nominal series into a real series. The second

criterion was that the series exist back to at least 1889 and still be

available today from standard reference publications.   The desire for long

                                                           and eliminated at
time series was obviously a very restrictive requirement

least half of the physical production series in Historical Statistics.

      The third and most fundamental criterion was that the series be

reasonably consistent over time. To establish consistency I looked for

several characteristics in the data. One was that the production estimates

were and still are based on contemporaneous annual censuses or surveys of

producers. This requirement was designed to eliminate those prewar series

that have been constructed in the postwar era using data that is much less

complete than those underlying modern estimates.   Another characteristic

that I looked for was that the definition of the good being measured was

the same over time. This requirement made sure that a series did not, for

example, cover shipments in one period and production in another or include

 some by-products in one period and exclude them in another.

       The application of the consistency criterion eliminated many series

 from Historical Statistics. For example, the commonly used wheat flour

 series was not used because early estimates are simply interpolated by

 population rather than derived from actual survey data.   In some cases it

 was possible to improve faulty series given in Historical Statistics rather

 than to eliminate them altogether. For example, while the pig iron series

 given in Historical Statistics uses shipments and production data

 interchangeably, the source publications from the American Iron and Steel

 Institute can be used to form a series that consistently represents
                                             6

  production.

          A complete listing of the 38 series that were eventually chosen is

  given in Table Al of the data appendix. The
                                                    appendix also discusses the
  sources of the data and any changes that were made to the series given in

  Historical Statistics to improve consistency.



  II. FRAMEWORK OF ANALYSIS

          In order to examine changes in
                                           cyclical behavior, it is useful to
 describe the individual production series
                                                 as following a very general
 time series process. This time series process provides a framework for

 motivating and interpreting various measures of the nature of short-run

 fluctuations in the individual series in different time periods.

          Model. The logarithm of each series can be described as following an

 integrated moving average process with drift.       That is,



                     (1)            = B. +

                                u. = A(L)e.t,
where AJL) is a polynomial in the lag operator and
                                                                is white noise.
This representation
                       says that the first differences of the logarithms of
each production series           are   equal to a series specific mean (B.) plus
a random disturbance (u.). The random term of each series may be serially

correlated which is represented by the size and sign of the coefficients

A.(L).

         This description of the data is particularly useful because it allows

one to remain agnostic about whether there is indeed a deterministic trend

to which the individual production
                                       series revert. For the model given in
                                      7

                                                           combination of the
equation (1) sufficiently large negative values for some

coefficients of A.(L) would suggest that the series does tend to- revert to

a trend growth path when it is shocked away. Coefficients that are small

or positive indicate that shocks have permanent effects.

      Given this framework for describing the individual production series,

it is clear that simple statistical measures can be used to describe the

nature of economic fluctuations. First, an obvious measure of the

volatility of each series is the standard deviation of the random

component, u. This measure shows the dispersion of the first differences

of a production series around the mean growth rate. Second, the

autocorrelations of the u.fl's provide a convenient way of assessing the

persistence of short-run fluctuations. Cochrane (1986) and Campbell and

Mankiw (1987a,b,c) show that a weighted average of the first several sample

autocorrelations can be used to indicate if movements in production are

primarily transitory or permanent. Finally, the cross-correlations of the

u.fl's provide a way of evaluating the interactions between the individual

production series.

      Sample Periods. These statistical measures describe the nature of

cycles over whatever sample of data is used in the calculation. By

dividing the last century into subperiods and estimating the standard

deviations, autocorrelations, and cross-correlations for each series for

each period, one can analyze whether the nature of short-run movements in

output has changed over time. The particular subperiods chosen for

comparison are 1889-1914, 1922-1939, and 1947-1984. In what follows these

periods are referred to as the prewar, interwar, and postwar eras,

respectively.

      While these periods are reasonably standard (they are, for example,
                                       8

 similar to those used in Taylor (1986) and Schultze (1986)), it is useful

 to explain why they were chosen. First, the prewar sample does not begin

 until 1889 because of data limitations. While many of the important series

 exist back to 1869, several interesting series such as refined sugar,

 canned vegetables, cement, and refined lead are not available on a

 consistent basis until 1889. Second, the two World Wars and the immediate

 postwar depressions are excluded because it is likely that wartime

 expansion and the subsequent demobilization do not provide a useful

 indication of the typical short-run behavior of the macroeconomy.

       Finally, the period before World War I is evaluated separately from

 the period between World War I and World War II because it is not at all

 clear whether the interwar period should be grouped with the prewar era or

with the postwar era. For example, if one is interested in comparing a

period before activist government intervention and with one after

intervention, the correct break is arguably World War 1.1 A further

reason for evaluating the interwar period separately is to see whether the

behavior of the economy in this era is fundamentally different from that in

other periods. This analysis may provide evidence about whether the Great

Depression was a unique event or merely a more extreme version of earlier

economic downturns.



III. VOLATILITY

      Of all the changes in short-run behavior that may have occurred over

time, the one that has received the most attention is the possible decline

in the volatility of the economy. This possible stabilization of the

postwar economy is of tremendous interest because it is perceived as being

the likely effect of activist government stabilization
                                                         policy. Therefore,
                                      9

it is very useful to see what the sample of 38 consistent production series

shows about changes in volatility between the prewar and postwar eras.

      As discussed in Section II, a simple measure of the volatility of

each production series in the various time periods is the square root of

the variance of log first differences. In terms of the time series process

described in (1), this is simply


                              .JVar(u.).


This measure shows the dispersion of the first differences of a production

series around the mean growth rate. Since each series has been expressed

in logarithms, this measure is essentially the same as the simple standard

deviation of percentage changes. If this standard deviation is large, then

either the deviations from trend of a series with a trend are large or the

shocks to a series without a trend are large. Both of these conditions

correspond to what economists mean when they describe a series as volatile.

      Changes in Volatility. When this measure is calculated for each

series in each period, the main finding is that the volatility of the

series in the prewar and postwar eras is quite similar. This can be seen

in Table 1, which reports the standard deviations of each series in each

sample period. A more convenient way to examine how much stabilization has

occurred in each series is to examine the ratio of the prewar standard

deviation to the postwar standard deviation. Figure 1 shows histograms of

the prewar to postwar stabilization ratios for agricultural goods, mineral

products, manufactured commodities, and all 38 goods, respectively.

      The most obvious feature evident from the histograms is that the

stabilization ratios for nearly all of the goods are surprisingly close to

1.0. For the total sample, over 85% of the goods had ratios lower than
                                      10

1.75 and over half had ratios lower than 1.25. The median stabilization

ratio is 1.11 and the mean stabilization ratio is 1.24.2 Of the four goods

that show stabilization ratios over 2.0, three are the reasonably minor

commodities of cigarettes, Irish potatoes, and hay. The only major

commodity that shows an obvious stabilization is crude petroleum.

      The histograms for the commodities broken down by sector reveal some

interesting differences in the amount of stabilization shown by goods in

each sector. Agricultural goods show by far the least stabilization.

Eighty percent of these goods have stabilization ratios less than 1.25 and

over 30 percent of the goods have ratios substantially below 1.0,

indicating destabilization. This absence of stabilization in agriculture

is particularly surprising given the technological advances of the modern

era, such as pesticides and widespread irrigation, which one would have

expected to counteract some of the destabilizing shocks to farm production.

      The stabilization ratios for mineral products are distributed fairly

evenly over the range .25 to 1.75. This indicates that there is a

substantial amount of variation in the behavior of the output of mines;

indeed, about as many mineral products have become less volatile as have

become more volatile. Finally, for manufacturing, the stabilization ratios

are clustered in the range 1.25 to 1.75. This indicates that a majority of

manufactured goods have shown a small decline in volatility over time.

However, it is useful to note that 40 percent of manufactured goods have

stabilization ratios below 1.25.

      Despite this variation across commodities, the main finding of the

analysis is that most of the 38 commodities in the sample have

stabilization ratios between .75 and 1.25. More importantly, nearly all of

the major goods included in the sample show stabilization ratios in this
                                     11

range. This can be seen if one examines the stabilization ratios for six

goods that would commonly be considered among the most important goods

produced in the United States: corn, wheat, bituminous coal, pig iron,

cotton textiles, and raw steel.3 Of these six goods, only pig iron and

steel production show even a slight stabilization. All of the rest have

ratios that are indistinguishable from 1.0. This indicates that there has

been very little change in volatility between the prewar and postwar eras.

      While the similarity of the standard deviations of each series in the

prewar and postwar eras is one obvious feature of the data, an equally

obvious characteristic is that the standard deviation of each series is

substantially higher in the interwar period than in either of the other

eras. Using the data in Table 1, the interwar standard deviations are

typically 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times as large as the standard deviations of the

prewar or postwar eras. This indicates that economic activity was

significantly more volatile in the l920s and 1930s than in the several

decades on either side of this period.

      Comparison to Aggregate Findings. To put the changes in volatility

shown by the individual production series into perspective, it is useful to

compare the preceding results with those for various aggregate indicators

of production. The standard deviations of the percentage changes for

various aggregate series in different time periods are given in Table 2a.

The resulting prewar to postwar stabilization ratios indicate that the

traditional estimates of both GNP and industrial production (IP) show a

substantial damping of cyclical fluctuations over time. However, as

discussed previously, Romer (l986a and 1986b) demonstrates that the

traditional prewar measures of CNP and industrial production overstate the

size of short-term fluctuations and hence exaggerate the amount of
                                      12

 stabilization that has occurred over time. These studies find that when

consistent estimates are analyzed, the ratio of prewar to postwar standard

deviation is approximately 1.3 for both GNP and industrial production.

      The amount of stabilization shown by the individual production series

is much more similar to that shown by the consistent aggregate series than

to that shown by traditional measures of GNP and industrial production.

Indeed, the amount of stabilization shown by the traditional aggregate

series is substantially larger than that shown by over 90 percent of the

individual production series examined in this paper.4 On the other hand,

the stabilization ratios of the consistent aggregate series are roughly

equal to those of the majority of individual commodities.

      It is important to note that the similarity in the volatility of the

individual production series and the consistent aggregate series genuinely

provides new information on stabilization and is in no way present by

construction. For industrial production, the consistent series is formed

by continuing a prewar index of manufacturing production, which is based

almost exclusively on data on inputs, with the postwar Federal Reserve

Board (FRB) index of materials production. Because the FRB index contains

data on many goods not present in the prewar era, a comparison of this

series with the available prewar series only provides information on

changes in the general behavior of materials. It does not do what this

study does, which is to see if particular goods or even a particular basket

of goods has stabilized over time. Furthermore, while both the prewar and

postwar indexes of materials production includes some of the 13

manufactured goods analyzed in this paper (such as refined iigar and pig

iron), they obviously do not include any agricultural goods and very few

mineral products. Hence, the analysis of the agricultural and mineral
                                     13

products included in this paper provides completely new information on how

much stabilization has occurred over time.

      For CNP, the consistent series is formed by extrapolating modern GNP

estimates back to the prewar era using available prewar estimates of

commodity output.5 While the data on commodity output does include

agricultural and mineral products, these data cover goods that are

typically much more processed than those included in the sample analyzed in

this paper and are derived from nominal value series that are then deflated

rather than from physical production data. As a result, the data set

analyzed in this paper and that used in deriving consistent estimates of

GNP are very different and thus provide independent estimates of the amount

of stabilization that has occurred over time.

      Possible Biases. While the behavior of the individual production

series certainly appears to confirm the finding that there has been little

damping of business cycles over time when consistent data are compared, one

might worry that the analysis of individual production series is biased

toward finding little stabilization. First, because of the necessity of

including only those goods for which data exist for at least 95 years, the

disaggregate data set tends to include many industries that have changed

from high growth to low growth industries between the prewar and postwar

eras. If such industries tend to become more volatile as they decline,

this could explain why the disaggregate production series have not

stabilized over time.

      To see if this bias in the sample of individual production series is

an important source of the lack of stabilization in these series, it is

useful to exploit the cross-sectional nature of the data set. Since the

sample includes a fair number of goods that have continued to expand over
                                         14

 time as well as the many that have declined, it is possible to test

 explicitly whether the degree of stabilization shown by various series is

 systematically related to the pattern of growth in those industries. To do

 this one can examine the correlation between the stabilization ratios for

 each series and the change in the mean growth rate of each series between

 the prewar and postwar eras. A negative correlation would indicate that

 those industries that have not stabilized are precisely those industries

 that have shown a large decline in the rate of expansion.

         The relevant correlation coefficients by sector are - . 17 for

agriculture, .42 for minerals, and .06 for manufacturing.6 As can be seen,

only agriculture shows the suspected negative relationship and the

correlation coefficient is very small. Both manufacturing and mining show

a positive correlation between the stabilization ratios and the change in

the growth rates of the various commodities. This suggests that for these

sectors, goods that move from a phase of high growth in the prewar era to

low or negative growth in the postwar era are more likely to show

stabilization than those industries that have not declined. This somewhat

anomalous finding actually makes sense when one considers how volatile an

industry may be in the very early phases of development. If there is

lumpiness in investment, the production of a good may grow very little for

several years and then grow tremendously in the year that a new plant

opens.

         Overall, the low and positive correlation coefficients suggest that

for the economy as a whole there is not a consistent relationship between

the degree of stabilization shown by a commodity and the change in the

average growth rate of the commodity between the prewar and postwar eras.

This indicates that the overrepresentation of declining industries in the
                                       15

sample of 38 individual production series cannot account for the lack of

stabilization shown by these series.

      Another feature of the data that one might fear could bias the

results is that the postwar sample period is 12 years longer than the

prewar sample period. If one believes that the mean growth rate of a

series is more likely to change over a longer sample period, then it is

possible that the standard deviation around a constant mean may overstate

the volatility of the postwar era relative to the prewar era. The reason

for this is that a larger fraction of the deviations around the mean may be

due to changes in the drift term rather than to changes in the variance of

the disturbance ternis in the postwar era than in the shorter prewar era.

      Two pieces of evidence suggest that this possible bias is not

significant. First, since several of the individual series exist back to

1869, it is possible to compare prewar and postwar eras that are of more

equal length. When this is done, the ratio of prewar to postwar standard

deviations are very similar to those reported in Table       Second, one can

also break the postwar sample into two equal periods and see if the mean

growth rates of the individual series have changed between the first and

second halves of the postwar era. The result of this test is that the mean

growth rates have often changed by 1 or 2 percentage points between the

early and late postwar eras. However, the standard deviations around the

two different means are very similar in both periods and are consistently

10 to 15 times as large as the change in the mean growth rate. As a

result, the standard deviation around a single mean in the postwar era is

indistinguishable from that around two different means corresponding to the

first and second halves of the period.

 IV.     PERSISTENCE

          While a decline in the volatility of production has been the most

 widely analyzed change in short-run economic activity, there are many other

 changes that can and should be analyzed using disaggregate production data.

 One of these deals with the persistence of short-term fluctuations. It is

 useful to know if movements in real output tend to be permanent or

 transitory and if the persistence of shocks has changed over time. This

 information is crucial for determining whether there is a business cycle

 around a deterministic trend in either the prewar or postwar eras. This

 fact in turn is important for determining the nature of shocks and the

 appropriate model of short-term fluctuations in the prewar and postwar

 eras.

         Measure of Persistence. To analyze whether shocks to the production

of individual commodities have permanent or transitory effects, it is

necessary to derive a measure of persistence. To do this it is useful to

consider the simple time series representation of each series given in

equation (1). Recall that the growth rate of series i can be represented

as a moving average with drift. That is



                                    —    + A.,(L)e.


where B. is the industry-specific mean growth rate and             1 +         +
                                                           A(L)          A1L
A. L2 +
 i2
          ... + A.inLn.   From this representation it is clear that the sum    of
the coefficients of A.(L) (represented by A(l)) indicates whether a shock

to the growth rate is counteracted or not in subsequent periods. If A(l)

  0, then a shock to the growth rate is completely undone in later periods.

As a result, the level of output returns to its trend growth path and is
                                          17

not permanently changed.8 On the other hand, if A.(l) > 0, then a shock to

the growth rate is not completely undone and hence the level of output is
                                                              eventually return to
permanently altered (even though the growth rate may

its average level.) In the extreme case that the growth rate of output is

white noise (which corresponds to the level of output following a random

walk)    A.(l)   1.

         From this description, it is clear that an estimate of A(l) provides

an obvious measure of the persistence of short-run movements in the

production of individual commodities. In the recent literature on

persistence, a way of estimating A.(l) that does not require specifying and

estimating a particular ARMA model for each series has been developed by

Cochrane (1986) and Campbell and Mankiw (l987a,b,c).              Cochrane suggests

that the two-sided infinite sum of the autocorrelationS of a series (in log

first differences) provides one indicator of persistence.              If the series

reverts to a deterministic trend, this sum (denoted as V.) is 0; if the

 series is a random walk, this sum is 1.        Cochrane shows that a consistent

 estimate of this two-sided infinite sum of autocorrelations is

                                          k               A

                      (2)    V. = 1 + 2   E (1 -
                                                              -
                                          j=1       k+l

 where       is the th sample autocorrelation of the first differences of

 series i, and k is large relative to the sample size.

         Campbell and Mankiw show that because there is a one-to-one

 relationship between the coefficients of the moving average representation

 of a series and the autocorrelations, there is also a unique relationship

 between Cochrane's V. and A.(l). In particular,


                       (3)    A.(1) =      ______
                                          18

  where      is the fraction of the variance of a series that is predictable

  from a knowledge of the past history of the process. Given this

  relationship, Campbell and Mankiw suggest that a nonparametric estimate of

 A.(l)
  1    can be calculated as
                                              /   A
                              A           / V.1
                      (4)     A.(1) =
                                  1
                                         /
                                          /           A2
                                        v (1      -
                                                      p11)
 where the square of the first sample autocorrelation of the series is used

 as a conservative estimate of R.

          In applying this nonparametrjc approach I use k            7 as the number of

 sample autocorrelations to include in the estimate of V.. This level of k

 relative to the size of the various sample periods is approximately the

 level the Campbell and Mankiw (1987a and l987c) suggest is necessary to

 distinguish between a deterministic and a non-deterministic process in

 Monte Carlo simulations. More intuitively, k                7 should satisfy the

 requirement that k be fairly large in order to capture any reversion to

 trend that occurs only after a fairly long lag. At the same time, k =
                                                                       7 is

 still small relative to the sample size of 25 observations in the
                                                                   prewar
 era and 37 in the postwar

 era. Hence, it should not introduce the downward bias in A1(l) that

results when k is very large relative
                                         to the sample size (see Campbell and
Mankiw, l987a).

      Changes in Persistence. The nonparametric estimates of A1(1) are

given in Table 3. The first characteristic to note about these estimates

is that they indicate that for most goods there has been no change in the

persistence of short-term fluctuations between the
                                                              prewar and postwar eras.
A simple indicator of this fact is that
                                          the average A.(l) is .68 in the
prewar era and .70 in the postwar era. A comparison of the estimates for
                                     19

each good in the prewar and postwar eras shows that this similarity in the

means is due to similarity in the results for individual goods, not to

offsetting movements among different commodities.

      The similarity in the amount of persistence shown by these individual

commodities between the prewar and postwar eras suggests that the notions

of cyclical fluctuations and deviations from trend are as appropriate or

inappropriate for the prewar era as they are for the postwar era. More

fundamentally, it suggests that the many changes that have occurred in the

behavior and structure of the economy over time, have not altered the way

that the production of these individual goods responds to shocks.

      While the degree of persistence shown by individual commodities is

very similar in the prewar and postwar eras, the level of persistence is

noticeably higher in the interwar era. The average A(l) is .76 in the

1920s and 1930s. Furthermore, the increase in persistence in the interwar

era is probably larger than that suggested by the estimates of A(l)

because for the interwar era, k — 7 may be fairly large relative to the

sample size of 17. As a result, A(l) may be biased downward in a way that

is not true in the longer prewar and postwar eras.

      This increase in the persistence of short-term movements for the

individual production series in the l920s and 1930s is in complete accord

with common perceptions of the interwar period. If there ever was a time

when shocks to output are thought to have had very persistent effects it

was during the boom of the l920s and the Great Depression of the l930s.

The increased persistence of short-run movements in the interwar era is

also further evidence that this period is anomalous. Whereas the prewar

and postwar eras show basically the same degree of volatility and the same

tendency to revert to trend, the interwar era shows much greater volatility
                                       20

 and much less tendency to revert to trend. This suggests that short-run

 fluctuations in the period between the wars should be viewed as a different

 phenomenon from those on either side of this era.

       Level of Persistence. While changes in persistence over time is

 obviously an important topic, an equally important topic is the absolute

 level of persistence in both the prewar and postwar eras. Do the estimates

 of A.(l) suggest that fluctuations in the production of the individual

 commodities analyzed in this paper were and still are mainly transitory or

 mainly permanent?

       To answer this question, it is first useful to note that there is a

 substantial difference in the level of persistence shown by agricultural

 and nonagricultural goods. The average A(l) is roughly .50 for

agricultural goods in both the prewar and postwar eras and .75 for

nonagricultural goods. This indicates that movements in the production of

agricultural goods are substantially less persistent than those in the

production of nonagricultural goods.

      The average level of the estimates of A.(l) suggest that at least

half of the effect of a shock to agricultural production is undone in

subsequent years. This suggests that a large fraction of the short-run

movements in the production of farm commodities is transitory. At the same

time, there is clearly a permanent component as well; shocks to

agricultural production have at least a small effect on the long-run level

of production.

      For mining and manufactured goods, the permanent effect of a shock is

larger than that for agricultural goods. The estimates of
                                                            A(l) indicate
that approximately 75 percent of a shock remains after several years.

While this indicates a substantial amount of persistence, it is important
                                       21

to note that this is less persistence than one would find if the production

of these goods actually followed a random walk.

      It is also likely that the nonparametric estimate of A(l)

overestimates the persistence of short run movements in production.

Including only seven lagged autocorrelations means that the measure will

miss any trend reversion that occurs after seven years. Because of this

possible upward bias on A(l) it is reasonable to conclude that slightly

less than half of the effect of a shock to the production of mineral and

manufactured goods is transitory and slightly more than half of the effect

is permanent in both the prewar and postwar eras.

      This finding that individual production series show at least some

trend reversion in both the prewar and postwar eras takes on added

importance when one considers the correlation between goods.   I show in

Section V below that movements in different production series in the prewar

and postwar eras are largely uncorrelated and thus that movements in

individual series are primarily the result of industry-specific shocks.

This finding combined with the results concerning trend-reversion suggests

that industry-specific shocks are at least partly transitory in both the

prewar and postwar eras. This in turn may suggest that either industry-

 specific supply shocks are partly transitory or that there exist transitory

 industry-specific shocks to demand.

       The presence of transitory industry-specific supply shocks may also

 explain why agricultural production is less persistent than nonagricultural

 production. In addition to the many productivity and demand shocks

 affecting other commodities, agricultural goods are also buffeted by

 frequent changes in weather and disease. Since these additional shocks are

 likely to be transitory, a larger fraction of shocks hitting the
                                         22

  agricultural sector is also likely to be transitory. Hence, it is not

  surprising that short-run movements in agricultural production tend to be

  less persistent than those in other sectors.

       cQiiiparison to Aggregate Indicators. As was the case with the

 volatility properties, it is interesting to compare the change in the

 persistence characteristics of the consistent disaggregate data with that

 for both traditional and improved
                                     measures of aggregate production. The
 nonparametric estimates of A.(l) for the various aggregate series in

 different time periods are given in Table 2b.     The first thing that one
 notices from Table 2b is that the traditional and consistent aggregate

 series yield very similar estimates of persistence. This similarity makes

 sense because while prewar movements are exaggerated in the traditional

 series, there is no reason to suspect that this
                                                   exaggeration should affect
 the timing of short-run fluctuations.

       While the traditional and consistent estimates of GNP and industrial

 production tell a story similar to each other, they tell a story that is

slightly different from that of the individual production series. In

particular, the aggregate series show slightly more change in persistence

between the prewar and postwar eras than do most of the good individual

production series. This is especially true of GNP which shows an increase

in the estimate of persistence of 20 percent.

      In addition to showing a noticeable increase in persistence between

the prewar and postwar
                         eras, all of the aggregate series show a substantial
increase in persistence in the interwar era. As can be seen from Table 2b,

this change is more extreme for GNP than for industrial production. In

this characteristic the aggregate series echo the behavior of the

individual production series which also show an increase in the persistence
                                      23

of short-run movements in the interwar era.

      In terms of the actual level of persistence, industrial production

shows slightly less persistence than do the individual series on average in

the prewar era and about the same amount as the individual series in the

postwar era. GNP shows about the same level of persistence as do the

individual series in the prewar era and somewhat more persistence in the

postwar era. In general, the measures of persistence for the aggregate

series indicate that some of the effect of a shock is permanent and some of

the effect of a shock is transitory and that the permanent component has

been rising over time. However, the estimates of A.(l) do not indicate

that movements in GNP or industrial production are completely permanent,

even in the postwar era.



V. THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG GOODS

      A final change in cyclical behavior that can be examined using good

disaggregate production data concerns the correlation between goods. It is

important to discover if short-run movements in various goods are highly

correlated as traditional business-cycle theory would suggest and whether

 the relationships among goods have changed over time. This analysis is

useful in identifying what type of models are appropriate for analyzing

 short-run fluctuations in production in both periods. It is also important

 for evaluating whether the volatility and persistence characteristics of

 the individual production series provide information about aggregate

 stabilization and trend reversion.

       To examine changes in the relationships between the 38 individual

production series, it is useful to examine the cross-correlations of the

percentage changes of each series with those of each of the other series.
                                             24

 In terms of the simple time series model given in (1), the measure

 calculated is simply


                                Cov(u., uj)
                                    aU.aU.
                                      13
where    a
          U.
             1                                           it
                 indicates the standard deviation of the u. 's. These cross-

 correlations      can be calculated for the prewar, interwar, and postwar sample

periods to see if the size and sign of the correlations have changed over

 time.

         Because it is difficult to analyze the resulting 38 by 38 matrix of

cross-correlations, Table 4 reports the average pairwise correlation for

each good with all of the other goods in the prewar, interwar, and postwar

eras. These average correlations are calculated separately for

agricultural, mineral, and manufactured goods. This allows one to examine

whether the average correlation of a particular good with agricultural

goods is different from the average correlation of that good with mineral

or manufactured goods.

         Level of Cross-Correlation. Several features of the cross-

correlations are evident from Table 4. The most striking feature of the

average cross-correlations is that they are very low in both the prewar and

postwar eras.9 For most goods the average within-sector and across-sector

correlations are indistinguishable from zero. An analysis of the

individual cross-correlations shows that in nearly all cases these low

average correlations result from low pairwise correlations, not from large

positive and negative correlations cancelling each other out.

         While the average cross-correlations for most goods are very low in

both the prewar and postwar eras, there are exceptions to this pattern.

One of these is that the correlations between major manufactured and
                                     25

mineral goods are typically quite high. This can be seen in Table 5 which

shows the cross-correlations for corn, wheat, coal, pig iron, cotton

consumed, and steel in the prewar, interwar, and postwar eras. Though

wheat and corn are only weakly correlated with each other or with other

goods, the major mineral and manufactured products have cross-correlations

that range between .4 and .9 and average around .7.

      Changes in Cross-Correlation. Though the low level of correlation

shown by most goods is an obvious feature of the estimates, Tables 4 and 5

indicate that there have also been some changes in the pattern of cross-

correlation over time. One such change is that the cross-correlations of

goods within the manufacturing and mining sectors and between goods in

these two sectors are much higher in the interwar era than in either the

prewar or postwar eras. Average pairwise correlations of .6 or .7 are not

unusual even for minor goods in these sectors during the l920s and l930s.

      This pattern, however, does not carry over to agricultural goods.

While agricultural goods are somewhat more correlated with themselves in

the interwar era than in other periods, their correlation with

nonagricultural goods is if anything lower in this period than in the

prewar era. Indeed, beginning in the interwar era, agricultural goods

switch from having a vaguely positive correlation with mineral and

manufactured goods to having a small but decidedly negative correlation

with these products. This change can be seen by the fact that in the

prewar era only 3 of the agricultural goods have an average pairwise

correlation with mining and manufactured goods that is negative, while 8
                                                                              -


agricultural goods have a negative correlation in the interwar era. This

change continues into the postwar era where 10 of the 11 agricultural goods
have a negative average pairwise correlation with nonagricultural goods.
                                      28

correlation between goods and the change in the correlation among goods

between the prewar and postwar eras have implications for the usefulness of

the individual production series for indicating aggregate behavior. First,

the low level of correlation between goods in both the prewar and postwar

eras suggests that the level of volatility and persistence shown by the

individual series does not represent the level of volatility and

persistence in the economy accurately. Because the movements in the

individual series are largely independent, an aggregate series constructed

using these series would certainly be less volatile than the individual

series. Similarly, because aggregate shocks have so little effect on the

behavior of individual commodities, the short-run movements in aggregate

output could be more or less persistent than those in the individual

series. The fact that aggregate series will behave differently from, the

individual series in any given time period is confirmed by Table 2 which

shows that even good aggregate series have standard deviations and sums of

autocorrelations that are quite different from those of the individual

series.

      On the other hand, the fact that the changes that have occurred in

the correlation among goods over time have been fairly small suggests that

the behavior of the individual series does provide a good indication of

changes in volatility and persistence over time. If the relationship

between goods has not changed significantly and if individual goods have

shown little change in volatility or persistence over time, then it is

unlikely that an accurate aggregate indicator could show much change

either. And indeed, consistent aggregate series do not show significant

changes in either volatility or persistence over time.

      The small changes that good aggregate series do show between the
                                      29

prewar and postwar eras can probably be explained by the decline in the

correlation among major commodities and the switch from a small positive

correlation to a small negative correlation shown by agricultural and

nonagricultural goods between the prewar and postwar eras. As discussed in

Section III, most individual commodities show little decline in volatility

between the prewar and postwar eras while consistent estimates of CNP and

industrial production do show a slight stabilization over time. This could

be due to the fact that short-run movements in various goods may be

offsetting each other more in the postwar era than they did in the prewar

era.

       Similarly, as discussed in Section IV, the individual production

series show little change in the persistence of short-run fluctuations

between the prewar and postwar eras, while GNP and industrial production

shows a moderate increase in persistence over time. The changing degree of

correlation between individual commodities may help to explain this

finding. Because goods move together somewhat less in the postwar era, it

is possible that aggregate output may stay away from trend longer in the

postwar era even though the persistence of individual commodities has not

changed.



CONCLUS ION

       To examine changes in the cyclical behavior of production, this study

has eschewed the use of aggregate measures of output. Rather, it has

analyzed the short-run behavior of 38 individual production series that

appear to be consistent over the last century. This analysis indicates

that there has been remarkably little change in the short-run behavior of

these 38 commodities between the prewar and postwar eras.
                                       30

       First, the volatility of short-run movements does not appear to have

 declined noticeably over time. While short-run movements were clearly more

 extreme in the interwar era, the ratio of the prewar to postwar standard

 deviation of percentage changes is on average 1.2 for the 38 individual

 goods. This slight amount of stabilization is somewhat smaller than that

 shown by even consistent estimates of industrial production or CNP.

       Second, there has been little change in the persistence of short-run

 fluctuations in these 38 goods between the prewar and postwar eras. Shocks

 to the output of these goods were approximately half temporary and half

 permanent in both periods. However, shocks were typically much more

 persistent in the interwar era. The persistence properties of the 38 goods

 are roughly similar to those of CNP and industrial production, though both

 aggregate measures show some increase in persistence over time.

      Third, there has been little change in the correlation among

commodities over time. The correlation between the growth rates of the

various goods is very low in both the prewar and postwar eras. It is,

however, somewhat higher in the interwar period. The only significant

change in correlation between the prewar and postwar eras is that

agricultural goods switch from having a small positive correlation with

nonagricultural goods in the prewar era to having a small negative

correlation in the postwar era.

      The implications of the changes, or more precisely the lack of

changes, in the short-run behavior of the individual production series is

obviously a topic for much further research. However, it is possible to

suggest some of the questions raised by the results. First, the lack of

stabilization shown by the individual production series between the prewar

and postwar eras raises the possibility that stabilization policy has not
                                     31

been effective. Because policy was not used in the prewar era and was used

in the postwar era, one might have expected to see a stabilization of

production in the postwar era. That this has not happened for most of the

38 commodities examined suggests that policy has not been as obviously

successful as many economists might have believed. However, in order to

argue that policy has genuinely not worked at an aggregate level many

additional issues such as the relative size of shocks in the two periods or

the possible presence of destabilizing institutional changes in the postwar

era will have to be examined.

     A second question raised by the results concerns what type of model

is appropriate for analyzing short-term fluctuations in output in the

prewar and postwar eras. The persistence properties of the disaggregate

series suggest that shocks to the production of individual goods tend to be

partly transitory, but with a definite permanent component in both the

prewar and postwar eras. At the same time, the correlation between the

various commodities is surprisingly low in both periods. Only the major

commodities tend to be highly correlated and this correlation has been

declining over time.

      These findings indicate that both permanent and transitory industry-

specific shocks are an important source of short-term fluctuations in the

production of individual commodities in both periods, and especially in the

postwar era. Therefore, it is important that models of the behavior of

aggregate production allow an important role for industry-specific shocks

and pay careful attention to the individual variation that may be masked by

aggregation.

      Finally, a third issue raised by this analysis of the behavior of the

individual production series involves possible explanations for the Great
                                      36

more difficult to discern. In all Census Bureau documes the source of
data before 1903 is given as Latham, Alexander, and Co.    Latham and Co.
was a New York banking firm that published an extensive book annual of
cotton statistics called Cotton Movement and Fluctuations. However, the
data in this book appear to have been collected by correspondents of the
Commercial and Financial Chronicle of New York. The Chronicle's annual
report "Cotton Crop of the United States" is reprinted in each edition of
the Latham book and describes Chronicle correspondents surveying all major
consumers of cotton. Judging from the fact that the Chronicle reports very
detailed information on such things as how many spindles came in and went
out of use in each region, it appears that the survey conducted by its
correspondents was indeed quite extensive and exact.

      Coffee and Silk. Like cotton consumed, coffee imported and
unmanufactured silk imports for consumption are input series that are used
to proxy for the production of manufactured commodities. The ultimate
source of the prewar data on coffee and silk imports are the monthly and
annual reports from the collectors of customs duties. Customs agents, in
addition to collecting revenue, received and checked reports from every
ship entering the U.S. on the quantity and the value of the goods unloaded.
From the tremendous amount of specific data on imports by port that are
provided in early publications such as the Treasury Department's Monthly
Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Statistics, it is clear that this data
is based on a contemporaneous enumeration of producers, or in this case,
importers. Modern data on imports are still based on the reports of
customs agents and ultimately on the quantities declared by importers.

      Refined Sugar. The ultimate source of early estimates of refined
sugar production is the Weekly Statistical Sugar Trade Journal. This trade
publication was put out by Willett and Gray whom Frickey (1947) describes
as "sugar statisticians of New York." The data on both cane sugar meltings
and refined beet sugar production appear to be based on a contemporaneous
canvass of major producers. Modern data on refined sugar production are
now compiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. While procedures of
the USDA are no doubt different from those of Willett and Gray, modern
numbers are still derived from a survey of major producers.

      Canned Corn and Canned Tomatoes. Beginning in 1907 the data on
canned vegetables are compiled by the National Canner's Association. The
Canner's Association is a professional organization that surveys producers
of canne7goods about the quantity and market value of the goods they
produce.    The canvass made by the Canner's Association from its earliest
days appears to be quite complete and is still the source of modern figures
on canned goods production.
      According to Department of Agriculture documents, data on canned corn
and canned tomatoes before 1907 are available from the trade publication
The American Grocer. While it is unclear how extensive a canvass was made
by The American Grocer, the data appear to be very detailed and were
certainly collected contemporaneously. Furthermore, estimates made by the
early trade presses were typically quite accurate because such publications
often had a close relationship with producers and because accurate
estimates were crucial to retaining readers.

     Beer, Distilled Spirits, Tobacco. Cigars, and Cigarettes. The
                                     37

ultimate source of both the prewar and postwar series on alcohol and
tobacco products are the tax records of the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue and later of the Internal Revenue Service. Because alcohol and
tobacco products have been subject to excise taxes over the entire period
1889-1984, tax collectors have continuous records of how many goods have
ben reported as being produced and hence subject to tax. Early issues of
the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue contain very
detailed information on the number of producers and the success of Treasury
Department agents in enforcing the excise tax laws. This suggests that
early tax data probably do provide an extensive census of the actual
production of alcohol and tobacco products.
       Modern data on the production of these goods are still derived from
tax records. While the methods of data collection have not changed
radically between the prewar and postwar eras, it seems likely that
enforcement may have improved over time. However, as long as prewar tax
 evasion was not systematically related to the cycle, this difference should
 not jeopardize the accuracy of the series for analyzing changes in the
 representation of short-run fluctuations.

      Raw Steel. Rails, and Pig Iron. The ultimate source of both prewar
and postwar data on raw steel, rails, and pig iron produced is the American
Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). The AISI is the research wing1f the
professional trade organization of producers of iron and steel.    From the
mid-l9th century on the AISI has surveyed producers of iron and steel
concerning production of various products. According to the 1890 Annual
Statistical Report, "all the iron and steel manufacturers in the country,
with scarcely an exception, cordially respond to our calls for statistical
information" (AISA, 1891, p. 8). This indicates that the data on iron and
steel in both the prewar and postwar eras satisfy the requirement that the
series be based on a contemporaneous survey of producers.

Updates
      Continuations for the 13 manufacturing series come from a variety of
sources. Modern data on coffee imported, silk imported, cotton consumed,
beer, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, and steel are available in various
issues of the Statistical Abstract. Data for the most recent years for
coffee imported and cotton consumed are taken from Business Statistics
because sies consistent with earlier estimates have been dropped from the
Abstract.    As discussed before, the most recent numbers available are
used back to 1971, but the data before 1970 given in Historical Statistics
are generally not revised.
      Modern data on canned corn and canned tomatoes are taken from
Agricultural Statistics. 1985. The continuation for the series on
distilled spirits is from Alcohol. Tobacco, and Firearms Summary
Statistics. 1982 published by the Treasury Department. Modern data on
shipments of steel rails are from various issues of the Annual Statistical
Report of the American Iron and Steel Institute.

 Notes on Individual Series

       Cotton consumed. The series on cotton consumed given in Historical
 Statistics is inconsistent with data available for recent years because the
 early series includes linters (the fuzz of short fibers that adheres to
                                     38

cottonseed after ginning) while recent data do not. To deal with this I
put together an alternative series using data from various issues of the
Statistil Abstract. These data are described as being exclusive of
linters.

      Canned Tomatoes. The series in Historical Statistics uses different
sources for 1899 and 1904 than for the rest of the prewar era. These two
observations appear to come from the Census of Manufactures while those for
other years come from industry trade reports. The effect of this
inconsistency is that the series takes a radical jump in both 1899 and 1904
because the Census enumeration is more complete. To form a more consistent
series I replace the observations for 1899 and 1904 in Historical
Statistics with those from Burns (1934) which is the intermediate source
for the rest of the prewar series in Historical Statistics.

      Steel Rails. The series on steel rails in Historical Statistics uses
production data until 1967 and shipments data thereafter. Because
shipments data are all that is available, I also continue the series with
shipments data. While this difference clearly yields an inconsistency, the
bias should be in the direction of causing the data to show a stabilization
over time. Because inventories tend to be procyclical in the postwar era,
a shipments series is likely to be smoother than a production series.

                                 FOOTNOTES



1.   For example, Barro (1986, p. 376) suggests that "the process for

generating deficits in the interwar period, 1920-40,. .   . is broadly similar

to that in the post-World War II period, 1948-82. . .

2.   It is important to note that the mean is not a useful summary of the

data because it gives more weight to a ratio of 2.0 than to a ratio of .5,

even though the two are equally far from 1.0 in percentage terms.

3.   Direct data on cotton textiles do not exist. However, Census Bureau

estimates of raw cotton consumed is considered to be a good measure of the

production of basic cotton cloth.

4. At the same time, it is useful to note that the stabilization ratios of

the traditional aggregate series reported here are smaller than those found

in many other studies. The reason for this is that most studies do not

examine the prewar and interwar eras separately. As is true for the

individual production series, the aggregate output measures are much more

volatile in the l920s and l930s than in the preceding or proceeding three decades.

5. In the extrapolation process the postwar relationship between GNP and

commodity output is used to transform the more extreme short-run movements

in commodity output into reasonable movements for a GNP series.

6. For this calculation the periods compared are 1889-1914 and 1947-1984.

The change in the average growth rates is calculated by subtracting the

postwar figure from the prewar figure, and hence is usually positive.

7. For example, the stabilization ratio using the extended prewar sample

period is 1.00 for corn, 1.20 for wheat, .84 for bituminous coal, 1.18 for

pig iron, 1.06 for cotton consumed, and 1.65 for steel. The respective

ratios for the shorter prewar sample from Table 1 are 1.09, 1.12, .89,
                                        40

1.33, 1.08, and 1.54.

8. As written in (1), the trend level of output is defined as output that

grows as the constant rate B. per year.

9.   This result is similar to that found by Long and Plosser (1987) using

monthly sectoral output data for the postwar era.

10. The 1905 Yearbook of the USDA provides a good description of the crop

reporting procedures.

11. For a description of current crop reporting procedures see the USDA

publication Statistical Series the U.S. Department of Agriculture: How

they are Constructed and Used (1971).

12. The Geological Survey actually began operations in 1879, but did not

collect data systematically until 1882.

13. The descriptive notes about the pig iron series in Historical

Statistics also contain some inaccuracies.

14. This series is in fact identical to that given in Historical

Statistics for these two decades.

15. The thoroughness of the canvasses is evident from the 1913 Census

Bureau pamphlet Instructions to Special Agents: Cotton Statistics.

16. The source before 1895 is often given as the U.S. Department of

Agriculture. However, the 1899 Yearbook of the USDA says their data on

cotton consumed are from Latham and Co.

17. A useful description of the Canner's Association's activities is

provided in their publication The Canning Industry (1971).

18. In the mid-nineteenth century statistical reports were put out

directly by the American Iron and Steel Association.

19. The cotton consumed series in Business Statistics is ratio spliced to

that from the Statistical Abstract in 1978.
                                     41

20. The notes to the tables in the Statistical Abstract for some years are

ambiguous. It is possible that the series before 1909 includes linters.

However, the data for 1889-1908 taken from the 1916 Statistical Abstract

are identical to those in Historical Statistics, which are described as

being exclusive of linters.

aThe traditional estimates of GNP are the Kendrick (1961) estimates for
1889-1928 and the Commerce Department (1986) estimates for 1929-1984. The
Kendrick series in 1929 dollars is ratio spliced to the Commerce Department
series in 1982 dollars in 1929.

bThe Romer (1986b) estimates of prewar GNP are used as the consistent
extension of the modern Commerce Department estimates.

CThe traditional industrial production series is the Frickey (1947) index
of manufacturing production for 1889-1914 and the Federal Reserve Board
(1986) index of manufacturing production for 1919-1984.

dThe postwar FRB materials index is used as the consistent extension of
Frickey's index. See Romer (1986a) for further details on forming
consistent estimates of industrial production.
eA(l) is Campbell and Mankiw's nonparametric estimate of the infinite sum
of moving average coefficients.
