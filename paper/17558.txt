                                               ABSTRACT

Derivatives exposures across large financial institutions often contribute to – if not necessarily create
– systemic risk. Current reporting standards for derivatives exposures are nevertheless inadequate
for assessing these systemic risk contributions. In this paper, I explain how a transparency standard,
in contrast to the current standard, would facilitate such risk analysis. I also demonstrate that such
a standard is implementable by providing examples of existing disclosures from large dealer firms
in their quarterly filings. These disclosures often contain useful firm-level data on derivatives, but
due to a lack of standardization, they cannot be aggregated to assess the risk to the system. I highlight
the important contribution that reporting the “margin coverage ratio” (MCR), namely the ratio of a
derivatives dealer’s cash (or liquidity, more broadly) to its contingent collateral or margin calls in
case of a significant downgrade of its credit quality, could make toward assessing systemic risk contributions.

                          A Transparency Standard for Derivatives

           - Viral V Acharya, New York University Stern School of Business2

        Derivatives exposures across large financial institutions often contribute to – if
not necessarily create – systemic risk. During a crisis, lack of adequate understanding of
such exposures often compromises regulatory ability to unwind an institution, inducing
large-scale backstops and counterparty bailouts. It is often claimed – in spite of the
massive assistance that was provided in this crisis to deal with derivatives exposures –
that derivative contracts are well collateralized so that counterparty risk on derivatives
exposures is not a significant issue. Documenting evidence that supports or refutes this
claim beyond reasonable doubt is currently infeasible due to the poor quality – and lack
of standardization – of derivatives disclosures by financial firms. Nevertheless, all
available evidence points against the claim that counterparty risk in derivative exposures
is always well collateralized.

         In many important cases that contributed to the crisis, most notably but not
exclusively the case of A.I.G. Financial Products, collateralization was weak.3 Some
reports also suggest that the problem is probably of non-trivial magnitudes and that going
forward derivatives exposures are likely to remain a potentially important contributor to
systemic risk. For instance, using information from the 10-Q quarterly statements, the
IMF reports estimate that the five key institutions that are active in the OTC derivatives
market – Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley
– were jointly carrying almost $500 billion in OTC derivative payables exposure as of
3Q09.4 The report also estimates that five largest European banks – Deutsche Bank,
Barclays, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Credit Suisse – had about $600-$700
billion in under-collateralized risk (measured by residual derivative payables) as of
December 2008. This residual exposure arises for two reasons, as per the IMF report.
First, sovereigns, as well as AAA-rated insurers, corporations, large banks and
multilateral institutions “do not post adequate collateral since they are viewed by large
complex financial institutions as privileged and (apparently) safe clients.” Second,
dealers have agreed in their bilateral contracts not to mandate adequate collateral for

Architecture of Global Finance”, NYU Stern and John Wiley & Sons, November 2010. The author is

3 For example, The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, released in January 2011, reports: “In the housing

boom, CDS were sold by firms that failed to put up any reserves or initial collateral or to hedge their
exposure. In the run-up to the crisis, AIG, the largest U.S. insurance company, would accumulate a one-
half trillion dollar position in credit risk through the OTC market without being required to post one
dollar’s worth of initial collateral or making any other provision for loss. AIG was not alone….”

dealer-to-dealer positions whereby credit-worthy dealers often post no collateral to each
other for these contracts.

        These reports raise several pertinent questions:

   What is the true potential exposure on derivatives dealings of large institutions?

   How much of this exposure is collateralized?

   Is collateral posted adequate under some conservative requirements of maximum
    counterparty risk in case of system-wide stress when besides the emergence of
    counterparty risk, positions become illiquid, hard to replace and may have to be
    unwound at short notice?

   Are derivatives being deployed in under-collateralized manner to undertake
    significant maturity transformation and taking on attendant liquidity risks?5

         This note addresses these questions by examining the theoretical justification for a
transparency standard for derivatives positions. To demonstrate that such a standard is
implementable, the note shows examples of existing disclosures from large dealer firms
in their quarterly filings. These disclosures often contain useful firm-level data on
derivatives, but due to a lack of standardization, these are not aggregation-friendly for
assessing the risk to the system. The note highlights the important role for tracking of a
“margin coverage ratio” (MCR), namely the ratio of a derivatives dealer’s cash (or
liquidity, more broadly) to its contingent collateral or margin calls in case of a significant
downgrade of its credit quality. Finally, the note discusses the implications of such a
possible standard for the Office of Financial Research (OFR) to be set up under the
Treasury as per the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States.

Case for regulatory and market disclosure of standardized derivatives reports

       It is useful to understand theoretically the market failure in the provision of
information in derivatives markets. Acharya and Engle (2009) and Acharya and Bisin
(2010) formalize this idea under the notion of a “counterparty risk externality”.6

       To illustrate the idea, suppose that counterparty A agrees to pay B. Then, A turns
around and sells a similar contract to C. The addition to A’s position from the contract
with C dilutes the payoff on its contract with B in case that A turns out ex-post to not

5 In terms of “risk topography”, derivatives can be considered the mechanism to build contingent exposures
– across states of nature and over time – which when not adequately collateralized or capitalized lead to
liquidity risk. Thus, derivatives facilitate complex forms of “liquidity mismatch”, discussed in greater
detail elsewhere by Markus Brunnermeier, Gary Gorton and Arvind Krishnamurthy.
6 Acharya, Viral V and Robert Engle, 2009, “Derivatives trades should all be transparent,” Wall Street
Journal, 15 May 2009, and Acharya, Viral V and Alberto Bisin, 2010, “Counterparty risk externality:
Centralized versus over-the-counter markets,” working paper, NYU-Stern.
have adequate funds to repay both B and C. Thus, B’s payoff dependency on what else A
does represents a negative payoff externality on B due to A’s counterparty risk. The key
efficiency question is whether B can adequately reflect this risk in charging price or
adopting risk controls (e.g., margins or overall position limits) on A. Clearly, B’s ability
to do so depends upon whether B can observe what A does.

        Now, if markets are organized over-the-counter (OTC) as with many derivatives
contracts, there is opacity at level of derivatives positions of a financial firm. As a result
of this opacity, counterparty risk externality described above cannot be adequately
reflected in price and collateral arrangements. More broadly, since generating
information about each firm’s derivatives positions requires its cooperation but benefits
the system at large, the firm may not fully internalize the social benefits of transparency.
This theory predicts thus that there will be too little production of private information in
settings that involve counterparty risk externality. Acharya and Engle (2009) and
Acharya and Bisin (2010) present several proposals to address this market failure.

         One proposal is that central clearing and margining on exchanges get around this
failure (at least when viewed in the realm of a particular clearinghouse or exchange).
Central counterparty or trade-guaranteeing body or exchange can observe end-of-day (or
even intra-day) positions, and set position limits, concentration limits and margin calls
accordingly. This arrangement works best if the same clearing entity clears most
products. Yet, many markets, especially for complex and customized derivatives will
almost necessarily remain OTC. They cannot easily be standardized if their primary
purpose is to provide customized hedging to some end-users and the system may not find
it profitable to incur transaction costs in setting up clearinghouses or exchanges for these
products if their volumes are thin. For these remaining derivatives, some regulators have
proposed addressing counterparty risk directly by limiting leverage (charging adequately
high margin requirements) against them. Still, regulatory attempts to do design such
instrument-specific requirements have failed miserably in the design of capital
requirements even on simpler instruments such as mortgages, loans and lines of credit.

        A second proposal, not necessarily exclusive of the first one, is to rely more on
markets’ transparency at large. Suppose information on derivatives position of a financial
firm was made available to market participants. This would enable better pricing and
managing of counterparty risk by markets themselves. This way, dealers would be
incentivized to lower their counterparty risks in an efficient manner. With a market-wide
standard, dealers would also be incentivized to provide transparency about their own
management of counterparty risk, a move that would benefit them the most in times of
significant aggregate uncertainty when customers tend to leave business with riskier
counterparties, triggering a “franchise value run”, as witnessed by Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley around the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and instead “fly to quality”.

         A common argument against such public transparency of positions and
counterparty level data is that it reduces economic benefits of undertaking these positions
in the first place and could reduce risk-sharing gains for the economy. A compromise
would be to provide market transparency with a reasonable lag, so that price impacts for
trading parties are minimized, and yet the lagged information is useful for counterparty
risk assessments.

         Finally, it is highly likely that an efficient transparency standard for derivatives
will in turn produce an efficient information system at each financial firm that aggregates
its own derivatives positions in different subsidiaries, markets and countries. This could
improve firm’s own risk management by providing timely information to senior
management and chief risk officers about enterprise-wide risks.

A transparency standard for derivatives and counterparty risk

        What might a transparency standard for derivatives look like? Here is an
example. All dealers as well as large swap players provide to a centralized data
repository frequent (for example, weekly or bi-weekly) risk reports on their derivatives
positions as follows:

•      Classification of exposures into
        o      product types (such as single-name CDS, index CDS, interest rate swaps,
        currency swaps, commodities, equities, etc.),
        o      by major currency categories,
        o      maturity (buckets) of contracts,
        o      type of counterparty (bank, broker-dealer, corporation, government-
        sponsored enterprise, monoline, insurance firm, etc.), and
        o      credit rating of counterparties.

•      Size of exposures could be reported as7
        o      gross (maximum notional exposure),
        o      in fair-value terms (to account for mark-to-market changes),
        o      net (taking account of bilateral netting arrangements), and
        o      uncollateralized net (recognizing collateral posted by counterparties).

•    Uncollateralized net exposures could be disclosed also as “potential exposures”
based on stress tests8 that take account of
       o       several notches of ratings downgrade of counterparty and its ability to post
       additional collateral; and
       o       counterparty default and replacement risk for the exposures assuming
       severe market conditions such as replacement time of two to four weeks.9

7 The crucial item here is “uncollateralized” as without knowledge of collateral backing the contracts,
there is the risk of over-stating the derivatives exposures, but more importantly, it would create the
uncertainty about magnitude of risk in the first place.
8 The focus of such a possible standard is on stress tests based on counterparty risk. Nevertheless, stress
tests based on macroeconomic scenarios, as proposed in Darrell Duffie’s note [“Systemic Risk Exposures:
A 10-by-10-by-10 Approach”], could also be used in addition.
9 In particular, the current disclosure of Level-1, Level-2 and Level-3 of assets’ underlying value should
also be enhanced to report potential illiquidity and opacity of positions (not just for derivatives), so that an
asset could be Level-1 in normal times, but the disclosure would also state whether it is likely to be Level-
1, Level-2 or Level-3 in reasonable stress scenarios.
To facilitate the understanding of contingent or potential exposures and for deriving
implications for systemically risky exposures, all dealers as well as large swap players
could also provide two important and novel reports:

•     Margin call reports that list the additional collateral liabilities of the firm as
       o      total additional liability in case the firm was to experience one, two or more
       (say, up to six) notch downgrades, and
       o      largest such liabilities aggregated by different counterparties (say, ten
       largest).

•    Concentration reports that provide the above information for the entity’s largest
counterparty exposures (say, the largest ten) or accounting for at least a substantial
proportion (say, 75%) of the total exposure.

        When aggregated across firms, the standardized firm-level reports aggregate to a
“map” of derivatives positions and their risks (mark-to-market risk, counterparty risk and
liquidity risk) as shown in Exhibit 1.

        Although such a transparency standard appears at first to involve a large amount
of information gathering, the costs of such disclosure are not likely to be that onerous.
Sophisticated investment banks already maintain such information for their internal risk
management purposes, and they do publish some of it in their quarterly reports (though in
a highly non-standardized and less granular manner, as explained below). Therefore, it is
unlikely to be a significant additional burden for them to disclose such information to
regulators in a standardized format at frequent intervals. Some aggregated versions that
respect customer confidentiality can then be made transparent to markets at large, say on
a monthly or at least quarterly basis, to help enhance market discipline against the build-
up of uncollateralized exposures.

What do financial firms currently do and do not disclose?

        The 10-Q filings of financial firms, as for any SEC-regulated firms in the United
States, require disclosure of all materially relevant information. In case of financial
firms, given their increasingly large presence in derivatives markets, these filings also
contain information on positions – and on their risks – in these markets. A few examples
below help illustrate what is useful in the current reports, and what changes would be
necessary to adhere to a transparency standard such as the one outlined above.

        Consider for example the reporting of credit protection sold by Citigroup and
JPMorgan Chase, shown from their 10-Q filings in Exhibits 2a and 2b. Citigroup reports
its positions by industry, product and credit rating of underlying reference entity, whereas
JPMorgan reports them by maturity and credit rating of underlying entity. While it is
possible to draw some relative conclusions about average credit rating of entities they
write protection against (Citigroup wrote more risky protection than JPMorgan), other
aspects of disclosures are not comparable. Nevertheless, the exhibit reveals that financial
firms could report these data in a standardized manner if required to do so.

        Next, consider Exhibits 3a and 3b that show Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan
Chase’s reporting of counterparty credit risk in their over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
positions. Goldman Sachs reports the positions as well as their value net of collateral by
credit rating of counterparty, by risk types and by maturity buckets. In this case,
JPMorgan’s reporting provides similar information as that of Goldman Sachs, facilitating
a straightforward comparison. One can easily reach the conclusion that overall, in terms
of percentage of overall exposures, JPMorgan’s counterparty credit risk profile is safer
than that of Goldman Sachs, as 40% of JPMorgan’s OTC derivative credit exposure is
with counterparties at AA and higher level versus around 20% for Goldman Sachs.

       Notably, no data on concentration of exposures in derivatives are currently
revealed in any of the 10-Q filings. This creates a significant challenge in assessing
systemic risk based on current public disclosures of financial firms.

         In contrast, there is some useful information on potential margin calls. Exhibit 4a
illustrates that different financial firms report their margin liabilities in case of own
downgrades with varying levels of granularity and “stress”. JPMorgan’s report
historically appears the best in a relative sense in that it includes margin liabilities for
one-notch downgrade and up to six-notch downgrade. Goldman Sachs, however, reports
margin liabilities only up to two notches, and the second notch is disclosed only since the
crisis. It is immediately apparent from this report that JPMorgan’s liquidity risk from one
to six-notch downgrade is far smaller in terms of multiplier on the required margin than it
is for Goldman Sachs.

        No discussion of contingent liquidity risk related to margin calls can be complete
without a discussion of A.I.G. Exhibit 4b shows that A.I.G. reported only one notch
downgrade risk up until 3Q 2008, and in that last quarter, reported up to two notches.
From one to two notch, its collateral liability increased by a factor of six, a valuable piece
of information in assessing system’s counterparty risk to A.I.G. that was not available in
their reports until 2Q 2008.10 As it turned out, while Moody’s and Fitch downgraded it

10 This information too was available not in a well tabulated form in AIG’s 10-Q of 3Q 2008 but in the
body of the text: “Credit ratings are important to AIG‟s business, results of operations and liquidity.
Downgrades in AIG‟s credit ratings could increase AIG‟s borrowing costs and could adversely affect its
competitive position and liquidity. With respect to AIG‟s liquidity, it is estimated that, as of the close of
business on April 30, 2008, based on AIGFP‟s outstanding municipal guaranteed investment agreements
(GIAs) and financial derivative transactions at that date, a downgrade of AIG‟s longer−term senior debt
ratings to „Aa3‟ by Moody‟s Investors Service (Moody‟s) or „AA−‟ by Standard & Poor‟s, a division of the
McGraw−Hill Companies (S&P) would permit counterparties to call for approximately $1.8 billion of
collateral, while a downgrade to „A1‟ by Moody‟s or A+ by S&P would permit counterparties to call for
approximately $9.8 billion of additional collateral. Further downgrades could result in requirements for
substantial additional collateral, which could have a material adverse effect on how AIGFP manages its
liquidity. The actual amount of collateral that AIGFP would be required to post to counterparties in the
event of such downgrades depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions
and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. Additional obligations to post collateral would
increase the demands on AIGFP‟s liquidity.”
by two notches, Standard & Poor’s did so by three notches, resulting in collateral liability
of $20 bln which was compounded upwards eventually to $32 bln given mark-to-market
or fair-value adjustments due to deteriorating market conditions.

        Finally, it is instructive to use these margin call reports in conjunction with the
cash position of these firms to assess their “margin coverage ratios” (MCR). In 4Q 2008,
JPMorgan Chase had cash-equivalent assets of $26 bln, so that its MCR was over four,
since its margin call for a six-notch downgrade is $6.3 bln. Goldman Sachs had cash
assets (its “total global core excess”) of over $100 bln, giving it an MCR of around 50 for
a margin call of $2.14 bln at a two-notch downgrade. That is, while Goldman Sachs’
liquidity risk due to collateral calls is substantial, it also holds a lot of unencumbered cash
to deal with this risk. In contrast, A.I.G. had cash assets of just around $2.5 bln in 2008,
giving it an MCR of between 1 and 2 for its $1.8 bln margin call at one-notch downgrade.
Once it revealed its two-notch downgrade risk in August 2008, its MCR for two-notch
downgrade was just around 0.25 as its (hitherto un-disclosed) margin call exposure was
up at $9.8 bln with a two-notch downgrade. A.I.G.’s margin risk was simply not well
covered for a “stress” downgrade scenario by its holdings of cash assets. Importantly, for
a multi-notch downgrade, this was not at all transparent based on it 10-Q’s prior to
August 2008.

        The purpose behind reporting these data from 10-Q filings is two-fold. One, to
make it clear that financial firms can, and do, report much of the possible standard
discussed in this note for derivatives reporting. Second, to illustrate that standardized
data can support and enhance the assessment of counterparty risk in derivatives markets
using simple analytical tools such as the margin coverage ratio (MCR) (that is analogous
to interest coverage ratio employed by credit rating analysts in their assessment of non-
financial corporations’ liquidity risk).

        We now examine how a transparency standard like that described above would
affect the degree to which the desired objectives of the recent financial reforms legislated
in the United States could be achieved

Implications for the Dodd-Frank reforms and the Office of Financial Research

       The “Wall Street Transparency and Accountability” part of the Dodd-Frank Act
of 2010 requires that

• All existing derivative positions (both cleared and un-cleared “swaps”) be reported to a
swap data repository within 180 days of its enactment;
• All new positions – cleared or un-cleared – be reported starting 90 days after the
enactment (or an alternative legislated period);
• The repository be tasked with providing data to the regulatory agencies – including
foreign and international agencies, if applicable – to minimize systemic risk;
• The repository be tasked with publishing aggregate market information (trading and
clearing in major swap categories, participants and developments in new products) to
public twice a year;
• There be real-time public reporting, meaning “to report data relating to a swap
transaction, including price and volume, as soon as technologically practicable after the
time at which the transaction has been executed”; and,
• Such public reporting, however, not include counterparty or customer information, and
also have a delay exemption for “block trades” (to be defined by rule-makers) taking
account of the impact of disclosure of such trades on liquidity.

     While these attempts to improve transparency in the derivatives markets are
commendable, there are also several notable omissions:

• Prices of new trades are often not sufficient to mark old positions, since derivatives are
often struck at terms so as to be at zero fair-value to both involved parties. It is essential
to have for derivative trades their potential exposure and collateral risk, not just current
mark-to-market values. However, such risk management variables are not required by
the Act to be collected by data repository. Indeed, there is no required reporting of
collateral information of any trades, precluding analysis of potential counterparty risk.
• While clearinghouses will clearly collect required counterparty information for trades
they clear and will (hopefully) set adequate initial and variation margins to
counterparties, several complex derivatives positions will still remain OTC.
Understanding the counterparty risk in these OTC positions is crucial for margining on
clearinghouses as well as in broader assessments of credit risk and systemic risk.
• Legislating counterparty risk transparency for regulators may have some favorable
effects. Extending such transparency in some lagged form to markets might help
reinstitute market discipline as a buffer against regulatory failures to contain risks
adequately.

        All of these omissions can be addressed by a possible transparency standard, as
explained in this note.11 Although there will remain private data repositories such as the
Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), it is beyond doubt that over time the
Office for Financial Research (OFR), which is required by the Dodd-Frank Act to be set
up under the Treasury for collecting, analyzing and disseminating systemic risk relevant
information and early warnings, will require derivatives counterparty risk information.
An adequate, standardized, and self-reported but audited disclosure of derivatives
positions and risks by the largest financial firms would be invaluable in such an exercise.
The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), representing heads of regulatory
agencies in the United States, formed as per the Dodd-Frank Act and charged with the
task of identifying systemically important financial institutions (SIFI’s) and regulating
them, would also find such standardized reporting on derivatives of direct use as this
would reveal information about which firms are currently – or potentially – too
interconnected to fail. Academics, regulators, accounting boards, and derivatives dealers
and large banks could come together to refine and implement the standard.



11 Indeed, the current hedge-accounting standards could also be possibly employed to make it clear what
proportion of the exposures are for hedging purposes and to account for hedging effects in reported values
and risks of positions.
Conclusion

In summary, better market discipline and regulatory intelligence about counterparty risk
in derivatives market likely requires a new transparency standard. This standard could be
layered on top of the current quarterly disclosures of derivatives positions and risks by
financial firms, but with a greater frequency for regulatory reports. Of particular
importance is position-level transparency of large derivatives players, not just in a static
sense, but also as potential exposure to stress scenarios, margin call exposure in case of
their credit quality deterioration, and concentration exposure for assessment of systemic
interconnections. Such transparency would facilitate tracking valuable counterparty risk
indicators, most notably the “margin coverage ratio” (MCR) that compares a firm’s cash
position to its margin call exposure under stress scenarios.
