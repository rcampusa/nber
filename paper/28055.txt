                                          ABSTRACT

We argue that falling farm product prices, incomes, and spending may explain 10-30 percent of
the 1930 U.S. output decline. Crop prices collapsed, reducing farmers' incomes. And across U.S.
states and Ohio counties, auto sales fell most in crop-growing areas. The large spending response
may be explained by farmers' indebtedness. Reasonable assumptions about the marginal
propensity to spend of farmers relative to nonfarmers and the pass-through of farm prices to retail
prices imply that the collapse of farm product prices in 1930 was a powerful propagation
mechanism worsening the Depression.

        "The evils of deflation and liquidation through bankruptcy and default manifest
        themselves more malevolently in agriculture than in any other great industrial
        group." -Irving Fisher (Fisher, 1932, p. 32).


1 Introduction
      The first year of the Great Depression in the United States was exceptionally severe,
much more severe than that in other countries. Figure 1 shows the path of U.S. industrial
production in the first year of the Great Depression. Had the U.S. Depression ended in
1930, the output decline would still have been more severe than that in any other post-1869
recession with the exception of 1945-46 and, perhaps, 2020.1 Industrial production fell 27
percent from its peak in July 1929 to October 1930; year-on-year, in 1930, real GDP fell
8.5 percent.2 In her sample of 23 countries, Romer (1993, table 1) finds that the U.S. was
the only country in 1930 to see a year-over-year decline in industrial production of over 20
percent; among the 15 countries in which industrial production fell, the median decline was
9 percent (Romer, 1993, p. 21).
      We argue that the size and characteristics of the agricultural sector explain part of why
initial negative shocks resulted in a large downturn. This helps to account for why 1930 was
an exceptionally bad year for the U.S. economy despite continued stability of the banking
system through most of the year. The worldwide recession that began in summer 1929
quickly lowered the prices of farm products, particularly those of internationally traded
crops. These price declines in turn depressed farmers' incomes. Likely because lower farm
incomes interacted with fixed nominal debt burdens, spending in agricultural areas collapsed.
We estimate that absent this propagation through the agricultural sector, the output decline
in the first year of the Depression would have been at least 10 to 30 percent smaller.
      To document the importance of farmers for the severity of the early U.S. Great Depres-
sion, we proceed in four steps. First, in the next section, we show that at the beginning of
the Depression, farm product prices fell rapidly in both absolute and relative terms, depress-
ing farm incomes. These price declines were particularly large for crops exposed to world

demand. Entirely because of price declines, the combined dollar value of U.S. cotton, wheat,
and tobacco production fell 38 percent between 1929 and 1930.3

       In section 3, we show that in 1930 the spending of farmers fell relative to nonfarmers. To
examine farm spending, we use monthly auto sales data by state and newly-collected data
on auto sales in Ohio counties.4 We find that in the first year of the Depression, spending fell
more in states and counties most exposed to falling crop prices. The cross-sectional effect
of exposure to farm product price declines is large: a one standard deviation increase in the
share of a state's population living on farms is associated with a 5.5 percentage point larger
decline in auto sales between the second and third quarter of 1929 and the second and third
quarter of 1930. Qualitatively similar results in some (though not all) specifications in the
county and state data increase our confidence in the economic significance of the relationship
between farming and the Depression. The similarity of the results across Ohio counties and

     We use "auto" and "car" interchangeably.

across all U.S. states suggests that this relationship is not simply an idiosyncratic artifact of
a few states' performance.
    A large cross-sectional effect of exposure to farm product prices need not indicate an
important role for farmers in the aggregate. But redistribution away from farmers would have
mattered for the aggregate economy if farmers had higher marginal propensities to consume
(MPCs) than the companies and workers benefiting from lower farm product prices.5 In
section 4, we show that this is plausible because farmers entered the Great Depression with
high nominal debt burdens, and because there was incomplete pass-through of lower farm
product prices to lower consumer prices.
    In the final section of the paper, section 5, we use the structure of the model in Hausman,
Rhode, and Wieland (2019) to obtain a quantitative sense of the effect of falling farm product
prices on the severity of the early Great Depression. We ask: if relative farm product prices
had not declined before November 1930, how much less severe would the first year of the
Depression have been? We find that lower farm product prices likely explain at least 10-
30 percent of the output decline that occurred before fall 1930. The large range is due to
uncertainty about the relative MPC of farmers and nonfarmers, the pass-through of farm
product prices to final goods prices, and the aggregate multiplier.
    This paper relates to several themes in the economic history and macroeconomics lit-
eratures. Most obviously, we contribute to the literature on the beginning of the Great
Depression. Friedman and Schwartz (1963) (pp. 306-307) emphasize tight monetary policy
as a cause of the initial output decline in 1930. But as noted by Temin (1976) and Romer
(1993), the argument that monetary policy drove the initial downturn is problematic; over
the fifteen months from July 1929 to October 1930, the real money supply grew 3.2 percent,6
and nominal interest rates fell.7 The literature points to the stock market crash (Romer,

    5
      Here and throughout we abuse terminology and use "marginal propensity to consume (MPC)" to refer
to all spending by farmers, not just spending on consumption goods. From the perspective of the aggregate
economy in the short-run, it was equally contractionary for a farmer to forgo a purchase of a car for investment
purposes as it was for a farmer to forgo a purchase of a car for consumption purposes. In practice, it seems
likely that farmers often purchased a car with the expectation that it would be used for both consumption
and business purposes; surveys conducted in 1935-36 suggest that roughly one-third to one-half of farmers'
car use was for business purposes (United States Department of Agriculture, 1940, p. 34, table 15).

      This refers to the seasonally adjusted broad nominal money supply (from Friedman and Schwartz (1963),

1990) and consumer debt burdens (Olney, 1999) as causes of the large decline in U.S. output
before the first banking crisis. And in a recent paper, Gorton, Laarits, and Muir (2019)
argue that despite the lack of depositor runs, bank behaviour contributed to the output
decline in 1930, as banks cut back on loans in favor of safe assets. Since the upper end of
our range for the effect of lower farm product prices on 1930 output still leaves two-thirds
of that year's output decline to be explained, our work is consistent with a large role for
these other shocks and propagation mechanisms identified by prior authors. We add to this
prior work by documenting substantial regional heterogeneity in the severity of the early
Great Depression and by arguing that lower farm product prices, income, and spending are
a plausible propagation mechanism through which exogenous shocks (e.g. the stock market
crash) led to a large output decline.
    Relative to the literature on the U.S. Great Depression, the literature on the international
Great Depression has put more emphasis on agriculture.8 Kindleberger (1973) is concerned
with how trade in agricultural products helped to transmit economic distress across countries.
He devotes a chapter to "The Agricultural Depression," and he suggests that low farm product
prices could have contributed to the Depression. He refers to the "conventional wisdom that
price declines are deflationary in so far as they `check confidence, provoke bank failures,
encourage hoarding and in various ways discourage investment" ' (Kindleberger, 1973, p.
142). Interestingly, however, he doubts the importance of the effect that we emphasize of
a higher MPC among farmers translating lower farm product prices into lower aggregate
spending (p. 142).
    The more recent literature on agriculture and the international Great Depression is small.
Most related to our work are Madsen (2001) and Federico (2005). Madsen (2001) examines

1930 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1943), table 120, pp. 450-451). Hamilton (1992)
shows that inflation expectations likely did not turn sharply negative until the last trimester of 1930; thus
over the first year of the Great Depression, ex ante real interest rates were also probably falling.
    8
      Earlier work by the agricultural economists George Warren and Frank Pearson (Warren and Pearson,
1935) does discuss negative effects of lower commodity prices on U.S. agriculture. And Temin (1976) (p.
146-151) briefly considers whether developments in the agricultural sector might have contributed to the
U.S. downturn in 1930. Based on his reading of Kindleberger (1973), Temin concludes (p. 150) that "The
fall in farm income may have played a disproportionate role in the fall in consumption in 1930 but the farm
sector was too small by 1930 for changes within this sector to dominate the whole economy." Temin sees less
of an aggregate role for farmers than we do, perhaps because he did not have the cross-sectional quantitative
evidence we provide of a large relationship between agricultural intensity in a state and the size of the 1930
contraction in the state.

the role of agricultural in transmitting the Great Depression across countries. Like us, he
emphasizes that farmers probably had a higher MPC than nonfarmers. Using cross-country
data, he concludes that falling agricultural prices likely account for a significant portion of
the output decline during the Great Depression. Federico (2005) addresses a similar question
but comes to a different conclusion. He is interested in whether conditions in agriculture
substantially contributed to the severity of the Great Depression. He concludes that they
did not. His evidence comes from (1) an analysis of world farm product demand and supply
which suggests little overproduction in the 1920s, and (2) a review of the literature which
finds limited support for the view that problems in agricultural areas were an independent
cause of the nationwide banking panics in the U.S. Great Depression. Relative to Madsen
(2001) and Federico (2005), we are focused more narrowly on one country (the U.S.) and
one year (1929-1930). This allows us to look at detailed state and county data.
      In addition to our findings' importance for understanding the aggregate U.S. economy at
the beginning of the Depression, we also contribute to the literature on regional heterogene-
ity in the Depression's severity. We add to the findings in Garrett and Wheelock (2006),
Rosenbloom and Sundstrom (1999), and Wallis (1989) in two ways. First, we quantify the
large role of agriculture in explaining variations in state economic performance at the begin-
ning of the Depression. Second, we show that it was internationally traded crop production
rather than agricultural activity as a whole that drove differences in state performance.
      We also contribute to a growing literature in macroeconomics on redistribution and MPC
heterogeneity. Recent work in macroeconomics has stressed the importance of redistribution
and MPC heterogeneity for aggregate outcomes.9 We show that these forces are also relevant
to understanding the Great Depression.

in absolute and relative terms after the summer 1929 business cycle peak. Figure 2 shows that
rapid farm product price declines began only in early 1930. Industrial production peaked in
July 1929 and fell rapidly after October (Figure 1); therefore, this timing strongly suggests
that lower farm product prices were not an exogenous shock causing the U.S. Depression; they
were a response to the Depression and, we shall argue, a propagation mechanism worsening
the Depression.
    The prices of all major farm products fell in 1930, but the price decline was not uniform.
Table 1 shows the prices of 12 major farm products early in the Depression. In 1930, the
prices of wheat, cotton, and tobacco fell more than those of other crops. This is consistent
with a possible contribution of recession abroad to the price decline: cotton, tobacco, and
wheat are the three crops in Table 1 that were traded most internationally. Figure 3 illus-
trates the large divergence in the paths of traded and nontraded farm product prices after
the beginning of the Depression. Of course, recession abroad may itself have been caused
by recession in the U.S. So it is difficult to quantify the extent to which traded crop price
declines were an endogenous response to the U.S. recession. Large declines in the prices of

Notes: The figure shows seasonally adjusted traded crop and nontraded farm product prices. Traded crops
are wheat, cotton, and wool, major internationally traded crops for which monthly price data are available.
Tobacco is excluded because only annual prices are available. Nontraded farm products are corn, potatoes,
hay, cattle, hogs, milk, eggs, and chickens; these products were traded little internationally. See appendix B
for details on the sources and construction of these price indices.



    The large farm product price decline is likely explained by a decrease in demand (foreign
and domestic) combined with the near total inelasticity of supply of farm products. Demand
fell as the U.S. and foreign economies fell into recession. In the short-term, supply was
determined by past planting decisions. And even in the medium-term, farmers facing price
declines for their products may have maintained production; a price decline for a farmer has
a substitution effect pushing a farmer to plant less but an income effect pushing a farmer to
plant more. These forces were combined with an influx of workers into agriculture during
the Great Depression, as unemployed urban workers moved to rural areas. Throughout
the 1920s, there was net migration from farm to cities; this pattern reversed in 1930 with
net migration to farms from cities each year from 1930-33 (United States Department of
Agriculture, 1936, table 445, p. 339). Ezekiel and Bean (1933) (p. 21) argue that "Left to
themselves, farmers as a group have been unable to readjust their total production in line

                                                                   8
with the reduced demands." 10 An inelastic supply of farm products was of course not unique
to the Great Depression. Bordo (1980) notes that at least since Cairnes (1873) economists
have known that inelastic supply may make commodity prices more volatile than the prices
of manufactured goods.11

       The effect of large commodity price movements depends on their incidence; it was the
U.S. economy's misfortune in 1930 that the burden of lower farm product prices fell on
indebted farm households. An individual farmer's income roughly equaled the price of their
product times the quantity produced, so the large decline in farm product prices produced a
large decline in farmers' incomes. This is a key difference between farm products and other
commodities; when the price of, say, iron ore falls the immediate effect is to lower the profits
of iron mining firms; the incomes of mining households only fall when wages for iron miners
decline, a process likely to take months if not years. Changes in farm product prices, by
contrast, have a direct, rapid impact on the incomes of farm households.

       Farm incomes are shown in Figure 4. Between July 1929 and October 1930, real, cpi-
deflated farm income fell 29 percent; income from crops fell 42 percent. While individuals
who became unemployed may have seen larger income declines, the decline in income for the
typical farmer was far larger than that for the typical nonfarm worker. Annual data from the
BEA (table SA04) show that CPI-deflated nonfarm personal income fell 6.3 percent between
1929-1930; over the same period, CPI-deflated farm income fell 25.1 percent.

       To understand whether the fall in farm income in 1930 was driven by lower farm product
prices, Figure 5 shows farm income and the quantity of marketed farm products from 1927
to 1930. Unlike the series shown in Figure 4, these series are not seasonally adjusted; thus
they show the regular seasonal peak in fall of farm products sold and farm income received.
Income and marketing track each other closely until mid-1930, when farm marketing rises in
its typical seasonal fashion, while farm income increases little relative to its normal seasonal
increase. The unusually small increase in farm income reflects falling farm product prices.
The behaviour of these series shows that before mid-1930 falling seasonally adjusted farm

  10
      This is the heading of a subsection that goes on to describe the movement of city workers to farms and
the fact that bankruptcy did not typically stop production on a farm (Ezekiel and Bean, 1933, p. 21).
   11
      Bordo (1980) adds to this argument by showing that commodity price flexibility also makes commodity
(including agricultural) prices more volatile in response to monetary shocks.

incomes (Figure 4) may have largely reflected less marketing of farm products. Reduced
marketing may have been a result of drought which shrank the 1929 harvest. (In our cross-
state regression below, we control for drought conditions.) In any case, beginning in summer
1930 lower farm product prices are the clear driver of lower farm incomes.

3 Expenditure in farm areas
       The large decline in farm product prices and incomes led to a collapse of spending in farm
areas. Initial evidence for this comes from a comparison of rural and small town retail sales
with department and variety store sales. Rural and small town retail sales are a Department
of Commerce index (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1934a) that uses data on mail order and
chain store sales to measure consumption in small towns (those with population less than
10,000) and on farms.12 Department stores were located in urban areas and thus capture a
part of urban consumption. They have the disadvantage, however, of being weighted towards
higher-price goods. The U.S. Department of Commerce (1934c) developed an index of variety
store sales in part to correct for this bias. The variety store index has the disadvantage for
our purpose, however, of being based on a sample that puts a heavy weight on relatively
small cities, those with population less than 100,000. Still, the Department of Commerce

  12
    The underlying data for this index were provided by Chicago Mail Order House, Montgomery Ward &
Co., Sears, Roebuck & Co., and J. C. Penney Co. For further details, see U.S. Department of Commerce
(1934a).

saw this series as at least somewhat representative of consumption in urban areas (U.S.
Department of Commerce, 1934a).
   Figure 6 graphs these series between 1929 and 1933. (The rural and variety store indices
begin in January 1929.) The indices start to diverge in December 1929; between July 1929
and October 1930, seasonally adjusted department store and variety store sales fell 7 percent;
rural and small town retail sales fell 28 percent.

   While this is already evidence of a large relative decline in consumption in farm areas, we
turn to state and county data in order to more precisely quantify the evolution of spending
in farm versus nonfarm areas. In particular, we focus on data on auto sales. Auto sales have
three advantages. First, the data are available monthly by state and monthly by county
in Ohio. We know of no other indicator of expenditure available by state or county at
this frequency. Second, the data are likely to be relatively well-measured, given that car
registration was required. Finally, while only one component of household spending, cars
played an outsized role in the initial year of the Great Depression. As emphasized by Romer

                                                                    12
(1990), in 1930 durables consumption fell much more than non-durables consumption.


3.1 Evidence from U.S. States Monthly data on new passenger car registrations come
from the 1934 Automotive Daily News Review and Reference Book.13 These data closely
approximate sales and for conciseness, we will generally refer to auto "sales" rather than
"new registrations." States required the registration of new cars, so new registrations were a
direct measure of sales. As discussed further in appendix C, at times the measure could be
inexact, but only to a limited degree.
       Figure 7 shows a scatter plot of the percent change in new registrations (sales) between
the second and third quarter of 1929 and the second and third quarter of 1930 and the share
of a state's population living on farms. Here and in our regressions below we compare car
sales between these six-month averages (1929:Q2-Q3 and 1930:Q2-Q3), since doing so filters
out idiosyncratic noise in the monthly data. Figure 7 shows a clear negative relationship
between car sales growth and farm share of the population during the first year of the Great
Depression.
       Figure 8 provides another way to see the relationship between farm share and economic
performance. It graphs the average level of auto sales in each of four quartiles of states,
where states are grouped by the share of their population living on farms.14 By the second
half of 1930, a clear pattern emerges, in which auto sales had fallen most in the highest
farm share states (quartile 4) and least in the lowest farm share states (quartile 1). There
is no evidence of divergence between the quartiles before early 1930, with the exception of a
notable upward spike in auto sales in quartile 4 in late 1929. This upward spike is driven by
very high auto sales in Alabama and Mississippi, numbers that we suspect may be errors.
Appendix Figure D.1 shows that when Alabama and Mississippi are excluded, this upward
spike disappears, but the monotonic pattern in which 1930 car sales fell most in the highest

      This was published as a supplement to the Automotive Daily News. The data are on pp. 22-23 and are
labeled "New Passenger Car Registrations." The original source is listed as R.L. Polk & Co., New Jersey
Motor Co., and Sherlock & Arnold.
   14
      For this figure, we seasonally adjust auto sales using data from 1929 (when the series begins) through
1934, excluding 1933 because of the dramatic auto sales growth in spring 1933 (Hausman et al., 2019). We
use data only through 1934, because thereafter the seasonal pattern of auto sales changed due to a change
in the date of new model introduction (Cooper and Haltiwanger, 1993). Seasonally adjusted sales in month
        ^t + 12    ^
t are e       j =1 j /12 , where ^t is the residual from a regression of log auto sales on monthly dummies, and
 ^j is the OLS coefficient on the month j dummy.

farm share states remains. That the pattern of worse performance emerges in early 1930
and not before is consistent with the timing of farm product price declines; we saw in the
previous section that farm product prices only began to rapidly decline in early 1930.

   Table 2 investigates the relationship between farm intensity and auto sales more carefully
by estimating regressions of the form:

       %Auto salesi,1929:Q2-Q3-1930:Q2-Q3 = 0 + 1 Agricultural exposurei +  Xi + i ,                                                                           (1)

where %Auto salesi,1929:Q2-Q3-1930:Q2-Q3 is auto sales growth in state i at the beginning of
the Depression, "Agricultural exposure" is a measure of a state i's exposure to falling farm
prices, and X is a set of control variables. Column 1 shows results for the single-variable
regression analogous to the scatter plot in Figure 7. The coefficient is both economically
and statistically significant (the t-statistic equals 5). The coefficient of -0.32 implies that a
one standard deviation change in farm population share (17 percentage points) is associated
with a 5.5 percentage point decline in auto sales growth. For comparison, nationwide auto

sales fell 34 percent over this period.15 Note also that the R2 is 0.30: as measured by auto
sales, the farm share of the population alone explains 30 percent of the cross-state variation
in the severity of the early Great Depression.

       In interpreting the results in Table 2, it is worth emphasizing that specification 1 is not
directly measuring the change in purchases of cars by farmers themselves; the difference we
see between the change in car sales in more and less farm intensive states is due not only to
the purchasing behaviour of farmers but also to the purchasing behaviour of segments of the
population whose livelihood was linked to that of farmers. When farmers' spending fell, the
owner of the local general store may have also foregone an auto purchase.

       Column 2 adds control variables to address omitted variable bias concerns. We control
for population to assure that the percent of state's population living on farms is not simply
proxying for a small versus large state effect;16 we control for the per-capita number of cars
sold in 1928 to assure that estimates are not biased by greater propensities to purchase cars

value of crops sold per capita in 1929. The coefficient is again economically and statistically

larger decline in auto sales in the first year of the Depression. This is very similar to the
decline in auto sales associated with a one standard deviation change in farm share of the
population. Column 5 adds control variables and region fixed effects. The coefficient shrinks
by one third, but remains economically and statistically significant. Column 6 adds controls
for drought. This results in an increase in the coefficient on crops sold per capita.

   The results in Table 2 show that agricultural-intensive states suffered more during the
first year of the Great Depression. This is consistent with a story in which lower agricultural
prices depressed farm incomes and farm consumption and investment. We would also like to
know what sort of farm areas did worst in 1930. If spending declined most in areas growing
crops whose prices declined most, this would support our argument that lower farm product
prices and income lowered farm area spending. To investigate this, we look at how state
performance varied with the type of agricultural product produced.



3.1.1 Results by crop Table 3 shows the relationship between the auto sales growth in
the first year of the Depression and the production of two categories of farm products:
internationally traded crops and nontraded farm products. In distinguishing between traded
and nontraded farm products, our goal is to distinguish between those farm products whose
prices were likely to be strongly influenced by world demand (e.g. cotton) from those less
influenced by world demand (e.g. milk). This roughly captures the difference between farm
products whose prices collapsed in 1930 and those whose prices fell more modestly (Table 1
and Figure 3). We define traded crops to be the value of cotton, tobacco, cereals, and wool
production. While not all cereals were traded, their substitutability meant that their prices
often moved together (Hausman et al., 2019). Nontraded farm production equals nontraded
crop production plus the value of dairy and livestock sold. Nontraded crop production is
equal to the value of total crop production minus the value of traded crops. We also include
corn in the nontraded crops category. Corn is a cereal, and corn prices may have moved
with other cereals prices; but movements in corn prices did not necessarily directly impact
farm incomes, because corn was often grown to feed hogs. An increase in the market price
of corn had little or no effect on many corn farmers' incomes, since the same farmers were
using the corn to feed their hogs.

    The first column of Table 3 shows that traded crop production was much more correlated
with auto sales than was nontraded farm product production. The coefficient on traded crop
production of -0.15 implies that a one-standard deviation increase in traded crop production
($39) would have resulted in 5.7 percentage points lower auto sales growth. The coefficient
is estimated precisely, with a t-statistic above 4 and a 95 percent confidence interval of [-
0.21,-0.08]. Thus we can be confident that there was an economically significant relationship
between traded crop production and economic performance.

    By contrast, conditional on traded crop production, there is no evidence of a negative
association between nontraded farm product production and car sales growth in the first
year of the Depression. The conclusion remains the same in columns (2) and (3) when
we add control variables. In sum, the cross-state results show that it was traded crop
production rather than agricultural production as a whole that was associated with a more
severe beginning of the Depression. This is consistent with the much larger declines in traded

crop prices than in the prices of farm products as a whole.


3.2 Evidence from Ohio counties To obtain further evidence on the relationship between
agriculture and the severity of the early Great Depression, we collected data on new car
registrations in Ohio counties. To our knowledge, these are the only available county-level
data on new car registrations at an annual or higher frequency in 1929-30. The data for
Ohio come from the Bulletin of Business Research prepared by the College of Commerce
and Administation of the Ohio State University. The data are monthly and are presented as
"Registrations of New Automobile Bills of Sales in Ohio Counties" with the source specified
as "Clerks of Courts of Listed Counties." 18 Unfortunately, the data do not cover all counties:
we have data for 50 of the 88 counties in Ohio. But these counties accounted for most
car sales; in 1928, more than 80 percent of all new car sales in Ohio occurred in these 50
counties.19
       The Bulletin of Business Research presents data on both new passenger car sales and new
truck sales. Unfortunately, however, there are too few counties with substantial truck sales
to make the truck sales data useful for understanding the early Great Depression. Thus we
confine ourselves to an analysis of the new passenger car sales. This has the added advantage
of easy comparability with the our cross-state results, which are also only for passenger cars.
       Figure 9 presents a cross-county scatter plot analogous to the cross-state scatter plot
in Figure 7. Across Ohio counties, there is no clear relationship between farm population
share and new car sales growth. Close inspection of the data, however, reveal that the null
result is driven by a few counties, in particular, Gallia, Geauga, and Union. These three
counties had large portions of their population living on farms but relatively low values of
crop production. As discussed above, it is crop producing areas that we expect to have
suffered most at the beginning of the Depression, because crop prices fell more than farm
product prices as a whole. Figure 10 thus shows a similar scatter plot, but with the value
of crops sold per capita rather than the proportion of the population living on farms on the

     County car sales in 1928 are calculated from the Industrial and Commercial Ohio Yearbook (1930), table
XVI, p. 104 which lists by county both 1929 car sales and the 1928-29 percent change in car sales. The state
total is from Automotive Industries, 2/23/29, p. 271.

x-axis. As expected, here there is a more obvious negative relationship. This results in part
from the shift of Gallia, Geauga, and Union counties from the far right of the graph to near
the middle, reflecting their mid-range crop production despite large farm population shares.

   To more formally investigate the relationship in Ohio between agricultural intensity and
performance early in the Depression, we run regressions across counties like those estimated
across states in the previous section. Specifically, we estimate

      %Auto salesj,1929:Q2-Q3-1930:Q2-Q3 = 0 + 1 Agricultural exposurej +  Xj + j ,                                                                                           (2)

where %Auto salesj,1929:Q2-Q3-1930:Q2-Q3 is new auto sales growth in county j at the beginning
of the Depression, "Agricultural exposure" is a measure of exposure to falling farm product
prices, and X is a set of control variables.

   Columns (1) and (2) of Table 4 show the single variable regressions corresponding to
the scatter plots in Figures 9 and 10. Columns (3) and (4) add controls for population
and 1928 car sales per capita. Unsurprisingly given the scatter plot (Figure 9), with and
without controls the coefficient on farm share is small and insignificant. By contrast, with

and without controls, the coefficient on crop sales per capita is economically and statistically
significant. Its magnitude (-0.13) is somewhat larger than that in the cross-state regression
with these controls (column 5 of Table 2). Thus the results support the cross-state finding
of an economically significant relationship between the importance of crops in a county
and the depth of the Depression in 1929-30. Columns (5) and (6) explore the relationship
between traded and nontraded farm product production and auto sales. As in the cross-state
results in Table 3, across Ohio counties, the negative impacts of agriculture are driven by
the cultivation of traded crops. But the conclusion is more tentative in the Ohio county
data than it is in the state data, since when controls are added (column 6) the coefficient on
traded crops loses statistical significance.

   Unlike the state results which change little when weighted by population (appendix
Table F.1), some of the cross-county specifications are sensitive to population weighting.
Specifically, appendix Table F.2 shows that the univariate results (specifications (1) and
(2)) become stronger, with more evidence of a negative relationship between farm share /
crops sold per capita and auto sales. But the results with controls (specifications (3) and

(4)) become weaker. When weighted, there is no longer a negative coefficient on crops sold
per capita. Reassuringly, weighting strengthens the finding in columns (5) and (6) that
traded crop production drove worse economic performance while nontraded farm product
production did not.
    Taken together, the cross-county data are supportive of the findings from the cross-
state data. The county sample is too small and noisy for precise, statistically significant
conclusions in all specifications, but the results support the robust message from the cross-
state data that areas producing traded crops suffered most in the first year of the Depression.



3.3 Narrative evidence Further evidence for the effect of lower farm product prices on
car sales in farm areas comes from narrative evidence. Narrative evidence itself does not
establish the importance of a channel from farm product prices to car sales. But combined

                                                            22
with the quantitative evidence above, it is reassuring. That contemporaries noticed the
channel from farm product prices to auto sales suggests that the effect was significant; it
supports the mechanism we posit, in which lower farm product prices reduced farmers'
incomes and hence their expenditure.
   Narrative evidence comes from the publication Automobile Topics which reported on car
sales conditions around the country. In summer and fall 1930, it reports many instances
of lower farm product prices depressing sales. The 2 August 1930 edition includes these
reports:

   · "IOWA - Grain prices are too low. Farmers will not buy" (p. 1028).

   · "MICHIGAN - Better prices for agricultural products would help sales" (p. 1028).

   · "SOUTH DAKOTA - Prices of farm products hurting our business" (p. 1028).

   Similar comments were made in the 4 October 1930 issue:

   · "SOUTH CAROLINA - Prices on cotton and tobacco retarding sales" (p. 678).

   · "GEORGIA - Low price of cotton hurting" (p. 678).

   · "NORTH DAKOTA - Poor crops and low grain prices retarding sales. There can be
     no prosperity here until grain prices go up" (p. 678).

   To be sure ­ and consistent with our argument ­ low farm product prices are far from the
only factor discussed in Automobile Topics. Many quotes are also to be found on depressed
conditions in manufacturing, on complaints about banks, and on idiosyncratic local condi-
tions. Like our quantitative evidence, however, the narrative evidence is consistent with a
large role for lower farm product prices in explaining lower auto sales in 1930.



4 Redistribution
   Lower farm product prices transferred income from the farm sector to the rest of the
economy, and we have shown that spending fell in farm relative to nonfarm areas. This
does not establish, however, that lower farm product prices had a negative impact on the

                                         23
economy as a whole. Like Madsen (2001), we believe that a mechanism through which the
transfer of income away from farmers was on net contractionary is that farmers likely had a
higher MPC than the agents benefitting from lower farm product prices.
       Unlike the econometric evidence of the previous sections, the evidence for a relatively
high MPC among farmers is fragmentary. The first piece of evidence is farmers' debt burden.
As the quote from Irving Fisher that begins this paper suggests, low farm product prices
and incomes posed particularly severe problems for farmers because of large nominal debt
burdens. In 1930, farm mortgage debt was 190 percent of net farm personal income.20 By
comparison, residential mortgage debt was 39 percent of nonfarm personal income.21 High
farm debt burdens were reflected in large numbers of farm foreclosures. In 1929 and 1930,
there were 14.7 and 15.7 foreclosures per 1000 farms. This indicates a severe level of distress
relative to more normal times; foreclosures per 1000 farms averaged just 3.2 in both the
1913-20 period and the 1941-1950 period (Alston (1983), table 1, p. 888).
       These debt problems were long in the making. Farmers acquired debt during World War
I as farm product prices and farm land values rose. Nominal debt continued to rise in the
1920s even as farm product and farm land prices fell (Wickens, 1932; Alston, 1983). This put
farmers in a perilous position on the eve of the Great Depression; hence when farm product
prices fell in 1929-1930, real farm debt burdens rose to very high levels. Table 5 shows that
the ratio of farm debt to gross income and the ratio of farm debt to assets roughly doubled
between 1910 and 1930. The debt to gross income ratio increased by 20 percent just between
1928 and 1930.

    One would expect these large nominal debt burdens to have increased the difficulties
farmers faced from lower farm product prices in 1930. As farmers' incomes fell, debt service
absorbed more of their income, squeezing their spending. Olney (1999) argues that a similar
mechanism affected households burdened by consumer debt, contributing to the economy-
wide collapse of spending in 1930. To understand the contribution of farm mortgage debt
to the collapse of spending in farm states, we start by examining the univariate relationship
between auto sales over our sample period (1929:Q2-Q3 to 1930:Q2-Q3) and farm leverage
in a state, with leverage defined as                                                           assets

and assets are equal to the value of farm land and buildings.

al. (2015).



    Figure 11 shows a scatter plot of this relationship. There is some evidence of a negative
relationship, though it is not statistically significant when Washington D.C. (an obvious
outlier with little agriculture) is excluded. Of more interest than this bivariate relationship
would be whether the interaction of traded crop production and farm leverage was a deter-
minant of auto sales in 1930. (We focus on traded crops because those are the farm products
whose prices fell most.) The hypothesis--consistent with Olney (1999)--is that the negative

                                                                                                     25
effect of traded crop production on auto sales would have been largest in those areas with the
most farm leverage. In other words, we expect farmers to have cut back most on spending
in response to farm product price declines in places where their debt burdens were heaviest.
       To test this hypothesis we would like to estimate:

       %Auto salesi,1929:Q2-Q3-1930:Q2-Q3 = 0 + 1 Traded crop p.c.i + 2 Leveragei                        (3)

                                                 + 3 Traded crop p.c.i × Leveragei +  Xi + i .

       The problem is that with 49 observations we lack the statistical power to do this estima-
tion; in our 49 observation sample, there is essentially no variation in the interaction term
that is not explained by the level of traded crop production and leverage. The R2 of the
regression of the interaction on the levels of traded crop production and leverage is 0.998.
Thus we cannot plausibly identify 3 .
       Despite our inability to estimate equation 3, we have three reasons to believe that 3 is
negative, that more debt was associated with a larger decline in spending when farm product
prices fell. First, a negative 3 is predicted by theory. Second, in Hausman et al. (2019)
we estimate a regression similar to (3) on nationwide county auto sales data in 1933, a time
when farm product prices rose; we find that higher farm product prices had a larger effect
on spending in counties where more farms were mortgaged. Third, recent evidence from
the 2008 financial crisis suggests that more leverage was associated with larger declines in
household consumption (Mian, Rao, and Sufi, 2013).
       The second argument suggesting that farmers had a relatively high MPC concerns the
distribution of the benefits of lower farm product prices. Insofar as lower farm product prices
benefited urban workers, many of whom were losing their jobs in 1930, it is not obvious that
the difference between the MPCs of the winners and losers would be large. Limited pass-
through meant, however, that it was businesses as well as workers who benefited from lower
farm product prices. And it is quite plausible that the marginal propensity to spend of
businesses was much below that of farmers.22
  22
     Some of the farm products whose prices fell most, such as cotton and tobacco (Table 1), were exported
in large quantities. This meant that some of the benefit of lower farm product prices accrued to households
and businesses abroad. In the same way, however, U.S. households and businesses benefited from lower
prices of imported agricultural goods, such as coffee, sugar, and rubber. U.S. trade in agricultural products
was roughly balanced; therefore, there was likely to have been a rough balance between the exported and

                                                         26
    Limited pass-through was driven by the stickiness of many final goods prices at the
beginning of the Depression. For example, while the producer price of tobacco fell 23 percent
from 1929-1930, the price of a pack of cigarettes rose 2 percent.23 Retail bread prices fell
0.17 cents per pound while the price of the farm product input fell 0.26 cents.24 And while
the price of the wheat input to a 28-oz package of wheat cereal fell by 0.8 cents between
1929:Q2-Q3 and 1930:Q2-Q3, the retail price fell only 0.2 cents (United States Department
of Agriculture (1945), table 42, p. 195). These (and other) examples suggest that in 1930
businesses producing final goods from farm products often benefited from lower farm product
prices.25



5 Aggregate effect
    To obtain a quantitative sense of how farmers' relatively high MPC could have led to
aggregate effects of lower farm product prices, we follow Hausman et al. (2019). There
we argued that the aggregate effect of a farm product price change on car sales can be
approximated by

                                  Farm area income per capita                    w
    %Cars =  × f ×                                            ×           1-                ×      µt        (4)

 is the coefficient from the cross-state regression of the percent change in car sales on
the farm share of the population. From column 1 of Table 2 this is -0.32. f is the farm
share of the U.S. population, which in 1930 was 24.8 percent. We call the product of  and
imported benefits of lower farm product prices. (In 1928-29, U.S. agricultural exports totaled $1.8 billion,
imports $2.2 billion (United States Department of Agriculture, 1936, table 421, p. 292).) So we do not
consider redistribution between the U.S. and foreign countries in our aggregate analysis below. We are
indebted to Walker Hanlon for alerting us to this issue.

f a naive extrapolation, since it is what one would guess about the aggregate effect from
assuming that the aggregate effect of farmers on economic performance was exactly equal to
the cross-sectional effect.

       As discussed above, this naive extrapolation is wrong since the cross-sectional coefficient
measures both the negative effect of lower farm product prices on farmers and the positive
effect of lower farm product prices on nonfarmers. We assume that there are two types of
nonfarmers: capitalists and workers. By assumption, capitalists have a MPC of zero, so that
gains from lower farm product prices absorbed by businesses have no effect on aggregate
demand. Thus, for instance, we assume that the gains of cigarette manufacturers from lower
tobacco prices do not lead to more investment spending by cigarette manufacturers. Nonfarm
workers, by contrast, do have a positive MPC, and we assume that they spend a substantial
fraction of their gains from lower farm product prices. We believe this assumption to be
reasonable given, for instance, the evidence in Gelman, Gorodnichenko, Kariv, Koustas,
Shapiro, Silverman, and Tadelis (2019) on consumers' spending response to lower gas prices
in 2014-2015; Gelman et al. (2019) find an MPC near 1 from the increase in income due to
lower gas prices. While gas prices may be uniquely salient, it is likely that lower farm product
prices, insofar as they passed through to lower consumer (e.g. food) prices did increase real
worker spending, including that on cars.

       These assumptions are reflected in our adjustment for redistribution.26 The adjustment
             w
factor,  f
           , equals the extent to which lower farm product prices were passed through to
workers ( ) times the ratio of the marginal propensity to consume of workers (w ) to the
marginal propensity to consume of farmers (f ). As in Hausman et al. (2019), we consider a
                                                       w
range of values for the redistribution factor,  f
                                                  , of 0.3 to 0.7, and a range for the aggregate
spending multiplier of 1 to 3. Also as in Hausman et al. (2019), we ignore the possible
quantitative contribution of intertemporal substitution, i.e. the contractionary effect of
lower inflation expectations caused by lower farm product prices.

       The results of this exercise are shown in Table 6. Columns (2) through (4) show the

  26
    The adjustment for the ratio of farm area income per capita to national income per capita is a mechanical
adjustment made necessary by the fact that farm areas tended to be poorer than nonfarm areas, and thus
cross-sectional estimates exaggerate the aggregate effect of farmers on the national economy. See Hausman
et al. (2019) for further discussion.

percent decline in car sales accounted for by lower farm product prices for given assumptions
about the redistribution factor and the aggregate multiplier. Columns (5) through (7) divide
these estimates by the total decline in new car sales growth from 1929:Q2-Q3 to 1930:Q2-Q3
to show the fraction of the decline in new car sales growth explained by lower farm product
prices. These estimates show that lower farm product prices had a significant effect on
the downturn in the initial year of the Depression unless one believes: (1) that lower farm
product prices were passed through to urban workers ( high), (2) that urban workers had
a MPC similar to farmers (w close to f ), and (3) that the aggregate multiplier was low.
For example, a mid-range estimate of the redistribution factor (0.5) and of the aggregate
multiplier (2) suggests that had farm product prices not fallen, the downturn in the initial
year of the Depression would have been 15 percent smaller.




6 Conclusion
    We argue that the agriculture sector played an important rule in propagating negative
shocks that hit the U.S. economy in 1929 and 1930. Declines in world demand translated into
large declines in farm product prices and farmers' incomes. Income declines in turn lowered
farmers' expenditure, a process likely intensified by farmers' large nominal debt burdens.
    We find that between mid-1929 and mid-1930 car sales fell most in states most exposed
to farm product price declines. While less robust, we find a similar pattern across Ohio
counties. The rough consistency of the county results with the state results is reassuring

                                                29
evidence that the effect we find is real and is not an artifact of a spurious cross-state corre-
lation. These cross-sectional results are themselves of interest; they show, for instance, that
knowing the farm share of a state's population in 1930 is quite predictive of the severity of
a state's economic contraction in 1930. We are, however, ultimately interested in the ag-
gregate implications of low farm product prices. To estimate these, we need a model. This
section is necessarily more speculative. But a plausible range of parameters suggest that the
mechanism through which farm product prices lowered spending by farmers explains 10-30
percent of the decline in U.S. output before the first banking crisis.

   Importantly, this may be a conservative, lower bound for the impact of lower farm product
prices on the U.S. economy. Because of the difficulty in quantifying the effect, our model
deliberately excludes the contractionary effect of lower farm product prices operating through
deflation and deflationary expectations. But this effect could have been large: plummeting
farm product prices were one of the early indicators of the severe deflation that began in
1930.

   This paper's concern is with a specific historical episode. But there are contemporary
implications. A growing theoretical and empirical literature in macroeconomics shows the
importance of redistribution as a propagation mechanism for macroeconomic shocks. Much
of the empirical motivation for this literature comes from the experience of the 2008-2009
financial crisis and recession in which the costs of falling house prices were concentrated on
indebted households. The large spending response of these households to this negative shock
was a key driver of the recessions' severity (Mian et al., 2013).

   Farmers in 1930 are the analog to mortgaged households in 2008. They had high levels
of debt and their spending was sensitive to income declines. Just as declines in spending by
mortgaged households explain a part of the 2008-09 recession, so declines in farmers' spending
explain part of the early U.S. Great Depression. This result supports macroeconomists'
recent focus on redistribution. It is also a reminder of the value of a detailed understanding
of an economy's structure even for aggregate questions. Redistribution effects depend on the
distribution of income and on the spending propensities of the affected groups. Thus our
work also supports the long-standing concern of economic historians with agriculture in the
interwar period.

A Data appendix for Table 1
A.1 Prices Price data come from United States Department of Agriculture (1936) with the
exception of tobacco price data which come from Strauss and Bean (1940), table 24, p. 69.
We seasonally adjust these data by regressing the log price on monthly dummies, excluding
the year 1933 because of the extreme price movements in spring 1933. For further details on
the price sources, see Hausman et al. (2019), online appendix C.1. All sources and methods
used for the prices in Table 1 are the same as those described there.

A.2 Production

   · For wheat, corn, oats, cotton, tobacco, hay, potatoes, milk and chickens, farm product
     value, production, and trade data are from United States Department of Agriculture
     (1934) and United States Department of Agriculture (1936) as specified in appendix
     C.1 of Hausman et al. (2019).

   · Cattle: 1929 farm product value is equal to that given for cattle and calves in United
     States Department of Agriculture (1931), table 371, p. 842 minus 1929 calf production
     times the 1929 calf producer price from United States Department of Agriculture (1936)
     table 307, p. 213. Production in 1929 is from United States Department of Agriculture
     (1931), table 370, pp. 840-841. Production in 1930 is from United States Department
     of Agriculture (1932), table 328, pp. 782-783. Trade data are for beef and beef products
     and are from United States Department of Agriculture (1933), table 320, p. 600.

   · Hogs: Farm product value is from United States Department of Agriculture (1931),
     table 396, p. 860. Production in 1929 is from United States Department of Agriculture
     (1931), table 395, p. 859; production in 1930 is from United States Department of
     Agriculture (1932), table 347, p. 795. Trade data are for hog products and are from
     United States Department of Agriculture (1933), table 341, p. 792.

   · Eggs: Sources are as specified in Hausman et al. (2019), except trade data which are
     from United States Department of Agriculture (1932), table 438, p. 859.


B Data appendix for Figure 3
     The nominal price index for traded crops is equal to j pricej × weightj for traded crops
j , and the nominal price index for nontraded farm products is equal to k pricek × weightk
for nontraded farm products k . The indices shown in the figure are put in real terms by
dividing by the nonseasonally adjusted CPI, FRED series CPIAUCNS (the CPI does not
have obvious seasonality at this time).
     For the prices of all products other than wool, the sources and method of seasonal ad-
justment are as detailed above (appendix A.1 with further details in Hausman et al. (2019),
online appendix C.1). For wool, monthly prices are from United States Department of Agri-
culture (1936), table 347, p. 244, with seasonal adjustment done using data from January
1926 through December 1935, excluding 1933.

                                                 34
                                                    farm product valuej
   The weight for traded crop j is equal to all traded crop farm product value in 1929, and
                                                               farm product valuek
the weight for nontraded farm product k is equal to all nontraded farm product     value in
1929. For milk and chickens we use the value sold rather than produced. Farm product
value for cattle and hogs are as listed above (appendix A.2). All other farm product value
data come from Haines et al. (2015).


C New registrations as a measure of car sales
   In the paper, we use new car registrations as a measure of new car sales. The U.S.
Department of Commerce (1934b) provides a useful discussion and data on the relationship
between new registrations and unit sales. The Department of Commerce writes (pp. 16-17):

        Registration figures have been available and in normal times they undoubtedly
        offer a rather accurate picture of the general trend in unit sales.
        . . . [Sales] represent the number of cars actually sold each month, whereas the
        registration figures are unduly decreased or increased in certain months because
        of lax enforcement of licensing provisions and other factors, which allow the
        holding over of car sold in one month for registration in a later month when the
        cost of licensing will be lower. The months of June and July and December and
        January are especially affected by these factors.

    While this statement raises concerns about measurement error from using new regis-
trations as an indicator of sales, the available data suggest this error is quite small. The
Department of Commerce (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1934b) computed an index of the
dollar volume of nationwide new car sales. The index begins in 1929, but actual (rather than
imputed) data on unit sales begin only in 1930. Since the data are also unavailable by state,
the series is of no use for our paper. Still, we can use it to see how well new car registrations
approximate dollar sales during the Depression. Reassuringly, the answer is very well. Over
the entire period 1930-33 and in 1930 alone, the correlation between month-over-month per-
centages in dollar sales and new registrations is roughly 0.88.27 Figure C.1 confirms the close
correspondence between the two series.

      Nationwide new passenger car registrations are from NBER macrohistory series m01109.

 Notes: The dependent variable is the percent change in non-seasonally adjusted auto sales from the 1929:Q2-
Q3 average to the 1930:Q2-Q3 average. p.c. means per capita. While we observe monthly auto sales in
1929-30 in 50 counties, there are only 49 observations since 1928 car sales were not reported for Morgan
county. Robust standard errors in parenthesis.  p < 0.1,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01 Sources: New car
registrations - see text; population and percent of the population on farms - the 1930 Census as reported
in Haines and ICPSR (2010); 1929 value of crops sold per capita and farm product categories - the 1940
Census as reported in Haines et al. (2015); 1928 car sales - calculated from the Industrial and Commercial
Ohio Yearbook (1930), table XVI, p. 104 which lists by county both 1929 car sales and the 1928-29 percent
change in car sales.
