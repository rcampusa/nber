                                             ABSTRACT

        We provide an introduction to the use of return based style analysis of Sharpe (1992) in practice.
We demonstrate the importance of selecting the right style benchmarks and how the use of inappropriate
style benchmarks may lead to wrong conclusions. When style analysis is applied to sector oriented funds
such as healthcare, precious metals, energy, technology, etc., the set of benchmarks should include sector
or industry indexes. Following Glosten and Jagannathan (1994), Fung and Hsieh (2001), and Agarwal
and Naik (2001), we show how to analyze the investment style of hedge fund managers by including the
returns on selected option based strategies as style benchmarks. In the examples we consider, return based
style analysis provides insights not available through commonly used “peer” evaluation alone.

Introduction

          Several changes have taken place in the past three decades in the U.S. capital

markets.      An important one among them is the reduction in the direct holdings of

corporate equities by individual investors and a corresponding increase in institutional

holdings. The growth of mutual funds and pension funds during this period has been the

primary cause of the sharp increase in the institutional holdings of equities in the U.S.A.

Whereas mutual funds and pension funds held only 14% of all U.S. corporate equities in

1970, they held almost 40% by 20011. While holding equities through money

management institutions has made it possible for individual investors to reap

diversification benefits and plan sponsors to benefit from specialization it has not been

without cost. Individual investors as well as pension plan sponsors who invest through

professional money managers need to monitor their actions and evaluate their

performance and this introduces invisible agency costs.

          For example, consider a large plan sponsor who allocates the funds across several

money managers based on each manager’s unique investment style. How can a plan

sponsor verify that the investment decisions taken by the manger and the securities he

purchased are consistent with the assigned investment style? How can a plan sponsor

ensure that the bets taken by different external managers do not offset each other?

Furthermore, external money mangers are compensated based on their performance. In

many cases an active investment manger’s performance is assessed in terms of her ability

                                                    2
to “beat a benchmark”2. How can the pension fund manger evaluate the nature of the risk

the manager undertook in order to attain a performance that is superior to that of the

benchmark? These problems are not unique to plan sponsors however, but are also of

considerable concern to Individual investors who own actively managed mutual funds.

          Return-based Style Analysis provides a way of identifying the asset mix style of

the fund manager and comparing it with the asset mix style of the performance

benchmark. This enables the plan sponsor or an individual investor to evaluate how well

an active money manager performed and whether he provides diversification benefits in a

multi-manager portfolio. The use of the technique however, is not without limitations. As

we illustrate in several examples the technique relies crucially on the correct specification

of the style benchmark asset classes. Inappropriate or inadequate choice of style

benchmarks may lead to wrong inferences about performance and the level of “active”

management. For example, when style analysis is applied to sector oriented funds such as

healthcare, precious metals, energy, technology, etc., the set of benchmarks should

include sector or industry indexes. We also show how to analyze the investment style of

hedge fund managers by including the returns on selected option based strategies as style

benchmarks. In the examples we consider, return based style analysis provides insights

not available through commonly used “peer” evaluation alone.

          The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. We provide a brief overview of

Portfolio-based Style Analysis in section 1 and review the underlying theory behind

Return based Style Analysis in section 2. We provide several examples showing how to

    additional 15 basis points for each 1% of performance over the benchmark such as the S&P500. Typically
    the fees are determined from time to time through negotiation between the manger and the pension plan
    sponsor.

implement Return Based Style Analysis using mutual fund data in section 3 and examine

style consistency over time using a ‘rolling windows’ methodology in section 4. We

show how to evaluate the performance of money mangers with style analysis in section 5

and discuss some common pitfalls in implementing the technique in section 6. We

discuss the use of Return-based Style Analysis of hedge fund managers who use dynamic

trading strategies and derivative instruments in section 7 and conclude in section 8.


1.     Portfolio-Composition-Based Style Analysis

The performance of money managers is often evaluated by comparing the performance of

the managed portfolio against the performance of a particular manager-specific passive

benchmark (e.g. S&P500 for a Large Cap manager). Performance attribution seeks to

explain the sources of the difference between the manager’s performance and that of the

specified benchmark. In other words, once it is clear what the results were, the goal is to

find out why they were what they were. One commonly used approach is to examine the

portfolio composition of the manager’s portfolio and compare the characteristics or

attributes of the securities the manager has invested in with the characteristics of the

securities that make up the performance benchmark. Some of the common characteristics

that are often used in such comparisons include: Market cap, book to market (price) ratio,

historic earning growth rate, dividend yield and for fixed income securities attributes

such as duration, rating, etc. The attributes are averaged across securities and the returns

associated with each attribute are determined.

       Table 1 provides a simple example of a global manager who outperformed his

benchmark during 2001 by 165 basis points (1.65%). The analysis shows that of the total




                                             4
difference, 115 basis points could be attributed to the portfolio “tilt” toward investing in

Japanese stocks during a period in which Japanese stocks outperformed stocks of firms

from other Developed countries and Emerging Markets countries. The remaining 50 basis

points could then be associated with the manger’s ability to select “winners” within the

various regions.

       As mentioned earlier the use of portfolio based style analysis requires knowledge

of the composition of the managed portfolio as well as the performance benchmark at the

time of the analysis. In the case of a pension plan sponsor the money manger typically

would provide the necessary information to the pension plan for performing the analysis.

In the case of mutual funds, the investor can obtain this information from quarterly

filings. Some websites also provide information on mutual fund characteristics computed

using portfolio-weight-based style analysis and classify the funds they cover into various

categories.

       Table 2 displays information available from the Morningstar web site

(www.morningstar.com), for the Goldman Sachs Growth and Income Fund as of January

2002. Panel A, displays the equity characteristics of the fund portfolio and a comparison

to the S&P500 Index. The portfolio attributes represent an aggregation of the individual

securities comprising the fund portfolio (the top 25 holdings are shown in panel B). The

fund invests in only 95 stocks with no bonds, and also maintains some exposure to

foreign markets (roughly 5%). The companies owned by the fund are much smaller than

those included in the S&P500 (the median firm size is roughly $28 billion versus $58

billion in the S&P500) and the industry weightings differ substantially (see panel C). The

fund has a somewhat higher average Price to Book ratio, but a lower Price to Earning




                                             5
ratio. This is probably because the stocks owned by the fund experienced a higher

earning growth relative to price in the past than the stocks comprising the benchmark.

The difference in returns between the fund and the benchmark that may arise may be

attributed to the characteristics bets the fund took relative to the performance benchmark.

For example, the difference in industry weighting between the fund and the benchmark,

coupled with the returns for each industry can be used to calculate the contribution of

‘industry bias’ to the overall return difference as shown in Table 1.

       Portfolio-based Style Analysis requires information on portfolio composition,

which may be difficult to obtain. Further the classification of individual securities into

slots based on characteristics can involve substantial amount of judgment. For example,

a conglomerate firm would typically have operations in several different sectors of the

economy and it may be difficult to identify how much of the firm goes into each sector.

In addition, portfolio compositions may change over time. Point in time categorization

may result in significant style “drift”. Such “drift” would render long-term stylistic

comparisons not very meaningful. One solution is to calculate these characteristics at

different points in time and use multiple portfolios to classify the investment manager.

       Another problem arises from simply calculating portfolio characteristics based on

the portfolio holdings. A domestic equity mutual fund investing in domestic stocks that

derive a majority of their revenue from sales abroad will clearly be influenced by factors

in foreign economies. If the foreign economies go into recession, the fund will be

affected. In this way, the fund, although domestic, responds to factors in foreign

economies with a manner similar to an international equity fund. An investor interested in

foreign exposure may be able to obtain it through investing in such a domestic fund. In




                                             6
William Sharpe’s oft-quoted words, what is important here is that “If it acts like a duck,

assume it’s a duck”. One advantage of the approach however, is that it provides updated

information on the money manger investment strategy and asset allocation.


2.        Return-based Style Analysis

While it is possible to determine a fund’s investment style from a detailed analysis of the

securities held by the fund, a simpler approach that uses only the realized fund-returns is

possible. Return-based Style Analysis, requires only easily obtained information, while

Portfolio-based Style Analysis requires knowledge of the actual composition of the

portfolio.

2.1       Relation to multifactor models

Multiple factor models are commonly used to characterize how industry factors and

economy wide pervasive factors affect the return on individual securities and portfolios

of securities. In such models a portfolio of factors is used to replicate the return on a

security as closely as possible.               Equation (1) gives a generic n-factor model that

decomposes the return on security i into different components:

                                  ~              ~              ~                    ~
                                  Ri ,t = β i ,1 F1,t + β i , 2 F2,t + .... + β i ,n Fn,t + ε~i ,t      t = 1,2,3...T   (1)

~                                              ~                                    ~
Ri ,t is the return on security i in period t; F1 represents the value of factor 1; F2 the value

             ~
of factor 2; Fn the value of the nth factor and ε~i is the “non-factor” component of the

return. The coefficients β i ,1 , β i , 2 , ...β i ,n represent the exposure of security i to the

different      set      of     industry            and          economy              wide            pervasive     factors.
      ~        ~                ~
β i ,1 F1,t + β i , 2 F2,t + .... + β i ,n Fn ,t is the particular combination (portfolio) of factors that best


                                                            7
                      ~
replicates the return Ri ,t . In factor models the portfolio weights, β i ,1 , β i , 2 ,...., β i ,n need

                           ~
not sum to 1 and a factor, Fk ,t , need not necessarily be the return on a portfolio of

financial assets.

        Sharp’s (1988, 1992) Return-based Style Analysis can be considered a special

case of the generic factor model. In Return-based Style Analysis we replicate the

performance of a managed portfolio over a specified time period as best as possible by

the return on a passively managed portfolio of style benchmark index portfolios. The two

important differences when compared to factor models are: (i) Every factor is a return on

a particular style benchmark index portfolio, and (ii) The weights assigned to the factors

sum to unity. Rewriting equation 1 yields,

                         ~
                         R p ,t = [δ 1, p x1,t + δ 2, p x 2,t + .... + δ n , p x n,t ] + ε~t , p   t = 1,2,3,...T (2)

      ~
Where R p ,t represents the managed portfolio return at time t and x1 , x 2 ...x n are the

return on style benchmark index portfolios. The slope coefficients δ 1 , δ 2 ....δ n represent

the managed portfolio average allocation among the different style benchmark index

portfolios – or asset classes during the relevant time period. The sum of the terms in the

square brackets is that part of the managed portfolio return that can be explained by its

exposure to the different style benchmarks and is termed the style of the manger. The

residual component of the portfolio return - ε~t, p reflects the manager decision to depart

from the benchmark composition within each style benchmark class. This is the part of

return attributable to the manger stock picking ability and is termed selection.

        Given a set of monthly returns for a managed fund, along with comparable returns

for a selected set of style benchmark index portfolios (asset classes), the portfolio


                                                             8
weights, δ 1 , δ 2 ....δ n , in equation (2) can be estimated using multiple regression analysis.

However, in order to get coefficients’ estimates that closely reflect the fund’s actual

investment policy it is important to incorporate restrictions on the style benchmark

weights. For example, the following two restrictions are typically imposed:

                                                               δ j , p ≥ 0 ∀ j ∈ {1,2,...n}               (3)


                                                                δ 1, p + δ 2, p + .... + δ n , p = 1      (4)

The first restriction corresponds to the constraint that the fund manager is not allowed to

take short positions in securities. The second restriction imposes the requirement that we

are interested in approximating the managed fund return as closely as possible by the

return on a portfolio of passive style benchmark indexes. The no short sale restriction is

standard for pension funds and mutual funds3. For funds known to employ some leverage

or short selling such as hedge funds other bounds may be invoked.

           As before, the objective of the analysis is to select a set of coefficients that

minimizes the “unexplained” variation in returns (i.e. the variance of ε~t , p ) subject to the

stated constraints. The presence of inequality constraints in (3) requires the use of

quadratic programming since standard regression analysis packages typically do not

allow imposing such restriction. Rearranging Equation (2) yields,

                                                                                Ε p = Rp − Χ ⋅ ∆ p       (5)




3
    The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires mutual funds to state their likely use of derivatives in their
    prospectuses. Although most of the mutual funds do explicitly state so in their prospectuses, they rarely
    use derivatives. Koski and Pontiff (1999) find that only 20% of the mutual funds in their sample of 675
    equity mutual funds invest in derivatives.


                                                       9
where Χ is the T × n matrix of asset classes returns, R p is the T × 1 vector of portfolio

returns and ∆ p is the n × 1 vector of slope coefficients δ 1 , δ 2 ....δ n . The term on the left

Ε p can be interpreted as the T dimensional column vector, [ ε~t , p , t = 1,2..]’, of differences

between the return on the fund and the return on the portfolio of passive benchmark style

indexes corresponding to the n dimensional vector ∆ p of style benchmark portfolio

weights – also referred to as style-asset class exposures. The goal of Return-based Style

Analysis is to find the set of non-negative style-asset class exposures δ 1 , δ 2 ....δ n that sum

to 1 and minimize the variance of ε~t , p , referred to as fund’s tracking error over the style

benchmark. Note that the objective of this analysis is not to choose style benchmarks that

make the fund “look good” or “bad”. Rather the goal is to infer as much as possible about

a fund’s exposures to variations in the returns of the given style benchmark asset classes

during the period of interest.

        It is also important to understand that the ‘style’ identified in such an analysis

represents an average of potentially changing styles over the period covered. Month-to-

month deviations of the fund’s return from that of style itself can arise from selection of

specific securities within one or more asset classes, rotating among asset classes, or both.

We use the term selection to cover all such sources of tracking differences.

2.2     “Active” versus “Passive” management

The decomposition of a managed portfolio return into two components, style and

selection, provides a natural distinction between “active” and “passive” managers. An

“active” manager is looking for ways to improve performance by investing in asset

classes as well as individual securities within each asset classes that she considers



                                               10
underpriced. She will therefore deviate from the style of the performance benchmark

index – i.e., tilt towards style benchmarks that she considers undervalued and away from

style benchmarks she considers overvalued – and in addition select individual securities

within each style benchmark asset class that she considers as being good buys. Hence

she will typically have different exposure to the style benchmark asset classes when

compared to her performance benchmark. She will also be holding a different portfolio

of securities within each style benchmark asset class. She may also be holding securities

that fall outside the range of asset classes spanned by the style benchmarks

       As a result, the benchmarks will have a lower explanatory power and the residual

terms ε~i will be larger for the managed funds when compared to their respective

performance benchmarks. In contrast, “passively managed” funds do not buy and sell

securities based on research and analysis; rather, the fund’s assets are simply deployed

among different asset classes. As a result, the ε~i 's will be closer to zero for passively

managed funds when compared to actively managed funds. In this sense, a passive fund

manger provides an investor with an investment style, while an active manger provides

both style and selection.

       A useful metric for identifying “active” managers from “passive” managers is the

R2 or the proportion of the variance “explained” by the selected style benchmark asset

classes. Using the traditional definition of R-Square we have for portfolio p:


                                                              2    Var (ε~p )
                                                            R = 1−       ~             (6)
                                                                   Var ( R p )

The right side of Equation (6) equals 1 minus the proportion of variance “unexplained”.
                                                                               ~
The resulting R-squared value thus indicates the proportion of the variance of R p



                                            11
“explained” by the n asset classes. It is important to recognize that this measure indicates

only the extent to which a specific model fits the data at hand. A better test of the

usefulness of any implementation is its ability to explain performance out of sample.

Notice also that the vector of residuals is not necessarily orthogonal to the matrix of

benchmark returns as is the case in multivariate regression, because of the constraints

(e.g Χ ' ⋅ Ε p ≠ 0).     As     a    result,       the        alternative   definition   for   R-square,

( R 2 = ∆' p ⋅ Χ ' ⋅ Χ ⋅ ∆ p / Var ( R p )) , is in general not equivalent to the definition given in

(6) for Return-based Style Analysis.


3.        Implementing Return-based Style Analysis

To demonstrate how Return-based Style Analysis is applied in practice, we analyze a set

of open-end mutual funds returns using StyleAdvisor software of Zephyr Associates

Inc. We use twelve asset classes, each represented by a market capitalization-weighted

index of a large number of securities (see Appendix 1 for a description of the asset

classes). In addition to Bills (Cash equivalent with less than 3-months to maturity), the

model includes intermediate and long term government bonds (between 1-10 years and

over 10 respectively) and corporate bonds as 3 distinct asset classes. Longer maturities

government bonds correspond to higher risk due to variation in the shape of the yield

curve and higher expected returns. Corporate bonds returns are also affected by changes

in the market price of default risk (credit spread).

          We use the Russell 3000 index as a measure of the value of all publicly traded

corporate equities in the U.S.A. The Index tracks the performance of the 3,000 largest

                                                         12
U.S. companies and represents approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market.

The largest 1,000 companies in the Russell 3000 constitute the Russell 1000 index and

the remaining companies are included in the Russell 2000 index. The Frank Russell

Company also assigns all stocks in each index to growth and value sub indices based on

their relative price-to-book ratio and the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S)

consensus analyst forecast for long-term earnings per share growth rate. All four indexes

are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, market cap-weighted, annually rebalanced and

include only common stocks domiciled in the United States and its territories. This

division captures the two key dimensions that previous research found to affect the

variation in equity returns: size (“small/large”) and book to market (“growth/value”).

       The returns on foreign stocks are measured by MSCI Japan, MSCI EASEA and

MSCI EM Free, which represent Japan, Developed Countries excluding Japan and

Emerging Markets countries, respectively. Finally, the Lehman non-U.S. bond index is

used as a proxy for all fixed income securities outside the U.S. It is important to note that

each index represents a strategy that could be followed at low cost using index funds (or

Exchange Traded Funds for some of the equity indices).

3.1    Vanguard Windsor Fund

Figure 1.1 portrays the results of style analysis for the Vanguard Windsor mutual fund

using return data for the period January 1988 - August 2001. The fund is classified as a

large value fund by Morningstar and has $18 billion in assets under management as of

December 2001. The bar chart suggests that consistent with Morningstar classification,

the fund invests primarily in large value stocks (roughly 83% invested in the Russell

1000 value) with the rest invested in small value stocks. As indicated by the pie chart



                                             13
(Figure 1.2) during the period investigated over 87% of the month-to-month variation in

returns on the fund could be explained by the concurrent variation in the return of this

particular mix of large and small value stocks. The pie chart also demonstrates the

additional information we get from Return-based Style analysis. Standard & Poor’s 500

stock index, a commonly used performance benchmark for large cap funds, explains only

66% of the variation in monthly returns of Vanguard Windsor Fund whereas the return on

the style benchmark asset classes explain 87%. It would be wrong to conclude that the

relative low R-Square with respect to S&P500 is due to Windsor management following

a very active strategy. Part of the low R-Square with respect to the benchmark is due to

the fact that the S&P500 may not be the best performance measure. The S&P500 had an

equal share of value and growth stocks whereas Windsor invested nearly 83% of its

assets in value stocks. A large cap value index may be a more appropriate performance

benchmark for the Windsor fund.

3.2    Growth and Income funds

The universe of domestic equity funds in the U.S. includes thousands of mutual funds.

Investors, frequently make inferences about a fund’s investment policy from its

classification by companies such as Morningstar or Lipper or simply from the fund’s

name. We now examine whether Return-based Style Analysis provides any incremental

information beyond that conveyed by the fund’s classification and investment policy as it

appears in its prospectus. Specifically, we compare the results of style analysis for a

group of funds, all with an identical name (Growth and Income Fund) offered by several

leading money management firms. The funds objective, size and fee structure are

described in Appendix 2.



                                           14
       An examination of the investment objective and strategy of each fund (based on

its prospectus) reveals little differences. Basically, all funds follow a value strategy where

they invest in stocks they deem undervalued based on fundamental research or compared

to similar companies. The funds focus on stocks of large and established companies that

are expected to pay dividends (the income component). The funds maintain a long-term

investment horizon and do not engage in market timing. An investor who considers

investing in a growth and income fund should have little reason to prefer one fund over

the other based on their declared investment policies.

       The style analysis results for the group of funds using return data for the period

March 1993 through August 2001 are presented in Figure 2.1-2.2. Despite the similarities

in objectives and investment strategy they have substantial differences in their Style.

While Putnam’s style reflects over 90% exposure to large value stocks, Goldman Sachs

fund has less than half that exposure. Although the fund followed a ‘value strategy’, the

analysis reveals extensive style exposure to Large Growth (20%) and Small Value. These

findings are generally consistent with results of the Portfolio-based Style analysis for GS

Growth & Income fund reported in the previous section. The comparison reveals

however, the advantages of the technique, mainly its easy graphical representation and

quantitative nature.

       The style of the Vanguard fund on the other hand, reflects an S&P500 like

composition with equal holding of large value and growth stocks. The exposures to

European and Japanese stocks might reflect the activity of American companies in these

markets, rather than a direct investment in foreign stocks. Note also the difference in the

selection component of return among the funds. The relatively low R-Square obtained




                                             15
using style benchmarks for the Goldman Sachs fund may indicate that the fund may be

pursuing a relatively more active stock selection strategy within each style asset class.

This may also explain why the fund charges the highest front-load commission (5.50%)

and has the highest expense ratio (1.19%). Overall, the results point to substantial style

differences among funds that appear similar based on stated objectives.

3.3     Fidelity Convertible Securities Fund

Although convertibles are not represented as a distinct asset class in the model, Return-

based Style Analysis is able to capture over 86% of the monthly variation in the fund’s

returns through a combination of stocks, bonds and bills (Figure 3.1-3.2). This should not

come as a surprise however, as convertible bonds characteristics of both stocks and

bonds. These results demonstrate the versatility of return-based style. Note that the fund

holds a substantial fraction (about 12%) of its assets in foreign securities (probably

convertibles) as measured by its exposure to the MSCI indexes.

3.4     Style Analysis for multiple-manager portfolios

The effective asset mix represents the style of the investor’s overall portfolio or pension

fund overall assets. Once the style of the individual mutual funds or money mangers have

been estimated, it is quite straightforward to determine the corresponding effective asset

mix. Denote by ω j the proportion of the assets allocated to manger j. The overall

                   ~
portfolio return ( R P ) will be:

                                                                    ~               ~
                                                                    RP =   ∑ω
                                                                           j
                                                                                j   Rj   (7)


Substituting Equation (2) in (7) yields another linear equation:




                                             16
                             ~                                                                        
                             RP ,t = ∑ ω jδ 1,t       x1,t + ∑ ω jδ 2,t      x2,t + ... ∑ ω j δ n,t    x n ,t   (8)
                                      j                       j                          j            

which can be rewritten as follows,

                ~                                                          ~
                R p ,t = [Ψ1, p x1,t + Ψ2, p x2,t + .... + Ψn, p xn ,t ] + ζ t , p       t = 1,2,3,............T (9)

Where Ψ1, p , Ψ2, p ....Ψn, p are the pension fund or investor’s portfolio overall exposure to

each style benchmark asset class. As can be seen by comparing equation (8) and (9), each

Ψ j, p is the weighted average of the exposures of the different managers to style

benchmark asset class, j, with the relative amount of money allocated to each manager

used as the weight for that manager. The resulting effective style benchmark asset mix

will account for a large proportion of the month-to-month variation in the return of a

portfolio invested with several money managers. When the residual terms across different

managers are uncorrelated, diversification across different fund managers will

substantially reduce the variance of the aggregate non-factor component and thus

increase the portion of the variance attributable to asset allocation. Even if some of the

residuals are correlated, the use of multiple fund managers will often lead to a large

reduction in selection risk.




4.     Asset Allocation and Style Consistency over Time

It is important to remember that the style identified in each of the three examples, is in a

sense, an average of potentially changing styles over the period covered. Since a fund’s

style can change substantially over time, it is also helpful to study how the exposures to

various style benchmark asset classes evolve. For that purpose we conduct a series of


                                                         17
style analyses, using a fixed number of months for each analysis, rolling the time period

used for the analysis through time.

4.1    Vanguard Balanced Index fund

Figure 4.1 portrays the evolution of style for the Vanguard Balanced Index fund using a

60 months rolling window between October 1992 and August 2001. The point at the far

left of the diagram represents the fund style when the sixty months ending in September

1997 are analyzed. Every other point represents the results of an analysis using a different

set of sixty months. Note that each set has fifty eight months in common with its

predecessor. As its name suggests, the fund is indeed balanced, spreading its investments

among stocks, bonds and bills. As documented in Figure 4.2 style accounted for

practically all the variation in the fund’s return and remained largely constant throughout

the period analyzed.

4.2    Vanguard Windsor fund

In contrast, the style of Vanguard Windsor Fund changed several times between 1990 and

2001 (Figure 5). The fund was a “pure” value fund until August 1997, investing about

75% of its assets in large stocks and the rest in small stocks. It then eliminated

completely its exposure to small value stocks (Russell 2000 value) and replaced it with

mostly small growth stocks and emerging markets stock4. About a year later, another

style change occurred which lasted through the rest of the time period covered. The fund

began investing again in small value stocks but still kept an exposure to small growth

stocks (roughly 7%). The fund also developed a substantial exposure to emerging

markets through holding stocks of companies from these countries (10% on average).




                                            18
           The ability of Return-based Style Analysis to capture changes in investment style

over different time horizons is one of its key advantages. While Portfolio-based Style

Analysis description of a fund style is accurate for a point in time, Return based Style

Analysis describes an average style over a time period (much like a balance sheet and an

earning report) and can account for changes in style. An investor who owned shares in

the fund anytime after August 1998 and thought, based on Morningstar classification that

he was betting solely on a value strategy in the U.S., would in fact have also been

exposed to risks and rewards associated with investing in small growth stocks and

Emerging Markets to some extent.


5.         Performance Evaluation

While a passive fund manager provides investors with an investment style, an active

manager provides both style and selection. This suggests that the performance benchmark

should consist of a portfolio of asset classes that gives the desired exposure to benchmark

style asset classes. Superior performance relative to the performance benchmark which

provides a static mix of the style benchmark asset classes would justify the higher fees

usually paid to “active” as opposed to “passive” managers.

           We follow this approach and focus on the fund’s selection return, defined as the

difference between the fund’s return and that of a passive mix with the same style. The

assumption we make is that the active manager declares the fund style at the beginning of

each period and is engaged only in picking undervalued securities within each style

benchmark asset class – and that the style benchmark is a more appropriate benchmark



4
    Based on Morningstar records, there was no management change in that year.


                                                    19
for measuring performance than the commonly used S&P500 index5. Note that this

differs from the use of the ε~t, p ’s values obtained as by products of a style analysis,

because the ε~t, p ’s were constructed in-sample.

       To illustrate this approach for the Vanguard Windsor Fund we employ the following

steps for each month t:

1. The fund’s style is estimated, using returns from month t - 36 through t - 1. The

       length of the estimation period while somewhat arbitrary, tries to balance between

       two opposing issues. A longer estimation period reduces “noise” and provides a more

       accurate description of the fund’s style exposure. For active managers who

       dynamically rotate among several asset classes in addition to providing stock picking

       abilities however, a longer estimation period will not produce accurate estimates. A

       shorter estimation period will be able to better track such managers.

2. The return on the resulting style (i.e. using the coefficients estimated in step 1) is

       calculated for month t.

3. The difference between the actual return in month t and that of the style benchmark

       determined in the previous steps is computed. This difference is defined as the fund’s

       selection return for t.

       Figure 6 shows the cumulative excess returns from Jan 1988 through August 2001 for

Vanguard Windsor. In such a graph, increases result from positive selection returns and

decreases from negative ones. On average, the fund outperformed its style benchmarks by

0.027% per month, with a standard deviation of 1.69% per month. The t-statistics




5
    This approach would not be valid when the portfolio manager is a market or sector or style timer.


                                                       20
associated with the mean difference is however small in absolute value suggesting that

the average difference was not statistically significantly different from zero.

     Figure 7 demonstrates the advantages of using style analysis to analyze the

performance the way we have done. It compares the return on Vanguard Windsor with

the S&P500 stock index. The fund’s performance so measured was almost three times as

good as that shown previously: the cumulative difference was 9.75% and the average

difference was 7.6 basis points per month. However, such a comparison includes results

attributable to both style and selection. During the period in question the fund’s style

outperformed that of the S&P500. Indeed, this accounts for approximately two-thirds of

the fund’s superior performance. An investor choosing to invest in the fund could have

known that its style favored value and small stocks. The choice to expose some of the

portfolio to these assets classes is the investor’s. Results (good or bad) associated with

the choice of a style should be attributed to taking style bets.


6.         Common pitfalls in interpreting Style Analysis results

The popularity of Return-based Style Analysis lies in the ease with which it can be

applied. The ability to correctly interpret the results however depends on the selection of

appropriate style benchmark asset classes to use, which raises several questions. What

types of style benchmarks and how many style benchmarks should one include in the

model? Which index should be chosen to represent a style asset class when there are

several indexes available? Is the set of benchmarks appropriate for one fund necessarily

appropriate for another?




                                              21
        In general, it is desirable that the asset classes used in the model include as many

securities as possible, and are mutually exclusive such that no security is included in

more than one asset class. Benchmarks that are not mutually exclusive might cause the

factor weightings to oscillate between the correlated asset classes. A similar problem

arises, if the set of benchmarks is incomplete (i.e. not exhaustive) or inadequate. The

optimization algorithm will have trouble pinning down a benchmark that consistently

explains the fund’s behavior from period to period and, and the regression is likely to

flip-flop between those that temporarily provide a best fit (a fact, which will likely be

reflected in a low R2 as well). Finally, asset class returns should either have low

correlation with one another or, in cases where correlation is high, different standard

deviations.

        The number of asset classes used in the model, represents a tradeoff. Using a

larger number of distinct asset classes or a finer partition of the investment universe

facing the portfolio manager will provide more information and better tracking of the

portfolio performance. An example of that is the division of the Russell 2000 index to

growth and value sub indices, or the use of several regional indexes instead of the MSCI

EM (Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East). However, it is necessary to

consider not only the ability of a model to explain a given set of data but also its

parsimony. The use of a larger number of benchmarks has the potential of introducing

more “noise” into the analysis. This problem is especially acute, since we have no easily

available statistical procedure for assessing the significance of the exposure coefficients6.

In addition, the higher the number of benchmarks used, the longer the estimation period


6 The conventional assumptions regarding the distributional properties of the benchmark coefficients are
  not valid in the presence of inequality constraints as in (3).


                                                  22
required. Other things equal (e.g. R-Squared values), the fewer the asset classes, the

higher likelihood that the model will capture continuing fundamental relationship with

predictive content.

6.1     Model misspecification – an example for sector funds

Table 3 highlights the potential for misinterpretation of style analysis results when the

benchmarks used are inadequate. The column entitled “basic model”, presents the result

of style analysis performed on Putnam Utilities Growth and Income during January 1992

through August 2001. As demonstrated previously, in the case of Fidelity Convertible

Securities fund, the technique tracks how a portfolio returns co-vary with other assets

classes rather than its composition. Although utility funds hold common stocks, Putnam

Utility returns behave more like a passive portfolio invested in both stocks and bonds.

That is, utility revenues are “sticky” because of the regulatory process, causing shares of

such companies to have features that are both stock-like and bond-like. Note that Putnam

Utilities Growth and Income has large exposure to Large Value Stocks. It is not that the

fund invests in such stocks – it is just that this asset class reflects the return characteristics

of the fund’s investment in utilities during this period. Utility funds typically concentrate

their holdings in one industry and as a result style accounts for an unusually small

fraction (about 60%) of the monthly variation in returns. The low R2 is not a result of a

highly “active management” strategy, but merely a manifestation of inadequate

benchmarks7.

        It is clear from this example that when style analysis is applied for sector oriented

funds (such as healthcare, precious metals, energy, technology, etc.), the set of




                                               23
benchmarks should include sector or industry indexes. For example, in the case of a REIT

(Real Estate Investments Trust) asset classes related to real estate such as mortgages and

housing indexes will be used.

           The column entitled “Extended Model“ reports the analysis result for Putnam

Utilities when the basic 12 asset classes model is extended by adding three sector

indexes: Utilities, Communication and Energy, constructed by Dow Jones. The addition

of the Energy and Communications indexes reflects the focus of utility companies in

these industries and can potentially capture some of the variation in the fund’s return.

Contrasting the analysis results with and without the inclusion of sector indexes is

striking. The Selection component of returns decreases from roughly 33% to about 7%,

confirming our prior assertion that the fund does not employ a highly active management

strategy. As expected the fund invests primarily in utility stocks. The loading on Energy

and Communication indexes reflects the common component in returns of utility

companies stocks’ that operate in these industries (such as Gas, Electricity and Phone

companies), as well as actual holdings of energy and communication firms stocks. Note

the exposure to Bills, which probably results from the actual cash holdings the fund,

maintains to meet liquidity needs.

           We revisit the issue of model misspecification and inadequate benchmarks in the

next section, when we demonstrate how Style Analysis can be used to analyze the

performance of hedge funds by suitable choice of style index benchmark asset classes.

6.2        Interpreting R-Squared – “Active” management or inadequate benchmarks?




7
    The result is not unique for Putnam utility fund. Sharp (1992) reports a similar average value of R2 for a
     sample of utility funds.


                                                      24
Although some see a low value of R2, solely as an indicator of “active” management, a

higher R2 also implies that the technique is better, and often more consistently, able to

explain the long-term return behavior of the fund. As the last example demonstrates,

Style Analysis using an inadequate set of benchmarks results in a low R-Squared.

       Drawing inferences on a fund solely from the overall power of the technique to

explain the monthly variation in returns (e.g. R2), is improper and should be done in

tandem with an analysis of style changes through time (e.g. a rolling window

methodology) and cost structure. A relatively unstable style graph could indicate

inadequate benchmarks or market timing/sector rotation. In the latter case, the fund

manager may be switching in and out of asset classes or sectors, with the result that the

customized benchmark that best explains the fund’s return changes from time to time.

       Typically a high fund turnover ratio will accompany market timing.          If the

turnover on the fund is low, it could be that the types of securities held by the fund are

changing and causing a constant shift in style. Funds with high concentrations in

individual securities are candidates for this type of activity. The Windsor Fund, for

example, has an unstable style graph, but a turnover that rarely exceeds 35% annually.

Based on the 3rd quarter report of 2001, the fund top 5 holdings comprise 20% of total

assets and the top 10 holdings comprise over 30% of total assets. Clearly, this fund will

be highly sensitive to how quickly its top holdings go in and out of favor, how much they

behave like value or growth stocks, etc.

       It is also important to examine the fund’s cost structure. Funds with active

management differ from passive funds in their cost structure. Active funds have higher




                                           25
expense ratios to compensate for the excess trading costs and typically also charge a

buying or selling fee known as a load (either a front-load or a back-load).


7.         Style analysis and Hedge Funds

The success of Sharpe's (1992) approach is due to the fact that most mutual fund

managers are typically constrained to buying and holding assets in a well defined number

of asset classes and are frequently limited to little or no leverage. Their mandates are to

meet or exceed the returns on a given mix of asset classes. Thus, these mangers are called

relative return managers since they look to beat a specific benchmark. They tend to

generate returns, which are highly correlated with the returns on standard asset classes.

Stylistic differences among these managers are primarily due to the different securities in

their portfolios.

           Return-based style analysis is particularly helpful in characterizing the risk in the

strategies employed by Hedge Funds and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTA) that

employ dynamic trading strategies when suitable style benchmark asset classes are used8.

Standard style benchmarks however will not work with hedge funds and CTAs that have

mandates to make an absolute return target, regardless of the market environment and are

given the flexibility to choose among many asset classes and to employ dynamic trading



8
    A commodity trading advisor (CTA) is an individual or trading organization, registered with the
    Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) through membership in the National Futures
    Association, granted the authority to make trading decisions on behalf of a customer in futures, options,
    and securities accounts established exclusively for the customer. Until the 1980's, CTAs were limited as
    to what they could trade (commodities, commodity futures, and futures options). The globalization of
    markets and reduction in regulatory constraints over the past years have given CTAs the ability to trade
    an increasing number of instruments, such as global interest rate, currencies and physical commodity
    markets. As a result, while historically CTAs have been viewed separate from hedge fund managers, over
    the past ten years the difference between the two diminished as CTAs have established private investment
    partnerships with broad mandates in almost any financial market.


                                                      26
strategies that frequently involve short sales and substantial leverage9. While dynamic

trading strategies that have been discussed in the literature focused primarily on mutual

funds, the range of trading strategies employed by hedge funds are far more complex10.

The literature on market timing for example, has focused on the ability of mutual funds

managers to time the market on the long side (Merton 1981 and Dybvig and Ross 1985).

In contrast, hedge fund managers can make money on the short side as well. In addition,

hedge funds positions can involve time horizons much shorter than a month (and

sometime just several days). Furthermore, hedge fund managers can use derivatives and

complex options. As result, these alternative managers generate returns that have low

correlation with the returns of standard asset classes. Because of the dynamic strategies

followed by hedge funds the number of asset class needed to proxy hedge funds styles

becomes very large, even though they trade the same asset classes as mutual funds (see

Fung and Hsieh 1997 and Laing 2000 for an excellent discussion of related issues).

7.1     Applying Return-Based Style Analysis to Hedge Funds

Hedge funds’ strategies are typically classified as Directional or Non-directional.

Directional strategies hope to benefit from broad market movements, while Non-

Directional strategies have low correlation with any specific index by being “market

neutral”. These strategies aim to exploit short term pricing discrepancies and market

inefficiencies between related securities while keeping market exposure to minimum.

Some popular directional strategies include: Emerging Markets, Equity Non-Hedge and

Short Selling. Non-Directional strategies include: Event Driven, Relative Value Arbitrage


9 Hedge fund managers derive a substantial part of their compensation from incentive fees, which are paid
  only when these managers make a positive return. A "high-watermark" feature in their incentive contracts
  require them to make up all previous losses before an incentive is paid.



                                                   27
and Equity Hedge11. We use net of fees return data on two directional funds (Emerging

Market fund and a Managed Futures advisor) and two non-directional funds (Market

Neutral) to demonstrate the difficulties of analyzing the return pattern of alternative

managers (Appendix 3 contains a more detailed description of the funds).

        Table 4 (The columns entitled “basic model”) and Figure 8.1 present the Style

Analysis for the four hedge funds when no leverage or short sales constraints are

imposed12. The results when compared to the mutual fund examples in the previous

sections are striking. The ability to track the market neutral funds is extremely low (as

measured by the R-Squared)13. The analysis was more successful in the case of

directional funds, although it still captured at most only 57% of the monthly variation in

returns of the Axiom fund. Not surprisingly, with the debt crisis in Russia and South

America during the time period analyzed, this fund was shorting emerging markets bonds

and investing in U.S. Corporate bonds and emerging markets equities. The magnitudes of

some of the coefficients imply extreme levels of leverage and shorting activity. In

particular notice that there is no significant exposure to any component of the Russell

3000 Index. This finding probably reflects the nature of the dynamic trading strategies

employed by the funds rather than actual holdings.

        To illustrate this point, consider a manager involved in index arbitrage on the

S&P 500 by trading futures contracts and cash (e.g. individual stocks comprising the

index). Without leverage, a fully invested position of being consistently long 1 futures

contract (i.e. buy-and-hold) will result in the style analysis showing a coefficient of 1 on

the S&P 500 index. If the manager leverages up to 3 futures contract, the coefficient will

be 3. If the manger is short 1 futures contract, the coefficient will be -1. When the

alternates between long and short positions each month however, the regression

coefficient will be close to 0. Although in all examples, the manger invests in the US

stock market, the returns are very different depending on the trading strategy. In the first

two cases, the returns are positively correlated with US stocks. In the third case, the

returns are negatively correlated with US stocks. And in the fourth case, the returns are

uncorrelated with US stocks.

7.2         Evaluating Hedge fund performance using Hedge Fund indexes

Another approach for evaluating the performance of hedge funds often used by

practitioners is peer-comparison. To help investors understand hedge funds, consultants

and database vendors group hedge funds into “categories” of funds based on the

managers' self-disclosed strategies and location. The objective of the peer-group

approach is to capture the performance characteristics of funds operating “similar”

strategies.

            To demonstrate this approach, the performance of each fund is regressed against

an index that is composed of hedge funds with similar investment strategy. The returns

of Hillsdale and Nippon funds are compared to a Market Neutral Hedge Fund index while

we use Emerging Market and Managed Futures indexes as benchmarks for Axiom Fund

and John W. Henry & Company CTA respectively. Out of the many companies that offer

hedge fund indexes, we use those constructed by the Hedge Fund Research company



12
     The sum of the coefficients is still constrained to one.



                                                         29
(HFR), CSFB/Tremont and MAR Futures (for a description of the indexes see appendix

4).

        The peer-evaluation results are presented in Panel A, of Table 5. The Market

Neutral funds exhibit extremely low correlation with the index benchmarks and in three

out of six cases, the coefficients are not even significant. Although, for the two other

funds (Emerging market and Trend Following CTA), the benchmarks are highly

significant, they still capture only about 60%-70% of the variation in returns. Notice also

the large differences in explanatory power among the various indexes for the same fund.

As Table 5 demonstrates, while peer evaluation can be useful as a first step to

understanding the multitude of hedge fund styles, in the absence of a well formulated

model of hedge-fund styles, the allocation of funds to “peer” (or style) groups is largely

judgmental and can be, at times, ad hoc. Database vendors’ interpretations of what fund

managers say they do may not correspond to what managers actually do. There is a need

to verify that similar sounding strategies do indeed deliver similar performance

characteristics.

        Another problem with peer evaluation is that over time, there has been an

increasing tendency for hedge-fund mangers to employ multiple strategies. The need for

a more stable stream of returns over different market cycles has attracted hedge-fund

managers to adopt a multi-strategies approach. Homogeneous peer-groups are easier to

verify if the number of strategies involved in the group is small. When different funds

employ different combinations of strategies dynamically over time, using an aggregation

measure of “peers” to closely capture the essence of both the strategies employed and the




                                            30
dynamical allocation of capital to these strategies over time becomes an extremely

difficult task.

         Panel B of Table 5, repeats the peer evaluation. Instead of using only one index

for each index, we use five different benchmarks. The Event Driven and Fixed Income

indexes are included to better capture the range of trading possibilities facing the four

hedge funds. The fact that indexes, which represent different trading strategies than the

primary investment strategy of each fund, have significant coefficients confirms that

hedge funds employ multiple trading strategies. For example, the table reveals that the

Axiom fund returns also covary with the CSFB/Tremont Event Driven index returns and

the improvement in R2 is substantial (from 55% to 68%).

7.3      Option-like features in hedge funds returns

As the last section demonstrated, performing peer evaluation using an index of hedge

funds with the same investment strategy does not provide satisfactory results.

Furthermore, in some cases (such as for the market neutral hedge funds), Style Analysis

using standard asset classes has more explanatory power than any single hedge fund

index.

         Fung and Hsieh (1998) extended the traditional style analysis to incorporate

dynamic trading strategies by defining “style” as the common factor in the highly

correlated returns of a group of mangers. They argued that the concept of "style" should

be thought of in two dimensions: namely location choice and trading strategy. Location

choice refers to the asset classes, i.e., the x's in equation (2), used by the managers to

generate returns. Trading strategy refers to the direction (long/short) and leverage (i.e.,

the δ’s in equation 2), applied to the assets to generate returns. The actual returns are,



                                             31
therefore, the products of location choice and trading strategy (recall the example about

the manger involved in index arbitrage on the S&P500). They applied principal

components and factor analysis on hedge fund returns to extract style factors. By

extracting these common factors, they obtain the most popular investment styles.

However, the results are difficult to interpret and similar to peer evaluation, do not shed

light on how exactly hedge funds operate.

       Simply improving the Style Analysis explanatory power by incorporating a larger

number of asset classes, or shorter time periods to account for the changes in trading

strategies faces another problem. Glosten and Jagannathan (1994) argued that the returns

of portfolios managed using active strategies – as is the case with hedge funds -- would

exhibit option like features. Recently Fung and Hsieh (2001), and Mitchell and Pulvino

(2001) have empirically demonstrated that returns generated by hedge fund strategies

exhibit significant non-linear option like patterns. The non-linear return pattern results

from the use of derivatives -- either explicitly or implicitly through the use of dynamic

trading -- which amounts to the investor having written a call option.

       When manager’s returns relate to the benchmark in a non-linear manner, linear

regression models such as style analysis can lead to incorrect inference. Jagannathan and

Korajczyk (1986) and Grinblatt and Titman (1989) showed that if investors were to

evaluate the performance of a manager by measures like Jensen’s alpha or Treynor-

Black’s appraisal ratio, then a manager selling call options on a standard benchmark will

appear to be a falsely classified as a superior performer. Merton (1981) and Dybvig and

Ross (1985) noted that portfolios managed with superior information would typically

result returns that exhibit option-like features even when the managers do not explicitly




                                            32
trade in options. Glosten and Jagannathan (1994) suggested augmenting the return on

style benchmark indices with returns on selected options on the style benchmark indices

in order to capture the investment style of portfolio managers who employ dynamic

trading strategies. Agarwal and Naik (2001) show how the systematic risk of hedge funds

can be expressed through a combination of naïve option-based strategies on the S&P 500

Index and standard asset classes like equities and bonds. Agarwal and Naik find that the

inclusion of options trading strategies increased the explanatory power of the regression

dramatically and accounted for the non-linear component of returns.

       The options strategy used by Agarwal and Naik involves trading once-a-month in

short-maturity highly liquid European put and call options on the S&P 500 index. On the

first trading day in every month, an at-the-money call or option on the S&P 500 with one

month to maturity is purchased. On the first trading day of the following month, the

option is sold and another at-the-money call or put option on the S&P 500 index that

expires a month later is bought. This trading pattern is repeated every month. The returns

from this trading strategy are calculated for two options: an at-the-money and out-of-the-

money options14. The at-the-money call (put) option on the S&P500 index are denoted as

Cat (Pat) and out-of-the-money call (put) option as Cout (Pout).

       We repeat the style analysis for the four hedge fund including the options strategy

(Table 4 the columns entitled ‘Basic model + Options Strategy’ and Figure 8.2). The

explanatory power of the model increases substantially especially for the directional

funds. We also hold a “horse race” contest between the hedge fund indexes and the Style

Analysis benchmarks to see which has more explanatory power. Since the total number




                                              33
of variables or factors is above 20 and some of them are highly correlated we use

stepwise regression to identify the most important factors for each fund. Stepwise

regression involves adding and/or deleting variables sequentially depending on the F

value. We specify a 10% significance level for including an additional variable in the

stepwise regression procedure. The advantage of this approach in our setting lies in its

parsimonious selection of factors and its ability to solve the multicolinearity problem that

arises from the hedge fund indexes being partially correlated with the asset classes15.

         The stepwise estimation is presented in Table 6. As before the regressions

demonstrate a higher ability to track the variation in returns of directional funds relative

to non-directional funds. The R2 for the Emerging market and CTA funds range between

70%-80%, a somewhat higher figure than the style analysis. The analysis also reveals that

options are used in different ways by the funds. Market neutral funds for example use

them to hedge, selling call (put) options if they positive (negative) exposure to the

market. The trend following fund returns are similar to being long in an out of the money

put and call options. To summarize, we believe that by including new style benchmark

asset classes such as options and benchmark portfolios that use pre-specified dynamic

trading strategies, Return-based Style Analysis can be extended to analyze the style of

hedge fund managers as well.




14
   From the different strike price contracts available, Agarwal and Naik select the option where the strike
   price is closest to the current index value and define this to be at-the-money option. For calls (puts), they
   select the option with next higher (lower) strike price to be the out-of-the-money option.

8.     Summary

Style Analysis can help investors make order out of the chaos that often surrounds the

investment process. Both Portfolio-based and Return-based Style Analysis enable

investors to keep their actual asset allocation consistent with their investment goals and

evaluate the performance of fund managers against a proper benchmark.

       Return-based analysis is easy to implement and interpret. Portfolio-based analysis

provides a more in-depth analysis but is more data intensive, and requires knowledge of

portfolio holdings (which may not be readily available). Both methods can be used in

tandem to enhance the asset allocation process. Return-based analysis is often a precursor

to the more detailed analysis associated with Portfolio-based analysis. That is, Return-

based analysis is employed to define a particular universe of funds that appear to exhibit

the same style. Subsequently, Portfolio-based analysis can help one understand the exact

strategies and exposures that distinguish each of those funds.

       Although return-based analysis is an effective tool for analyzing the sources of a

portfolio's performance, as we illustrated using several examples, there are limitations.

The technique relies crucially on the correct specification of the style benchmark asset

classes. Inappropriate or inadequate choice of style benchmarks may lead to wrong

inferences about performance and the level of “active” management. In addition, since

the data used are historical returns, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the future

risk/return profile of the manager. The method also tends to detect style changes slowly

and at times may leave some style changes completely undetected. It may occasionally

indicate style changes that never occurred, often due to how the style indices are

correlated with each other. In short, correlation anomalies may occur, resulting in false



                                             35
signals. We also show how Return-based Style Analysis can be modified to analyze the

style of hedge fund managers and alternative investment managers who use dynamic

trading strategies and derivative instruments. For analyzing the style of such managers

Portfolio-based style analysis may be difficult to apply for the simple reason that hedge

fund managers are typically reluctant to disclose their portfolio holdings.        Another

difficulty arises from the fact that portfolio holdings may change rather very frequently.

   APPENDIX 2 - Growth and Income Funds Objective and Investment Strategy

                  (Based on funds’ prospectuses as of December 2001)

Goldman Sachs Growth & Income

Objective: This Fund seeks long-term growth of capital and growth of income through
investments in equity securities of well-established companies that are considered to have
favorable prospects for capital appreciation and/or dividend-paying ability.
Primary Investment Strategies: Based on a research-intensive approach, the fund employs
a value investing strategy that emphasizes stocks they believe to be inexpensive relative
to the fund’s estimate of their actual worth. The fund maintains a long-term investment
horizon with low turnover.
Size: $335 millions    Front Load: 5.50%     Expense Ratio: 1.19%


Putnam Fund for Growth & Income

Objective: The fund seeks to provide capital growth and current income by investing
primarily in common stocks that offer the potential for capital growth while also
providing current income.
Primary Investment Strategies: The fund invests mainly in common stocks of U.S.
companies, with a focus on value stocks that offer the potential for capital growth, current
income, or both. Value stocks are those that we believe are currently undervalued by the
market. We look for companies undergoing positive change. If we are correct and other
investors recognize the value of the company, the price of the stock may rise. We invest
mainly in large companies.
Size: $18.6 billions   Front Load: 5.75%     Expense Ratio: 0.81%


Vanguard Growth & Income

Objective: The Fund seeks to provide a total return (capital appreciation plus dividend
income) greater than the return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
Primary Investment Strategies: To achieve its objective, the Fund’s adviser uses
computer models to select a broadly diversified group of stocks that, as a whole, have
investment characteristics similar to those of the S&P 500 Index, but are expected to
provide a higher total return than that of the Index. At least 65% (and typically more than
90%) of the Fund’s assets will be invested in stocks that are included in the Index. Most
of the stocks held by the Fund provide dividend income as well as the potential for capital
appreciation.
Size: $6.6 billions    Front Load: 0         Expense Ratio: 0.38%




                                            39
Alliance Capital Growth & Income

Objective: The Fund seeks to provide Income and Capital appreciation.

Primary Investment Strategies: The fund primarily invests in dividend-paying common
stocks of good quality. It may also invest in fixed-income and convertible securities. The
fund tries to maintain a defensive dividend yield and price-to-earnings ratio, a fully
invested posture, and a high degree of sector and industry diversification. The fund
invests in quality companies that trade at undeserved discounts to their peers. The fund
does not make sector or market timing bets, but instead emphasize intensive, bottom-up
research and careful stock selection.
Size: $3.2 billions   Front Load: 4.25%     Expense Ratio: 0.91%

Hillsdale U.S. Market Neutral Fund (http://www.hillsdaleinv.com)

The US Market Neutral Equity Fund is beta, style and industry neutral. It invests in up to
150 companies and may use leverage up to 1 times equity. The investment objective of
the strategy is to provide a consistent 10-15 percent annualized return with volatility less
than or equal to bonds and 0% correlation with major US equity indices. The portfolio is
constructed by taking long and short positions in common share of U.S. corporations
primarily with a market capitalization in excess of one billion dollars.
Hillsdale Investment Management Inc. also manages the US Aggressive Hedged Equity
Fund and two additional funds with similar strategies that focus on the Canadian market.
The investment strategies are based on a proprietary investment platform that uses a
dynamic, fundamental based, multi-factor approach to stock selection and portfolio
construction. The firm, founded in 1996, is majority owned by its employees and is
registered with the Ontario Securities Commission as an Investment Counsel, Portfolio
Manager and a Limited Market Dealer.

Nippon Fund (http://www.aventineinvestments.com)

The Nippon Performance Fund is a market neutral hedge fund designed to deliver
consistent and positive returns with a low level of risk and virtually no correlation to the
Nikkei 225, or any global equity or bond market. The Fund capitalizes on the
undervaluations in Japanese convertible bonds and equity warrants by employing a
convertible arbitrage strategy to extract these undervaluations. These undervaluations
allow the Fund to deliver a superior rate of return with a low level of volatility while
removing the unwanted and unnecessary risks associated with Japanese securities. The
Fund's long positions include convertible bonds and warrants, which are hedged by
selling short the underlying stocks to remove the equity risk, and interest rate futures to
remove interest rate risk. The Fund is denominated in U.S dollars, and utilizes currency
futures, forwards, options and swaps to remove any currency risk.

Axiom Fund (http://www.axiom-invest.com)

Axiom Balanced Growth Fund invests primarily in listed shares of companies deriving a
significant portion of their revenues from emerging markets (including those in Southeast
Asia), but will also invest in fixed income obligations (such as US dollar Brady-type
bonds) of issuers in emerging markets (including those outside Southeast Asia). A wide
range of hedging techniques and instruments will, however, be employed where
considered appropriate with a view to minimizing the level of volatility, which is
normally associated with Emerging Market funds. The fund was launched on April 15th
1996.

                         APPENDIX 4 - Hedge Funds Indexes


Hedge Fund Research (www.hfr.com) provides 29 equally weighted style categories
and a composite index. Funds of funds are not included in the composite index. The
indexes are based on 1,100 funds drawn from a database of 1,700 funds. Funds in the
database represent $260 billion in assets. The index was launched in 1994 with data back
to 1990. Funds are assigned to categories based on the descriptions in the offering
memorandums. Survivorship bias is minimized by incorporating funds that have ceased
to exist.


Credit Suisse First Boston/Tremont (www.hedgeindex.com) covers nine strategies and
is based on 340 funds, representing $100 billion in invested capital, selected from a
database of 2,600 funds. It is the only asset (capitalization) weighted hedge funds index.
The CSFB/Tremont Index discloses its construction methods and identifies all the funds
within it. CSFB/Tremont accepts only funds (not separate accounts) with a minimum of
$10 million under management and an audited financial statement. If a fund liquidates, its
performance remains in the Index for the period during which the fund was active in
order to minimize survivorship bias. The index was launched in 1999, with data going
back to 1994. It incorporates the TASS+ database.


MAR Futures (www.marhedge.com) reports especially on the performance of Managed
Futures strategies in each of 15 categories, 10 of which are combined into four sub-
medians. The variety of Zurich (formerly MAR) index databases contains 1,300 funds.
Managers usually select their own categories. The firm’s website identifies the number of
funds and assets in each category. MAR, the former publisher of the index, sold its
database business to Zurich Financial Services in spring 2001.

The table reports the results of Style Analysis for three hedge funds and a CTA during March 1997 to
November 2001. The coefficients are not constrained to be non-negative due to the use of leverage and
short sales, but the sum of the coefficients is constrained to one. All figures in the table are in percents. The
columns titled ‘Basic Model’ report the results for the set of 12 asset classes. The next four columns show
the results of re-estimating the coefficients for each fund using the 12 asset classes and returns on 4
S&P500 options strategies. At-the-money call (put) options are denoted as Cat (Pat) and out-of-the-money
call (put) option as Cout (Pout).
