           New Evidence that Taxes Affect the Valuation of Dividends


                                       ABSTRACT



           This paper uses British data to examine the effects of dividend

 taxes on investors' relative valuation of dividends and      capital   gains.

 British data offer great potential to illuminate the dividends and taxes

 question, since there have been two radical changes and several minor reforms

 in British dividend tax policy during the last twenty-five years. Studying

 the relationship between dividends and stock price nxvements during different

 tax regimes   offers an   ideal controlled experiment for assessing the effects of
 taxes on investors' valuation of dividends. Using
                                                   daily data on a small

 sample of firms, and inth1y data on a xrnich broader sample, we find clear evi-

 dence that taxes change equilibrium
                                        relationships between dividend yields and

market returns. These findings suggest that taxes are important determinants

of security market equilibrium, and deepen the puzzle of why firms pay divi-

dends.

             Financial economists have long been puzzled by corporate dividend

behavior. It would seem that      rational   personal investors should value   a
dollar    of corporate dividends less highly than a dollar of corporate reten-
tions, because the former gives rise      to greater tax liabilities. On the other
hand,   corporations face equal   costs   of paying out dividends and retaining ear-

nings. As Miller and Modigliani (1961) deinstrated, in the absence of taxes

dividend policy should have no effect on share valuation. It follows that if

dividends are tax penalized, the value maximizing strater for a firm would

involve paying no dividends. It is therefore surprising that dividend

payments to taxable investors are widespread. In 1981, dividend tax reve-

nues in the United States were estimated to exceed twenty billion dollars.1

Indeed, some have interpreted the large volume of dividends paid as evi-

dence against the rational behavior postulates typically used by economists.

            The dividend question has stimulated a large theoretical and

empirical literature concerned with the question of investors' valuation of

dividends. In particular, the question of how taxes affect the market

valuation of dividends has generated considerable controversy. Numerous

studies including Litzenberger and Ramaswan (197'9, 1982), Auerbach (1983),

and Gordon and Bradford (1980), have isolated relationships between stock

returns and dividend yields which are consistent with the existence of tax

effects. Others, notably Miller and Scholes (1982), have suggested alter-

native explanations for the relationship. Indeed, Miller and Scholes go so

far as to claim that "after correcting ...      for   information effects, we find

no significant remaining relation between returns and expected dividend

yield —   certainly   nothing that could be considered a yield—related tax

effect of the classic kind [1982, p.1131]."

           A full understanding of how dividends affect returns remains dif-

ficult to achieve. It appears unlikely that we will ever be able to devise

completely satisfactory empirical measures of ex—ante returns on securi-

ties. Most studies of dividend effects rely on the standard CAPM, with the

aggregate stock market used as a proxy for the market portfolio, in order

to imdel required returns. Substantial theoretical and empirical litera-

tures cast doubt on the validity of this procedure. If ex—ante returns are

mis—modelled and yields are correlated with required returns, dividend

yield effects will not be estimated consistently.   This makes the isolation

and attribution of tax effects problematic.

           This paper presents the results of our research on dividends and

taxes using British data. As Miller and Scholes argue, the identification of

tax effects is likely to be impossible using data generated under a single tax

regime.   British data offer great potential to illuminate the taxes and divi-
dends   question because there have been two radical changes and a number of

minor changes in British dividend tax policy during the last 30 years.

Examination of the relationship between dividends and stock price movements

during different tax regimes offers an ideal controlled experiment for

assessing the effects of taxes on investors' valuation of dividends. This

opportunity is not available in the United States, where there have been no

comparably radical tax reforms.

            Our results confirm the view that the taxation of dividends redu-

ces their relative valuation by investors. Using daily data on a small
                                       —3—


sample    of companies and xnthly data on a much broader sample, clear evi-
dence that   taxes change equilibrium relationships between dividend yields

and   nErket returns is presented. The finding that dividend taxes are
recognized by investors and affect the ex—ante returns which they demand
only deepens the puzzle of why firms pay dividends.
            The paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the evolu-

tion of the British tax system over the last thirty years and discusses the

tax reforms which form the basis for our empirical tests. We consider both

the tax treatment of individual investors and the rules governing arbitrage

around ex—dividend days. Section II utilizes the ex-day methodolor to

examine tax effects for a small sample of companies. Section III describes our

primary   data   set, the London Business School inthly share price data base,

and reports on the relationship between rnthly     dividend   yields and   market
returns   during alternative tax regimes. Section IV presents our conclusions
and   describes several directions for future research.

I.   The Taxation of Dividends in the U.K.

           The taxation of cor:porate income in Britain has been substantially

reformed twice during the last 20 years. This makes British data especially

powerful   in   testing alternative hypotheses about the impact of taxes on the

market valuation of different forms of corporate income. If taxes affect the

relevant marginal investor, then the relative valuation of dividends and capi-

tal gains should change when the tax law changes. It appears that the major

changes in British corporate income taxation can safely be viewed as exoge-

nous. Both occurred following transitions of the political party in power,

after elections in which taxes were not an important issue.

           The first important change occurred in 1965, when the newly—elected

Labour Government instituted a capital gains tax at a statutory rate of 30

percent. This reform should have increased the relative valuation of dividend

income. The second change occurred in 19T3, when the Conversative government

introduced an integrated corporate income tax which effectively reduced the

dividend tax rate on personal and corporate investors and actually provided a

dividend subsidy to untaxed institutions.

            We begin by clarifying how an integrated tax system like that intro—

duced in Britain in 1973 affects investors* relative valuation of dividends

and capital gains. To motivate this, assume different securities yield

different combinations of certain capital gains (g) and dividends (d)

per unit value. Let m equal the marginal dividend tax rate, and z the effec-

tive tax rate on capital gains. All investors face the same tax rates2 and

require an after tax return of p(1—z). Asset market equilibrium requires
                                            —5—



that:
            (l—z)g + (l—m)d = p(1—z)    .                                            (1)

The   tax unadjusted return on a share with dividend yield d and capital
gain g is R =   g+d,    and using (1) we can write

            R=g+d=p+()d=p+dd                      .                                  (2)

The pretax return on higher yield securities is higher than that on low

dividend shares. This return just compensates investors for the extra

taxes they must pay. Prior to 1965,         there     was no capital gains tax so y = m.

Between 1965 and 1973, when Britain's tax system was very similar to that in

the United States, investors faced both dividend and capital gains taxes, and

      (m—z)/(l—z).

            In April 1973, the tax system was reformed in a way         which substan-
tially reduced the tax rate applicable to dividend income. Investors are now

permitted to take a partial credit for corporate tax parments in evaluating

their dividend tax liability. This tax system is similar to the tax integra-

tion proposals which have been suggested to eliminate the "double taxation" of

dividends in the United States. Equivalently, in the post—1973 British system

the   corporate tax is a kind of withholding          mechanism for collecting the divi-

dend tax, where the amount withheld is "imputed" to the shareholder. In this

case y becomes:


                m-w
                1-w                                                                  /
                  i—z

where m still denotes the dividend tax rate and w is the imputation rate.

This formula could, of course, also describe the pre—1973 system, with w =               0.
                                         —6—




             The workings of an imputation system are most easily demonstrated by

way of an example. Suppose a firm pays a £2.00 dividend to a shareowner in

the 50 percent tax bracket. Assume that w =       .33, implying   that corporate tax

payments worth thirty three percent of the dividend can be applied as a

credit against individual dividend taxes. Personal taxes are calculated on

grossed up dividends, rather than dividends net of withholding at the cor-
porate level. Therefore, the tax base for the 50 percent dividend tax is
£3,   and   the   shareholder's total tax liability is £1.50. Of this liability,

£1 is accounted for by the nney which was withheld at the corporate level,

leaving a personal tax liability of £.50, 25 percent of the dividend

received after withholding. For an investor in the 33 percent tax bracket, no

further taxes would be due. For shareholders with tax rates below w, the

Inland Revenue would provide a refund of (m—w)/(l—w) times the dividend.3

              It is sometimes suggested that the relevant nmrginal investor for

the valuation of dividends is either a tax free institution or a broker—

dealer who engages in trading around the ex—day. Some discussion of the regu-

lations affecting dividend arbitrage is therefore needed. Prior to 197'O,

"dividend stripping" by trading around ex—days was apparently widespread.

Major changes in the tax rules .relating to dividend trading occurred in 19T0.

For an individual, after 1970, if trading around ex-days such as selling

shares before the ex—day and repurchasing them later reduced his tax liability

by more than 10 percent in any year, his transactions could be declared void.

He could be assessed for the tax to which he would have been liable if he did

not pursue this strate. The second jor class of investors is tax—exempt
                                        —7—



 institutions.   After 1910, their trading around ex—days could be declared void

if they bought and sold the share within one nth of the ex—day. In this

situation, the institution could be required to pay a partial tax. For tra-

ders in securities, the third major class of investors, both dividends and

realized capital gains are taxed at the personal income tax rate (for part-

nership dealers) or the corporate rate (for incorporated dealers). Since

1970, when a dealer trades in securities around ex—days and holds the shares

for less than a nth, a substantial fraction of his capital loss on the tran-

saction can be disallowed for tax purposes. As the holding period declines,

the fraction disallowed rises and can reach 100 percent.

            While the interactions among these tax provisions are difficult to

describe, two facts stand out. First, the opportunities for avoiding taxes by

trading around ex—days were substantially reduced for all investors in 1970.

To   the extent that trading   around ex—days is important   in   determining ex—

dividend   price movements,   we would expect to observe noticable changes around

1970.    Second, the average tax burden on dividend income, relative to capital
gains,   declined in 1965 and fell substantially in 1973.     To provide some   indi-

cator of these changes, Table 1 presents estimates of the average marginal tax

rates on dividends and capital gains implied by the tax rules and the distri-

bution of share ownership for the years 1955—1981. These tax rates were

calculated by first determining the marginal tax rates applicable to different

classes of shareholders assuming they did nothing to avoid taxes, and then

averaging these rates across investor classes with weights proportional to the

shareholders' total equity holdings. A detailed description of the procedures

Naldrett and Poterba (1981).

           The table shows both discrete changes in average marginal tax rates

caused by the two tax reforms, and continuing nvements which result

from trends in the pattern of share ownership. In 1955, more than two—

thirds of all equity was held by persons, who are the rst heavily taxed

class of investors. By 1981, this fraction had declined to less than forty

percent.5 The marked decline in personal holdings coincided with the

rapid rise in the value of institutional holdings, particularly untaxed

pension funds. These trends have reduced the marginal tax rates on both

dividends and capital gains. We should emphasize that the weighted average

tax rates are only designed to indicate the magnitudes of tax changes. No

theory holds that asset returns should be governed by weighted average margi-

nal tax rates of the type computed here.

           The third column of Table I presents a summary measure for the

tax   syste&s                           capital gains. Since our study is
                treatment of dividends and

directed at estimating y from market data, it is informative to calculate the

values which would obtain if market returns reflected the average marginal tax
rates on all shareholders for the different tax regimes. The data clearly
reflect substantial variation. Prior to 1965, in what we refer to as Regime
I, y averages    .50.   This   reflects a substantial   tax burden on dividends and

the absence of capital gains taxes. Between 1965 and 1973, y averages .36,

lower than in Regime I largely because of the capital gains tax. Finally,

since 1973, y has actually been negative in many years. The average value of
                                        —10-




y during Regime III is —.18T.

            With these benchmark values of the tax parameters in mind, we exa-

mine share prices to see if the tax changes have left a trace in the xrasured

pretax returns of different securities. In the succeeding two sections we

report estimates using daily and     nnthly    data of the market's relative

valuation of dividends and capital gains under different tax regimes.


II.   Dividend Valuation: Tests Using Daily Data
            The xst straightforward test for the existence of dividend tax
effects on stock prices is the comparison of share price imvements and
dividend   payments on ex—dividend days. Numerous authors, including Elton

and Gruber (1970), Black and Scholes (19T3), Green (1980), Kaiay (1982),

Eades,    Hess and Kim (1982), Auerbach (1983), Hess (1983), and others have
used daily data to analyze relative share price movements in the United

States.    These studies have found that in general share prices do decline on
ex—days, but by less than the amount of the dividend.
            These results have been    interpreted   as supporting the bypothesis

that taxes influence market behavior, since shareholders discount future divi-

dend taxes. However, this tax—based explanation has been subject to some cri-

ticism. Hess     (1982, 1983) showed   that the restrictions implied by   the
after—tax    CAPM are violated in daily   and monthly returns. However, since his
tests    are joint   tests of both the tax effects I    othesis and a particular
model of ex—ante security returns, it is difficult to decide whether the tax
hypothesis is at fault.

            Black and Scholes (1973), Green (1980) and Kalay (1982) raised a

second objection, suggesting that short—term trading by tax arbitrageurs ren-

ders the ex—day approach powerless in measuring tax effects. If short term

traders   are   the nRrginal investors around the ex—day, then estimated share

price movements will not reflect the tax rates facing the firm's "usual"

clientele. Moreover, since one of the most likely arbitrageurs is the securi-

ties broker who faces identical tax rates on dividend income and on short term

capital gains (mz), this short term arbitrage should lead share prices to

decline by the full value of their dividends.6

            As we noted above, there were changes in the rules concerning ex—day

trading during our sample period. This is particularly evident in the 1970

Finance Act. If the short—term trading hypothesis is correct, then we would

expect to see relative price movements which were closer to —1.0 before 1970

than in later years. As we shall see below, these predictions are not borne

out by the data. If anything, the opposite has occurred and relative price

movements have narrowed in recent years. This is the prediction of the tax
effects hypothesis, not the short-term trading model, and explains in part why
we favor it as an explanation of share price reactions to dividends.

            To estimate the share price response to dividends, we obtained daily

data on the share prices and dividends of sixteen large U.K. firms.7 A

listing of these firms and the    periods covered by   our data ms.y be found in the

appendix. Using information on ex—dividend dates for these firms obtained

from the London Business School share price data tape, we consulted microfilm

copies of the Financial Times and recorded     closing share prices   on the trading
                                                —12-.




day before the ex—date, the ex—date itself, and                   the   day after the ex—date.

For each firm in the sample, we included all ex—dates between 1955 and 1981

corresponding to cash dividend payments which were taxable as ordinary income

and not accompanied by any dividend rights, stock options, or other special

features.    Our data set contained returns             for   633 ex—days and 616

non—ex—days.    We also obtained data on the value of the Financial
Times—Actuaries     500 Share      Index   for each day on which prices were uasured,
and used this index to construct a market return series.
            We estimated two xxdels for Rt, the total pretax return on security
i. The first is
                             16                 3

where        is the market        return and        is a company—specific coefficient
which    should resenible the security's beta. The dividend yield on each day

is d1tj where j denotes the tax regime (I, II, or III) in which the dividend

falls.    The       coefficients reflect the excess pretax return on ex—dividend
days, an estimate of y for each tax regime. If the tax—effects bypothesis is
correct, then the parameter    should depend upon the relative tax rates on

dividends    and capital gains. In particular, we would expect                      to vary

across tax regimes.

             The second equation which we estimated took a more agnostic approach

to modelling ex—ante returns, and              introduced     firm—specific intercept terms:
                                          —13 -

                                                                1     +


These equations were estimated by a generalized least squares procedure

which allowed for heteroscedasticity across different firms.8 Since

there were few instances in which two firms had coincident ex—days, residual

correlation across firms was not an issue.

          The results of our ex—day share price study are shown in Table II.

The first two rows show the results of estimating (li) and (5) for ex—dividend

days alone. There is clear evidence that the aj coefficients have changed

over time, with values between .3 and .           in   Regimes I and II and much

smaller values, between —.15 and —.1, in Regime III. This finding suggests

that changes in the capital gains tax rate, the principal difference between

Regimes I and II, did not exert a pronounced influence on ex—day price ve—

ments, but the reform of dividend taxation in 1973 did have a substantial

effect. The difference between the Regime II and Regime III coefficients

averaged across the two reported xdels is •1413, which is somewhat smaller

than the difference of .551 between the average values of y computed in Table

I.

         We experimented with several variants on our ex—day equation.

First, we computed two—day returns for each security, assuming that the

investor held his shares for the ex—day and the following day. When we

repeated our regressions on the 2—day returns, the coefficients changed,

although not markedly, and the basic conclusion that the 1973 tax reform had

 an impact on relative ex—day price movements remained.9 These equations are

 reported as rows three and four in Table II. The same finding emerged when

we   estimated our equations on daily data including the ex—days and the
following    day-s   as independent observations. The estimates of a for the first
two regimes rise to over .li., while the estimates for Regime III remain negative

the difference between the Regime II and III coefficients was of the same

magnitude as that computed using only ex—days. In each case, the dif-

ference between the Regime II and Regime III coefficients is statistically

significant at the 99 percent confidence level. Our        results   were quite robust

with respect to the exclusion of particular firms; when the equations were

estimated separately for each firm, l4 of our 16 companies had estimated

Regime III coefficients which were smaller than those for Regime 111.10

            We adopted another approach to testing the "tax—effects" hypothesis,

exploiting both the within—regime and the across—regime variation in tax

rates, by comparing our      estimate of a   for each year with y in Table I. The

hypothesis   that a =    y was rejected   at standard significance levels. However,
tests   using cx =
                     (m_w)/(1_w)t, imposing z. = 0, did not reject the null
hypothesis. This suggests that our measures of capital gains tax rates may be

very imprecise indicators of actual tax rates.

            Previous research, such as that of Gordon and Bradford (1980), has

documented the existence of large fluctuations in estimated tax effects

even over periods when the tax law was stable. To measure time series

variation, we re—estimated equation (2a) from Table II allowing separate

aj coefficients for each year. When the tax regime changed during the year,

we estinated separate coefficients for the two regimes. These resulting esti-

mates are shown     in   Table III. The coefficients are clearly subject to

substantial variability, even within tax regimes. However, there is a pro-

nounced drop in these coefficients beginning in              the   second half of   1973,    again

suggesting     the importance of tax effects. There is no comparable change in
1970,   when   the tax rules on trading were changed.
             While daily share price movements are likely to yield the most pre-
cise evidence on dividend valuation, they may be             contaminated by tax arbitrage
or   other unusual return patterns around ex-days. If taxes play an important

role in the valuation of dividend income, then it might be possible to detect

this phenomenon in a large sample of monthly security returns. While monthly

data are subject to various other biases, discussed below, we now turn to an

analysis of tax effects in monthly data for the period 1955—81.


III. Dividend Valuation: Tests Using Monthly Data

        A.   Methodolor
             A simple model, which we use as a point of departure for estima-

tion, is the after—tax CAPM described by Brennan (1970), Auerbach (1983), and

Gordon and Bradford (1980). The tax modified capital market line requires

that for each security i,


  (l_z)g. +                =             +               +                          +
                (l_m)djt       (1_m)rf       8.[(i—z)g       (l_m)d_(l_m)r1             c1    (6)



where (l_m)rf is the after-tax risk—free rate of return, m =
                                                                                    g   and
                                                 —18—




and dmt are the capital gains and dividends on the market portfolio, 8 =

Cov(flt,    R)/Var(R), and in             is   the marginal tax rate on interest income.

We use      above a return to show that it is measured after tax. Dividing

through expression (6) by (i—z) and manipulating terms yields


                             (1—8.)
 R1t =          + dt     =
                              (i—z) (l_m)rf +
                                                            + (1—y)d1    +      + 'it

                In daily     data,    the variation over time ifl the risk free rate and

the market dividend yield is small, so we could approximate (7) by

                                                        •                                        (8)



This was the equation which we estimated in the last section. In

monthly data, however, the specification of ex—ante returns is more

important. We therefore employed two alternative models. The first followed from

(6):

            —
                (1_m)rf

where           is the total return on the market and                is an error which assumed

to be uncorrelated across firms and time.11

                To estimate this model, we first estimated a set of 8.it                 for   each

firm    from regressions of the total security return on the market return. We

allowed          to vary during the sample, fixing it for five year intervals.

The results were not particularly sensitive to our choice of interval

length. We also tried a two—stage procedure which began by defining R =

dt     +
           g,    estimating 8jt' and estimating CL          for   each regime. We than redefined

       =
           (1—a)d    +
                         g,      similarly adjusted share returns as it = (1_CL)dlt +

and   used   these new returns to estimate new     'S.   The new    were then used to

form the left band side variable in (9).        Our results were insensitive to

these experiments; the findings reported below correspond to s estimated

from unad.justed Rmt and Rt.

             Estimating ad's from (9) may   be subject to serious biases if the

assumptions underlying the CAPM are not valid, or if 's cannot be accurately

estimated. infrequent trading and the failure of stock market returns to

measure the return on the whole constellation of assets held by investors

complicate the estimation of , and there is little evidence that firm B's

are stable over long time periods. These problems are probably substantial.

For  a relatively small open econoxay like Britain, it is especially unlikely
that the aggregate stock market is a very good proxy for total wealth.
             Failure to adequately proxy ex—ante returns has potentially serious
consequences, particularly in working with monthly data. Because increases in
ex—ante returns depress stock prices, they will be associated with increases
in dividend price ratios. These may- lead to upwards biased estimates of the

tax effects on the valuation of dividends. To control for this possibility we

follow Miller and Scholes (1982), and add a variable               where

      represents the split—adjusted mean price of security i in our sample.

This variable is intended to pick up the effects of unmeasured risk changes

which affect the firm's price. The expected sign of this variable's coef-

ficient is positive. When the risk of a security rises, its price will decline

and provided dividends adjust slowly to new information its dividend yield

will rise. At the same time,     the   ex-ante return on this security will rise,
                                          —2 0-




leading to a positive association between measured dividend yield and return.

To capture other possible misspecifications, the average dividend yield over

the past year, (D7P), was also added to equation (9).

          We also employed an alternative approach which imposed fewer theore-

tical constraints on the data. We assumed that


     Rt —    (l_m)rf   =
                           u+     +           + cidt2 + a3dt3 +      .         (10)


Equation (10) is a standard idel in the analysis of covariance; it allows for

firm effects and time effects in describing stock market returns. Each firm

is assumed to have a constant required excess return on an after tax basis and

there is some "market news" which affects all firms at time t. In principle

equation (10) could be estimated directly by adding a dumn variable for each

firm and each nnth to our regressions. This is not practical due to the size

of our sample. An alternative approach, described in Maddala (1977), is to

subtract the means for each firm and for each month from each variable in

(10). We considered some ndels with only firm effects and others with both

firm effects and time effects. These were estimated as:


            .t_R1. —   (1_m)(rft_rf   )   = xi(dti_d11i)                       (ii)

                                          + cz2(dt2—d.2) + cz3(dt3_dj.3) +


for firm effects, and



            Rt_R1_Rt =      a(d1ti_d1i_dti)       + (dt2_di2_dt2)              (12)

                           + a3(d1t3_d13_dt3) +


for firm arid time effects. The term R. is the average value of R.  for firm
                                     1.                          it

i, dii is the time average of dtj for firm i, and             is the average return
                                          —21—




at   time   t across   all firms.   This procedure   is numerically equivalent to doing

a regression with firm and time dummies, but it is much less computationally

burdensome. In estimating (11) and (12), we also allowed for unmeasured

changea in required returns by adding the inverse price level and the average

dividend yield variables, appropriately de—ineaned, to our equations.

             Before presenting our nthly regression results, there is one

remaing methodological issue to discuss. This is the question of information

effects and the relationship between yields and returns. The problem arises

if dividends are announced and paid in the same nnth. In this case, there

will be a positive correlation between announced dividends and "dividend

news." Assuming that the announcement of higher than expected dividends

causes stock prices to rise, information effects will give rise to a spurious

positive correlation between yields and returns. Miller and Scholes (1982)

point out an additional, more subtle bias. Some firms that pay zero dividends

undoubtedly surprised and disappointed their shareholders by omitting their

dividend. This also leads to an upward bias in the estimate of the effect of

dividend yields on returns.

             We adopted two different procedures for addressing this problem.

The first is a variant on one of the procedures used by Litzenberger and

Rainaswan' (1982).       We included in the sample only observations for which

i) positive dividends were paid but had been announced in the preceding iiinth,

or ii) no dividends were paid but positive dividends had been paid within the

preceeding    two nxnths. The logic of this selection rule is that market
participants    are unlikely to expect dividends to be paid within two nnths
                                        -22.-




of a previous dividend payment,    especially    since in Britain dividends are

almost universally paid on a semi—annual basis. Restricting the sample       to
these observations should eliminate most of the bias due to information

effects.

            Unfortunately, data on dividend announcement dates were only

available for part of our    sample period (1965—1977). The restricted sample
method could therefore not be used to estimate yield effects over the entire

1955—1981   period.   To obtain estimates for the full sample period, we adopted

an instrumental variable procedure similar to that suggested by McCallum

(1976) in   the   context of rational expectations macro models. The

basic   idea is   as follows. Suppose x    is   a rational expectation of

conditional   on some information set           It then follows that:

            x=     x+                                                              (13)


where       is orthogonal to any element of the information set
Equation (13) implies that the use of x as a proxy for x gives rise to
a classical errors in variables problem. It may be solved by using any
element of    that is correlated with x as an instrument for x. We therefore

use   average lagged dividend yield as an instrument for the      contem-

poraneous dividend    yield in those months in which a dividend was paid.     The

definition    of our instrument is d.t = (d.11        +
                                                          d.i2 ÷ d.i3), which
is the previous year's dividend yield in this month with a minor correction
to allow for possible timing differences in two consecutive years.12        When
d.t = 0 our instrumental variable was also set equal to zero. This rr.y

leave    some small residual bias but it should be common to all   firms,   and

reasonably constant over time.

            Our instrumental variable procedure differs from the iterated
least squares procedure used by Litzenberger and Rainasvaii    (19T9,   1982),
Gordon and Bradford (1980), and many other authors. These authors use a

first stage regression to create an expected dividend yield variable which

they then include in estimating an equation like (12). However, as

Hausman (1983) explains, this procedure is flawed in two respects. First,

unless   all the variables included on the right hand side   of (12) or any

other second stage equation are included in the first stage, the second

stage estimates will be inconsistent. Second, even if all the appropriate

variables are included, the standard errors will be overstated if a two

stage procedure is used. Our results are therefore the first which both

correct for information effects and also present consistent standard errors.13

            It is important to recognize that the biases in estimated tax

effects due to information effects and miszneasurement   of risk which have been
extensively   discussed in the literature should infect the yield—return rela-

tionship in a similar way during all tax regimes. By studying the differences

in estimated yield effects under alternative tax regimes, we are able to

measure tax effects with less contamination by other spurious factors than

many previous studies. Failures in r del of ex—ante returns and other

specification errors are likely to exert a roughly constant bias in all regi-

mes. The variation in coefficients across tax regimes should therefore be the
                                        —24


focus of our attention.

           Our nnthly returns data were drawn from the London Business School

share price data base, provided by Mr. Jerexrr Sinithers of the LBS. This data

set includes monthly observations on prices, dividend payments, and market

indices for 3,500 U.K. firms during a twenty—six year period between 1955 and

1981. There are a total of over 550,000 company—months of share price infor-

mation. Although 3,500 companies are contained in the data set for at least

some inths, many appear for only short periods. The full data set contains

many   firms   which evidence severe non—trading.

           To avoid infrequent trading problems and other difficulties asso-

ciated with data inconsistencies, we constructed a data subset for our analy-

sis. First, since the LBS tape provides monthly information on each month's

final recorded transactions price, the date of this transaction, and the

monthly high and low price, we were able to select only months in which

both the recorded price and the previous month's recorded price were trans-

actions prices for the last day of the nth. This restriction substan-

tially reduced the size of our sample, from 550,000 to about 1140,000

company months. This procedure both reduces the non—trading problem which may

lead to poor estimates of , and avoids the problem of firms which

experienced ex—days during a month but were last traded before the ex—date.

Note that for these firms, the measured price decline due to the dividend

payment would be zero.

               We also deleted i) any firms for which we had less than twelve

adinissable observations, on the grounds that the estimated 's would be poor

guides   to actual betas, ii) outlying observations on dividend yield (>25% per

year) and share price zmvements (any observation corresponding to nre than a

50 percent price nvement during one nnth) and iii) any months involving non—

cash dividends or special rights issues. Finally, we examined only obser-

vations on large firms, measured by market value at the end of 1981. Our

results are based on all firms in the first third of the value distribution

although the findings are not particularly sensitive to choosing alternative

cut—off points. This firm size criterion reduced our sample size from about

135,000 to 11i4,000 company_months.hl


       B. Results

         Estimates of equations (ii) and (12) using the restricted data sample of

firms without announcement or information biases are presented in Table IV.

The results   confirm the daily findings and provide strong support for the
hypothesis    that taxes influence the relationship between dividend yields and

security returns. In the simplest specification, based on the CAPM, the esti-

mated tax penalty on dividends falls from T          to   45 percent between Regimes II

and III. A drop—off of this magnitude corresponds very closely to the decline

in average marginal tax rates reported in Table I. The evidence on changes

between Regime I and        II   is re difficult to interpret; there are tovements    in
both   directions in      the various equations, and the hypothesis of equal coef-

Notes:     These equations were estimated on a data subsample which comprised only company—months in which a
           dividend was paid, or which followed a dividend month by one or two months. We deleted all dividend
           observations for which announcement dates were unavailable; this excluded all data before 1965 and
           after 1977. Dividends which were announced in the month they were paid were also deleted, leaving a
           total of ,146 observations. Equations 1 and 2 were estimated by weighted least squares as in Table II;
           subsequent models by ordinary least squares. Standard errors are shown in parentheses. The CAPM

suggest the importance of tax changes, although in the firm—effect rtdels many

of the inter—regime coefficient changes are larger than the "predicted"

changes based on Table I. These large values reflect in part the failure of

the fixed effects estimator without time dummies to capture the variation due

to systematic forces at each moment of time. 'When the time dummies are added,

in equations 14e and 1f, the coefficients and their differences decline to

             The major        puzzle in               the results is why the estimated tax rates are

so    high. Their values suggest some sort of bias due to mismeasurement of risk.
In the CAPM models,          addition of variables designed to capture these biases,
such as the inverse price, reduce the absolute size of the coefficients
slightly. The changes are not enough to resolve the nrstery, however. 'While
our coefficients are implausibly large, other authors using non—American data
have found similar values. Lakonishok and Verinaelen (1983) discovered                         that

Canadian share prices often fall on ex—days by only one third of the                        dividend
value,   suggesting y of roughly two thirds. These incredible values for price

drop—offs should be a source of further study.

            Table   V presents estimates of the returns model for the entire
1955—1981 period using our instrumental variable procedure for handling the

information effect problem. The results provide further support for the

hypothesis that taxes affect the relationship between dividend yields and

security returns.           The estimated differences between 2                and    range between

.25   and .30 for the modified CAPM equations, and are somewhat larger in the

fixed—effects   case. These findings                       suggest that the major tax reform in 1973

 did   not lead to changes in security returns for only       a few   days   around   the ex—

day. Rather, these results suggest a more persistent effect which can be

traced in monthly returns. This encouraging evidence is partially offset by

the comparison between the estimates of y        for   Regime I   and Regime II.      There
are    few dramatic changes, in spite of the fact that the introduction of a
capital gains tax     should   have reduced y.   The   hypothesis that       =     can be

rejected    in only one of the six equations. We cannot therefore refute our

earlier conjecture that direct  dividend taxes are reflected in returns, while
the effect of capital gains taxes is much more subtle.
            The addition of our risk proxies, the inverse price and average

dividend yield, does not alter the conclusions. While the                     variable

always enters with a statistically significant coefficient (the t—statistics

are often greater than ten), it leads to only minor reductions in the level of

the      coefficients and virtually no changes in the inter—regime differences.

The average yield variable, (D7P), also has a significant positive

coefficient.15 This suggests that a higher average dividend yield raises the

ex ante return on     a security, even in the months when it       is not paying divi-

dends. However, the size of the estimated yield coefficients are often

implausibly large. The question of how dividend policy affects required

returns in non—dividend months      should be a subject of further study.
            In   our attempt to learn why   the absolute sizes of        were larger than
expected,   we tried several alternative approaches to estimating the basic

equations. First, we added dt and           as   explanatory variables in our esti—

mating equations. These had almost no effect. We experimented with more

restrictive data sets, focusing only on the very largest companies. This also

had no effect. These results, however, underscore the possible biases in the

level of estimated dividend valuation coefficients and   further   emphasize the

need for tests which rely upon genuine variation in the tax system in studying

dividends and taxes.

IV.     Conclusions
            The   results in this paper suggest the importance   of taxes in deter-

mining   the relationship between dividend yields and stock market returns.
Using both daily and monthly data on British securities, we have documented
that changes in dividend taxation have a substantial effect on the premium

which    investors require to induce them to receive returns in the   form of   divi-
dends. Our results provide ample evidence of the importance of the biases

that have been extensively discussed in the literature. However, these biases

due to "information effects" and problems of measuring risk are common to all

tax regimes. Hence, our findings that the valuation of dividends changes

across tax regimes provides strong evidence that tax effects account for a

significant part of the positive relationship between yields and stock market

returns.

            Our conclusions thus support inferences drawn by Litzenberger and

Ramaswanr (19T9, 1962) and Gordon and Bradford (1980), and cast doubt on

those obtained by Miller and Scholes (1982) and Kalay (1982) from American

data. Of course, it     is   possible that our results cannot be extrapolated to

American securities markets. Certain tax rules, such as the investment

interest limitation stressed by Miller and Scholes (1978), differ between

Britain and the U.S. However, the significance of tax details for market

valuation of dividends has never been documented. Feenberg (1981) provides

evidence suggesting that dividends are taxable for more than 99 percent of

American investors.

            It would be valuable to extend this work in several directions.

First, some other countries, notably Canada, have significantly reformed divi-

dend taxation in recent years. Their experiences provide similar controlled

experiments for assessing tax effects. Second, our research has not examined

clientele effects, though changing tax rules offer the potential for further

exploration of this important issue. A natural project would consider whether

differences in & across firms have become less pronounced since the reductions

in dividend tax rates on most investors. Finally, an alternative method of

examining the nrket's valuation of dividends is suggested by Amoako—Adus

(1983) study of how the announcement of Canadian tax reform affected different

securities. It would be useful to apply his approach to British data,

although there are serious problems in dating the moment when expectations of

tax reform change.

          Perhaps the st important item on the agenda for future research is

the development of a theory of why firms pay dividends in environments

where they are tax penalized. Such a theory is a necessary prelude to a full

understanding of the effects of dividend taxation on real economic behavior.

A survey of some existing approaches and some empirical tests of their impli-

cations is presented in Poterba and Summers (1981.).

          1. This was calculated by multiplying the $61 billion dollars of
dividends paid by the nonfinancial corporate sector (see the Economic Report
of the President, 1983, Table B—12) by an estimate of the average marginal tax
rate on dividends. Feldstein, Dicks—Mireaux and Poterba (1983) calculated
effective dividend tax rates for years prior to 1980. Their marginal tax rate
on dividends for 1979 was •315. Since few investors are likely to experience
changes in their marginal tax rates because of dividend receipts, the average
and marginal rates are very similar.

          2. Equation (1) would hold if all investors faced the same tax
rates. In situations with important heterogeneity in the tax treatment of
dividends and capital gains, however, this expression would be replaced by a
complicated weigited average of individual tax parameters. Our exposition
focusses on "the marginal investor," in part because of difficulty with the
existing theories of how equilibrium is achieved in the presence of differen-
tial taxes. Shaefer (1983) addresses some of these questions.

          3. Prior to 1973, some investor income tax was withheld "at source"
so the actual cheque received by shareholders was less than the announced
dividend. After 1973, shareholders received the full announced dividend.

          4.   Kaplanis (1983) discusses these trading rules in greater detail.
          5.  Data on share ownership proportions for the U.K. may be found in
King, Naldrett, and Poterba (1981).

          6. There have been several recent papers concerned with questions of
tax trading around ex—dividend days. These include Kalay (1982), Elton,
Gruber, and Rentzler (1983a) and Kalay (1983), all of which discuss the magni-
tude of transactions costs for trading around the ex-day. Lakonishok and
Vermaelen (1983) have reported tests of the short—term trading hypothesis for
Canada, and concluded that it may explain ex-day price movements there. The
source of these differences might be traced to institutional details or other
factors and clearly warrants further investigation.


          7.  We began with a sample of twenty large, non—nationalized
industrial firms selected from Fortune's 1981 listing of the world's largest
500 industrial corporations. For four firms, substantial evidence of non-
trading, especially early in the sample period, or other difficulties in
finding comparable price series through time, led to exclusion from the
sample.

          8. We estimated the returns model by ordinary least squares,
                     T
         '2     1
computed a =                 for each i   firm,    and then weighted observations for the
                    t =1
th firm by 1/ IZ .         The differences between the OLS and the GLS results were

typically minor.

          9.  Further work must consider whether there are unusual share price
movements for the few days before or after ex—days, as Black and Scholes (1973)
suggested could explain U.S. ex—dividend behavior.

          10. We attempted to estimate clientele effects for each tax regime by
adding squared dividend yields to our returns model. While there were some
weak evidence of clientele effects, in the form of a negative coefficient on
the quadratic term, neither the size of this coefficient nor its differences
could be estimated with any precision given our small sample.

          11. The assumption of independence across firms at any moment is
usually rejected by securities data, and corrective estimation techniques
(Zeilner's SUR method) have been applied by Gibbons (1982) and Hess (1982,
1983). Because our monthly sample of firms is so large, these procedures were
computationaily impractical.

          12. The use of lagged dividend information forced us to eliminate
the first twelve monthly observations for each firm.

           13. This instrumental variable procedure does not equire us to use
all available lagged information in forming our estimate of X.. It is con-
sistent so long as some elements of the relevant information set 2 re
employed. Since it is a powerful tool for analyzing models wh±h involve
rational expectations, it should find ntjnierous applications in financial
economics.

          14. Other variables in the monthly regressions were measured as
follows. We calculated the after—tax risk—free return as (1.-m)rf where t
is a time series on the weighted average marginal tax rate on interest income
calculated by Ohrnial and Foldes (1975) and Ohrnial (1979), recently extended
by King, Naldrett, and Poterba (19814). The risk free return was measured as
the short term Treasury bill rate from the LBS Indices file. We calculated
    as the sum of the capital gain and dividend yield components on the
FP—Actuaries 500 Share Industrial Index.

          15. Rosenberg and Marathe (1979) and Elton, Gruber, and Rentzler
(1983a) experiment with a variety of similar modtfications to the basic CAPM
equation, adding average dividend yield variables
