A Survey of Global Impacts of Climate Change: Replication, Survey Methods, and a Statistical
Analysis

                                           ABSTRACT

The present study has two objectives. The first is a review of studies that estimate the global
economic impacts of climate change using a systematic research synthesis (SRS). In this review,
we attempt to replicate the impact estimates provided by Tol (2009, 2014) and find a large
number of errors and estimates that could not be replicated. The study provides revised estimates
for a total of 36 usable estimates from 27 studies. A second part of the study performs a statistical
analysis. While the different specifications provide alternative estimates of the damage function,
there were no large discrepancies among specifications. The preferred regression is the median,
quadratic, weighted regression. The data here omit several important potential damages, which
we estimate to add 25% to the quantified damages. With this addition, the estimated impact is
-2.04 (± 2.21) % of income at 3 °C warming and -8.06 (± 2.43) % of income at 6 °C warming.
We also considered the likelihood of thresholds or sharp convexities in the damage function and
found no evidence from the damage estimates of a sharp discontinuity or high convexity.

I.     Introduction
     Economic models predict that climate change will have significant effects on economic
 activity in several ways. Key sectors are agriculture, coastal communities due to sea-level
 rise, health, ecosystems, and energy systems. The International Panel on Climate Change
 undertook several surveys of the overall economic impacts of climate change in the
 Second through Fifth Assessment Reports. In the Fourth Report, the IPCC stated that
 “Global mean losses could be 1 to 5% of GDP for 4°C of warming.” (IPCC, Fourth
 Assessment Report, Impacts, 2007, section 5.7). The Fifth Assessment Report does not
 include a numerical estimate but has a table of impacts (see below). The summary in the
 Fifth Assessment Report states, “In sum, estimates of the aggregate economic impact of
 climate change are relatively small but with a large downside [sic, but presumably
 meaning upside] risk.” (IPCC, Fifth Assessment Report, Impacts, 2013, p. 692)
     The first part of this study is a review of estimates of the global impacts of climate
 change. There have been several surveys of impacts by researchers. One of the most
 influential was Tol (2009), which contained a survey of the literature and a statistical
 analysis. This study was widely criticized as containing significant errors. Tol published a
 corrections (Tol 2014), which also had errors, and the journal published an Editorial
 Statement (2015) describing the errors and referring interested scholars to the IPCC Fifth
 Assessment Report. There was a closely related table in the IPCC Fifth Assessment
 Report, which was almost identical to Tol’s latest summary in Tol (2014), but the source
 was not attributed.1 This report will concentrate on the original Tol article and the 2014
 revision.
     There are concerns that inaccurate estimates have affected the scholarly and
 policymakers’ views of the damages resultant from climate change impacts. Given the
 multiple errors contained in the Tol survey, and the apparent republication of his
 estimates in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, we believe that an independent look at the
 methods and range of damage estimates is of great importance. There is a growing body
 of evidence on the difficulty of replicating studies, and this is clearly essential to areas of
 interest as centrally important as climate change damages (see particularly Ioannidis
 2016).
     Given the already large and growing body of literature surrounding the impacts of
 climate change, we selected two different approaches to a survey of the academic
 literature on impacts. We first undertook a classical systematic research synthesis, or
 “SRS.” It turns out that this approach, as we will explain below, had limited success. We
 therefore augmented the SRS with other information. We also reviewed the estimates in
 the various Tol surveys, particularly the final tabulation in Tol (2014), to see if we could
 bring a close to this long-running saga.
 The second contribution of this study is to examine alternative specifications and
 estimates that can be used for empirical damage functions in integrated assessment
 models (IAMs). The approach was to use the 36 usable estimates and treat them as data

                                                                                                2
  drawn from an underlying damage function. The preferred regression is the median
  quadratic weighted regression. The estimated impact from the preferred regression is
  1.63 % of income at 3 °C warming and 6.53% of income at a 6 °C warming. We make a
  judgmental adjustment of 25% to cover unquantified sectors. The reasons for this
  adjustment were provided in Nordhaus and Sztorc (2013) and are given in the Appendix.
  With this adjustment, the estimated impact is -2.04 (+ 2.21) % of income at 3 °C warming
  and -8.16 (+ 2.43) % of income at a 6 °C warming. An additional major conclusion
  concerns the likelihood of thresholds or sharp convexity in the damage function. A variety
  of tests suggest that there is no indication from the damage estimates of a sharp
  discontinuity or high convexity.

              We add an important note on the sign convention on “damages” and “impacts.” In
      this study, damages and impacts are measured with a negative sign. Therefore, the
      preferred estimate is for an impact or damage of -2.04% of income at 3 °C warming.
      Sometimes, damages are measured as a positive number. This confusion is probably one
      of the reasons why impact or damage estimates are incorrectly tabulated.

         We close with a note of urgency on the importance of greater attention to damage
  estimates. This point was also emphasized in a recent report of a panel of the National
  Academy of Sciences (NAS) on the social cost of carbon: “In the longer term, the
  Interagency Working Group [of the US government] should develop a damages module
  that meets the overall criteria for scientific basis, transparency, and uncertainty
  characterization: 1. It should disaggregate market and nonmarket climate damages by
  region and sector, with results that are presented in both monetary and natural units and
  that are consistent with empirical and structural economic studies of sectoral impacts
  and damages. 2. It should include representation of important interactions and spillovers
  among regions and sectors, as well as feedbacks to other modules. 3. It should explicitly
  recognize and consider damages that affect welfare either directly or through changes to
  consumption, capital stocks (physical, human, natural), or through other channels. 4. It
  should include representation of adaptation to climate change and the costs of
  adaptation. 5. It should include representation of non-gradual damages, such as those
  associated with critical climatic or socioeconomic thresholds.” (National Research Council
  2017, p. 147)

             The present study is but a tiny step down the road recommended by the NAS
      committee. It starts by compiling an accurate list of the global studies to date. Much more
      work is needed to fulfill the ambitious agenda laid out by the report.

II.      Methodology
      Introduction to research synthesis and meta-analysis

         There are two main methods for research syntheses: narrative and quantitative. Each
      of these approaches has advantages as well as disadvantages. The narrative approach is
      the most common one for literature review because it is straightforward, especially when
      the researcher is familiar with the literature on the topic. But this approach is susceptible

                                                                                                  3
to the subjective judgment of the researcher and may fail to examine characteristics of
studies as potential reasons for disparate results (Wolf 1986).
   The quantitative approach uses a systematic approach to reviewing a topic.
Quantitative research synthesis can take different forms, generally grouped into three
categories: (1) meta-analysis (which we will confine to classical meta-analysis with a
well-defined sampled population); (2) research synthesis with a clear sampling
procedure, which we call “systematic research synthesis”; (3) and research synthesis
without a clear sampling procedure, which we call “non-systematic research synthesis.”
While the quantitative approach is not immune to criticisms, the problem of subjectivity
is generally less serious if the researcher conducts the analysis in a systematic fashion.
   The history of quantitative research synthesis goes back to early 20th century. The first
such synthesis appears to be Karl Pearson’s study in 1904 in which he combined five
separate samples in analyzing the correlation between enteric fever inoculation and
mortality (Pearson 1904). Other examples of early work in this area include Tippett
(1931), Birge (1932), Fisher (1932), Cochran (1937), and Mosteller and Bush (1954).
   The term “meta-analysis” was coined by Gene V. Glass in a paper in 1976, in which he
defined a meta-analysis as “the analysis of analyses . . . [that is,] the statistical analysis of a
large collection of analysis results from individual studies for the purpose of integrating
the findings” (Glass 1976). Since then, meta-analysis techniques have been greatly
advanced and widely applied in fields such as medicine, education, and psychology (for
some examples, see Glass, McGaw, and Smith 1981; Hunter, Schmidt, and Jackson 1982;
Rosenthal 1984; Hedges and Olkin 1985).2 The term meta-analysis is now widely used for
a compilation of studies even though it does not have a probabilistic interpretation, but
we propose a stricter definition below.
   There is a long tradition of using meta-analysis in the biomedical literature, largely
because clinical trials of new drugs are expensive to conduct and meta-analyses are a
cost-effective way for synthesizing individual studies. A numerical example will illustrate
the approach. Assume that five independent studies have been conducted for examining
the effectiveness of a drug XYZ. The results of the studies are shown in Table 1. No study
shows effectiveness at a 1% probability, while three show effectiveness at a 5%
probability. However, when we combine the five studies, they show effectiveness with
high confidence (p = 0.04%). This example is one of a classic meta-analysis because the
studies are drawn from the same distribution.

                                                                                                 4

 XYZi


   This simple example illustrates some key points about meta-analysis. First, in
synthesizing the estimates from separate studies, it is important to ensure that those
estimates are independent. Second, the sample sizes of different studies in a meta-
analysis give important information in the calculation of the combined statistic. All else
equal, the sample size of a study is a proxy of the reliability of its results. Third, a meta-
analysis can reveal more accurate results than from individual studies; in the example
above, even though four out of five studies do not report statistically significant effects,
the combined test shows a significant effect. Finally, and most important for the topic at
hand, the requirements for deriving a statistical interpretation of a synthesis of different
studies is very demanding and unlikely to be met in many circumstances.
   We emphasize that our definition of “meta-analysis” is narrower than the standard
usage in economics and many other areas. We limit this term to a collection of studies
where the studies are drawn from a well-defined population; and where the samples can
be deemed independent (or where the dependence is clearly defined). Under this
definition, the studies can be combined using standard statistical tools.

       The role of meta-analyses and research syntheses in economics

        A central issue for thinking about meta-analysis and research summaries concerns
the population from which the studies is drawn. In classical meta-analysis, such as studies
of the effect of anti-depressants discussed above, the sample is in principle the adult
population recruited for clinical trials. If the samples are from the same population and
are independent, and if the treatment protocols are identical, then it is appropriate to
combine those samples into a meta-sample, and this larger sample can estimate the effect
of the drug more precisely than the individual studies.
   There is a growing literature that presents “meta-analyses” in economics. Stanley’s
survey cites meta-analyses of union wage premiums, recreation benefits, education and
productivity, minimum wage effects, gasoline demand elasticities, the benefits of
endangered species, and of Ricardian equivalence (Stanley 2001). We have identified 46
studies with “meta-analysis” in the titles of 245 economics journals covered by JSTOR.

                                                                                             5
       None of these were classical meta-analyses. A very small number had properties where
       the populations were potentially homogeneous, but none exploited this property to
       derive improved estimates. About half of the studies were research summaries, often
       employing regression analyses. They are “quantitative research syntheses,” some
       systematic, some non-systematic. However, the conditions for an appropriate meta-
       analysis almost never apply for research in economics and environmental economics.
       Many of them look at the same data (for example the Current Population Survey or
       government data on productivity) and the difference might be the econometric technique
       or the sample period.
           An example of something mislabeled as a meta-analysis is Stanley’s study of Ricardian
       equivalence (Stanley 1998). He selects his sample as all studies included in EconLit that
       refer to “Ricardian equivalence,” claim to test Ricardian equivalence, and report the
       corresponding test statistic. There is no discussion about the overlap of the underlying
       data (e.g., years, countries, macro v. micro). Rather, the emphasis is on testing the
       influence of the equation specification on the statistical significance. This study therefore
       clearly qualifies as a systematic research synthesis but not as a meta-analysis in our
       sense. We do not downplay the importance of systematic research syntheses. These
       allow researchers to examine existing research in a way that may help avoid bias. But a
       probabilistic interpretation usually does not automatically apply and must be determined
       in each case.
           The difference between meta-analysis and research synthesis can be illustrated for our
       subject, the impacts of climate change. For example, two studies might summarize the
       impacts of sea-level rise based upon the same underlying study. These estimates would
       clearly not be independent. Or a study might be an update of an earlier study by the same
       author. In this case, the author might have revised the estimates for some but not all
       sectors. These challenges imply that a research synthesis might be a useful summary of
       the literature, but it would generally not be appropriate to assume that the studies are
       independent. The major potential advantage of systematic research syntheses for impacts
       is to avoid subjectivity in the selection of studies. We will see below that this has been a
       major issue in current surveys.

III.      Systematic research summary for impacts of climate change
          Systematic Research Summary
          It is immediately apparent that the different studies of the impacts of climate change
       do not qualify for a classic meta-analysis. The results clearly are not independent samples
       from a population.
           Instead, we begin with a systematic research summary (SRS). We now describe the
       method by which we undertook the SRS for impacts. The starting point for any SRS is to
       define a research area and a universe to search. The universe to search for the present
       analysis was designated as platforms that aggregate relevant academic literature. The
       platforms assessed were EconLit, JSTOR, and Google Scholar. The first two are ones that
       have strict criteria on inclusion (primarily publication in a designated set of scholarly
       journals). Google Scholar is much more inclusive, but the set of criteria is not well-
       defined.

                                                                                                   6
        Each of these platforms was tested to determine whether a search turned up most
of the studies used in Tol (2014). EconLit and Google Scholar passed this first hurdle
(although not with flying colors). JSTOR failed miserably, containing only two of the
studies in question, so JSTOR was dropped from the list of search engines.
       The two remaining platforms were then assessed based on our ability to use the
platform for the present study. Keeping in mind that our research methodology would
require us to go through each entry retrieved from our search string, we determined that
EconLit provides a manageable number of entries while Google Scholar provides so many
entries as to be unwieldy. Google Scholar would in principle be the preferred engine, as it
captured the available body of literature more fully. However, the size of the resulting
number was too large to be feasible within the scope of the present study. Given this
constraint, the following SRS is based on those studies retrieved from EconLit alone. (See
Appendix Table A-1 for the success of different search engines.)
         The next step was to define the research area. While the general subject (impacts
of climate change) was clear, generating a list of studies requires defining a string search,
or list of keywords. Based on our experience and the studies included in Tol (2014), we
tested several strings that might be included in the study. The general criterion was that
the string should include all studies, but at the same time should yield a manageable
number of results. To create this search string, we identified several key words and
linking syntaxes, creating from these 21 unique search strings.
        Each search string was run through the three databases, and we noted: (1) the
number of total entries returned and (2) the number of studies from Tol (2014) included
in the search string. The desired result was to optimize a function to have a large number
under criterion (2) while having a relatively small number of studies to examine in (1). To
keep the study manageable, we limited the number of studies to under 2000. The final
search string used was as follows: “(damage OR impact) AND climate AND cost.” This
string generated nearly 1700 studies in EconLit. By contrast, the number of hits in Google
Scholar was 2,800,000, while the number of hits in Google was 64,000,000.
       The next step was to review the abstracts of each of these studies and determine
the relevance of each to the present study, and our degree of confidence that the study
was or was not relevant.3 This process of coding each study was done as precisely and as
conservatively as possible to allow for the highest number of relevant studies to enter
into our analysis. Of the 1700 identified studies, only 24 studies, or just over one percent
of studies that passed the string test, were found to address global impacts from climate
change. We then read the articles from the 24 studies that seemed likely candidates on
the basis of their abstracts. From the 24 studies, only 11 provided enough information to
determine global damages, of which only six were included in Tol (2014).
        To summarize the results of the SRS: It turned out that using the approach of a
formal SRS was of limited value. To begin with, the field is too diffuse to define a well-
identified subject. Unlike a subject like “The effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs on cancer sites other than the colon and rectum,” “impacts of climate change”


3   See Table A-2 for our full coding system.
                                                                                             7
covered too much ground. It turned up too many sectors, regions, countries, types of
studies, policy proposals, and so forth. While Google Scholar turned up virtually all the
studies that we knew, it was impractical.
        A further finding from our SRS concerned the results when we limited the number
of studies to a manageable number (fewer than 2000 abstracts). In this case, again
because of the diffuse character of the field, only ½% of studies turned out to contain
useful information. While these studies were additions to the list of previously identified
studies, it was an extremely small yield.
       Finally, and most interesting, is that the SRS missed a substantial fraction of the
previously identified studies. This occurred because they were in obscure journals or
books, or in fields that were not covered by either EconLit or JSTOR.
       Non-systematic Research Summary
       Given the limited ability of our SRS methodology to return a useful universe of
studies, we combined it with a second approach, known as a “non-systematic research
summary.” In this approach, the universe of studies was selected by a combination of
formal and informal methods, such as the SRS above, the results of the Tol survey, and
other studies that were known to the researchers.
       In our case, we included in our research summary those studies included in Tol
(2014), plus those relevant studies found in our SRS but not included in Tol (2014). To
this end, we reviewed all studies included in Tol (2014) as he expanded the list of
relevant studies from his 2009 article. A summary of our findings is included in our
results section, and more detailed accounts of the reviewed studies from Tol (2014) can
be found in Appendix Table A-3.
       Most of the studies from Tol (2014) and our SRS provided explicit estimates of
global damages. However, four studies provided only regional estimates, and we
calculated global damages ourselves. 4 There were differences between our results and




4 These studies were: Maddison 2003, Rehdanz and Maddison 2005, Maddison and
Rehdanz 2011, and Kemfert 2001. In these four studies, the authors estimated damages
for different sets of between 67 to 88 nations and eight to 11 regions. We estimated
global damages for each study by aggregating the product of each nation’s individual
damages and its share of global income. Where national GDP and per capita GDP figures
were required for our calculations, we used GDP in 2010 prices from the IMF, in
international USD. To examine differences between current and future damage estimates,
we converted all per capita and national GDP data to their future values using scaling
factors derived from the FUND model’s regional growth rates. Income data was scaled to
the relevant year in each study. We are indebted to David Anthoff for providing these
figures. The regional disaggregation was found using the model’s technical tables (Tol
and Anthoff, 2014).


                                                                                             8
      Tol’s that may have arisen because he used a different methodology. However, he did not
      provide his methods, so his results could not be replicated.5
              In undertaking our replication, it has proven extremely difficult to determine the
      results for many of the studies. One set of studies states clearly the global results for a
      given temperature change. A second set provides estimates by region, and these can then
      be aggregated for a given distribution of world output. A third set does not provide full
      information, and for these we needed to go to the authors to find the estimates. Even for
      these, the base year for the temperature is not uniform and is not always clear. So, while
      we have made great efforts to verify the results, even these are likely to contain residual
      errors.
          Finally, we note that the results are usually cited as impacts on “global GDP.” This
      nomenclature is somewhat misleading, because the concepts often differ from standard
      GDP measures. Most damage estimates include non-market output (such as health or
      ecosystem damages), and some output estimates are closer to net rather than gross, or
      use consumption or the consumption-equivalent of utility as the output estimate. These
      differences will be important for the numerator (damages) but generally the adjustments
      for the denominator (output) will be minimal. The only exception to the statement about
      the denominator is that it will make a substantial difference whether output is measured
      at market exchange rates (MER) or at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. We
      take the PPP approach whenever there is a choice.
IV.       Results
          We have collected the results of the studies from Tol and from our systematic and
      non-systematic research syntheses in Table 2. Each row is a different global damage
      estimate, so studies with more than one estimate are represented in multiple rows. The
      first group is from Tol, while the second are ones identified in our SRS and not in Tol.
          After introducing the study’s author and year, the next two columns report the status.
      They are grouped into four categories according to the status of the impact estimate:
      correct in Tol (Y), incorrect in Tol (Err), unable to replicated (NR), or omitted (O). Table 5
      collates the totals in each category for the 2009 and 2014 studies.
          The columns indicate the global average temperature increase above pre-industrial
      levels in degrees C and the resultant impact to global income or output in percentage
      terms. To provide a glimpse of how estimates have been revised over time for each study,
      we have included estimates from Tol (2009), Tol (2014), and the present analysis. There
      are 31 different damage estimates. Of these, six were generated by the SRS but not
      included in Tol’s survey, and 25 were from the expanded Tol list.
         Table 3 shows the studies that were added for the statistical analysis in the next
      section. These included three integrated assessment models that include damage
      modules. Two of the estimates were calculated from the MUP study (Gillingham 2015),
      and the other was provided by Chris Hope (see the discussion in Table A-3).

      region’s share of global income.

  Since the number of studies and estimates is confusing, we have summarized the
numbers in Table 4.
    Table 5 shows an assessment of the accuracy and replicability of the two Tol studies
using the estimates in the current study as a benchmark. Of the original 14 impact
estimates, 7 were incorrect or not replicated. Of the 21 impact estimates in the 2014
study, 10 were incorrect or could not be replicated.
    Most of the cases of error or lack of replicability arose because the primary source did
not provide a clear and unambiguous estimate of global damages. In some cases, Tol did
not provide the methodology for deriving estimates, so the difference may arise due to
different methods. Some cases (such as the wrong sign for impacts or taking the wrong
scenarios when the preference was clearly stated) were just plain mistakes. We also note
that some of our estimates could not be derived from the primary source. In several
cases, we sought and received clarifications or estimates from the authors, and these are
the basis of our estimates. (See the discussion in Table A-3 for details.)

V.      Statistical Analysis
         It will be useful to synthesize the different studies to provide a central estimate, using
     the individual studies as “data.” This approach is clearly warranted for standard meta-
     analyses, such as in the case of studies which report independent clinical trials. In the
     present situation, the results of the chosen studies are sometimes dependent, so treating
     them as independent data points is less clearly appropriate. We have therefore made
     adjustments to reflect the potential dependence. Additionally, in our primary estimates,
     we have assumed that there is a true relationship, and that the data points are drawn
     from that relationship with errors of measurement of the damages, but not of the
     temperature changes themselves.
            The approach we take is the following: We begin with the estimates shown in
     Tables 2 and 4.v These yield 36 usable estimates from 27 studies.
             We then determine a set of weights for each study, from 0 to 1. A weight of 1 is
     given to the latest versions of estimates that used independent methods which, in our
     view, were appropriate for estimating damages. We downgraded either earlier versions
     of estimates (such as earlier versions of DICE model estimates), studies that primarily
     relied on other studies, and studies that used what we view as uninformative methods. As
     an example of the latter, our opinion is that studies relating current incomes to
     “happiness” and weather provide little information about long-run impacts of climate
     change, so these receive a low weight.
            Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of the data points. Visually, the immediate
     impression is that there are many studies of theoretical temperature increases in the 2 to
     4 °C range, and that they cluster in the range of a loss of 0 to 4% of global output.
            Table 6 shows the distribution of weights for the 38 estimates. 10 studies received
     full weight, while 17 were omitted or accorded minimal weights. Appendix Table A-6
     shows these estimates and weights in detail. We preview at this point that the weighting
     made little difference to the results, and, while it introduces a degree of subjectivity, it
     does not skew the results.

 Figure shows the results of 36 estimates with positive weight. The area of each circle
 represents its weight.



       We then estimated several specifications of damage functions. These were as
follows:
          Regression specifications: weighted and unweighted; ordinary least squares
           (“OLS”) and quantile regression (“Median”).
          Three alternative versions of polynomial: quadratic term only (“Quad”), linear
           and quadratic terms (“LinQuad”), and nonlinear with estimated exponent
           (“Expon”).
                    Omitting outliers from the top and bottom: For each of the first two
           sets of cases, we also ran regressions which omitted data starting from the
           bottom and from the top. For example, starting from the top, we omit estimates
           with temperature greater than 8° C because these are highly speculative and
           would have great weight in an OLS regression. We can also omit estimates with
           temperatures less than 2 °C, because these are relatively unimportant for
           damage functions in the range of 3 to 6 °C, which is most important for the end
           of the 21st century.




                                                                                                          14
       The most useful way to tabulate the results was to predict damages at 3 and 6 °C.
Table 7 tabulates the results by specification, and the full results are shown in Appendix
Table A-7ABC.
        Another way to visualize the implications of different specifications is shown in
Figure 2. This shows the predictions from the regressions for seven different
specifications along with the actual study results (the graph is slightly truncated for
legibility).

        The authors’ preferred regression is the median quadratic weighted regression.
The impact is -1.63 (+ 1.77) % of income at 3 °C warming and -6.53 (+ 1.95) % of income
at a 6 °C warming. Note that the errors reported here represent forecast errors in the
preferred equation. If we include all specifications (last rows of the table), the impact
                                                                                            15
is -1.8 (+ 0.74) % of income at 3 °C warming and -6.7 (+ 3.0) % of income at a 6 °C
warming. We note as well that the weighted regressions give larger negative predictions
(damages) than the unweighted regressions.
       We make a judgmental adjustment of 25% to cover unquantified sectors. This
adjustment is described in detail in Nordhaus and Sztorc (2013) and in the Appendix.
With this adjustment, the estimated impact is -2.04 (+ 2.21) % of income at 3 °C warming
and -8.16 (+ 2.43) % of income at a 6 °C warming.
       A final important finding concerns the possibility of sharp thresholds in damages.
Technically, this concerns the degree of convexity of the damage function. Many damage
functions are assumed to be linear-quadratic (as for example in most versions of the DICE
model). By contrast, some scholars believe that the damage function is more convex. An
important example that has been used in policy discussions is an approach which
assumes a sharp threshold at a temperature increase of 2 °C; implicitly this implies a very
sharp kink in the curve near that threshold. There is virtually no information on this
question in the impacts literature, but we can test it using the results collected here.
        Tests for thresholds or convexity are shown in Table 7 in the rows labeled
“Exponent.” This reports results of an equation of the form D / Y  T    . There are
four versions of this: weighted and unweighted combined with ones with and without the
linear term (γ). Note that, implicitly, the quadratic version has no linear term. The
estimate of β averages 1.3 for four the different specifications. The four estimates of β are
shown as the estimate of c(2) in the last four rows of Appendix Table A-7C. The authors’
preferred estimate would be a weighted regression with the linear term, which has an
exponent of β = 1.15 (+ 0.28). This result is important because it indicates that the impact
estimates suggest a convexity that is less than quadratic. Moreover it strongly rejects
damage estimates with a sharp discontinuity or convexity (as would be represented by a
high value of β). Instead, it appears that the quadratic or linear-quadratic is a reasonable
way of approximating the results of the damage studies.
       We can also examine the degree of polynomial in the FUND and PAGE09 models
(from data supplied by their authors). In a linear-quadratic specification, the PAGE09
model has an exponent of β = 1.82 (+ 0.20). The FUND model is virtually linear over the
range of observations used in the MUP study.

VI.      Conclusion
         The present study is a contribution to understanding the damages that are likely to
      occur with future climate change. It focuses on two separate questions: a review of
      current studies, and a synthesis of these studies.
         Review of existing studies
          On the first question, a review of existing studies, we used two approaches. The first is
      a formal systematic research synthesis (SRS) in which we used different databases to find
      studies of impacts. It turns out that this was only partially successful, because the
      databases turned up either too small or too large a number of studies to be examined. We
      then turned to a research synthesis, which combined the results of the SRS with a list of
      existing studies, primarily from impact studies of Richard Tol. In the end, we found 36
      usable estimates from 27 studies.
          One question that had been raised by scholars was whether the Tol estimates were
      accurate. We therefore endeavored to replicate the estimates of the Tol studies. Of the
      original 14 estimates, 7 were found to be incorrect or not replicable. In the final revision
      in 2014 (a correction of a correction), we found that of 21 estimates, 10 were found to be
      inaccurate or not replicable. This result adds to the growing body of work that indicates
      the low rate of replicability in studies. This is of particular concern in the present case
      because the Tol survey was supposed to help researchers wade through a large literature.
          We add one final note for researchers: Our investigations have found few cases in
      which the techniques of formal systematic research synthesis, and no cases of true meta-
      analyses, were used in economics. Our results are not encouraging in this respect. In
      effect, we never got to first base. We were unable to find a database of studies that met
      the twin criteria of (i) turning up all the studies that we know about and (ii) doing so with
      a universe of studies that was sufficiently small (<2,000) to allow a careful review of their
      content. It might be that further refinements that sift through the numerous (> 1 million)
      results from Google Scholar or a similar comprehensive data set could improve our
      search results, but we have not found such a technique.
         It is useful to have a compilation of global aggregate damage estimates from climate
      change. This study has evaluated the results from Tol (2009, 2014) and found significant
      errors or inability to replicate the results. We add to the literature by carefully
      documenting our methodology and making it readily available. Further studies can work
      toward building a general consensus of the literature by performing research summaries
      that are both comprehensive and objective.
          Statistical summary
          The second contribution of this study is to examine alternative specifications and
      estimates that can be used for empirical damage functions in integrated assessment
      models (IAMs). The approach was to use the 36 estimates and treat them as data drawn
      from an underlying damage function. We also used weights attached to each estimate that
      reflected the authors’ judgement as to whether it contributed independent information


                                                                                                18
about damages. Figure 1 above provides a visual display of the estimates and their
weights.
       Our statistical procedures used several different approaches to estimating damage
functions. They were different combinations of weighted and unweighted regressions;
ordinary least squares and median regressions; quadratic, linear-quadratic, and
polynomial specifications; and limited samples to exclude temperature extremes.
        Three major conclusions emerged from the estimates. First, while the
specifications provided different estimates, there were no large discrepancies. The
preferred regression is the median, quadratic, weighted regression. With a judgmental
adjustment of 25% on top of the quantified estimates, the estimated impact is -2.04
(+ 2.21) % of income at 3 °C warming and -8.16 (+ 2.43) % of income at a 6 °C warming.

      A second major conclusion concerns the likelihood of thresholds or sharp
convexity in the damage function. A variety of tests suggest that there is no indication
from existing damage estimates of a sharp discontinuity or high (greater than quadratic)
convexity. Instead, it appears that the quadratic or linear-quadratic is a reasonable way of
approximating the shape of the damage function.

       General conclusion on impact studies
        An additional warning is that the impact estimates are generally not
comprehensive. They often cover key sectors such as agriculture, sea-level rise, energy,
and forestry. Most do not include many non-market impacts, and the quantifications of
non-market impacts that do exist are generally just guesses. As examples, estimates of the
losses from ecosystems or damages from melting permafrost are omitted or unreliable.
This point suggests that the figures examined here are likely to be underestimates of true
damages.
       As a final conclusion, we emphasize the limited nature of work on impacts. There
are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of impact studies in different areas such as health,
agriculture, energy, ecosystems, and coastal structures. However, very few are
comprehensive both in sectors and regions.
       Moreover, few organizations have the resources to integrate different studies to
prepare the comprehensive estimates that are needed for use in economic-climate
modeling. Virtually all the work on impacts has been performed by small groups of
scholars. By comparison with studies in other parts of the climate-change nexus (such as
monitoring or climate modeling), comprehensive impact studies are almost an
afterthought in the study of climate change. Yet they are critical in estimates of policy
instruments, such as the social cost of carbon, or the appropriate emissions,
concentrations, or temperature targets. Concentrated independent scholarly work on
impacts is critically needed.

The above table shows with an “X” if the given platform turned up the given study in one
of the three search engines used. This search examined only the studies used in Tol
(2014). A platform was given an “X” if it had the study in its database, regardless of
whether it was returned as a result from our search string. The number of studies turned
up with the search string was smaller than the number shown here, so the number here is
the maximum that could be included with an ideal set of search strings.

Further note on temperature: We have based the temperature increase from the global
average in 1920-1940. The increase from that base is calculated to be 0.64, 0.730, 0.72,
0.82 °C above the base for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 (where we use five-year moving
averages when possible).
Estimates from Tol surveys
The following studies were included in Tol (2009)

Nordhaus a, 1994a (Y)
The impact presented in Tol (2014) is -1.3% of global output for a three-degree C
temperature increase. This has been rounded from the author’s finding of -1.33% and is
generally correct. This paper uses -1.33% for accuracy.

Nordhaus b, 1994 (E09, E14)
(i) The impact presented in Tol (2014) is -3.6% for a three-degree C temperature
increase and is the mean estimate of the likelihood of high consequence events presented
in scenario A of the study. (ii) Tol excluded scenarios B and C from his survey; these
scenarios report significantly higher impacts and were excluded from Tol without
discussion. We also include scenario B in our analysis as 1994b-ii. This is an example of
where the Tol survey selected only one of multiple scenarios, and in this case was the one
with the lowest impact.

Fankhauser, 1995 (Y)
The estimate used is in line with the authors’ findings.
Tol, 1995 (Y)
The figure Tol cites in 2014 is correct. It has, however, been incorrectly cited elsewhere.
Fankhauser (1995) cites it as -1.5% GNP for a 3-degree C temperature rise while
Mendelsohn (2000) cites it as -1.5% GNP for a 2.5-degree C rise. Tol's actual study shows
an impact of -1.9% on global GNP and an impact of -1.5% of USA GNP for a CO2 doubling,
which is 2.5 degrees in his model. Global figures have been used in the present study.

Nordhaus and Yang, 1996 (Y)
In the original study by Nordhaus and Yang the impacts of increased temperature on
output were reported in regional figures rather than global. The global estimate provided
in Tol (2014) is confirmed using weights for 2100 and impact coefficients as shown in
Table 2 of Nordhaus and Yang.
Plambeck and Hope, 1996 (E09, E14)

                                                                                           24
This study relies on the PAGE95 model. No methods were provided by Tol, and no
estimates of damages appear in the article. We cannot find any source for the impact, and
the PAGE95 is not being supported by its author. Therefore, we have no estimate for this
study.

Mendelsohn, Morrison, Schlesinger, and Andronova or MMSA (2000) and Mendelsohn,
Schlesinger, and Williams or MSW (2000) (E09, E14)
Tol (2009) and Tol (2014) differ in the study referenced with no explanation for the
difference. These two studies use similar methodologies but have different underlying
models and results. None of the results in either of the original studies corresponds to the
results reported by Tol (2009) or (2014). MMSA reports 3 temperature increases and
four results. We report the two higher temperature changes. MSW reports results for
several models, and we report the model average, which are all for a 2.2 °C increase. The
results are (i) a benefit of 0.03% for experimental impacts functions and (ii) 0.07% for
cross-sectional impacts functions. MMSA reports 3 temperature increases and four
results. We report the two higher temperature changes. The average results for (iii) are 2
°C shows a benefit of 0.08% and while (iv) the result for 3.5 °C is a benefit of 0.01%.

Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000 (Y)
Tol (2014) reports the output-weighted figure of climate change impacts for a 2.5-degree
C temperature increase of -1.5% of global output, which is correct. The original study
reports another impact figure that is population-weighted, and is -1.88%. In the present
study, we also used output weighted figures and note where there are weighting-related
differences.

Tol, 2002 (Y)
The estimate used is in line with the authors’ findings.

Maddison, 2003 (NR)
The results could not be replicated because the method was not stated. It's unclear how
Tol got damages of -0.1% of global output. Maddison assumed a household production
function and ran a regression to find the increase in costs of several commodities due to
temperature and precipitation changes, controlling for several potentially confounding
variables. He then estimated for the change in cost of living index for 88 countries due to
a 2.5-degree C temperature increase. Changes in temperature and precipitation due to a
2.5-degree C temperature increase were estimated using the United Kingdom
Meteorological Office's GCM. It is not stated whether the increase is relative to
contemporaneous or pre-industrial, but the logic is clear that it is for contemporaneous
(roughly 2000), so we have added 0.6 °C to make the figures comparable with other
studies. We take IMF data on country-level 2010 GDP using market exchange rates. We
calculate weighting factors as the country's share of output relative to all the countries
included in the study. This weighting factor is multiplied by the study's cost of living
index change figure to find country-specific damages. These are summed to find global
damages in 2100 due to 2.5 degree C temperature increase. Note that the results exclude
China and the Russian Federation.

                                                                                         25
Rehdanz and Maddison, 2005 (O, Y)
The authors estimate the extent to which changes in temperature and precipitation affect
happiness using panel data on 67 countries. They calculate the amount GDP would need
to increase (decrease) to offset the change in happiness due to temperature and
precipitation changes for two 30-year time periods. They use the first regression model
to get GDP impact, which used mean temperature in the hottest and coldest month and
mean precipitation in the wettest and driest month. They use that climate coefficient to
get the GDP increase (decrease) needed to maintain happiness at its current level given
the predicted changes in temperature and precipitation for two time intervals of 30 years
each. It is important to note that the authors do not compute damages for a specific
average surface air temperature increase for these time intervals, but rather compute it
for an average rise in the mean warmest and coolest months. Tol, according to his own
account, added up the numbers by country.

The authors present two results, (i) for 2069and (ii) for 2039. The data are averaged
from 14 GCMs and scaled to a projected mean global temperature increase of 0.620
degrees C and 1.024 degrees C for each of the two time intervals ending in years 2039
and 2069, respectively. The deviations are from the average of 1961-90. These are 0.24 °C
above preindustrial, so we have added this number to the temperature change.

We have used IMF 2010 data on GDP using market exchange rates and scaled this up to
the relevant years using assumed FUND regional growth rates. Because the authors
compute losses in terms of 1995 per capita dollar amounts, we use 2010 per capita GDP
figures to find an implied percent decrease after adjusting for inflation. This is then
applied to the country GDP and multiplied by the country-weighting factor, which is its
relative output to global output of countries included in the study. These damages are
then summed to reach the final global damages in four instances, with two distinct time
intervals and two climate conditions. We report damage estimates that include damages
from both temperature and precipitation. It is noteworthy that our results show that
damages are a smaller share of global GDP in 2069 than in 2039, and that damages are
higher assuming that they are only due to temperature increases rather than both
changes in temperature and precipitation.

Hope, 2006 (E09, E14)

This study uses the PAGE2002 model. The study does not report an impact value. The
2010 Interagency Working Group (p. 9) provides an estimate based on model runs, which
calculates an impact of -1.4% at a 3 °C warming. We cannot replicate this number and
find an impact of -1.1% at a 3 °C warming. The estimates reported in Tol (2009) are
+0.9% or -0.9% in Tol (2014). On Tol estimates, note that the first estimate had a benefit,
while the second had a cost. They are both wrong and cannot be replicated.

The number quoted in the present paper was derived by the authors as follows: Hope
provided 10,000 runs of the model. We fitted a quadratic regression and used the
prediction of the model at 2.5 °C warming.

Nordhaus, 2006 (E09, E14)
This study provides impacts on global output of a temperature increase with and without
mid-continental drying and with three different weightings: area, population and output.
Tol (2009, 2014) reports (i), which is the estimate without continental drying and
output-weighted. This was clearly not preferred. The preferred estimate (ii) clearly stated
in Nordhaus (2006) is output-weighted, but with continental drying, bringing the
estimate up to 1.05 percent of global income. Tol also indicated that one of the damage
estimates is calibrated to a 2.5-degree C temperature increase, whereas it is actually for
3-degrees C.
The following studies were not included in Tol (2009) but were included in Tol (2014).

Nordhaus, 2008 (Y)
The estimate provided by Tol (2014) of -2.5 percent of global output deviates only
slightly from the actual figure of -2.6 percent. This was incorrectly reported as included in
Tol (2009) in Table 1 of Tol (2014).

Maddison and Rehdanz, 2011 (NR)
It is unclear how Tol estimated damages of -11.5 percent of global output. This study is
very similar to Rehdanz and Maddison (2005) in approach and scope. A key point to note
is that in this study the authors measure WTA for losses and WTP for gains. By
aggregating panel data for 79 countries on happiness scores taken from the World Value
Survey and combining that with climate data they aim to approximate the impact climate
can have on life satisfaction. Climate is coded as ‘degree-months’, which is the aggregate
monthly difference between the measured climate from a temperature of 65 °F (18.3 °C).
Damages, or compensating surplus as it is termed in the study, are found by calculating
the difference in satisfaction that would be required to account for the change in degree-
months from climate change. The authors use Hadley CM3's SRES A2 climate scenario,
which predicts a 4-degree C temperature increase above pre-industrial levels by 2070-
2099 (Betts et al., 2011). We scaled global income to the year 2085, which is the middle of
the range provided by the authors. It appears Tol has incorrectly used a median
temperature result from the A1Fl scenario. To find aggregate damages we aggregated the


                                                                                          27
product of the percentage change in welfare reported by the authors and individual
country output weighting factors.

Bosello et al., 2012 (Y)
The study is a CGE analysis of 7 sectors and 14 regions. The results in Tol are correctly
reported. The sources of the impacts by sectors are not clearly described.

Roson and van der Mensbrugghe, 2012 (E09)
Tol’s estimates are (i) for 2050 and (ii) 2100. Both are wrong. The damage estimate is
from the following: “According to our preliminary estimates, at the global level, the most
serious consequence from climate change will be changes to labor productivity that
would induce 84% of the global damage in 2050 (-1.8% of global GDP) and 76% in 2100
(-4.6% of global GDP).” This implies a total impact of -2.14% and -6.05% for the two
years. The temperature increase according to Figure 4 and correspondence with the
authors are 2.3 and 4.8 °C increase over 2000. We translate these into 3.0 and 5.5 °C
relative to 1920-40 find a - 1.8% and -4.6% impact on global output due to temperature
increases of 3.0 and 5.5 degrees C, respectively. According to Tol, Robert Kopp
subsequently acquired the original data from Roson, and found that the original version
was correct after all.

Nordhaus, 2013 (E09)
This study relies on the DICE-2013R model for its estimates. The cited number in Tol
(2014) is incorrect. A calculation from the model finds that the damage/net output ratio
at 2.9 °C is -2.3% of global output, instead of -2.0% as reported in Tol (2014). Tol reports
that he read the results for this and other studies from the graphs.

Studies added for from systematic research synthesis

See Table 2.

Studies added for statistical analysis

We have added three studies for our statistical analysis. The estimates for the FUND and
WITCH model are from the MUP study (Gillingham 2015). They take the estimated
damage/output ratio for 2080 – 2100 that most closely approximates the temperature
increase.

The estimates for PAGE09 were made in the same way as for PAGE2002 above, except
that we have taken three temperature increases. Each set of estimates is taken to be
reliable and the three are given a total weight of 1.

This table shows the weight for each estimate included in the statistical analysis. Note
that the sum of the weights for data points of a study is that study’s weight. For example,
at the bottom of the table, FUND 2015 has three data points whose weights sum to 1. The
weights were determined by the authors.xi

Table A-7A. Results of all regressions
Table shows complete results for each specification. “Weights” refers to whether the
regression is weighted or unweighted. “Method” refers to whether ordinary least squares
or median. “Specif” is “Quad” for only a quadratic term, “LinQuad” for quadratic with
linear and quadratic terms, “Expon” for non-linear with estimated exponent. The next six
columns are coefficients, standard errors of coefficients, and t-statistics of coefficients, N
is number of observations, “Pred at x °C” is the prediction of each equation at the given
temperature increase.

Appendix B. Source of additional damages

       The following is drawn from Nordhaus and Sztorc (2013).

         “The 2013 model instead uses a highly simplified damage function that relies on
current estimates of the damage function. More precisely, DICE-2013R uses estimates of
monetized damages from the Tol (2009) survey as the starting point. However, current
studies generally omit several important factors (the economic value of losses from
biodiversity, ocean acidification, and political reactions), extreme events (sea-level rise,
changes in ocean circulation, and accelerated climate change), impacts that are inherently
difficult to model (catastrophic events and very long term warming), and uncertainty (of
virtually all components from economic growth to damages). I have added an adjustment
of 25 percent of the monetized damages to reflect these non-monetized impacts. While
this is consistent with the estimates from other studies (see Hope 2011, Anthoff and Tol
2010, and FUND 2013), it is recognized that this is largely a judgmental adjustment. The
current version assumes that damages are a quadratic function of temperature change
and does not include sharp thresholds or tipping points, but this is consistent with the
survey by Lenton et al. (2008).” (p.11)
