We perform a field experiment to measure racial discrimination in the labor market. We respond

with fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate

perception of race, each resume is assigned either a very African American sounding name or a very

White sounding name. The results show significant discrimination against African-American

names: White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects

the benefits of a better resume. For White names, a higher quality resume elicits 30 percent more

callbacks whereas for African Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase. Applicants living in better

neighborhoods receive more callbacks but, interestingly, this effect does not differ by race. The

amount of discrimination is uniform across occupations and industries. Federal contractors and

employers who list “Equal Opportunity Employer” in their ad discriminate as much as other

employers. We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something

other than race, such as social class, from the names. These results suggest that racial discrimination

is still a prominent feature of the labor market.

1     Introduction
Every measure of economic success reveals significant racial inequality in the US labor market. Compared
to Whites, African Americans are twice as likely to be unemployed and earn nearly 25 percent less when
they are employed (Council of Economic Advisers, 1998). This inequality has sparked a debate on whether
employers discriminate by race. When faced with observably similar African American and White applicants,
do they favor the White one? Some argue yes, citing either employer prejudice or employer perception that
race signals lower productivity. Others argue that discrimination is a relic of the past, eliminated by some
combination of employer enlightenment, affirmative action programs and the profit-maximization motive.
In fact, many in this later camp even feel that stringent enforcement of affirmative action programs has
produced an environment of reverse discrimination. They would argue that faced with identical candidates,
employers might favor the African American one.1 Data limitations make it difficult to empirically test these
views. Since researchers possess far less data on workers than employers do, White and African American
workers that appear similar to researchers may look very different to employers. So any racial difference in
labor market outcomes could just as easily be attributed to these differences unobserved by researchers as
to discrimination.
    We conduct a field experiment to circumvent this difficulty. We send resumes in response to help-
wanted ads in Chicago and Boston newspapers and measure the number of callbacks each resume receives
for interviews. We experimentally manipulate perception of race via the name on the resume. We randomly
assign very White sounding names (such as Emily Walsh or Greg Baker) to half the resumes and very
African American sounding names (such as Lakisha Washington or Jamal Jones) to the other half. Because
we are also interested in how credentials affect discrimination, we experimentally vary the quality of the
resumes used in response to a given ad. Higher quality applicants have on average a little more labor market
experience and fewer holes in their employment history; they are also more likely to have an email address,
have completed some certification degree, possess foreign language skills or have been awarded some honors.2
In practice, we typically send four resumes in response to each ad: two higher quality and two lower quality
ones. We randomly assign to one of the higher and one of the lower quality resumes an African American
sounding name. In total, we respond to over 1300 employment ads in the sales, administrative support,
clerical and customer services job categories and send nearly 5000 resumes. The ads we respond to cover a
large spectrum of job quality, from cashier work at retail establishments and clerical work in a mailroom to
office and sales management positions.
    We find large racial differences in callback rates.3 Applicants with White names need to send about
   1 This camp often explains the poor performance of African Americans in terms of supply factors. If African Americans lack

many basic skills entering the labor market, then they will perform worse, even with parity or favoritism in hiring.
   2 In creating the higher quality resumes, we deliberately made small changes in credentials so as to minimize the chance of

over-qualification.
   3 For ease of exposition, we refer to the effects uncovered in this experiment as racial differences. Technically, however, these




                                                                 2
10 resumes to get one callback whereas applicants with African American names need to send around 15
resumes to get one callback. This 50 percent gap in callback rates is statistically very significant. Based on
our estimates, a White name yields as many more callbacks as an additional eight years of experience. Since
applicants’ names are randomly assigned, this gap can only be attributed to the name manipulation.
    Race also affects the reward to having a better resume. Whites with higher quality resumes receive 30
percent more callbacks than Whites with lower quality resumes, a statistically significant difference. On the
other hand, having a higher quality resume has a much smaller effect for African Americans. In other words,
the gap between White and African-Americans widens with resume quality. While one may have expected
that improved credentials may alleviate employers’ fear that African American applicants are deficient in
some unobservable skills, this is not the case in our data.4 Discrimination therefore appears to bite twice,
making it harder not only for African Americans to find a job but also to improve their employability.
    The experiment also reveals several other aspects of discrimination. First, since we randomly assign
applicants’ postal addresses to the resumes, we can study the effect of neighborhood of residence on the
probability of callback. We find that living in a wealthier (or more educated or more White) neighborhood
increases callback rates. But, interestingly, African Americans are not helped more than Whites by living
in a “better” neighborhood. Second, the amount of discrimination we measure by industry does not appear
correlated to Census-based measures of the racial gap by industry. The same is true for the amount of
discrimination we measure in different occupations. In fact, we find that discrimination levels are statistically
indistinguishable across all the occupation and industry categories covered in the experiment. We also find
that federal contractors, who are thought to be more severely constrained by affirmative action laws, do
not discriminate less; neither do larger employers or employers who explicitly state that they are an “Equal
Opportunity Employer” in their ads. In Chicago, we find that employers located in more African American
neighborhoods are slightly less likely to discriminate.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 compares this experiment to prior work on
discrimination, and most notably to the labor market audit studies. We describe the experimental design
in Section 3 and present the results in Section 4.1. In Section 5, we discuss possible interpretations of
our results, focusing especially on two issues. First, we examine whether the race-specific names we have
chosen might also proxy for social class above and beyond the race of the applicant. Using birth certificates
data on mother’s education for the different names used in our sample, we find little relationship between
social background and the name specific callback rates.5 Second, we discuss how our results map back
effects are about the racial soundingness of names. We briefly discuss the potential confounds between name and race below
and more extensively in Section 5.1.
    4 These results contrast with the view, mostly based on non-experimental evidence, that African Americans receive higher

returns to skills. For example, estimating earnings regressions on several decades of Census data, Heckman et al. (2001) show
that African Americans experience higher returns to a high school degree than Whites.
    5 We also argue that a social class interpretation would find it hard to explain all of our results, such as why living a better

neighborhood does not increase callback rates more for African American names than for White names.



                                                                 3
to the different models of discrimination proposed in the economics literature. In doing so, we focus on
two important results: the lower returns to credentials for African Americans and the relative homogeneity
of discrimination across occupations and industries. We conclude that existing models do a poor job of
explaining the full set of findings. Section 6 concludes.



2       Prior Research on Discrimination
With conventional labor force and household surveys, it is difficult to measure racial discrimination or analyze
its mechanics.6 With survey data, researchers usually measure discrimination by comparing the labor market
performance of Whites and African Americans who report a similar set of skills. But such comparisons can be
quite misleading. Standard labor force surveys do not contain all the characteristics that employers observe
when hiring, promoting or setting wages. So one can never be sure that the African American and White
workers being compared are truly similar from the employer’s perspective. As a consequence, any measured
differences in outcomes could be attributed to these unobserved (to the econometrician) factors and not to
discrimination.
     This difficulty with conventional data has led some authors to use pseudo-experiments.7 Goldin and
Rouse (2000), for example, examine the effect of blind auditioning on the hiring process of orchestras. By
looking at the treatment of female candidates before and after the introduction of blind auditions, they try
to measure the amount of sex discrimination. When such pseudo-experiments can be found, the resulting
study can be very informative, but finding such experiments has been extremely difficult.
     A different set of studies, known as audit studies, attempt to place comparable minority and White
subjects into actual social and economic settings and measure how each group fares in these settings.8
Labor market audit studies send comparable minority (African American or Hispanic) and White auditors
in for interviews and measure whether one is more likely to get the job than the other.9 While the results
vary somewhat across studies, minority auditors tend to perform worse on average: they are less likely to
get called back for a second interview and, conditional on getting called back, less likely to get hired.
     These audit studies provide some of the cleanest non-laboratory evidence of labor market discrimination.
But they also have weaknesses, most of which have been highlighted in Heckman and Siegelman (1992)
and Heckman (1998). First, these studies require that both members of the auditor pair are identical in all
dimensions that might affect productivity in employers’ eyes, except for race. To accomplish this, researchers
    6 SeeAltonji and Blank 1999) for a detailed review of the existing literature on racial discrimination in the labor market.
    7 Darityand Mason (1998) describe an interesting non-experimental study. Prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employment
ads would explicitly state racial biases, providing a direct measure of discrimination. Of course, as Arrow (1998) mentions,
discrimination was at that time “a fact too evident for detection.”
   8 Fix and Turner (1998) provide a survey of many such audit studies.
   9 Earlier hiring audit studies include Newman (1978) and McIntyre et al (1980). Three more recent studies are Cross et

al (1990), Turner et al (1991), James and DelCastillo (1991). Altonji and Blank (1999), Heckman and Siegelman (1992) and
Heckman (1998) summarize these studies. See also Neumark (1996) for a labor market audit study on sex discrimination.


                                                              4
typically match auditors on several characteristics (height, weight, age, dialect, dressing style, hairdo) and
train them for several days to coordinate interviewing styles. Yet, critics note that this is unlikely to erase
the numerous differences that exist between the auditors in a pair.
   Another weakness of the audit studies is that they are not double-blind. Auditors know the purpose of the
study. As Turner et al (1990) note: “The first day of training also included an introduction to employment
discrimination, equal employment opportunity, and a review of project design and methodology.” This may
generate conscious or subconscious motives among auditors to generate data consistent or inconsistent with
racial discrimination. As psychologists know very well, these demand effects can be strong. It is very difficult
to insure that auditors will not want to do “a good job.” Since they know the goal of the experiment, they
can alter their behavior in front of employers to express (indirectly) their own views. Even a small belief
by auditors that employers treat minorities differently can result in apparent discrimination. This effect is
further magnified by the fact that auditors are not in fact seeking jobs and are therefore more free to let
their beliefs affect the interview process.
   Finally, audit studies are extremely expensive, making it difficult to generate large enough samples to
understand the nuances and possible mitigating factors of discrimination. Also, these budgetary constraints
worsen the problem of mismatched auditor pairs. Cost considerations force the use of a few pairs of auditors,
meaning that any one mismatched pair can easily drive the results. In fact, these studies generally tend to
find significant differences in outcomes across pairs.
   Our study circumvents these problems. First, because we only rely on resumes and not people, we can be
sure to generate comparability across race. In fact, since race is randomly assigned to each resume, the same
resume will sometimes be associated with an African American name and sometimes with a White name.
This guarantees that any differences we find are due solely to the race manipulation. Second, the use of paper
resumes insulates us from demand effects. While the research assistants know the purpose of the study, our
protocol allows little room for conscious or subconscious deviations from the set procedures. Moreover, we can
objectively measure whether the randomization occurred as expected. This kind of objective measurement
is impossible in the case of the previous audit studies. Finally, because of relatively low marginal cost, we
can send out a large number of resumes. Besides giving us more precise estimates, this larger sample size
also allows us to examine the mechanics of discrimination from many more angles.10
  10 A similar “correspondence” technique has been used in a few U.K. studies. See Jowell and Precott-Clarke (1970), Brown

and Gay (1985) and Hubbock and Carter (1980). These earlier studies have very limited sample size and focus exclusively on
documenting gap in callbacks between the minority and non-minority groups. Some of these studies fail to fully match skills
between minority and non-minority resumes, for example by imposing differential education background by racial origin.

3        Experimental Design

3.1       Creating a Bank of Resumes

The first step of the experimental design is to generate templates for the resumes to be sent. The challenge
is to produce a set of realistic and representative resumes without using resumes that belong to actual job
seekers. To achieve this goal, we start with resumes of actual job searchers but alter them sufficiently to
create distinct resumes. The alterations maintain the structure and realism of the initial resumes without
compromising their owners.
    We begin with resumes posted on two job search websites as the basis for our artificial resumes.11 While
the resumes posted on these websites may not be completely representative of the average job seeker, they
provide a practical approximation.12 We restrict ourselves to people seeking employment in our experimental
cities (Boston and Chicago). We also restrict ourselves to four occupational categories: sales, administrative
support, clerical services and customer services. Finally, we further restrict ourselves to resumes posted more
than six months prior to the start of the experiment. We purge the selected resumes of the person’s name
and contact information.
    During this process, we classify the resumes within each occupational category into two groups: high
and low quality. In judging resume quality, we use criteria such as labor market experience, career profile,
existence of gaps in employment and skills listed. Such a classification is admittedly subjective but it is
made independently of any race assignment on the resumes (which occurs later in the experimental design).
To further reinforce the quality gap between the two sets of resumes, we add to each high quality resume a
subset of the following features: summer or while-at-school employment experience, volunteering experience,
extra computer skills, certification degrees, foreign language skills, honors or some military experience. This
resume quality manipulation needs to be somewhat subtle to avoid making a higher quality job applicant
over-qualified for a given job. We try to avoid this problem by making sure that the features listed above
are not all added at once to a given resume. This leaves us with a high quality and a low quality pool of
resumes.13 .
    To minimize similarity to actual job seekers, we use resumes from Boston job seekers to form templates
for the resumes to be sent out in Chicago and used the Chicago resumes to form templates for the resumes
to be sent out in Boston. To implement this migration, we alter the names of the schools and previous
employers on the resumes. More specifically, for each Boston resume, we use the Chicago resumes to replace
a Boston school by a Chicago school.14 We also use the Chicago resumes to replace a Boston employer by a
 11 The  sites are www.careerbuilder.com and www.americasjobbank.com.
 12 In practice, we found large variation in skill levels among people posting their resumes on these sites.
 13 In Section 4.2 and Table 3, we provide a detailed summary of resume characteristics by quality type.
 14 We try as much as possible to match high schools and colleges on quality and demographic characteristics.

Chicago employer in the same industry. We use a similar procedure to migrate Chicago resumes to Boston.15
This produces distinct but realistic looking resumes, similar in their education and career profiles to this
sub-population of job searchers.16


3.2     Identities of Fictitious Applicants

The next step is to generate identities for the fictitious job applicants: names, telephone numbers, postal
addresses and (possibly) e-mail addresses. The choice of names is crucial to our experiment.17 To decide
on which names are uniquely African American and which are uniquely White, we use name frequency data
calculated from birth certificates of all babies born in Massachusetts between 1974 and 1979. We tabulate
these data by race to determine which names are distinctively White and which are distinctively African
American. Distinctive names are those that have the highest ratio of frequency in one racial group to
frequency in the other racial group.
    As a check of distinctiveness, we conducted a survey in various public areas in Chicago. Each respondent
was given a resume with a name and asked to assess features of the person, one of which being race. In
general, the names led respondents to readily attribute the expected race for the person but there were a
few exceptions and these names were disregarded.18
    The final list of first names used for this study are reported in Appendix Table 1. The table also reports
the frequency of these names in the Massachusetts birth certificates data.19 The African American first
names used in the experiment are remarkably common in the population. This suggests that by using these
names as an indicator of race, we are actually covering a large segment of the African American population.20
    Applicants in each race/sex/city/resume quality cell are allocated the same phone number. This guaran-
tees that we can precisely track employer callbacks in each of these cells. The phone lines we use are virtual
ones with only a voice mail box attached to it. A similar outgoing message is recorded on each of the voice
mail boxes but each message is recorded by someone of the appropriate race and gender. Since we allocate
the same phone number for applicants with different names, we cannot use a person name in the outgoing
message.
  15 Note that for applicants with schooling or work experience outside of the Boston or Chicago areas, we leave the school or

employer name unchanged.
  16 We also generate a set of different fonts, layouts and cover letters to further differentiate the resumes. These are applied at

the time the resumes are sent out.
  17 We chose name over other potential manipulations of race, such as affiliation with a minority group, because we felt such

affiliations may especially convey more than race.
  18 For example, Maurice and Jerome are distinctively African American names in a frequency sense yet are not perceived as

such by many people.
  19 We also tried to use more White sounding last names for White applicants and more African American sounding last names

for African American applicants. The last names used for White applicants are: Baker, Kelly, McCarthy, Murphy, Murray,
O’Brien, Ryan, Sullivan and Walsh. The last names used for African American applicants are: Jackson, Jones, Robinson,
Washington and Williams.
  20 One might however wonder whether this is an atypical segment of the African American population. In Section 5.1, we

discuss whether the race effect could be interpreted as a social class effect.



                                                                 7
    While we do not expect positive feedback from an employer to take place via postal mail, resumes still
need postal addresses. We therefore construct fictitious addresses based on real streets in Boston and Chicago
using the White Pages. We select up to 3 addresses in each 5-digit zip code in Boston and Chicago. Within
cities, we randomly assign addresses across all resumes. We also create 8 email addresses, 4 for Chicago and
4 for Boston.21 These email addresses are neutral with respect to both race and sex. Not all applicants
are given an email address. As we explained above, the email addresses are used almost exclusively for the
higher quality resumes. This procedure leaves us with a bank of names, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail
addresses which we can assign to the template resumes when responding to the employment ads.


3.3        Responding to Ads

The experiment was carried on between July 2001 and January 2002 in Boston and between July 2001
and May 2002 in Chicago.22 Over that period, we collected all employment ads in the Sunday editions of
The Boston Globe and The Chicago Tribune in the sales, administrative support, and clerical and customer
services sections. We eliminate any ad where applicants are asked to call or appear in person. In fact, most
ads we surveyed in these job categories asked for applicants to fax in or (more rarely) mail in their resume.
We log the name (when available) and contact information for each employer, along with any information
on the position advertised and specific requirements (such as education, experience, or computer skills). We
also record whether or not the ad explicitly states that the employer is an equal opportunity employer.
    For each ad, we use the bank of resumes to sample four resumes (two high-quality and two low-quality)
that fit the job description and requirements as closely as possible.23 In some cases, we slightly alter the
resumes to improve the quality of the match, such as by adding the knowledge of a specific software program.
    One of the high and one of the low quality resumes selected are then drawn at random to receive African
American names, the other high and low resumes receive White names.24 We use male and female names
for sales jobs, whereas we use nearly exclusively female names for administrative and clerical jobs to increase
callback rates.25 Based on sex, race, city and resume quality, we assign a resume the appropriate phone
number. We also select at random a postal address. Finally, e-mail addresses are added to most of the
high quality resumes.26 The final resumes are formatted, with fonts, layout and cover letter style chosen at
  21 The  e-mail addresses are registered on Yahoo.com, Angelfire.com or Hotmail.com.
  22 This  period spans both tight and slack labor markets. In our data, this is apparent as call-back rates (and number of new
ads) dropped precipitously after September 11th, 2001. Interestingly, however, the amount of discrimination we measure in
these two periods is the same.
  23 In some instances, our resume bank does not have four resumes that are appropriate for a given ad. In such instances, we

send only two resumes.
  24 Though the same names are repeatedly used in our experiment, we guarantee that no given ad receives multiple resumes

with the same name.
  25 Male names were used for a few administrative jobs in the first month of the experiment.
  26 In the first month of the experiment, a few high quality resumes were sent without email address and a few low quality

resumes were given email addresses. See Table 3 for details.




                                                              8
random. The resumes are then faxed (or in a few cases mailed) to the employer.27 All in all, we respond to
more than 1300 employment ads over the entire sample period and send close to 5000 resumes.


3.4     Measuring Responses

We measure whether a given resume elicits a callback or e-mail back for an interview. For each phone or
email response, we use the content of the message left by the employer (name of the applicant, company
name, telephone number for contact) to match the response to the corresponding resume-ad pair.28 Any
attempt by employers to contact applicants via postal mail cannot be measured in our experiment since the
addresses are fictitious. Several human resource managers confirmed to us that employers rarely, if ever,
contact applicants via postal mail to set up interviews.


3.5     Weaknesses of the Experiment

We have already highlighted the strengths of this experiment relative to previous audit studies. We now
discuss its weaknesses. First, our outcome measure is crude, even relative to the previous audit studies.
Ultimately, one cares about whether an applicants gets the job and about the wage offered conditional on
getting the job. Our procedure, however, simply measures callbacks for interviews. To the extent that the
search process has even moderate frictions, one would expect that reduced interview rates would translate
into reduced job offers. However, we are not able to translate our results into gaps in hiring rates or earnings.
    Another weakness is that the resumes do not directly report race but instead suggest race through
personal names. This leads to various sources of concern. First, while the names are chosen to make race
salient, some employers may simply not notice the names or not recognize their racial content. As a result,
our findings may under-estimate the extent of discrimination. Relatedly, because we are not assigning race
but only race-specific name, our results are not representative of the average African American (who may
not have such a racially distinct name).29
    Finally, and this is an issue pervasive in both our study and the pair-matching audit studies, newspaper
ads represent only one channel for job search. As is well known from the existing literature, social networks
are a common means through which people find jobs and one that clearly cannot be studied here. This
omission would affect our results if African Americans use social networks more or if less discriminating
employers rely more on networks.30
  27 As part of the faxing process, we strip all identifiers from the outgoing fax to guarantee that employers could not see that

all four faxes originate from the same locale.
  28 Very few employers used email to contact an applicant back.
  29 As Appendix Table 1 indicates, the African American names we use are however quite common among African Americans,

making this less of a concern. We return to this issue in Section 5.1.
  30 In fact, there is some evidence that African Americans may rely less on social networks for their job search (Holzer, 1987).




                                                               9
4     Results

4.1     Is There Discrimination?

Table 1 tabulates average callback rates by racial soundingness of names. Included in brackets under each
rate is the number of resumes sent in that cell. Row 1 presents our results for the full data set. Resumes
with White names have a 10.08 percent chance of receiving a callback. Equivalent resumes with African
American names have a 6.70 percent chance of being called back. This represents a difference in callback
rates of 3.35 percentage points, or 50 percent, that can solely be attributed to the name manipulation.
Column 4 shows that this difference is statistically significant.31 Put in other words, these results imply that
a White applicant should expect on average one callback for every 10 ads she or he applies to; on the other
hand, an African American applicant would need to apply to 15 different ads to achieve the same result.32
    How large are these effects? While the cost of sending additional resumes might not be large per se, this
50 percent gap could be quite substantial when compared to the rate of arrival of new job openings. In our
own study, the biggest constraining factor was the limited number of new job openings each week. Another
way to benchmark the measured return to a White name is to compare it to the returns to other resume
characteristics. For example, in Table 5, we will show that, at the average number of years of experience in
our sample, an extra year of experience increases the likelihood of a callback by .4 percentage point. Based
on this point estimate, the return to a White name is equivalent to about 8 additional years of experience.
    Rows 2 and 3 break down the full sample of sent resumes into the Boston and Chicago markets. About
20 percent more resumes were sent in Chicago than in Boston. The average callback rate (across races)
is lower in Chicago than in Boston. This might reflect differences in labor market conditions across cities
over the experimental period or maybe differences in the ability of the MIT and Chicago teams of research
assistants in selecting resumes that were good matches for a given help wanted ad. The percentage difference
in callback rates is however strikingly similar across both cities. White applicants are 48 percent more likely
than African American applicants to receive a callback in Chicago and 52 percent more likely in Boston.
These racial differences are statistically significant in both cities.
    Finally, rows 4 to 7 break down the full sample into female and male applicants. Row 4 displays the
average results for all female names while rows 5 and 6 break the female sample into administrative (row 5)
and sales jobs (row 6); row 7 displays the average results for all male names. As noted earlier, female names
were used in both sales and administrative job openings whereas male names were used close to exclusively
for sales openings.33 Looking across occupations, we find a significant racial gap in callbacks for both males
  31 These statistical tests assume independence of callbacks. We have however verified that the results stay significant when

we assume that the callbacks are correlated either at the employer or first name level.
  32 This obviously assumes that African American applicants cannot assess a priori which firms are more likely to discriminate

against them.
  33 Only about 6 percent of all male resumes were sent in response to an administrative job opening.




                                                              10
(49 percent) and females (50 percent). Comparing males to females in sales occupations, we find a larger
racial gap among males (49 percent versus 25 percent). Interestingly, females in sales jobs appear to receive
more callbacks than males; however, this (reverse) gender gap is statistically insignificant and economically
smaller than any of the racial gaps discussed above.
   Rather than studying the distribution of callbacks at the applicant level, one can also tabulate the
distribution of callbacks at the employment ad level. In Table 2, we compute the fraction of employers that
treat White and African American applicants equally, the fraction of employers that favor White applicants
and the fraction of employers that favor African American applicants. Because we send up to four resumes
in response to each sampled ad, the 3 categories above can each take 3 different forms. Equal treatment
occurs when either no applicant gets called back, one White and one African American get called back or
two Whites and two African Americans get called back. Whites are favored when either only one White gets
called back, two Whites and no African American get called back or two Whites and one African American
get called back. African Americans are favored in the other cases.
   As Table 2 indicates, equal treatment occurs for about 87.5 percent of the help-wanted ads. As expected,
the major source of equal treatment comes from the high fraction of ads for which no callbacks are recorded
(82.5 percent of the ads). Whites are favored by nearly 9 percent of the employers, with a majority of these
employers contacting exactly one White applicant. African Americans, on the other hand, are favored by
only about 3.7 percent of employers. We formally test whether there is symmetry in the favoring of Whites
over African Americans and African Americans over Whites by employers. We find that the difference
between the fraction of employers favoring Whites and the fraction of employers favoring African Americans
(5.11 percent) is statistically very significant (p = .0000).


4.2    Do African Americans Receive Different Returns to Resume Quality?

Our results so far suggest a substantial amount of discrimination in job recruitment. Next, we would
like to learn more about how employers discriminate. More specifically, we ask how employers respond to
improvements in African American applicants’ credentials. To answer this question, we examine how the
racial gap in callback rates varies by resume quality.
   As we mentioned in section 3, for most of the employment ads we respond to, we send four different
resumes: two higher quality and two lower quality ones. Table 3 gives a better sense of which factors
enter into this subjective classification. It displays means and standard deviations of the most relevant
resume characteristics for the full sample (column 1) as well as broken down by race (columns 2 and 3) and
resume quality (columns 4 and 5). Since applicants’ names are randomized, there is no difference in resume
characteristics by race. Columns 4 and 5 document the objective differences between resumes subjectively
classified as high and low. Higher quality applicants have on average an extra year of labor market experience,


                                                         11
fewer employment holes (where an employment hole is defined as a period of at least 6 months without a
reported job), are more likely to have worked while at school and to report some military experience. Also,
higher quality applicants are more likely to have an email address, to have received some honors and to list
some computer skills and other special skills (such as a certification degree or foreign language skills) on their
resume. Note that the higher and lower quality resumes do not differ on average with regard to applicants’
education level.34 About 70 percent of the sent resumes report a college degree.35
   The last 5 rows of Table 3 show summary characteristics of the applicants’ zip code address. Using
1990 Census data, we compute the fraction high-school dropouts, fraction college educated or more, fraction
Whites, fraction African Americans and log(median per capita income) for each zip code used in the exper-
iment. Since addresses are randomized within cities, these neighborhood quality measures are uncorrelated
with race or resume quality.
   The differences in callback rates between high and low resumes are presented in Table 4. The first thing to
note is that the resume quality manipulation works: higher quality resumes receive higher callback rates. As
row 1 indicates, we record a callback rate of more than 11 percent for White applicants with a higher quality
resume, compared to 8.8 percent for White applicants with lower quality resumes. This is a statistically
significant difference of 2.51 percentage points, or 30 percent. Most strikingly, African Americans experience
much less of an increase in callback rate for similar improvements in their credentials. African Americans
with higher quality resumes receive a callback 6.99 percent of the time, compared to 6.41 percent for African
Americans with lower quality resumes. This is only a .58 percentage point, or 9 percent, increase and this
increase is not statistically significant.
   Instead of relying on the subjective quality classification, Panel B directly uses resume characteristics
to classify the resumes. More specifically, we use a random subsample of one-third of the resumes to
estimate a probit regression of the callback dummy on the resume characteristics listed in Table 3. We
further control for a sex dummy, a city dummy, 6 occupation dummies and a vector of job requirements
as listed in the employment ads.36 We then use the estimated coefficients on the resume characteristics to
rank the remaining two-thirds of the resumes by predicted callback. We classify as “high” resumes those
that have above median predicted callback; similarly, we classify as “low” resumes those that have below
median predicted callback. As one can see from Panel B, qualitatively similar results emerge from this
analysis. While African Americans do appear to significantly benefit from higher quality resumes under this
alternative classification, they benefit much less than Whites. The ratio of callback rates for high versus low
quality resumes is 1.66 for African Americans, compared to 2.81 for Whites.
  34 This reflects the fact that all sent resumes, whether high or low quality, are chosen to be good matches for a given job

opening.
  35 This varies from about 50 percent for the clerical and administrative support positions to more than 80 percent for the

executive, managerial and sales representatives positions.
  36 See section 4.4 for more details on these occupation categories and job requirements.




                                                             12
    In Table 5, we directly report the results of race-specific probit regressions of the callback dummy on
resume characteristics. We however start in column 1 with results for the full sample of sent resumes. As
one can see, many of the resume characteristics have the expected effect on the likelihood of a callback.
The addition of an email address, honors and special skills all have a positive and significant effect on the
likelihood of a callback.37 Also, more experienced applicants are more likely to get called back: at the
average number of years of experience in our sample (8 years), each extra year of experience increases the
likelihood of a callback by about .4 percentage point. The most counterintuitive effects come from computer
skills, which appear to negatively predict callback, and employment holes, which appear to positively predict
callback.
    The same qualitative patterns hold in column 2 where we focus on White applicants. More importantly,
the estimated returns to an email address, additional work experience, honors and special skills appear
economically stronger for that racial group. For example, at the average number of years of experience in
our sample, each extra year of experience increases the likelihood of a call back by about .7 percentage point.
Also, working while at school, while not a statistically significant determinant of callback in the full sample,
yields positive returns for White applicants.
    As might have been expected from the two previous columns, we find that the estimated returns on these
resume characteristics are all economically and statistically weaker for African American applicants (column
3). In fact, all the estimated effects for African Americans are statistically insignificant, except for the return
to special skills. Resume characteristics thus appear less predictive of callback rates for African Americans
than they are for Whites. To see this more clearly, we predict callback rates using either the regression in
column 2 or the regression in column 3. The standard deviation of the predicted callback from column 2 is
.064, whereas it is only 0.034 from column 3. In summary, employers simply seem to pay less attention or
discount more the characteristics listed on the resumes with African American sounding names. Taken at
face value, these results suggest that African Americans may face relatively lower individual incentives to
invest in higher skills.38


4.3     Applicants’ Address

An incidental feature of our experimental design is the random assignment of address to the resumes. This
allows us to examine whether and how an applicant’s residential address, all else equal, affects the likelihood
of a callback. In addition, and most importantly for our purpose, we can also ask whether African American
applicants are helped more by residing in more affluent neighborhoods.
  37 Note that the e-mail address dummy, because it is close to perfectly correlated with the subjective resume quality variable,

may in part capture some other unmeasured resume characteristics that may have led us to categorize a given resume as higher
quality.
  38 This of course assumes that the changes in wage offers associated with higher skills are the same across races, or at least

not systematically larger for African Americans.



                                                               13
   We perform this analysis in Table 6. We start (columns 1, 3 and 5) by discussing the effect of neighborhood
of residence across all applicants. Each of these columns reports the results of a probit regression of the
callback dummy on a specific zip code characteristic and a city dummy. Standard errors are corrected
for clustering of the observations at the employment ad level. We find a positive and significant effect of
neighborhood quality on the likelihood of a callback. Applicants living in Whiter (column 1), more educated
(column 3) or higher income (column 5) neighborhoods have a higher probability of receiving a call back. For
example, a 10 percentage point increase in the fraction of college-educated in zip code of residence increases
the likelihood of a callback by .6 percentage point.
   In columns 2, 4 and 6, we further interact each of the zip code characteristic above with a dummy
variable for whether the applicant is African American or not. Each of the probit regressions in these
columns also includes an African American dummy, a city dummy and an interaction of the city dummy
with the African American dummy. There is no evidence that African Americans benefit any more than
Whites from living in a more White, more educated zip code. The estimated interactions between fraction
White and fraction college educated with the African American dummy are economically very small and
statistically insignificant. We do find an economically more meaningful effect of zip code median income
level on the racial gap in callback; that effect, however, is statistically insignificant.
   In summary, while the quality of the neighborhood of residence is a significant factor in employers’
decision to contact a job applicant, African Americans do not appear to benefit more than Whites from
living in better neighborhoods. These findings are interesting. Indeed, if ghettos and bad neighborhoods are
particularly stigmatizing for African Americans, one might have expected African Americans to be helped
more by having a “good” address. Our results do not lend support to this hypothesis.


4.4    Job Characteristics

In this section, we turn to job characteristics and ask whether discrimination varies based on the specific job
requirements or occupation listed in the employment ads.
   Column 1 of Table 7 gives a description of the specific requirements stated in the sample of ads we respond
to. About 80 percent of the ads state some form of requirement. About 43 percent of the ads require some
minimum experience, of which roughly 50 percent simply ask for “some experience,” 25 percent less than
two years and 25 percent at least 3 years of experience. About 44 percent of ads mention some computer
knowledge requirement, which can range from Excel or Word to more esoteric software programs. Good
communication skills are explicitly required in about 12 percent of the ads. Organization skills are mentioned
7 percent of the time. Finally, only about 11 percent of the ads list an explicit education requirement. Of
these, 8.8 percent require a high school degree, 49 percent some college (such as an associate degree) and




                                                        14
the rest at least a 4-year college degree.39
    How do these different job requirements affect the racial gap in callback? To answer this question, we
show in column 2 the results of various probit regressions. Each entry in this column is the marginal effect
of the requirement on the racial gap in callback. Specifically, each entry comes from a separate probit
regression where we regress a callback dummy on an African American dummy, the requirement dummy and
the interaction of the requirement dummy with the African American dummy. The reported coefficient is that
on the interaction term. The point estimates show no consistent economic pattern and are all statistically
insignificant. Measures of job quality, such as experience, computer skills or education requirements do
not predict the extent of discrimination. Equally surprising, communication or other inter-personal skill
requirements have no effect on the level of discrimination. In short, discrimination appears to vary little by
job requirements.40
    Panel A of Table 8 investigates whether discrimination varies significantly across occupations. As we
mention earlier, the specific subsections of the Sunday newspapers help-wanted sections that we sample for
this study broadly relate to sales and administrative positions. This is reflected in the occupational distri-
bution reported in column 1. To form this classification, we use the job description listed in the employment
ad and map it into one of six following categories: executives and managerial occupations; administrative
supervisors; sales representatives; sales workers; secretaries and legal assistants; clerical occupations.41 In
the 1990 5 percent Census, these occupations account for about 46.5 percent of total salaried private sector
employment in Chicago and Boston. African Americans account for about 4 percent of employment in these
occupations in Boston and 10.5 percent in Chicago. For comparison, African Americans account for about
4.8 percent of total salaried private sector employment in Boston and 11.8 percent in Chicago.
    We report in the second to last column of Table 8 average earnings measures for each of these occupation
categories. These measures are computed from the 1990 5 percent Census for Boston and Chicago. More
specifically, we first estimate a micro wage regression of log(annual earnings) on 8 education dummies, a
quadratic in age, a sex dummy and a city dummy. We then compute the mean residual earnings in each
occupation category. As expected, the sampled occupation categories are very different. The first two (about
22% of the data) correspond to better jobs on average that involve, among other things, the supervision
of other workers; these two categories are associated with the highest earnings. Sales representatives and
secretaries (about 50% of the data) involve less supervision but are still fairly well paying jobs. The last two
occupations (sales workers and clerical workers) correspond to the lowest paying jobs in our sample.
  39 Other requirements sometimes mentioned include typing skills for secretaries (with specific words per minute minimum

thresholds) and, more rarely, foreign language skills.
  40 Other ways of estimating these effects produce a similar non-result. Among other things, we considered including a city

dummy or estimating the effects separately by city; we also estimated one single probit regression including all requirements at
once.
  41 These categories respectively correspond to the following Census 1990 occupation codes: 000-042; 303-307; 253-262; 263-302;

234 and 313; 308-402 (excluding 313).



                                                              15
   The second and third columns of Panel A of Table 8 respectively report the callback rates for White and
African American applicants in each of these occupation categories. Column 4 reports the ratio of callback
rates while column 5 reports the difference. The average callback rate across races seems to decrease with
the level of job quality. Whites receive more callbacks than African Americans in all job categories. While
the racial gap in callback rates varies somewhat across occupations, we cannot reject the null hypothesis
that the gap is the same across all categories.
   We however briefly discuss the point estimates by occupation and how they relate to Census measures
of average earnings. The smallest gap appears to be for executive job positions, where Whites only face
a 33% higher chance than African American of being called back. The second lowest gap is for clerical
jobs, with Whites being called back 38% more often. Interestingly, these two job categories are at opposite
ends of the job quality spectrum, as captured by our earnings measure. This suggests no monotonous
relationship between job quality and the extent of discrimination. The highest discrimination ratio happens
for administrative supervisors, the second highest job quality category in our data. For such jobs, Whites
are 64% more likely to get a callback.
   In the last column of Table 8, we report the race differences in earnings by occupation. These are again
computed from the 1990 5 percent Census for Boston and Chicago. The racial gaps in earning are defined as
the White-African American differences in mean residual log(annual earnings) by occupation, where residual
earnings are estimated as explained above. Interestingly, there does not seem to be a monotonous association
between these estimated racial gaps in earnings and the racial gaps in callbacks. For example, executive and
managerial positions have the lowest racial gap in callbacks but the second highest racial gap in earnings;
similarly, administrative supervisors have the highest racial gap in callbacks but the second lowest racial gap
in earnings. On the other hand, sales representatives are associated with the second-highest racial gap in
callbacks and the highest racial gap in earnings. These results are interesting and potentially suggest that
readily available measures of racial differences, such as the racial gap in earnings used above, may not give a
reliable depiction of discrimination patterns in the economy. However, because the occupational differences
in callback are not significant, these results should not be overstated.
   To summarize, we find that the level of discrimination is remarkably uniform across a variety of occupa-
tions and job requirements. This occurs despite the fact that some of the jobs we study are higher earnings,
such as managerial positions or high end sales jobs.42


4.5    Employer Characteristics

The final set of possible determinants of discrimination we consider are employer characteristics. Collecting
such employer information is not obvious as most of this information is not readily available from the
 42 Obviously,   we cannot rule out that different patterns might exist when one moves even higher in the job quality distribution.



                                                                16
employment ads we respond to. In fact, the only piece of employer information we can directly collect from
the employment ad is whether or not the employer explicitly states being an “Equal Opportunity Employer.”
In several cases, the name of the employer is not even mentioned in the ad and the only piece of information
we can rely on is the fax number which applications must be submitted to.
    We proceeded as follows. For employment ads that do not list a specific employer, we use the fax number
to identify the company name via web reverse-lookup services. Based on the company names, we use three
different data sources (Onesource Business Browser, Thomas Register and Dun and Bradstreet Million Dollar
Directory, 2001) to track company information such as total employment, industry and ownership status.
Using this same set of data sources, we also try to identify the specific zip code of the company (or company
branch) that resumes are to be sent to. Finally, we use the Federal Procurement and Data Center website to
find a list of companies that have federal contracts.43 The racial difference in callback rates for the subsample
where employer characteristics could be determined is very similar in magnitude to that in the full sample.
    Column 1 of Table 9 reports summary employer characteristics for the available data. Sample sizes for
each variable are reported in parentheses. Twenty-nine percent of all employers explicitly state that they are
“Equal Opportunity Employers”. Eleven percent are federal contractors and, therefore, might face greater
scrutiny under affirmative action laws. The average company size is around 2000 employees but there is a lot
of variation across firms. Finally, 73 percent of the firms are privately held, 15 percent are publicly traded
and 12 percent are non-profits.
    The second column of Table 9 presents the marginal effect of each of these characteristics on discrimina-
tion. As before, each entry corresponds to a separate probit regression where we regress a callback dummy
on an African American dummy, the employer characteristic in that row and the interaction of the employer
characteristic with the African American dummy. The reported coefficient is that on the interaction term.
First, neither the “Equal Opportunity Employers” nor the federal contractors appear to discriminate less.
In fact, each of these employer categories is associated with more discrimination, even though these effects
are noisily estimated. Second, we find no effect of employer size on the degree of discrimination.44 Point
estimates indicate that publicly traded firms seem to discriminate more, while not-for-profit organizations
seem to discriminate less; however, these effects are again noisily estimated.45
    Panel B of Table 8 documents how the racial gap in callbacks varies across broad industry categories.
Our experiment covers a variety of industries. Around 8 percent of the jobs are in manufacturing, 3 percent
in transportation and communication, 22 percent are in wholesale and retail trade, 8 percent are in finance
insurance and real estate, 27 percent are in business and personal services and 15 percent are in health,
  43 This website (www.fpdc.gov) is accurate up to and including March 21, 2000.
  44 Similar results hold when we measure employer size using a total sales measure rather than an employment measure.
  45 Of course, our measurement of discrimination by firm type may not be a good indicator of the fraction of African Americans

actually employed in these firms. For example, “Equal Opportunity Employers” may receive a higher fraction of African
American resumes. Their actual hiring may therefore look different from that of non “Equal Opportunity Employers” when
one considers the full set of resumes they receive.


                                                              17
educational and social services. For 16 percent of the ads, we are not able to determine the recruiter’s
industry.
   Columns 2 through 4 show the callback rates for Whites and African Americans, and the differences and
ratios of these two. In every industry except for transportation and communication (which corresponds to
a very small subsample of the jobs in our experiment), African Americans fare worse than Whites. The
biggest gap appears to be in finance, insurance and real estate (where the ratio of callback is 2.44), while
the smallest (outside of transportation) appears to be in health, educational and social services (where the
ratio is 1.35). While the industrial differences in callbacks appear more pronounced than the occupational
differences we discussed above, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that discrimination is the same across
industries.
   We however report how the point estimates by industry relate to Census measures of earnings and
racial gap in earnings by industry. As we did for occupations, we compute such measures using the 1990 5
percent Census for Boston and Chicago. We follow a similar methodology and compute residual log(annual
earnings) and mean residual log(annual earnings) by industry and industry-race cell. These Census measures
are presented in the last two columns of the table.
   Documenting the relationship between inter-industry wage differentials and discrimination is interesting
in light of theories that predict that higher industry rents may allow for more discrimination. If higher rents
translate into higher wages through rent-sharing, these theories predict that high wage industries should
discriminate more (Katz And Summers 1989). Such a prediction could evolve from a straightforward taste-
based model of discrimination where employers are homogeneous in their dislike of minority workers but are
differentially constrained by industry-specific product market pressures in their ability to engage in costly
discrimination (Becker 1961). If one abstracts from the small transportation and communication sector, it
does appear that the two highest wage industries (manufacturing and finance, insurance and real estate)
are also the two highest discrimination industries. However, the relationship is far from monotonous. For
example, health, educational and social services have about average wage levels but also record the lowest
level of discrimination.
   Our final table, Table 10, focuses on the marginal effect of employer location on discrimination.46 As
we mentioned above, we use as a measure of employer location the zip code of the company (or company
branch) resumes were to be sent to. More specifically, we ask whether discrimination varies with the fraction
of African Americans in the employer’s zip code. Each column in Table 10 corresponds to a different probit
regression of a callback dummy on an African American dummy, the fraction African Americans in the zip
code and the interaction of the African American dummy with fraction African Americans in the zip code.
Reported in the last row of this table is the mean fraction African Americans in the relevant sample. In
 46 For previous work on the effect of employer location on labor market discrimination, see for example Raphael, Stoll and

Holzer (2000).


                                                            18
columns 1 and 2, we use the full sample for which data are available. As we can see in column 1, the interaction
term is positive, suggesting that employers located in more African American zip codes are more likely to
call back African American applicants. However, the coefficient on this interaction term is not statistically
significant. Column 2 estimates the same probit regression but allows for the degree of discrimination to vary
by occupation categories, industry categories and city. This increases a bit the magnitude of the coefficient
on the interaction term but that coefficient is still not significant.
    Pooling Chicago and Boston in the regressions in columns 1 and 2 however hides an important difference
across the two cities. The last four columns of Table 10 replicate the exercise above separately for Chicago
(columns 3 and 4) and Boston (columns 5 and 6). In Chicago, there is a larger and statistically signifi-
cant effect of employer location on discrimination. A 10 percentage point increases in the fraction African
Americans in the employer’s zip code reduces the racial gap in callbacks by close to 1 percentage point.
Such a 10 percentage point increases corresponds to a little less than a move from the 25th percentile to
the 75th percentile of the fraction African Americans in the Chicago sample. According to our estimates,
equality of callbacks across races would occur in a zip code that is about 60 percent African Americans. This
corresponds to the 97th percentile in the Chicago sample.
    In contrast, we find no effect in Boston. The estimated coefficient on the interaction term is both
economically and statistically insignificant. One possible reason for this differential effect might be differences
in both the level of and variation in the fraction African Americans across these two cities. The Chicago
sample contains many more employers located in fairly African American neighborhoods. The average
Chicago employer is located in a zip code with 10.5 percent African Americans; the average Boston employer
in a zip code with 4.5 percent African Americans. The 25th and 75th percentiles of fraction African Americans
in Chicago are respectively 1 percent and 12.5 percent; these are 0 percent and 5 percent in Boston.
    Finally, in regressions not reported here, we also investigated whether other employers’ zip code char-
acteristics affect the level of discrimination in Chicago. We found qualitatively similar results to the ones
reported above when we use fraction Whites, fraction college educated, fraction high school dropouts or
median per capita income in the employer’s zip code. These results all suggest that employers located in
less affluent neighborhoods are somewhat more amenable to hiring African American applicants.



5     Interpretation
Two main sets of issues arise when interpreting the results above. First, does our design isolate the effect
of race or is the name manipulation conveying some other factors than race? Second, what do our results
imply for different models of discrimination?




                                                        19
5.1     Potential Confounds

Though we have interpreted our results in terms of racial differences, we actually manipulate only the
name on the resume. While these names clearly signal race, perhaps they also signal some other personal
characteristics. More specifically, one might be concerned that employers are inferring social background
from the personal name. When employers read a name like “Tyrone” or “Latoya,” they may assume that the
person comes from a disadvantaged background. In the extreme form of this social background interpretation,
employers do not care at all about race but are discriminating only against the social background conveyed
by the names we have chosen.47
    While plausible, we feel that some of our earlier results are hard to reconcile with this interpretation.
For example, in Table 6, we found that while employers value “better” addresses, African Americans are
not helped more than Whites by living in Whiter or more educated neighborhoods. If the African American
names mainly signal negative social background, one might have expected the estimated name-gap to be
lower for the better addresses. Also, if the names mainly signal social background, one might have expected
the name gap to be higher for jobs that rely more on soft skills or require more inter-personal interactions.
We found no such evidence in Tables 6 or 7.
    We however directly address this alternative interpretation by examining the average social background
of babies born with the names used in the experiment. We were able to obtain birth certificate data on
mother’s education (less than high school, high school or more) for babies born in Massachusetts between
1970 and 1986.48 For each first name in our experiment, we compute the fraction of babies with that name
and in that gender-race cell whose mothers have at least completed a high-school degree.
    In Table 11, we display the average callback rate for each first name along with this proxy for social
background. Within each race-gender group, the names are ranked by increasing callback rate. Interestingly,
there is significant variation in callback rates by name. Of course, chance alone could produce such variation
because of the rather small number of observations in each cell (about 200 for the female names and 70 for
the male names).49
  47 African Americans as a whole come from more disadvantaged backgrounds than Whites. For this social class effect to be

something of independent interest, one must assert that African Americans with the African American names we have selected
are from a lower social background than the average African American and/or that Whites with the White names we have
selected are from a higher social background than the average White. We come back to this point below.
  48 This longer time span (compared to that used to assess name frequencies) was imposed on us for confidentiality reasons.

When fewer than 10 births with education data available are recorded in a particular education-name cell, the exact number
of births in that cell is not reported and we impute 5 births. Our results are not sensitive to this imputation. One African-
American female name (Latonya) and two male names (Rasheed and Hakim) were imputed in this way. For one African
American male name (Tremayne) we had too few births with education data at all and it is dropped from this analysis. Our
results are qualitatively similar when we use a larger data set of California births for the years 1989 to 2000 (kindly provided
to us by Steven Levitt).
  49 We formally tested whether this variation was significant by estimating a probit regression of the callback dummy on all

the personal first names, allowing for clustering of the observations at the employment ad level. For all but African American
females, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that all the first name effects in the same race-gender group are the same. Of
course, a lack of a rejection does not mean there is no underlying pattern in the between-name variation in callbacks that might
have been detectable with larger sample sizes.



                                                              20
   The row labeled “Average” contains the average fraction of mothers that have at least completed high
school for the set of names listed in that gender-race group. The row labeled “Overall” contains the average
fraction of mothers that have at least completed high school for the full sample of births in that gender-race
group. For example, 83.9 percent of White female babies born between 1970 and 1986 have mothers with
at least a high school degree; 91.7 percent of the White female babies with one of the names used in the
experiment have mothers with at least a high school degree.
   Consistent with a social background interpretation, the African American names we have chosen fall
below the African American average. For African American male names, however, the gap between the
experimental names and the population average is negligible. For White names, both the male and female
names are above the population average.
   But, more interestingly for us, there is substantial between-name heterogeneity in social background.
African American babies named Kenya or Jamal are affiliated with much higher mothers’ education than
African American babies named Latonya or Leroy. Conversely, White babies named Carrie or Neil have lower
social background than those named Emily or Geoffrey. This allows for a direct test of the social background
hypothesis within our sample: are names associated with a worse social background discriminated against
more? In the last row in each gender-race group, we report the rank-order correlation between callback
rates and mother’s education. The social background hypothesis predicts a positive correlation. Yet, for all
four categories, we find the exact opposite. The p-values indicate that we cannot reject independence at
standard significance levels except in the case of African American males where we can almost reject it at
the 10 percent level. In summary, this test suggests little evidence that social background drives the extent
of discrimination.
   Names might also influence our results through familiarity. It might be that these African American
names simply appear odd to human resource managers and that any odd name faces discrimination. But
as noted earlier, the names we have selected are not particularly uncommon among African Americans (see
Appendix Table 1). We have also performed a similar exercise to that of Table 11 and measured the rank-
order correlation between name-specific callback rates and name frequency for each gender-race group. We
found no systematic positive correlation.
   There is one final potential confound to our results. Perhaps what appears as discrimination is actually
the result of reverse discrimination. If qualified African Americans are thought to be in high demand,
then employers with average quality jobs might feel that an equally talented African American would never
accept an offer from them and thereby never call her or him in for an interview. Such an argument might
also explain why African Americans do not receive as strong of a return as Whites to better resumes, since
higher qualification only strengthens this argument. But this interpretation would suggest that among the
better jobs, we ought to see evidence of reverse, or at least less, discrimination. However, as we discussed in



                                                      21
Section 4.4, we do not find any such evidence. Discrimination does not vary across jobs with different skill
requirements, nor does it vary across occupation categories. Even among the better jobs in our sample, we
find quite a bit of discrimination against African American names.50


5.2        Relation to Existing Theories

What do the results in this paper imply for existing models of discrimination? Existing economic theories
can be classified into two main categories: taste-based and statistical discrimination models. Both sets of
models can obviously “explain” our average racial gap in callbacks by virtue of being discrimination models.
But can these models explain our other findings? More specifically, we discuss the relevance of these models
with a focus on two of these findings: (i) the lower returns to credentials for African Americans, and (ii)
the relative uniformity of discrimination across occupations and job requirements and, to a lesser extent,
industries.
    Taste-based models differ in whose prejudiced “tastes” they emphasize: customers, co-workers or em-
ployers. Customer and co-worker discrimination models seem at odds with the lack of significant variation
of the racial gap by occupation and industry categories, as the amount of customer contact and the fraction
of White employees must vary across these categories. More precisely, we do not find more discrimination
among jobs that explicitly require “communication skills” and jobs for which we expect either customer or
co-worker contacts to be higher (see Table 7).
    Because we do not know what drives employer tastes, employer discrimination models could be consistent
with the lack of occupation and industry variation. Employer discrimination also matches the finding that
Chicago employers located in more African American neighborhoods discriminate less. However, employer
discrimination models would struggle to explain why African Americans get relatively lower returns to their
credentials. Indeed, the cost of indulging the discrimination taste should increase as the minority applicants’
credentials increase.51
    Statistical discrimination models are the prominent alternative to the taste-based models in the economics
literature. In one class of statistical discrimination models, employers use the observable race to proxy for
unobservable skills (e.g. Phelps 1972, Arrow 1973). This class of models struggle to explain the credentials
effect. Indeed, the added credentials should lead to a larger update for African Americans and hence greater
returns to skills for that group.
    A second class of statistical discrimination models “emphasize the precision of the information that
  50 One  might argue that employers who reverse discriminate hire through less formal channels than help-wanted ads. But this
would imply that African Americans are less likely to find jobs through formal channels, which does not appear consistent with
the existing evidence (Holzer, 1987).
  51 One could however assume that employer tastes differ not just by race but also by race and skill, so that employers have

greater prejudice against minority workers with better credentials. But the opposite preferences, employers having a particular
distaste for low-skilled African Americans, also seem reasonable.




                                                              22
employers have about individual productivity” (Altonji and Blank, 1999). Specifically, in these models,
employers believe that the same observable signal is more precise for Whites than for African Americans
(Aigner and Cain 1977, Lundberg and Startz 1983, Cornell and Welch 1996). Under these models, African
Americans should receive lower returns to observable skills because employers place less weight on these
skills. However, how reasonable is this interpretation for our experiment? First, it is important to note
that we are using the same set of resume characteristics for both racial groups. So the lower precision of
information for African Americans cannot be that, for example, an employer does not know what a high
school degree from a very African American neighborhood means (as in Aigner and Cain (1977)). Second,
many of the credentials on the resumes are in fact externally and easily verifiable, such as a certification for
a specific software.
    An alternative version of these models would rely on bias in the observable signal rather than differential
variance or noise of these signals by race. Perhaps the skills of African Americans are discounted because
affirmative action makes it easier for African Americans to get these skills. While this is plausible for
credentials such as an employee of the month honor, it is less clear why this would apply to more verifiable
and harder skills. It is equally unclear why work experience would be less rewarded since our study suggests
that getting a job is prone to discrimination rather than reverse discrimination.
    The uniformity of discrimination across occupation is also troubling for a statistical discrimination in-
terpretation. Numerous factors that should affect the importance of statistical discrimination, such as the
importance of unobservable skills, the observability of qualifications, the precision of observable skills and
the ease of performance measurement, may vary quite a lot across occupations.
    These facts suggest that perhaps other models may do a better job at explaining our findings. One simple
alternative model is lexicographic search by employers. Employers receive so many resumes that they may
use quick heuristics in reading these resumes. One such heuristic could be to simply read no further when
they see an African American name. Thus they may never see the skills of African American candidates and
this could explain why these skills are not rewarded. This might also to some extent explain the uniformity of
discrimination since the screening process (i.e. looking through a large set of resumes) may be quite similar
across the variety of jobs we examine.52



6     Conclusion
This paper suggests that discrimination is an important factor in why African Americans do poorly in the
labor market. Job applicants with African American names get far fewer callbacks for each resume they
  52 Another explanation could be based on employer stereotyping or categorizing. If employers have coarser stereotypes for

African Americans, many of our results would follow. See Jones (2002) for the relevant psychology and Mullainathan (2002)
for a formalization of categorization.

send out. Equally importantly, applicants with African American names find it hard to fight discrimination
in callbacks by improving their observable skills or credentials.
   Taken at face value, our results on differential returns to skill have possibly important policy implica-
tions. They suggest that training programs alone may not be enough to alleviate the barriers raised by
discrimination. For training to work, some general equilibrium force outside the context of our experiment
would have to be at play. So, while a massive training program at the national level may change the struc-
ture of discrimination, small training programs may not work. In fact, if African Americans recognize how
employers reward their skills, they may be rationally more reluctant than Whites to even participate in these
programs.

a Notes:

1. Panel A reports the mean call-back rates for applicants with a White sounding name (raw 1) and African American
   sounding name (raw 2) depending on whether the resume was subjectively qualified as a lower quality (column 1) or
   higher quality (column 2). In brackets is the number of resumes sent for each race/quality group. Column 4 reports the
   p-value of a test of proportion testing the null hypothesis that the call-back rates are equal across quality groups within
   each racial group.
2. For Panel B, we use a third of the sample to estimate a probit regression of the call-back dummy on the set of resume
   characteristics as displayed in Table 3. We further control for a sex dummy, a city dummy, 6 occupation dummies and a
   vector of dummy variables for job requirements as listed in the employment ad (see Section 4.4 for details). We then use
   the estimated coefficients on the set of resume characteristics to estimate a predicted call-back for the remaining resumes
   (2/3 of the sample). We call “high quality” resumes the resumes that rank above the median predicted call-back and
   “low quality” resumes the resumes that rank below the median predicted call-back. In brackets is the number of resumes
   sent for each race/quality group. Column 4 reports the p-value of a test of proportion testing the null hypothesis that
   the call-back rates are equal across quality groups within each racial group.

a Notes:

1. Each column gives the results of a probit regression where the dependent variable is the call-back dummy. Reported in
   the table are the estimated marginal change in probability for the continuous variables and the estimated discrete change
   for the dummy variables. Also included in each regression are a city dummy, a sex dummy, 6 occupation dummies and
   a vector of dummy variables for job requirements as listed in the employment ad (see Section 4.4 for details).
2. Sample in column (1) is the entire set of sent resumes; sample in column (2) is the set of resumes with White sounding
   names; sample in column (3) is the set of resumes with African American sounding names.
3. Standard errors are corrected for clustering of the observations at the employment ad level.
4. Reported in the second to last row are the p-value for a χ2 testing that the effects on the resume characteristics are all
   zero.
5. Reported in the last row is the standard deviation of the predicted call-back rate.

   the table are the estimated marginal change in probability. Also included in columns (1), (3) and (5) is a city dummy;
   also included in columns (2), (4) and (6) is a city dummy and a city dummy interacted with a race dummy.
2. Sample in all regressions is the entire set of sent resumes (N = 4890).
3. Standard errors are corrected for clustering of the observations at the employment ad level.

 a Notes:

  1. This table reports call-back rates by race and occupation (Panel A) and by race and industry (Panel B). Sample is all
     sent resumes (N = 4890).
  2. The two tests reported in the table are log-likelihood tests obtained from two separate probit regressions. In Panel A,
     we regress the call-back dummy on 6 occupation dummies, a black dummy and the interaction of the black dummy with
     the six occupation dummies. In Panel B, we regress the call-back dummy on 7 industry dummies, a black dummy and
     the interactions of the black dummy with the 7 industry dummies. In each case, the null hypothesis tested is that the
     interaction term effects are all the same.
  3. The last two columns of the table report earnings statistics from the 1990 5 percent Census for Boston and Chicago.
     The first of these two columns reports mean log(residual annual earnings) in the occupation or industry category. The
     second column reports mean white-black gap in log(residual annual earnings) in the occupation or industry category.
     Log(residual annual earnings) are obtained from a micro wage regression of log(annual earnings) on 8 education dummies,
     a quadratic in age, a sex dummy and a city dummy. See text for details.

a Notes:

1. This table reports, for each first name used in the experiment, call-back rate and average mother education. Average
   mother education for a given first name is defined as the fraction of babies born with name in Massachusetts between
   1970 and 1986 whose mother had at least completed a high school degree (see text for details). Within each sex/race
   group, first names are ranked by increasing call-back rate. In brackets in each cell is the number of resumes sent in that
   cell.
2. “Average” reports, within each race-gender group, the average mother education for all the babies born with one of the
   names used in the experiment. “Overall” reports, within each race-gender group, average mother education for all babies
   born in Massachusetts between 1970 and 1986 in that race-gender group. “Correlation” reports the Spearman rank order
   correlation betwen call-back rates and mother education within each race-gender group as well as the p-value for the test
   of independence.

a Notes:

1. This table tabulates the different first names used in the experiment and the frequencies with which each of these names
   was used. Also reported for each race-sex category is the fraction of all births in that race-sex category with these first
   names (from the Massachusetts birth certificates, 1974 to 1979).
