             Inflation, Resource Utilization, and Debt and Equity Returns


                                        ABSTRACT




        Enormously   diverse real and nominal ex post returns on equity and
short   and long term debt securities have accompanied substantial variations

in inflation and resource utilization during the past half century. This

paper contains an examination of the relationships among these security

returns and an analysis of the effects of inflation and resource

utilization on the relationships.

     The three major results are the following. First, prior to the

Treasury—Federal Reserve Accord in 1951, nominal yields on one—month

Treasury bills were reasonably stable, while real bill rates were incredibly

volatile. Since 1952, the reverse has been true. Nominal bill rates have

cycled around a rising trend, and real bill rates have stayed near zero.

Second, changes in yields on new—issue, long—term bonds have been largely

unanticipated, and these changes have dominated the realized returns on

bonds relative to Treasury bills. Because bond rates have risen with

(unexpected) inflation during the last fifteen years, bonds have earned

negative real returns. Third, the relative returns on equities and bonds

are greatly affected by the business cycle with equities performing very

well around troughs and very poorly around peaks. This has been true

for all ten troughs since 1926 and all six peaks since 1946.

Introduction

        During   the   last half century, the American economy has been subjected

to numerous shocks. The greatest of these were the depression and

World    War II, but there were also other wars, OPEC and Itregulart?
business cycles. As a result, both resource utilization and inflation
have varied widely, and enormously diverse real and nominal ex post
returns    on   equity and short and long-term debt securities have
accompanied these variations.
        This paper contains an examination of the relationships among these
security returns and an analysis of the       effects of inflation and

resource      utilization on the relationships. More specifically, I will
report    on the impact of inflation on: Treasury bill rates, the realized

returns on Treasury bonds versus bills, and realized returns on

equities versus corporate bonds. Further, I will discuss the relationship

between the business cycle and realized returns on equities versus bonds.

Thus,   the   analysis provides a background for the fundamental portfolio

decision regarding the broad division of investable funds into

equities,     long-term debt and short-term debt.
    Before       turning to the analysis, a few words about the data are in

order. First, all of the underlying        yield data. -- equities, corporate

 bonds, Treasury bonds and Treasury bills -- are those ccRrrpiled by Ibbotson
 and Sinquefield (19'7'9, 1980). These are roughly representative of returns on
 economy-wide   "rsarket"   portfolios and   are   available monthly for the

 1926-7'8 period. Second, these yields are realized, rather than expected
 returns, except for those on Treasury bills which are both expected and
 realized because their one-month maturity equals the period over which
 the returns are calculated. Third, the returns -- income plus capital
 gains (except for bills) - are before-tax returns. They are not truly
representative of what either highly-taxed or tax-exempt investors actually
earned after tax (both investor gnoups pràsumably would have opted for
portfolios with different relative income and capital gains          components
than the market average, and the former, of course, paid taxes). Hopefully
differential returns, at least, are roughly representative of those
earned by most investors.


Inflation and Treasury Bill Returns
     During the 1926-80 period there was a single episode of significant
deflation, 1930-32. In those three years the inflation rate ranged
from -6 to -10 percent. Modest deflation also occurred in 1926-27,
1938, and ]99. In contrast, there have been three significant
bursts of inflation -- the beginning of World War II (9 percent in
l941 and 19b2), the postwar surge (18 percent in 19136 and 9 percent

was due to the monetary authorities'          policy     of pegging nominal interest
rates at low levels during a period of significant inflation. The
high real rate in the 1930s is largely attributable to the combination
of the general nonnegativity constraint on the nc*ninal rate and the
existence of significant deflation.           However,     it is noteworthy that
the real bill rate exoeeded 14 percent in al]. years in the 1926-30 period
during which the nonnegativity constraint was not binding (the nom(nil
bill   rate ranged from 2.14 to 14.7 percent).
       Figure 1 illustrates the enormous difference between the 1926-51
and 1952-80 periods in the volatility of both the nom(rinl and real bill
rate.. In the former period the ncminal rate declines      the early in

1930. and ii then flat; in the latter period this rate cycles around
a Eharply rising trend (the 1960 average bill rate of 11 percent disguises
variations in monthly rates between less than 7 percent and over i6
percent). In contrast, the real bill rate varied between a plus               12 percent

in 1931 and 1932 to a minus 15 percent in 19146. Its often cited               stability

clearly refers       to the   post 1951 period   only.
       Even   the   reduced variability of the real bill rate in the 1952-80

period   (plus 2 to minus 14 percent)       is possibly    an   overstatement of   future
variability because the        sharply   negative rates of 1973 and especially 19714
are unlikely to recur. Short-term bill rates became "out of line"
relative to short-term rates on large CDa, comeercial paper, and bankers
acceptances     1973, ani. especially 19714. To illustrate, the spread
                in

between yield.s   6 month CDs end bills increased in 19714 relative to
norl jeers by about 110 basis points and the spread between yields on 3 month

banks and municipalities had nonyield reasons for intaining bill holdings,
bill rates fell relative to other yields. As a result, expected inflat ion
was not fully reflected in bill rates • In fact, the enormous disparity
between private and U.S. short-term yields in 197k was the driving force
behind the creation of the money market fund, en entity that will prevent
such disparities from recurring.


Inflation and. Relative Returns on Equities,, Bonds and Bills
      The first two columns in Table 2 repeat the same columns in Table 1
(except that 1979 and 1980 are excluded). The third and fourth columns
record the mean and standard deviation of the difference between the
annual returns earned on equities and corporate bonds. Equities earned
a7   percentage point premium over both the 1926-51 and 1952-78 eubperiod*.
However, when these periods are further subdivided, the enormous variability
of this premium becomes apparent. The premium was much greater in the
1930s, 1950e and 1960a than in the 1930s and 1970s .   It would appear
from these data that there is no si1e relationship between the premium
and either the mean or standard deviation of the inflation rate.

Nonetheless, two of my co—authors in this volume have argued that the

increased inflation (combined with the excessive taxation of corporate

income -   Feldstein)   and the increased uncertainty regarding inflation

(and the economy generally -    lvlalkiel)   are causes of the relatively poor

performance of equities during    the   past fifteen years. My own view

is that these phenomena explain the relatively modest rise in promised

new-issue debt yields (decline in real after-tax yields), but not the

sharp decline in share values (Hendershott 1981).

 large, 3.8 percent, in the l926-1O period, and it was a negative one
 percent in the 1952-67 and 1968-78 periods. The reason for these
 differences is apparently unanticipated movements in interest rates.
 To illustrate, if yields fall unexpectedly, then prices of long-term
 bonds will rise unexpectedly and the one year return on bonds will be
 large. This was apparently the case in the l930a (the one month bill
 rat. declined from an average of over 3 percent in 1926-30 to less than
   percent in the 1933-hO period). In contrast, if yields rise unexpectedly,
 then prices of long-term bonds will fall unexpectedly and the one year
retn on bonds will he low. This apparently has happened in the post 1952
period (the one-month bill rate rose frcsa l percent in 1952-55 to
  percent in 196hi67 to over 6 percent in 1973-78).
     It is important to note that only unanticipated movements in interest
rates have such impacts on the difference in realized returns on bonds
and bills. Par cample, if long-term bond rates were expected to rise
during the year, then bonds would be priced at the beginning of the
 year such that a. high incone return wou]4 offset the anticipated capital
loss • In this case, the difference in ex post returns on honda and bills
would be independent of observed chAnges in new issue bond yields. To
determine whether changes in bond yields bays been anticipated or unantici-
pated, yield data on new-issue equivalent 20 year U.S. government bonds
were collected! Pigwe 2 contains plots of the difference in ex post
annual yields on bonds and bills (the "turity" premium of Ibbotson
sad Sinquefield) for the 1953-78 period and the change in the new issue
bond yield (scaled by a factor of 1.0) between the beginning and end of
the same year. The striking negative correlation implies that the

 Excluding the 80 and 106 month wartime (World War II and Vietnam)

    Annualized differences in equity and bond returns over different
phases of the cycle have been cCared. For contractions, the first and
last 5 months (which overlap for the two 8 month contractions) were
examined, For expansions, the first, second, third, and last six months
were studied (the last two periods overlap during the 21 month upswing in
the late 1920.). The cycles were divided into the 1926-52 and 1953-78

  7 percent) late in contractions an early in expansions and a relatively
  interior return late in expansions and early in contractions.
       Table 4 has been constructed to highlight this results. The means
  (and standard deviations) over all 10 cycles in the 1926-78 period are
 listed at the bottaa of the table. The mean net return on equities
 is 20 percent in the last five months of contractions (column 1) and
 38 percent in the first six months of expansions (column 2). On the
 other hand, this net return is -20 percent in the first five months of
 contractions (column 3). (The mean net return during the other six
 month phases of the expansions was around the normal 6
                                                          percent.) While
 the mean net equity returns are large (in absolute value) during these
 periods, their variability is also large. Statistically, this is revealed
 by the fact that none of these means is twice the size of its st&ndard
 error. Inspection of the indiyidu cycle datum also indicates numerous
 "Outliers."
      The most pronounced outlier ia the net equity return in the recovery
  of 1933, 125 percent; the other net returns in the first six months  of
upswings in the pre1952 period vary within the narrow 23 to 36
                                                                 percent
band. Interestingly, the second most pronounced outlier appears to be
the return in the imed.iat.].y preceding period, the end of the 1932-33
contraction. Rather than the normally high return, -37 percent was
earned. Thus, the incredibly high return in the middle of 1933 is largely
a catch up for or offset to the low return in late 1932 and early 1933.
The return over the full late contract ion-early expansion period seems
to be roughly in line with those arow'4 other lower turning points,

 Moreover, the •a. pattern occurs in 1957, when the highest postl952
 excess return early in the upswing, 50 percent, is preceded by the only
 negative excess return in the late contraction months•       It would appear
 that the variance in net equity returns over the, tull late contraction-
 eerI.y expe.ns ion period would be con4erabiy lena than the variance in
 returns in either the late contraction or early upswing months. The
 third column in Table Ii ir4icatas that this is indeed the case. The
 aean net return on equities for the last six months of a contraction
 and first six months of the following expansion over all cycles is
 26 percent, and it has a standard deviation of only 7 percent. Moreover,
this is also roughly the case for both the first and last five cycles
Thus, th. net equity returns are significantly positive at the 0.05
level, eM this is even true if the "normal" net return of 6 percent
is taken into account.
     A sossewbat siaflar pattern appears in late expansions and early
contractions during the postl953 period. The two largest negative net
equity returns in early recession months (column 5),   -116   percent in late
1957 and -39 percent in early 1970, were preceded by the only positive
net equity returns in late expansions (column 1), 211 percent and 6 percent,

i
respectively. The lsat column in Table 1 reports the net equity return
     the last six months of an expansion and the first six months of

the following recession; a].]. are negative in the 1953-78 period.
Moreover, the mean net extraordinary return (the .9 percent return less
the normal 6 percent) for these 5 cycles is -15 percent with a. 5 percent
standard deviation. Thus, the net extraordinary returns are significantly
                                                                      .16



negative in the late stages of the expansion and the early stages of the
contraction. (This is not true, however, for cycles prior to 1953).
     A   possible problem with th. above calculations is the oceiparison
of the net returns around turning points with a conata.nt "normal" 6
percent return.    The   mean net annual return on equities was shown in
Table 2 to vary widely between different "eras;" the net return was only
2 percent in the 1926-leO period, about 13 percent in the 191-67 span,
and actually negative in the recent 1968-78 years. This suggests that
net returns around turning points should be conpe.red with the average
net returns in surrounding years, rather than over the entire half
century. To accomplish this, we have first divided the months between
January 1926 and December 1978 into three types of periods: those around
troughs in which equity returns appear to be superior, those around peaks
in which equity returns appear to be relatively inferior, and the remainder.
The inferior periods are defined as the last six months of every expansion
and the tint half (dropping fractions) or first six months, whichever
is less, of every contraction. The superior periods are defined as the
last half (dropping fractions) or last six months, whichever is lees,
of every contraction and the first aix months of every expansion. The
second step in this comparison is to divide the total 1926-78 period
into ten overlapping intervals that contain single adjoin 1ng peaks and
troughs and all the aurrouMing months that do not overlap with adjacent
superior and inferior periods. That is, the intervals extend from
6 months after a trough to 6 months before the second following peak.
These ten overlapping intervals are listed at the left in Table 5.

Summary
       The results of our investigation of the impacts over the past half

century   of inflation and the business cycle on realized yields on equities,

long-term      debt   and short-term   debt can   be   summarized in     terms   of three
relationships.        Each is presented   in turn.
      First,   prior to the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord in 1951,               nominal
yields   on one-month Treasury bills were reasonably stable while real

bill rates were incredibly volatile. This was largely due to the

nonnegativity constraint on nominal bill rates during the rapid deflation
                                                                                  19




 in the early 1930s (and 1938 and 19149, to a lesser extent) and the pegging

 (at   low levels) of nominal interest rates during the rapid inflation

 early in World War II and         in   the Korean Conflict and following the former.

 Since 1952, the reverse has been true.           Nominal bill rate have cycled

 around a rising trend, and real bill rates have stayed near zero. Short

 term bills have been a hedge against inflation
                                                           during the last thirty years.

       Second, changes in long-term new-issue bond yields have been largely

unanticipated, and       these   changes have dominated the realized returns

on bonds relative to Treasury bills. Because bond rates have risen with

(unexpected) inflation during the last fifteen years, bonds have earned

negative real returns.

       Third,   the   relative returns on equities and bonds are greatly affected

by   the business cycle with equities performing very well around troughs
and very poorly around peaks. Extraordinary net (of bond returns) equity
returns have averaged 214. percent per annum in the (roughly) year surrounding
troughs over the ten      cycles   since 1926   and have   never been less than
13 percent. In  contrast, these returns have averaged -214 percent in
the (roughly) year surrounding peaks over the six cycles since 1946 and
have never been higher than -114 percent.

1This paper is based upon a larger ongoing study by Roger D. Huang and

 myself (1982). The underlying study provides econometric support for

 many   of   the propositions advanced in this paper.



2Data for nominal bill rates in 1979 and 1980 have been computed from

 the one-month tax-adjusted bill rates calculated by Huston MeCulloch,

 whom I thank for making       them available to me. To check the comparability
 of these rates with those of Ibbotson and Sinquefield, I computed

 the annual return on one month bills from McCulloch's data, 7.23 percent,

 and found that it differed little from that based on the I-S data,

 7.18 percent. The method for calculating tax-adjusted yields is presented

 in J. Huston McCulloch (1975).



3me premium equities earned over Treasury bills is very similar except

 for the i926_140    interval.   As is indicated in the last column of Table 2,

 government bonds outperformed government bills by nearly 1 percentage

points per annum      in   this period, resulting in the equity premium over

bills   being much larger than that over bonds.
