Policymakers everywhere are working to determine the set of restrictions that will effectively
contain the spread of COVID-19 without excessively stifling economic activity. We show that
publicly available data on human mobility -- collected by Google, Facebook, and other providers
-- can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and forecast the
spread of COVID-19. This approach relies on simple and transparent statistical models, and
involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United
States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world.

1    Summary

2    Background. Policymakers everywhere are working to determine the set of restrictions that will

3    effectively contain the spread of COVID-19 without excessively stifling economic activity. In some

4    contexts, decision-makers have access to sophisticated epidemiological models and detailed case

5    data. However, a large number of decisions, particularly in low-income and vulnerable communities,

6    are being made with limited or no modeling support. We examine how public human mobility

7    data can be combined with simple statistical models to provide near real-time feedback on non-

8    pharmaceutical policy interventions. Our objective is to provide a simple framework that can be

9    easily implemented and adapted by local decision-makers.

10   Methods. We develop simple statistical models to measure the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical

11   interventions (NPIs) and forecast the spread of COVID-19 at local, state, and national levels. The

12   method integrates concepts from econometrics and machine learning, and relies only upon publicly

13   available data on human mobility. The approach does not require explicit epidemiological modeling,

14   and involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics. We evaluate this approach using local

15   and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national

16   data from 80 countries around the world.

17   Findings. We find that NPIs are associated with significant reductions in human mobility, and that

18   changes in mobility can be used to forecast COVID-19 infections. The first set of results show the

19   impact of NPIs on human mobility at all geographic scales. While different policies have different

20   effects on different populations, we observed total reductions in mobility between 40 and 84 percent.

21   The second set of results indicate that -- even in the absence of other epidemiological information

22   -- mobility data substantially improves 10-day case rates forecasts at the county (20.75% error,

23   US), state (21.82 % error, US), and global (15.24% error) level. Finally, for example, country-level

24   results suggest that a shelter-in-place policy targeting a 10% increase in the amount of time spent

25   at home would decrease the propagation of new cases by 32% by the end of a 10 day period.

26   Interpretation. In rapidly evolving disease outbreaks, decision-makers do not always have im-



                                                      2
27   mediate access to sophisticated epidemiological models. In such cases, valuable insight can still be

28   derived from simple statistic models and readily-available public data. These models can be quickly

29   fit with a population's own data and updated over time, thereby capturing social and epidemiolog-

30   ical dynamics that are unique to a specific locality or time period. Our results suggest that this

31   approach can effectively support decision-making from local (e.g., city) to national scales.

32   Introduction

33   Societies and decision-makers around the globe are deploying unprecedented non-pharmaceutical

34   interventions (NPIs) to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. These NPIs have been shown to slow

35   the spread of COVID-19 (Chinazzi et al., 2020; Ferguson et al., 2020; Hsiang et al., 2020; Tian

36   et al., 2020), but they also create enormous economic and social costs (for example, Atkeson, 2020;

37   Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Weber, 2020; G¨
                                              ossling, Scott and Hall, 2020; Rossi et al., 2020; Thun-

38   str¨
        om et al., 2020). Thus, different populations have adopted wildly different containment strategies

39   (Cheng et al., 2020), and local decision-makers face difficult decisions about when to impose or lift

40   specific interventions in their community. In some contexts, these decision-makers have access to

41   state-of-the-art models, which simulate potential scenarios based on detailed epidemiological models

42   and rich sources of data (for example, Friedman et al., 2020; Ray et al., 2020).

43      In contrast, many local and regional decision-makers do not have access to state-of-the-art

44   epidemiological models, but must nonetheless manage the COVID-19 crisis with the resources

45   available to them. With global public health capacity stretched thin by the pandemic, thousands of

46   cities, counties, and provinces -- as well as many countries -- lack the data and expertise required to

47   develop, calibrate, and deploy the sophisticated epidemiological models that have guided decision-

48   making in regions with greater modeling capacity (Gnanvi, Kotanmi et al., 2020; Liverani, Hawkins

49   and Parkhurst, 2013; Loemb´
                               e et al., 2020). In addition, early evidence suggests a need to adapt

50   models to a local context, particularly for developing countries, where disease, population and other

51   characteristics are different from developed countries, where models are primarily being developed

52   (Evans et al., 2020; Mueller et al., 2020; Twahirwa Rwema et al., 2020).

53      Here, we aim to address this "modeling-capacity gap" by developing, demonstrating, and testing

54   a simple approach to forecasting the impact of NPIs on infections. This approach is built on two

55   main insights. First, we show that passively collected data on human mobility, which has previously

56   been used to measure NPI compliance (Engle, Stromme and Zhou, 2020; Klein et al., 2020; Kraemer

57   et al., 2020; Mart´
                       in-Calvo et al., 2020; Morita, Kato and Hayashi, 2020; Pepe et al., 2020; Wellenius

58   et al., 2020), can also effectively forecast the COVID-19 infection response to NPIs up to 10 days



                                                       4
59   in the future. Second, we show that basic concepts from econometrics and machine learning can be

60   used to construct these 10-day forecasts, effectively emulating the behavior of more sophisticated

61   epidemiological models.

62        This approach is not a substitute for more refined epidemiological models. Rather, it represents

63   a practical and low-cost alternative that may be easily adopted in many contexts when the former

64   is unavailable. It is designed to enable any individual with access to standard statistical software

65   to produce forecasts of NPI impacts with a level of fidelity that is practical for decision-making in

66   an ongoing crisis.



67   Data

68   Our study links information on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs, shown in Figure 1a) to

69   patterns of human mobility (Figure 1b) and COVID-19 cases (Figure 1c-d). All data were obtained

70   from publicly available sources. We provide a brief summary of these data here; full details are

71   provided in Appendix A.


72   Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions

73   We obtain NPI data from two sources. At the sub-national level, we use the NPI dataset compiled

74   by Hsiang et al. (2020).1 For each sub-national region in five countries, we observe the fraction of

75   the population treated with NPIs in each location on each day. We aggregate 13 different policy

76   actions into four general categories: Shelter in Place, Social Distance, School Closure, and Travel

77   Ban. At the national level, we compiled data on national lockdown policies from the Organisation for

78   Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) - Country Policy Tracker,2 and crowed-sourced

79   information on Wikipedia and COVID-19 Kaggle competitions.3

80   Human Mobility

81   We source publicly-available data on human mobility from Google, Facebook, Baidu and SafeGraph.

82   These private companies provide free aggregated and anonymized information on the movement of

83   users of their online platform (Fig 1e). Data from Google indicates the percentage change in the

84   amount of time people spend in different types of locations (e.g., residential, retail, and workplace).4

85   These changes are relative to a baseline defined as the median value, for the corresponding day of

86   the week, during Jan 3­Feb 6, 2020. Facebook provides estimates of the number of trips within

87   and between square tiles (of resolution up to 360m2 ) in a region.5 We aggregate these data to show

88   trips between and within sub-national units. Baidu provides similar data, indicating movement

89   between and within major Chinese cities.6 Lastly, SafeGraph dataset gives us information on

90   average distance travelled from home by millions of devices across the US.7


91   COVID-19 Cases

92   For each subnational and national unit, we obtain the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 from

93   the data repository compiled by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering

94   (JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data).8


95   Linking Data Sets

96   The availability of epidemiological, policy, and mobility data varies across subnational units and

97   countries included in the analysis. We distinguish between three different levels of aggregation

98   for administrative regions - denoted "ADM2" (the smallest unit), "ADM1", "ADM0." Our global

99   analysis is conducted using ADM0 data. The country-specific analysis is determined by data avail-

101   regional (ADM1) level in France; the province (ADM2) and region (ADM1) level in Italy; the

102   province (ADM1) level in South Korea; and the county (ADM2) and state (ADM1) level in the

103   United States.

104      We merge the sub-national NPI, mobility, and epidemiological data based on administrative

105   unit and day to form a single longitudinal (panel) data set for each country. We merge the daily

106   country-level observations to construct a longitudinal data sets for the portion of the world we

107   observe.



108   Methods

109   Models

110   We decompose the impact of an NPI on infections ( inf ections
                                                         N P I      ) into two components that can be

111   modeled separately: the change in behavior associated with the NPI, and the resulting change in

112   infections associated with that change in behavior:

                                 inf ections   behavior inf ections
                                             =         ×            .                                 (1)
                                  N P I        N P I     behavior

113   We construct models to describe each of these two factors. The "behavior model" describes how

114   mobility behavior changes in association with the deployment of NPIs ( behavior
                                                                             N P I ). The "infec-

115   tion model" describes how infections change in association with changes in mobility behavior

116   ( inf ections
       behavior ). Both models are "reduced-form" models, commonly used in econometrics, that char-

117   acterize the behavior of these variables without explicitly modeling the underlying mechanisms that

118   link them (cf., Hsiang et al., 2020). Instead, these models emulate the output one would expect

119   from more sophisticated and mechanistically explicit epidemiological models -- without requiring

120   the underlying processes to be specified. While this reduced-form approach does not provide the

121   same epidemiological insight that more detailed models do, they demand less data and fewer as-

122   sumptions. For example, they can be fit to local data by analysts with basic statistical training,


                                                      7
123   not necessarily in epidemiology, and they do not require knowledge of fundamental epidemiological

124   parameters -- some of which may differ in each context and can be difficult to determine. The

125   performance of these simple, low-cost models can then be evaluated via cross-validation, i.e., by

126   systematically evaluating out-of-sample forecast quality.


127   Behavior Model

128   For each country, we separately estimate how daily sub-national mobility behavior changes in

129   association with the deployments of NPIs using a country-specific model. In the global model, we

130   pool data across countries and estimate how mobility in each country changes in association with

131   national exposure to NPIs. Each category of mobility on each day is assumed to be simultaneously

132   influenced by the collection of NPIs that are active in that location on that day. A panel multiple

133   linear regression model is used to estimate the relative association of each category of mobility

134   with each NPI. Our approach accounts for constant differences in baseline mobility between and

135   within each sub-national unit ­ such as differences due to regional commuting patterns, culture,

136   or geography, and differences in mobility across days of the week. These effects are not modeled

137   explicitly but instead are accounted for non-parametrically. Appendix B.1 contains details of the

138   modeling approach.


139   Infection Model

140   As with the behavior model, we model the daily growth rate of infections at the local, national,

141   and global scale. In each location, we model the daily growth rate of infections as a function of

142   recent human mobility and historical infections. The approach does not require epidemiological

143   parameters, such as the incubation period or R0 , nor information on NPIs.

144      In practice, we estimate a distributed-lag model where the predictor variables are mobility rates

145   in that location for the prior 21 days, and the dependent variable is the daily infection growth

146   rate, constructed as the first-difference of log confirmed infections. This approach captures the

147   intuition that human mobility is a key factor in determining rates of infection, but does not require

148   parametric assumptions about the nature of that dependency. The model also accounts for constant


                                                       8
149   differences in baseline infection growth rates within each locality -- such as those due to differences

150   in local behavior unrelated to mobility, differences across days of the week, and changes in how

151   confirmed infections are defined or tested for. This approach is also robust to incomplete rates of

152   COVID-19 testing, uneven patterns of testing across space, and gradual changes in testing over

153   time (Hsiang et al., 2020).

154      We fit the model using historical data from each location, and follow stringent practices of

155   cross-validation to ensure that the models are not `overfit' to historical trends. The accuracy of

156   the forecast is then evaluated against actual infections observed during the forecast period, but

157   which were not used to fit the model. Models are fit at the finest administrative level where data

158   are available and forecasts are aggregated to larger regions to evaluate the ability of the model

159   to predict infections at different spatial scales. Appendix B.2 contains details of the modeling

160   approach.

161      In principle, such future forecasts can be used by decision-makers who are able to influence local

162   mobility through policy and/or NPIs, perhaps informed either by a behavioral model or observation.

163   Here, we test the quality of the infection model to generate forecasts by simulating and evaluating

164   what a forecaster would have predicted had they generated a forecast at a historical date. In the

165   forecasts presented here, we assume that mobility remains at the level observed during the forecast

166   period ­ although in practice we expect that decision-makers would simulate different forecasts

167   under different mobility assumptions to inform NPI deployment and policy-making.



168   Results

169   We first present results from our behavior model, characterizing the mobility response of different

170   populations to different NPIs. We then evaluate the infection model's ability to forecast COVID-19

171   infections based on these same mobility measures. We conclude by discussing how these models

172   could be used to guide policy decisions at local and regional scales.

173   Mobility response to NPIs

174   We estimate the reduction in human mobility associated with the deployment of NPIs by linking

175   comprehensive data on policy interventions to mobility data from several different countries at

176   multiple geographic scales. We find that the combined impact of all NPIs reduced mobility between

177   administrative units (Facebook/Baidu) by 73% on average across the countries with sub-national

178   policy data (Fig 2a). The combined effects were of similar magnitude in China (-78%, se = 8%),

179   France (-88%, se = 27%), Italy (-85%, se = 12%), and the US (-69%, se = 6%); no significant

180   change was observed in South Korea, where mobility was not a direct target of NPIs (for example,

181   You, 2020). Excluding South Korea, we estimate that all policies combined were associated with a

182   decrease in mobility by 81% . The general consistency of these magnitudes across countries holds

183   for alternative measures of mobility: using Google data we find that all NPIs combined result in an

184   increase in time spent at home by 28% (se = 2.9), 24% (se = 1.3), and 26% (se = 1.3) in France,

185   Italy, and the US, respectively. This was achieved, in part, by reducing time spent at workplaces

186   by an average of 59.8% and time in commercial retail locations by an average of 78.8%.

187      We estimate the impact of each individual NPI on total trips (Facebook/Baidu) and quantity of

188   time spent at home and other locations (Google) accounting for the estimated impact of all other

189   NPIs. Travel bans are significantly associated with large mobility reductions in China (-70%, se

190   = 7%) and Italy (-82%, se = 25%), where individuals stayed home for 10% more time, but not

191   in the US (Fig 2b). School closures were associated with moderate negative impacts on mobility

192   in the US (-26%, se = 10%) and increased time at home (4.6%, se = 0.7%) but slight positive

193   impacts in Italy (33%, se = 7%) and France (15%, se = 7%). Other social distancing policies, such

194   as religious closures, had no consistent impact on total trips but were associated with individuals

195   spending more time at home in the US (11.5%, se = 1.6%) and more time in retail locations in Italy

196   (17.6%, se = 4.8%). Similarly, the national emergency declaration was associated with significant

197   mobility reductions in China (-62.6 %, se = 12.7 %). Shelter-in-place orders were associated with

198   large reductions in trips for the US (-60.8%, se = 8%), Italy (-38.4%, se = 35%), and France (-

199   91.2%, se = 13.6%), and large increases in the fraction of time spent in homes (8.9%, 22.1%, 28%,

200   respectively). Shelter in place orders did not appear to have large impacts in South Korea or China.

201   This is consistent with earlier policies (such as the Emergency Declaration) restricting movement in

202   China earlier than the shelter in place orders, while mobility in South Korea was never substantially

203   affected by NPIs.

204      Globally, we find evidence that lockdown policies were associated with substantial reductions

205   in mobility (Figure 2c). Across 80 countries, the average time spend in non-residential locations

206   decreased by 40% (se = 2%) in response to NPIs. Time spent in retail locations is the most

207   impacted category, declining 49.9% (se = 2%). Some of the variation in response across countries

208   (grey dots) likely reflects different social, cultural, and economic norms; measurement error; and

209   statistical variability. In Appendix C, we disaggregate this effect temporally, and find that the most

210   significant reductions occur during the first eight days after a lockdown (Figure 5c).

211      In Appendix C, we further exploit the granular resolution of the mobility data to investigate

212   whether localized policies also impacted neighboring regions (Figure 5). In the USA and Italy,

213   the impact of NPIs on mobility was highly localized, with little evidence of spatial spillover effects

214   (Appendix C - Figure 5a). In China, the evidence is more mixed, with some evidence of spillovers

215   between neighboring cities (Appendix C - Fig 5b).


216   Forecasting infections based on mobility

217   We find that mobility data alone are sufficient to meaningfully forecast COVID-19 infections 7-10

218   days ahead at all geographic scales ­ from counties and cities (ADM2), to states and provinces

219   (ADM1), to countries (ADM0) and the entire world. Furthermore, identical models that exclude

220   mobility data perform substantially worse, suggesting an important role for mobility data in fore-

221   casting.

222      Figure 3 illustrates the performance of model forecasts in several geographic regions and at

223   multiple scales. The true infection rate is shown as a solid line; data used to train each model

224   are depicted in blue dots, and the forecast of our model is shown in orange, contrasted against a

225   model with no mobility data in green. Forecasts that account for current and lagged measures of

226   mobility generally track actual cases more closely than forecasts that do not account for mobility.


                                                       11
227   For example, a forecast made for the period 4/06/2020 - 4/15/2020 for California-Los Angeles on

228   4/15/2020 without mobility projects 30, 716 cases, while the same forecast accounting for mobility

229   would be 12, 650 cases, much closer to the 10, 496 that was observed. Figure 3b depicts projected

230   cases for the entire world based on this reduced-form approach, estimated using country-level data

231   mobility data from Google.

232      Figure 4 summarizes model performance across all administrative subdivisions of each of the

233   three countries we consider for the forecast analysis (China, Italy, and the United States). We show

234   the distribution of model errors over all ADM2 and ADM1 regions at forecast lengths ranging from

235   1 to 10 days. Table 1 summarizes each distribution using the median.

236      In all geographies and at all scales, models with mobility data perform better than models

237   without. In general, sub-national forecasts in China benefit least from mobility data, but forecasts

238   in Italy and the US are substantially improved by including a single measure of mobility for the 21

239   days prior to the date of the forecast. At the local (ADM2) level in Italy, the MPE is -1.73% and

240   13.27% for five and ten days in the future when mobility is accounted for, compared to 45.81% and

241   167.97% when it is omitted. In the US, MPE is 7.00% (5-day) and 20.75% (10-day) accounting for

242   mobility, and 23.79% and 79.47% omitting mobility. In China, MPE is 4.18% (5-day) and 131.09%

243   (10-day) accounting for mobility, and 16.83% and 128.80% omitting mobility. At the regional

244   (ADM1) level, MPE rates are similar but extreme errors are reduced, largely because positive and

245   negative errors cancel out. Country-level forecasts, which use country-level mobility data from

246   Google, benefit relatively less than sub-national model from including mobility information, in part

247   because baseline forecast errors are smaller. For countries in our sample, MPE is 6.35% (5-day)

248   and 15.24% (10-day) accounting for mobility, and 11.46% and 31.12% omitting mobility.


249   Model application in decentralized management of infections

250   Our results suggest that a simple reduced-form approach to estimating model (1) may provide

251   useful information and feedback to decision-makers who might otherwise lack the resources to

252   access more sophisticated scenario analysis. We imagine the approach can be utilized in two ways.

253   First, a decision-maker considering an NPI (either deploying, continuing, or lifting) could develop


                                                      12
254   an estimate for how that NPI might affect behavior, based on our analysis of different policies above

255   (Fig 2). Using these estimated changes in mobility, they could then forecast changes in infections

256   using the infection model described above -- but fit to local data.

257      Table 2 provides an example calculation for how a novel policy that increased residential time

258   (observed in Google data) would alter future infections, using estimates from the global-level model.

259   For example, a policy that increases residential time by 5% in a country is predicted to reduce

260   cumulative infections ten days later, to 82.5% (CI: (78.2, 87.0)) of what they would otherwise have

261   been. Similar tabulations can be generated by fitting infection models using recent and local data,

262   which would flexibly capture local social, economic, and epidemiological conditions.

263      A second way that a decision-maker could use our approach would be to actually deploy a policy

264   without ex ante knowledge of the effect it will have on mobility, instead simply observing mobility

265   responses that occur after NPI deployment using these publicly available data sources. Based on

266   these observed responses, they could forecast infections using our behavior model.



267   Discussion

268   The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented degree of cooperation and transparency

269   within the scientific community, with important new insights rapidly disseminated freely around

270   the globe. However, the capacity of different populations to leverage new scientific insights is not

271   uniform. In many resource-constrained contexts, critical decisions are not supported by robust

272   epidemiological modeling of scenarios. Here we have demonstrated that freely available mobility

273   data can be used in simple models to generate practically useful forecasts. The goal is for these

274   models to be accessible to a single individual with basic training in regression analysis using standard

275   statistical software. The reduced-form model we develop generally performs well when fit to local

276   data, except in China where it cannot account for some key factors that contributed to reductions

277   in transmission.

278      A key insight from our work is that passively observed measures of aggregate mobility are

279   useful predictors of growth in COVID-19 cases. However, this does not imply that population



                                                        13
280   mobility itself is the only fundamental cause of transmission. The measures of mobility we observe

281   capture a degree of "mixing" that is occurring within a population, as populations move about their

282   local geographic context. This movement is likely correlated with other behaviors and factors that

283   contribute to the spread of the virus, such as low rates of mask-wearing and/or physical distancing.

284   Our approach does not explicitly capture these other factors -- and thus should not be used to

285   draw causal inferences -- but is possible that our infection model performs well in part because the

286   easy-to-observe mobility measures capture these other factors by proxy.

287      The simple model we present here is designed to provide useful information in contexts when

288   more sophisticated process-based models are unavailable, but it should not necessarily displace

289   those models where they are available. In cases where complete process-based epidemiological

290   models have been developed for a population and can be deployed for decision-making, the model

291   we develop here could be considered complementary to those models. Future work might determine

292   how information from combinations of qualitatively distinct models can be used to optimally guide

293   decision-making.

294      We also note that the reduced-form model is designed to forecast infections in a certain popu-

295   lation at a restricted point in time. It achieves this by capturing dynamics that are governed by

296   many underlying processes that are unobserved by the modeler. However, because these underlying

297   mechanisms are only captured implicitly, the model is not well-suited to environments where these

298   underlying dynamics change dramatically. In such circumstances, process-based models will likely

299   perform better. Nonetheless, the reduced-form approach presented here can also be applied in these

300   circumstances, but it may be necessary to refit the model based on data that is representative of

301   current conditions. Similarly, when our reduced-form model is applied to a new population, it

302   should be fit to local data to capture dynamics representative of the new population.

303      The approach we present here depends critically on the availability of aggregate mobility data,

304   which is currently provided to the public by private firms that passively collect this information. We

305   hypothesize that the approach we develop here might skillfully forecast the spread of other diseases

306   besides COVID-19. If true, this suggests our approach could provide useful information to decision-

307   makers for managing other public health challenges, such as influenza or other outbreaks, potentially

309   the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.

Figure 4: Evaluation of forecast errors for the infection model. For Italy, US and China,
forecasts are evaluated at the finest administrative level (ADM2), as well as aggregated to larger
regions (ADM1). For each ADM2 region and forecast length, the mean is taken over all available
forecast dates, and the error is evaluated using that mean. Boxplots display the distribution of
these percentage errors for each ADM2 region. These are then aggregated to ADM1 level (right
panel), for both models including and excluding mobility variables. Similarly, for data fitted at a
global level (bottom-most plot), for each country and forecast length, the mean is taken over all
forecast dates.

Table 2: Example: Estimating the effect of a mobility-reducing policy on infections for
the global model (unit of observation is a country day). The values in the table are the ratio
of the cumulative number of cases after up to 10 days, if residential time over baseline was increased
in a country at day 0 by  = 1%, 5%, 10% or 20% from their original values. These values are
estimated using coefficients of the mobility variables derived from the pooled global model (details
in Appendix B.2). Note that each column compares to the value on its first row (indicated by the
value 1). An example interpretation is: if a country increases residential time by 5%, cumulative
infections ten days later is predicted to be 82.5% of what they would have been with no change in
mobility.

425   A        Data Acquisition and Processing

426   Data used in this study can be divided into three categories - Epidemiological, Policy and Mobil-

427   ity. The sources of these data sets include various research institutions, government public health

428   websites, regional newspaper articles and digital social media platforms.


429   A.1       Epidemiological Data

430   We collected epidemiological data from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data

431   Repository compiled by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU

432   CSSE).9 The primary variable of interest for our study is cum confirmed cases, i.e., the total number

433   of confirmed positive cases in an administrative area since the first confirmed case. We accessed it

434   along with other relevant metadata, including:

435         date : The date of observation

436         adm0 name : The ISO3 region (Administrative Level 0) code of the observation

437         adm1 name : The name of the "Administrative Level 1" region of the observation

438         adm2 name : The name of the "Administrative Level 2" region of the observation


439   A.2       Policy data

440   The policy data was constructed and made available for academic research by Hsiang et al. (2020).10

441   For each country, the relevant country-specific policies were identified and mapped to four harmo-

442   nized policy categories - Travel Ban, School Closure, Shelter in place, and Social Distance. These

443   category variables were created by taking an average of policy variables related to that category.


444        i. Travel Ban
      9    https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
      10   http://www.globalpolicy.science/covid19




                                                        25
445         · travel ban local : Represents a policy that restricts people from entering or exiting the

446            administrative area (e.g., county or province) treated by the policy.

447   ii. School Closure

448         · school closure : Represents a policy that closes school and other educational services in

449            that area.

450   iii. Shelter In Place

451         · home isolation : Represents a policy that prohibits people from leaving their home re-

452            gardless of their testing status. For some countries, the policy can also include the case

453            when people have to stay at home, but are allowed to leave for work- or health-related

454            purposes. For the latter case, when the policy is moderate, this is coded as home isolation

455            = 0.5.

456         · work from home : Represents a policy that requires people to work remotely. This policy

457            may also include encouraging workers to take holiday/paid time off.

458         · business closure : Represents a policy that closes all offices, non-essential businesses, and

459            non-essential commercial activities in that area.

460         · pos cases quarantine : A policy that mandates that people who have tested positive for

461            COVID-19, or subject to quarantine measures, have to confine themselves at home. The

462            policy can also include encouraging people who have fevers or respiratory symptoms to

463            stay at home, regardless of whether they tested positive or not.

464         · welfare service closure : A policy that mandates closure of welfare services such as day

465            care centers for children.

466         · emergency declaration : Represents a decision made at the city / municipality, county,

467            state / provincial, or federal level to declare a state of emergency. This allows the affected

468            area to marshal emergency funds and resources as well as activate emergency legislation.

469   iv. Social Distance


                                                       26
470           · social distance : Represents a policy that encourages people to maintain a safety distance

471             (often between one to two meters) from others. This policy differs by country, but

472             includes other policies that close cultural institutions (e.g., museums or libraries), or

473             encourage establishments to reduce density, such as limiting restaurant hours.

474           · no gathering : Represents a policy that prohibits any type of public or private gathering.

475             (whether cultural, sporting, recreational, or religious). Depending on the country, the

476             policy can prohibit a gathering above a certain size, in which case the number of people

477             is specified by the no gathering size variable.

478           · event cancel : Represents a policy that cancels a specific pre-scheduled large event (e.g.,

479             parade, sporting event, etc). This is different from prohibiting all events over a certain

480             size.

481           · religious closure : Represents a policy that prohibits gatherings at a place of worship,

482             specifically targeting locations that are epicenters of COVID-19 outbreak. See the section

483             on Korean policy for more information on this policy variable.

484           · no demonstration : Represents a policy that prohibits protest-specific gatherings. See

485             the section on Korean policy for more information on this policy variable.


486   A.3    Mobility data

487   Mobility data comes from three of the biggest internet companies - Google, Facebook and Baidu.

488   These companies have millions of users accessing their social media, e-commerce and other digital

489   platforms every day. These data are utilized to construct aggregated, anonymized user location and

490   movement metrics for various geographic regions and countries. Descriptions follow, and Table 3

491   contains a summary of the data used for each country.




                                                      27
492   A.3.1       Google

493   Google mobility data summarizes time spent by their users each day after Feb 6, 2020 in various

494   types of places, such as residential, workplaces and grocery stores.11 Specifically, it provides the

495   percentage change in number of visits and length of stay in each type of place, compared to a

496   baseline value. The baseline is the value on the corresponding day of the week during the 5-week

497   period between Jan 3, 2020 and Feb 6, 2020. The metrics are available starting Feb 15, 2020 at the

498   country (Administrative Level 0) and state level (Administrative Level 1) for over 135 countries.

499   We also access county-level metrics (Administrative Level 2) for the US. Types of places include

500   the following:


501         i. Grocery & pharmacy : Places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, spe-

502            cialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies.

503        ii. Parks : Places like local parks, national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas,

504            and public gardens.

505        iii. Transit stations : Places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations.

506        iv. Retail & recreation : Places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums,

507            libraries, and movie theaters.

508        v. Residential : Places of residence.

509        vi. Workplaces : Places of work.


510   A.3.2       Facebook

511   Facebook summarizes and anonymizes its user data into useful metrics that can be used to evaluate

512   the movement of people.12 , 13 Our analysis uses data beginning March 5, Feb 23 and Feb 24, 2020

513   for France, Italy and South Korea respectively. Specifically, Facebook aggregates the number of

514   trips between tiles of up to a resolution of 360 square meters. We aggregate these data to the level

515   of administrative regions, constructing metrics for number of trips between as well as within these

516   regions. We use the following variables from the data provided by Facebook:


517         i. Date - The day of the movement.

518        ii. Starting Location - The region or tile where the movement of the group started.

519        iii. Ending Location - The region or tile where the movement of the group ended.

520        iv. Baseline Movement - The total number of people who moved from Starting Location to

521           Ending Location on average during the weeks before the disaster began.

522        v. Crisis Movement - The total number of people who moved from Starting Location to Ending

523           Location during the time period specified


524   A.3.3       Baidu

525   Baidu provides aggregated user location data and mobility metrics via its Smart Eye Platform.14

526   These data were scraped and publicly shared by the China Data Lab. The metrics represent

527   movement in and out of major regions across China each day in terms of an aggregated mobility

528   index (China-Data-Lab, 2020). Index values are available beginning Jan 1, 2020. Baidu does not

529   disclose specific information regarding the construction of the index.


530   A.3.4       SafeGraph

531   SafeGraph data were generated by tracking anonymous mobile devices across US.15 The mobility

532   metrics are available starting January 1, 2020 for census block group. SafeGraph infers home

533   location based on night time location of the device and uses that to impute average distance

534   travelled per day by the devices in each census block. We aggregate this data to the state level

535   (Administrative Level 1) for our analysis.

536   B      Methods Summary

537   B.1      Behavior Model

538   The behavior model describes how human mobility changes as a result of NPIs ( behavior
                                                                                    N P I    in equation

539   (1)). The model is a commonly used reduced-form approach in econometrics. Details on the model

540   and model estimation are presented below.


541   Model details:

542       1. The model used for each policy is mt = f (policyt , Xt ) + t , where mt is a measure of mobility

543          behavior at time t, Xt represents control variables, and   t   is the error.

544       2. The model is fit for each country at the sub-national level where granular policy and mobility

545          data are available. For the rest of the world, use a panel regression model where the unit of

546          observation is at the country by day level.

547       3. The policy variable is a vector with NPIs specific to each country, for each location and day.

548          NPIs are continuous variables between 0 and 1 (inclusive) that indicate the intensity of the

549          policy where 0 is no enforcement and 1 is fully enacted. In some instances, it may be desirable

550          to gather multiple policies in a single variable (for example, business closure and restaurant

551          closure) by taking the average, thus the maximum value of 1 would indicate that all policies

552          are fully enacted.

553       4. The control variable X includes one-hot encodings of sub-national (or national) units and

554          day-of-week variables. The former account for time-invariant factors (for example, socio-

555          economic status, culture, public transportation availability) that impact mobility m, while

556          the later control for weekly patterns in mobility (for example, less workplace related mobility

557          on Sunday) that are common across location unit.

558   Steps for model estimation:

559       1. Estimate the average effect on mobility in all subsequent periods, ^, of each policy included

560          in each model using the model described above, and ordinary least squares.

                                                           31
561     2. Compute the combined effect of policies on human mobility by taking the sum across all ^.




562   B.2     Infection Model

563   Similar to the behavior model, the infection model is also a reduced-form approach, used to describe

564   the relationship between infections and mobility behavior (  inf ections
                                                                  behavior in equation (1)). Model

565   details, as well as steps for model estimation, forecasting and cross-validation are outlined below.

566   Also included are steps for data selection.


567   Model details:

568     1. The model used is log ( ItI-
                                      t
                                        1
                                          ) = g (mobilityt , Xt ) + t , where log ( ItI-
                                                                                       t
                                                                                         1
                                                                                           ) is the first-difference of

569         log confirmed infections at time t, Xt represents control variables, and           t   is the error.

570     2. The model is fit for each country at the sub-national level where granular infections and

571         mobility data are available. For the global model, use a regression model where the unit of

572         observation is at the country by day level.

573     3. The mobility variable is a vector with mobility rates specific to each country, for each location

574         and day. Includes mobility measures averaged over lags 1-7, 8-14 and 15-21, respectively.

575         We use Google mobility data in its original form (percentage points), and take logs for the

576         Facebook and Baidu mobility data.

577     4. The control variable X includes one-hot encodings of sub-national (or national) units and

578         day-of-week variables.

579   Steps for model estimation: The following steps are used to generate estimates of the average

580   effect of each mobility variable on the growth rate of infections (see Figure 6). These are then used

581   to estimate how a novel policy affecting mobility would alter future infections (Table 2).

582     1. Estimate the average effect of each mobility variable on the growth rate of infections, ^, using

583         the model described above, and ordinary least squares.

                                                            32
584     2. To estimate the potential effect of a mobility-reducing policy, use I = h(m, ^), where I

585        is the change in number of infections, m is the anticipated change in mobility due to NPIs,

586        and ^ are estimated coefficients of the mobility variables.


587     3. Specifically, for Facebook and Baidu data, where mobility variables are in log form: at forecast
                                           3     ^l log(1+ml ))
588        day k ,     Inew
                     Ioriginal   = ek (    l=1   
                                                                  , where ml is the fractional change in the lth mobility

589        variable (number of trips for all lags involved) (e.g., if the number of trips for all lags in

590        the lth variable is reduced by 10%, ml = -.1). For Google data: at forecast day k ,
                                 3     ^l l )
591
              Inew
            Ioriginal   = ek (   l=1   
                                                , where ml is the change in residential time over baseline for the lth

592        mobility variable (e.g., ml = .05 means a 5% increase, say from 20% to 25% residential time

593        over baseline, for all lags in the lth variable).

594   Steps for forecasting and cross-validation:

595     1. For a 20-day period (training data), fit a regression model as specified above, using ordinary

596        least squares.

597     2. For a 10-day period (test data), multiply the coefficient estimates obtained from fitting the

598        regression model on the training data with the observed predictor variables in the test data

599        to obtain prediction of the infection rate.

600     3. For each test day, compute the percentage error compared to the ground-truth infection rate.

601     4. Perform cross-validation (i.e., robustness to train and test sample selection), for all 20-day

602        training periods and 10-day forecast periods, limited by data availability.

603     5. Group percentage errors by day of forecast (from 1 to 10).

604     6. Repeat the above, using a baseline model which excludes mobility variables, i.e., log ( ItI-
                                                                                                      t
                                                                                                        1
                                                                                                          )=

605        j (Xt ) + t .

606   In other words, the baseline model simply uses past infections to predict future infections. Smaller

607   errors using the model including mobility variables would indicate that information on mobility

608   improves forecasts. Examples of the results are in Figure 3, and forecasting errors are in 4.

                                                                      33
609   Steps for data selection:

610      The time period that we consider (see Table 3) is the "first wave" of infections, and to demon-

611   strate the utility of the mobility model, we focus on the period in which mobility starts falling

612   as a result of lockdown measures imposed during this first wave, until right before mobility starts

613   increasing again. This model can be refit to the local context of interest, using data that is represen-

614   tative of current conditions. For countries in which lockdown policy data are available, we include

615   administrative regions after the lockdown policy has been implemented. For countries without pol-

616   icy data available on a granular enough level (US in this case), we use a start date of March 17 (the

617   results are robust to different start dates), or when Google residential mobility is at least 5 percent

618   above baseline (world level). We select an end date that roughly corresponds to just before mobility

619   picks back up. The reason for this choice is that in the phase in which mobility starts to increase,

620   we might expect there to be other measures put in place, or other changes in behavior, such as

621   contact tracing, mask wearing, and so forth, which justified the lifting of lockdown measures and

622   subsequent increase in mobility. The relationship between mobility and cases might therefore be

623   different than during the lockdown stage, suggesting that the model needs to be refit if we would

624   like for it to be used during this period.

625      Now, we train each model using 20 days of training data, and forecast for up to 10 days into the

626   future. To be included in the data used to train each model, we impose the following conditions

627   at the level of the administrative region. For the administrative region to be included, for all 20

628   training days t,


629     1. It  10

630     2. It-1 > 0

631          and for the world-level analysis only:

632     3. mobilityt  5 percent, i.e., current day mobility is at least 5 percent above baseline.

                     It
633     4.    log   It-1             .03 percent, i.e., the 14 days rolling average of the growth rate of cumulative
                           i,1-14
634          active cases flattens.


                                                               34
635      These conditions also imply that It , It-1 and the mobility variables have to be non-missing for

636   all training days. These conditions have implications for predictions as well: if an administrative

637   region is not included in the training data, predictions will not be generated for that region, because

638   the region fixed effect would not be estimated for that region.
