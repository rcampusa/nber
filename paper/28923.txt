Five Facts about the UIP Premium

                                         ABSTRACT

We document five novel facts about Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) deviations vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar for 34 currencies of advanced economies and emerging markets, using survey data on
expected exchange rate. First, the UIP premium co-moves with global risk perception (VIX) for
all currencies, whereas only for emerging market currencies there is a negative comovement
between the UIP premium and capital inflows. Second, the comovement of the UIP premium and
the VIX is explained by changes in interest rate differentials in emerging markets, and by
expected changes in exchange rates in advanced countries. Third, country risk measured by the
degree of policy uncertainty can explain both the negative comovement of the UIP premium with
capital inflows and the positive comovement of the UIP premium with the interest rate
differentials in emerging markets. Fourth, there are no overshooting and predictability reversal
puzzles--for any currency--when using exchange rate expectations to calculate the UIP
premium. Fifth, the classical Fama puzzle disappears in advanced economies in expectations, but
it remains for emerging markets. As a result, while global investors expect zero excess returns
and earn positive returns in the short-run and negative returns in the long-run by investing in
advanced country currencies, the same global investors always expect and earn positive excess
returns from emerging market currencies. These results imply that in advanced countries the UIP
premium is largely due to deviations from rational expectations and full information, whereas in
emerging markets, the UIP premium is a risk premium. Global investors charge an "excess"
premium to compensate for policy uncertainty in emerging markets--a premium that is over and
above the expected and actual depreciation of these currencies.

1       Introduction
A central concept in international macroeconomics and finance is the Uncovered Interest Parity
(UIP) condition that links interest rates to expected changes in the exchange rate. Under the UIP
condition, the home currency is expected to depreciate if the home interest rate is higher than the
foreign interest rate, offsetting this interest rate differential. Starting with the influential work of
Fama (1984), a large literature, focusing on advanced economies, uses realized exchange rates and
documents the opposite pattern: high interest rate currencies do not depreciate but appreciate in the
near future, implying ­on average­ excess returns from investing in these currencies.1 A subsequent
literature, also focusing on advanced economies and using realized exchange rates, documented
puzzling dynamics. The delayed overshooting puzzle, as first documented by Eichenbaum and
Evans (1995), shows that the exchange rate appreciates first as a response to a positive shock to
interest rate differentials, and only starts depreciating after some time. The predictability reversal
puzzle, as documented by Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2010), Engel (2016) and Valchev (2020),
shows that UIP deviations switch direction, that is high interest rate currencies have positive excess
returns in the near future due to the initial appreciation but, after some time, they start having
negative excess returns due to too much depreciation.2
    We undertake an empirical investigation for the determinants of UIP deviations in a large
panel of monthly observations composed of both advanced and emerging countries' currencies. Our
sample consists of 34 currencies -- 12 advanced economies and 22 emerging markets ­ over the
period 1996-2018. Following Froot and Frankel (1989),3 we use expectations of exchange rates from
survey data instead of realized exchange rates in order to be able to measure the exact counterpart
of the theoretical UIP condition in the data. We document five novel facts:

    1. The UIP premium co-moves with global risk perception (VIX) for all currencies, whereas only
        for emerging market currencies there is a negative comovement between the UIP premium
        and capital inflows.

    2. Decomposing the UIP premium into two components--interest rate differentials and expected
        exchange rate adjustment--reveals that the channel of transmission of global risk perception
        differs in emerging markets and advanced economies. In emerging markets, the comovement
        of the UIP premium and the VIX is explained by the comovement of the VIX with the interest

    1
      The empirical Fama literature measures the UIP condition using realized exchange rates on the assumption of
rational expectations and full information. In addition, this literature assumes that Covered Interest Parity (CIP)
holds by equating the difference between forward rates and spot rates to interest rate differentials. This is why
the Fama puzzle is also known as the forward premium/discount puzzle, as forward premium is associated with
appreciations instead of depreciations. An excellent review of this literature can be found in Engel (2014).
    2
      Froot and Frankel (1989) showed that forecast errors in exchange rate can account for the classic UIP puzzle,
whereas Candian and De Leo (2021) show that forecast errors can also account for predictability reversal puzzle and
can explain the entire path of excess currency returns. Both papers use only advanced country currencies (G7 or G10)
and argue that puzzles stem from deviations from full information and rational expectations. Engel (2016) argues
that high interest rate currencies cannot be "risky currencies" if they deliver negative returns most of the time, as
sum of all future excess returns are negative, the so-called "Engel puzzle."

      Stavrakeva and Tang (2018) also use expectations of exchange rates from survey data for advanced countries.

     rate differentials. In advanced economies, this comovement is explained by the comovement
     of the VIX with expected exchange rate changes.

  3. Country risk measured by the degree of policy uncertainty can explain the comovement of
     the UIP premium with interest rate differentials and with country-specific capital inflows in
     emerging markets. This is not the case in advanced economies.

  4. There are no overshooting and predictability reversal puzzles--for any currency--when using
     exchange rate expectations to calculate the UIP premium. In emerging markets, a transi-
     tory increase in interest rate differentials caused by a policy uncertainty shock leads to lower
     than required expected depreciations, which creates persistent expected excess returns. In ad-
     vanced economies, a positive shock to interest rate differentials leads to a permanent expected
     depreciation that offsets the shock.

  5. The classical Fama puzzle disappears in advanced economies in expectations, but it remains
     for emerging markets. As a result, while global investors expect zero excess returns and earn
     actual positive returns in the short run and negative returns in the long run by investing
     in advanced country currencies, the same global investors expect and earn positive excess
     returns over the entire horizon from emerging market currencies. The forecast errors in
     advanced countries are systematic as they are strongly negatively correlated with the interest
     rate differentials on average, where investors first over-react expecting a depreciation when
     there is ex-post appreciation, and they under-react later expecting a depreciation that is lower
     than the actual depreciation. In emerging countries, on the other hand, although there are
     forecast errors, they are not systematically correlated with the interest rate differential. The
     same global investors always over-react in emerging markets, expecting a depreciation larger
     than ex-post depreciation. Hence, expected and actual exchange rate move together. In
     emerging markets, expected and actual excess returns compensate for the policy uncertainty
     affecting foreign investors' risk sentiments.
   To illustrate our findings in detail, let us start with the UIP condition, Et (St+h )(1 + iU S
                                                                                              t ) =
St (1 + it ), where it and iU
                            t
                              S are the local and the U.S. short-term (12 month) interest rates, and

h is a 12-month horizon. E denotes expectations over the next year and S is the exchange rate
in units of local currency per USD. Denoting logs with lower case letters, we can write the UIP
premium ­e
         t+h ­ in logs as follows:


                                 e            US           e
                                 t+h = (it - it ) + (st - st+h ).                                (1)
                                         IR Differential   ER Adjustment

When e
     t+h = 0, the UIP condition holds, as the interest rate differential and expected exchange
rate changes offset each other. Expected excess returns are zero. When e
                                                                       t+h > 0, the UIP condition
does not hold and there are positive expected excess returns from investing in the domestic currency.
   The top panel of Figure 1 plots the expected excess returns over our sample period, separating
advanced economies from emerging markets. If we do eye-ball econometrics, the first observation to

                                                     2
notice is that UIP holds on average in advanced countries, as e
                                                              t+h fluctuates around zero (especially
since early 2000s), but it does not hold in emerging markets where e
                                                                   t+h is consistently above zero.
We confirm these observations also with Fama regressions.4 , 5

                            b) Interest Rate Differential and Exchange Rate Adjustment Terms

                             Figure 1: UIP Premium in Advanced Economies and Emerging Markets

Note: This figure shows the UIP premium and its decomposition between the interest rate differential and exchange
rate adjustment terms at 12 month horizon for 34 currencies ­22 emerging markets and 12 advanced economies­
over the period 1996m11:2018m12. The UIP premium and the exchange rate adjustment term are measured using
expected exchange rate changes from Consensus Forecast surveys.


          4
       This original Froot and Frankel (1989) result is confirmed in recent data for advanced economies by Bussiere,
Chinn, Ferrara, and Heipertz (2018). In emerging markets, however, UIP does not hold in expectations, even-though
we never get the "wrong sign" Fama coefficient. That is, high interest rate emerging markets' currencies are not
expected to appreciate. They are expected to depreciate as predicted by the UIP condition. Yet the condition still
fails to hold in emerging markets as the expected depreciation is not enough to offset the interest rate differential.

       We also compute Figure 1 and Fama regressions at 3 months horizon, obtaining similar results.

    The UIP premium shows high volatility across time. To assess this dynamics, we zoom in on the
exchange rate adjustment and interest rate differential components, defined in equation (1). As the
bottom panel of Figure 1 shows, these two components have a contrasting role on the dynamics of
their UIP premium across countries. In advanced economies, the UIP premium and the exchange
rate adjustment term overlap most of the time, with a correlation over 90 percent, while movements
in the interest rate differential term are negligible. In contrast, in emerging markets, interest rate
differentials almost perfectly co-move with the UIP premium, a 70 percent correlation, whereas the
exchange rate adjustment term is barely correlated with the UIP premium. These interest rate
differentials are systematic and are highly correlated with the expected excess returns, specially
during periods of high uncertainty, related to emerging markets' crises as in 1990s or to global
shocks, as in late 2000s. In our robustness exercises, we show that high inflation in emerging
markets cannot explain these patterns.
    To illustrate the correlation between global shocks/uncertainty and the UIP premium visually,
we show in Panel A of Figure 2, a strong correlation between the VIX and the UIP premium in
both advanced economies and emerging markets.6 In Panel B, we break down the UIP premium
again in its two components and show that shocks to global investors' risk sentiments affect the
UIP premium in these two set of economies through different channels. In emerging markets, the
VIX and the interest rate differential track each other closely. Indeed, the VIX has a much higher
correlation with the interest rate differential (0.44) than with the exchange rate adjustment term
(-0.03). In contrast, in advanced economies, the VIX co-moves more closely with the exchange rate
adjustment term (0.29) than with the interest rate differential (0.16).7
    We argue that the UIP premium in emerging markets is an investment risk premium. Investors
ask for an excess compensation that goes over and above their expectations of emerging markets'
currency depreciations. It is well known that emerging markets' currencies are riskier than advanced
economies' currencies given their higher volatility due to the country risk inherent in emerging
market investing. Such country risk will include both default (credit) risk and also uncertain
returns on foreign investment. To get at the latter, we extend the economic policy uncertainty
(EPU) index of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) for our large set of countries, and document that
policy uncertainty linked to credibility of emerging markets' policies is key to explain fluctuations in
the UIP premium in these economies. Using panel regressions, we show that, in these economies, an
increase in a country's policy uncertainty associates with a higher UIP premium, channeled through
a higher interest rate differential. Additionally, we show that the strong negative relationship
between capital inflows and the UIP premium ­also channeled through interest rate differentials­

      Giovanni, Kalemli-Ozcan, Ulu, and Baskaya (2019) is the original paper that shows the positive comovement
between UIP premium and VIX, but only for a single emerging market, Turkey. There is a parallel literature on the
correlation between VIX and the CIP deviations, where Du, Tepper, and Verdelhan (2018), Jiang, Krishnamurthy,
and Lustig (2021) and Avdjiev, Du, Koch, and Shin (2019) all show a systematic relationship between the US dollar
exchange rate, VIX and the CIP deviations.

      The exchange rate disconnect literature in terms of the correlation between realized changes in exchange rates
and the VIX (or predictive power of VIX) delivers mixed results, where some papers find a strong relation (e.g.
Sarno, Schneider, and Wagner 2012 and Lilley, Maggiori, Neiman, and Schreger 2019), others do not find much (e.g.
Bussiere, Chinn, Ferrara, and Heipertz 2018 and Engel and Wu 2020).

disappears upon conditioning on policy uncertainty.8 Hence, global investors' risk sentiment about
a country's idiosyncratic policy risk is priced in the interest rate differentials and, by this means,
entails a UIP premium. Our results also show the importance of global uncertainty as a determinant
of the UIP premium and are consistent with the literature that shows that VIX is a key correlate
of risk-free and risky interest rates, policy rate differentials and capital flows (e.g. Rey 2013, Bruno

        8
    The exchange rate disconnect literature shows a weak correlation between realized changes in exchange rates
and capital flows (e.g. Kouri 1981, Hau and Rey 2005, Lilley, Maggiori, Neiman, and Schreger 2019). Using expected
exchange rate changes, Stavrakeva and Tang (2018) find a stronger correlation with capital flows.

and Shin 2015, Kalemli-Özcan 2019). Notably, the transmission channel of global uncertainty
differs for advanced economies, where the VIX mainly affects expected exchange rate changes and,
thus, the UIP premium through currency movements.
    By running dynamic panel regressions akin to the overshooting literature, we evaluate the
response of the UIP premium to an increase in interest rate differentials caused by a transitory
shock to policy uncertainty. The UIP premium increases and stays persistent in emerging markets.
Although investors over-react and continuously expect a depreciation than realized ex-post, the
expected depreciation is never enough to offset the initial shock to interest rate differentials over
several months, leading to persistent expected excess returns. None of these results hold in advanced
countries. In those countries, a shock to policy uncertainty does not affect interest rate differentials
significantly. If we shock the interest rate differentials directly, then there is a permanent expected
depreciation in advanced countries that offsets this shock, as implied by the UIP.
    To further check that our results are capturing investors' risk sentiments about overall policy
uncertainty and go beyond the usual sovereign default risk at which emerging markets are typically
associated with (see for example Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe 2009), we complement our analysis
with data from the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). The ICRG reports several breaks
down for policy risk that capture the risk to global investors' returns due to unexpected changes
to central banks and governments' actions. Hence, we can take a granular approach to our "news"
based policy uncertainty (EPU) index. Examples of these risks are expropriation risk of foreign
investors, risks of profits repatriation and government accountability affecting market confidence. In
an extended analysis, we confirm our previous findings and show that these more narrowly-defined
policy risks are associated with increases in the interest rate differential and the UIP premium in
emerging markets. Importantly, once these policy risk variables are included into the analysis, the
correlation of capital inflows with the interest rate differential and the UIP premium disappears.
This result confirms that the UIP premium and the risk "priced" in the interest rate differential
capture the risk sentiment of foreign investors about policy uncertainty affecting their returns.
Finally, we show that, when removing from our sample countries that defaulted in the last fifty
years, our policy-risk variables do not lose significance. This result confirms that none of our policy
variables captures only default risk and, hence, their explanatory power on the UIP premium does
not go through default. As before, these policy-risk variables are not correlated with the UIP
premium in advanced economies.
    Overall, these facts show important differences across advanced countries' and emerging mar-
kets' investors that are captured by different expectations and reactions to idiosyncratic and global
uncertainty shocks. The UIP literature on advanced countries argued that, even if expected returns
are zero, actual realized returns are often not zero and such returns appear to be persistent and
volatile. A common interpretation in this empirical literature for such results is that there are
deviations from FIRE (full information and rational expectations).9 Another interpretation is that

predictability of realized excess returns as arising from FX markets inefficiencies due to financial
frictions. The extensive theory literature on UIP deviations focused on both interpretations, either
modeling deviations from FIRE à la information frictions, behavioral biases, and distorted beliefs,10
or adopting a financial frictions approach to limit the arbitrage.11 There are also papers that tend
to associate predictable excess returns and UIP deviations with risk averse investors participating
in efficient FX markets.12
    What is new in our paper in the context of this literature is the different behavior of investors
for different countries. In advanced countries, we show predictable excess returns and predictable
forecast errors given the systematic negative relation between the interest rate differentials and
expectational errors. At the same time, we show that emerging markets' case is quite different.
Since the same set of global investors invest in both countries and sets of currencies, this is a
puzzling result. We argue that even, if investors deviate from FIRE and make expectational errors
for both sets of currencies, the form of the error differs given the role of policy uncertainty related
risk premium in emerging markets.
    To shed more light on this issue, we investigate both average and dynamic behavior of forecast
errors. A negative Fama coefficient of 0.2 implies that, a 1 percentage point increase in the interest
rate differentials in advanced countries imply 20 percent appreciation, hence 80 percent predictable
excess returns. A positive Fama coefficient of 0.6 implies that, a similar 1 percentage point increase
in the interest rate differentials in emerging markets imply only 40 percent predictable excess re-
turns. Why would investors leave less on the table in emerging markets characterized by higher
degree of financial frictions? Why would the deviation from FIRE be worse in advanced coun-
tries? Dynamics of the forecast error reveals that investors over-react first in advanced countries,
expecting a depreciation and realizing an appreciation, but later they under-react, still expecting
a depreciation that is less than the actual depreciation. These patterns deliver the strong negative
correlation between the forecast errors and the interest rate differentials in advanced countries. In
emerging markets, on the other hand, investors always over-react by expecting a depreciation that
always exceeds the actual depreciation. On average, there is no systematic relation between the
interest rate differentials and the forecast errors since both expectations and reality move together
in emerging markets, even-though neither expected nor actual depreciation can offset the interest

rate differential shock fully. We show that the reason for this is the fact that policy uncertainty
drives interest rate shocks. As a result, we interpret the UIP premium for emerging markets as
an "inefficient" investment risk premium. This premium compensates for the policy uncertainty
of investing into these risky countries. Our findings indicate a significant effect of investors' risk
sentiments that co-move with policy uncertainty in pricing the risk of investing in emerging markets
over and above the expected and actual currency risk.
    The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data including the construction of
the EPU index based on news. Section 3 presents panel regressions and assesses the dynamics of
the UIP premium. Section 4 estimates dynamic panel regressions (local projections) and discusses
the overshooting and predictability reversal puzzles. Section 5 reports the Fama regressions and
discusses the classic UIP puzzle. Section 6 undertakes a granular analysis of country risk related
to policy uncertainty and credibility. Section 7 presents robustness including the role of inflation,
default risk and the difference between UIP and CIP deviations. Section 8 concludes.




2    Data and Measurement:
     Expectations, Risk Sentiments and News
We employ monthly data from International Monetary Fund (IMF), Bloomberg and Consensus
Economics to construct the UIP condition. We obtain the deposit interest rates, money market
rates and government bond rates from Bloomberg, the spot exchange rate from International Fi-
nancial Statistics (IFS) from the IMF, and the exchange rate forecasts data comes from Consensus
Economics. This survey provides information on expected exchange rate at 12-month horizon that
we use to construct the UIP at this maturity. We additionally conduct robustness tests for UIP at
3 months maturity. We employ the VIX index to proxy for global risk perception, which we obtain
from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We use standard capital flows data from IMF,
IFS. Following Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2020), we interpolate all capital flow series to monthly
frequency (see Appendix A.1 for details). For the Euro Area, we proceed as follows. We employ
individual series of interest rates, exchange rates and capital inflows for countries before they join
the Euro. After they join, we use Euro interest and exchange rates and consolidate inflows for the
Euro by adding individual country flows and weighting them by the GDP of each country ourselves
or using the Euro Area flows from IMF, IFS.
    To proxy for domestic policy uncertainty for each country, we employ two different methodolo-
gies. We first compute the EPU index for our sample following Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016).
This index is constructed by counting the number of journal articles containing words reflecting
economic policy uncertainty and, as such, is a good proxy for global investors' risk on government
and central bank policies. To narrow down the factors more relevant creating policy uncertainty,
we then complement our analysis with the ICRG, which ­as detailed below­ reports detailed infor-
mation of different components of policy risk for each country over time (for example, expropriation


                                                  8
risk, government accountability, etc.).
   Our panel is for 34 currencies, 12 advanced economies and 22 emerging markets, over the period
1996m11­2018m12, for which we have information for all variables to construct the UIP condition
and information about our policy risk variables. Our sample excludes country-month observations
when there is a fixed exchange rate regime based on the classification of Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and
Rogoff (2017), as in these cases the exchange rate does not move or covary with the interest rate by
construction. Appendix A discusses in detail the construction of the series and sample of countries.
   In the rest of this section, we discuss the characteristics of the Consensus Economics, EPU and
ICRG Risk Guide datasets and present main descriptive statistics of the UIP premium for advanced
economies and emerging markets.



Survey Data on Exchange Rate Expectations
Consensus Forecast conducts a monthly survey about expectations on future exchange rates at 1,
3, 12 and 24 months horizons of major participants in the foreign exchange rate market. Appendix
A.2 discusses thoroughly the details of this dataset. The coverage is extensive and includes 55
forecasters on average for advanced economies' currencies. Some currencies ­as the Euro, Japanese
Yen and UK Pound­ include more than a hundred of forecasters in several periods. Albeit with a
lower number of forecasters, the survey is also comprehensive in emerging markets and includes on
average 17 forecasters per currency.
   The forecasters interviewed are typically global banks and investors that actively participate in
the FX market. Notably, these global agents are present in both advanced economies and emerging
markets and, hence, provide together their forecasts for both sets of economies. Having the same set
of agents surveyed for both set of economies is important because it implies that different results
between advanced economies and emerging markets should not arise from heterogeneity in the
type of forecasters among these economies. To provide an example of the forecasters surveyed, in
September 2012, for the Japanese Yen (96 forecasters) these included: Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP
Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of Tokio Mitsubishi, IHS Global Insight, General Motors, ING Financial
Markets, Barclays Capital, and Morgan Stanley. These ten forecasters were also surveyed for the
Euro and the UK pound, which included a total of 103 and 81 forecasters that month. Forecasters
of emerging market currencies also included these group of global banks. For example, the main
forecasters of the Korean Won (22 forecasters) were: Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Citigroup,
Bank of Tokio Mitsubishi, IHS Global Insight, General Motors, ING Financial Markets. Similarly,
the Turkish Lira (28 forecasters) included the same list of forecasters. Other emerging market
currencies (as the Argentinean Peso, Brazilian Real, Chilean Peso, Colombian Peso, Hungarian
Forint, Indian Rupee, Malaysian Ringgit, Mexican Peso, Polish Zloty and Russian Rouble) also
included these forecasters, as well as other global investors like Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas,
ABN Amro, Allianz, Royal Bank of Canada, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland.13

Economic Policy Uncertainty and Policy Risk Variables
We construct the EPU index following the methodology of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016). In
particular, we use the online platform Factiva, which reports journal articles of main international
newspapers. Our list of words follows Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) to which we add four new
words to capture additional policy uncertainty characteristic of emerging markers (i.e. capital con-
trols, expropriation, nationalization and corruption). Because we are interested in the perspective
of the U.S. international investor, we focus on news reported in international newspapers (such
as Financial Times, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal, among others). We construct the EPU
                                                                              12

index for each currency and month as follows, EP Uit = Xit / 12                     Yt-j , where Xit is the number
                                                                             j =1
of articles referring to EPU episodes in country i at month t, Yt =                      i Yit   is the total number
of articles written at month t (i.e. the sum of articles across countries), and Yit is total number
of articles referring to country i at month t. We then normalize the index to 100 by estimating
                                                      T

                      × 100, where EP U i =       T         EP Uit is the average of EPU news for each coun-

try across time. Appendix A.3 reports the list of words and newspapers, as well as a detailed
description of the methodology employed to construct this index.14 , 15
    To narrow down our analysis of a country's policy risk and assess which risks affect the UIP
premium the most, we employ data from the ICRG. This dataset breaks down a country's policy
risk into several components and present individual index for each of them. In particular, we use
composite country risk using the ICRG composite risk index, which includes political, economic and
financial risks. Political risk contributes 50% to the composite index, and financial and economic
risks contribute to the remaining 50%. To pin down the main elements entailing policy risk, we focus
on two key elements of the political risk component that capture investors' sentiments: government
policy risk and confidence risk. Government policy risk captures expropriation risk, risk of not
being able to repatriate profits and government accountability, where this later evaluates different
types of democratic systems and the degree of freedom that a government has to impose policies to
its own advantage. Confidence risk assesses consumer confidence and unemployment (see Appendix
A.4 for more details).16


the forecasters as reported above, but we did not have access to their own individual forecast, rather the average
forecast at the country level.
    14
       Our methodology to construct the index follows Barrett, Appendino, Nguyen, and de Leon Miranda (2020) and
is an adaptation of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) for studies based on international newspapers, i.e. where there is
less availability of local newspapers. In particular, the difference with Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) is that their
index includes a non-minor proportion of local newspapers, which allows them to first compute the share of news
for each individual newspaper within a country and then add up the total sum for each country. Instead, Barrett,
Appendino, Nguyen, and de Leon Miranda (2020) methodology adds the total number of articles in a country and
pools all the newspapers together for each country.
    15
       We create the EPU and other policy risk variables for the Euro by computing the weighted average of the
respective index of each country, weighted by the country's GDP.
    16
       These two indexes come directly from the ICRG data. Our measure of government policy risk is the average of
the variables investment profile and democratic accountability, and our measure of confidence risk is the socioeconomic
risk variable. We pool investment profile and democratic accountability together as, despite both variables capture
different types of risk, they are highly correlated in data and, hence, collinear if used together econometrically.

Main Summary Statistics on the UIP Premium
We present main summary statistics of the UIP premium and its components of equation (1).
Confirming the eye-balling econometrics observation of Figure 1, columns 1 and 4 in Table 1 show
that there is a striking contrasts between advanced economies and emerging markets. While in
emerging markets there is a positive UIP premium that reaches ­ on average ­ 4 percentage points,
the UIP premium in advance economies is small and lower than 1 percentage point.
     The decomposition between the interest rate differential and the exchange rate adjustment
terms also confirms our previous finding of Figure 1. Columns 2 and 3 show that, in emerging
markets, the mean interest rate differential accounts for the bulk of the UIP premium, while the
exchange rate adjustment term is negligible. Instead, in advanced economies, the mean interest
rate differential and exchange rate adjustment terms are closed to each other, which is consistent
with a UIP premium being on average close to zero in these economies. In line with these figures,
the table also shows that the larger volatility of the UIP premium in emerging markets is princi-
pally explained by the higher volatility of the interest rate differential. In contrast, in advanced
economies, the volatility of the UIP premium is more related with exchange rate adjustments.17

3         The UIP Premium:
          The Role of Global and Local Uncertainty
In this section, we assess how changes in global investors' sentiment affect the UIP premium. Figure
2 above showed that the UIP premium varies substantially across time and that these fluctuations

are highly correlated with global uncertainty, captured by the VIX index. In this section, we go
beyond global uncertainty (VIX) and study whether the UIP premium correlates with local eco-
nomic policy uncertainty across countries and time.



3.1        Local Economic Policy Uncertainty
Do local risk factors affect global investors' sentiments and, by this means, the UIP premium?
Which component of the UIP premium do they affect more? Is there any difference between cur-
rencies of advanced economies and emerging markets? We approach these questions by comparing
the EPU index with the UIP premium across time for advanced economies and emerging markets.
Figure 3 plots these correlations. The co-movement between EPU index and the UIP premium
is rather small in advanced economies' currencies (2%). In contrast, this correlation is high in
emerging market currencies, reaching 50%. These correlations document suggestive evidence that
changes in global investors' sentiments due to local policy risk associate with the UIP deviations in
emerging markets. Yet these correlations pool all currencies together and, thus, can hinder hetero-
geneity across emerging market currencies. To control for this heterogeneity, in the next section, we
assess these correlations econometrically by estimating panel regressions with currency-fixed effects.

  Note: This figure shows the EPU and the UIP premium at 12 month horizon for 33 currencies ­21 emerging
  markets and 12 advanced economies­ over the period 1996m11:2018m12. The UIP premium is measured using

3.2        UIP Premium Panel Regressions:
           Interest Rate and Exchange Rate Disconnect
To assess the sources of the fluctuations of the UIP premium, we estimate panel regressions with
currency/country-fixed effects. Note that currency and country is the same as we treat Euro area

                                                                                     12
countries as a group. We study the effect of a global risk factor (VIX) and two local risk factors,
country-specific economic policy uncertainty and capital inflows. We then analyze how these risk
factors/channels affect each component of the UIP premium. More precisely, we estimate the
following panel regression:

            Yit = 1 log(Capital Inflows/GDPit-1 ) + 2 log(V IXt-1 ) + 3 EPUit-1 + µi + it ,        (2)

where i is currency/country, t is month, Yit is the UIP premium, the interest rate differential
term or the exchange rate adjustment term, i.e. Yit = {e
                                                       it+h , IR Diffit , ER Adjit+h }, and the
independent variables are lagged one month. µi are currency fixed effects that allow assessing the
UIP condition within currencies across time. We double cluster the standard errors across time and
country/currency. For expositional purposes, we introduce the independent variables sequentially.18
   Table 2 reports the results. Panel A shows the estimated coefficients of regression (2) in which
only capital inflows is included as a regressor. Capital inflows associate with decreases in the UIP
premium in emerging markets (column 1). As columns 2 and 3 show, this reduction is channeled
through a decrease in the interest rate differential. Capital inflows lower the local interest rate
and lead to an expected currency appreciation. Yet, the expected appreciation is not enough to
compensate for the lower interest rate differential and the UIP premium drops. The estimated
coefficient implies that one percentage point increase in capital inflows over GDP leads to a 0.5
percentage points decrease in the UIP premium. By the same token, a decrease in capital inflows
(or capital outflows by foreign investors) will lead to an increase in UIP premium. As the average
UIP premium is 4 percent in emerging markets, a change of 0.5 percentage points is an economically
significant effect. For comparison, we also show results for advanced countries, where capital inflows
do not significantly affect the UIP premium nor its components.
   In Panel B, we include the VIX as independent variable to assess the role of global risk per-
ception on the UIP premium. Both in advanced and emerging economies, the estimated coefficient
on the VIX variable is positive and highly statistically significant, suggesting that higher global
risk associates with higher UIP premia in both set of countries (columns 1 and 4). The estimated
coefficient for emerging economies implies that an increase in the VIX from p25 to p75 leads to
3 percentage points higher UIP premium. Another way to look at this coefficient is considering
the increase during the Global Financial Crisis. If the VIX increases as it did after the collapse
of Lehman Brothers (2008m8-2008m12) by 150%, the UIP premium in emerging markets would
increase by 9 percentage points. The increase in the UIP premium is slightly lower for advanced
economies: a rise from p25 to p75 associates with a 2.4 percentage points increase in the premium.
Lastly, it is worth remarking that global uncertainty has high explanatory power to account for
changes in the UIP premium, as the R2 increases significantly when including the VIX as a co-
variate in both set of economies.

-Fact 1: The UIP premium co-moves with global risk perception (VIX) for all currencies, whereas
only for emerging market currencies there is a negative comovement between the UIP premium and
capital inflows.


   We then assess the channels of transmission of global uncertainty. The VIX shock raises both
the interest rate differential and the exchange rate adjustment terms. Yet, there is an interesting
difference between emerging markets and advanced economies. In the former, increases in global
uncertainty affect the interest rate differential relatively more. It is then this larger expansion of the
domestic interest rate what accounts for the bulk of the increase in the UIP premium following VIX
shocks in emerging markets (columns 2 and 3 in Panel B). Instead, in advanced economies, the VIX
leads to larger expected changes in the exchange rate, which are the main source of raising the UIP
premium upon these shocks (columns 4 and 5 in Panel B). Notably, these results are in line with
our observation of Figure 2, where we showed that, in emerging markets, the main channel driving
the dynamics of the UIP premium was the interest rate differential and, in advanced economies,
this dynamics was mainly driven by exchange rate adjustments.


-Fact 2: Decomposing the UIP premium into two components--interest rate differentials and ex-
pected exchange rate adjustment--reveals that the channel of transmission of global risk perception
differs in emerging markets and advanced economies. In emerging markets, the comovement of
the UIP premium and the VIX is explained by the co-movement of the VIX with the interest rate
differentials. In advanced economies, this comovement is explained by the co-movement of the VIX
with expected exchange rate changes.


   Panel C adds economic policy uncertainty as independent variable. Confirming our earlier find-
ings for emerging markets, the estimated coefficient for the EPU variable is positive and highly
statistically significant, indicating that increases in a country's policy uncertainty associate with
higher a UIP premium (column 1). Importantly, once we include EPU variable into the regression,
capital inflows lose explanatory power to account for changes in the UIP premium. Interestingly,
the inclusion of the EPU index does not overpower the VIX coefficient ­ which remains similar in
magnitude and highly statistically significant ­ suggesting that both a country's policy risk and
global risk generate UIP violations and expected excess returns in emerging economies. The esti-
mated coefficient for emerging markets implies that if EPU risk increases from the p25 to p75 (for
example, from China to South Korea in the 2016m10), the UIP premium increases by 1 percentage
point. Columns 2 and 3 break down the channels of transmission of the higher domestic uncertainty.
As expected, an increase in a country's policy uncertainty raises the UIP premium mainly through
the interest rate differential channel, where capital inflows' effect on interest rate differential also
drops in size. Local policy uncertainty leads to expected depreciations, but this effect is smaller
in size than the interest rate differential and is not statistically different from zero. In line with
the patterns presented in Figure 3, local economic uncertainty does not affect the UIP premium in

advanced economies.


-Fact 3: Country risk measured by the degree of policy uncertainty can explain the comovement of
the UIP premium with interest rate differentials and with country-specific capital inflows in emerg-
ing markets. This is not the case in advanced economies.


   Our results on the impact of global uncertainty are consistent with the existing literature show-
ing that VIX shocks lead to a retrenchment of capital inflows by foreigners, increases in the do-
mestic interest rates and lead to currency depreciations (e.g. Forbes and Warnock 2012, Rey
2013, Giovanni, Kalemli-Ozcan, Ulu, and Baskaya 2019 and Miranda-Agrippino and Rey 2020).
Kalemli-Özcan (2019) shows that the increase in the short-term domestic interest rate comes from
the higher risk premium in emerging markets (and not from the higher monetary policy rate) due

                                                               15
to an increase in global investors' risk sentiments that also affects the UIP premium and playing a
key role in the international transmission. Our contribution is not only to show that the channel
of such international transmission of VIX shocks differs between advanced economies and emerging
markets, but also to explain why this is the case by documenting a direct link between interest rate
differentials and local economic policy uncertainty. Such uncertainty increases the UIP premium in
emerging markets, explaining the correlation between capital flows and the UIP premium. As such,
emerging markets different responses to global risk factors can be explained by the local economic
policy uncertainty that generates an "excessive" UIP premium in these economies.19 Hence, the
correlation between the UIP premium and capital flows in emerging markets ­absent in advanced
economies­ suggests that the UIP premium in emerging markets are "inefficient" as modeled by
Basu, Boz, Gopinath, Roch, and Unsal (2020).




4     Dynamics of the UIP Premium and Exchange Rates:
      The Role Policy Uncertainty Shocks
We now turn to analyze the dynamic response of the UIP premium and expected changes in ex-
change rate to a positive shock to interest rate differential. We will follow the overshooting/delayed
overshooting literatures and analyze these dynamics with impulse responses obtained through
Jorda-style local projections by running dynamic panel regressions.
    We first assess the well-known U-shaped dynamics of the exchange rates upon domestic inter-
est rate shocks (see Dornbusch 1976, Eichenbaum and Evans 1995, Bacchetta and van Wincoop
2010, and Bacchetta and van Wincoop 2019, among others). Known as the overshooting/delayed
overshooting puzzle, previous research has found that a positive shock to domestic interest rate,
increases the interest rate differentials and leads to an initial appreciation and then a delayed de-
preciation, producing a U-shaped dynamics for the realized exchange rates. Consistent with this
pattern, Engel (2016) shows that high interest rate currencies are not weak (risky) but strong (not
risky) as sum of all future excess returns are negative as a result of delayed but strong depreciations.
    Notice that this literature only focuses on advanced economies and uses realized exchange rates.
Differently than this literature, we will use expectations of the exchange rate, both for advanced
countries and emerging markets. We run OLS dynamic panel regressions (local projections), where
we regress expected exchange rate changes (ER) and UIP premium (that is expected excess returns,
), separately, on interest rate differential (IR) shocks. The literature undertakes a VAR analysis
assuming a global structure for the endogenous variables. The advantage of local projections is
to identify the responses without assuming such a structure.20 We also run an IV regression,

   19
      These results are consistent with Hassan, Schreger, Schwedeler, and Tahoun (2021) who using textual analysis
show that global investors' sentiments associate with capital outflows, and heterogeneous currency loadings on global
risk help explain the cross-country pattern of interest rates and currency risk premia.
   20
      See recent work by Plagborg-Møller and Wolf (2021) that shows that both methods produce equivalent impulse
responses.

instrumenting the shock to domestic interest rate with a rise in policy uncertainty (EPU).
   To identify the response of expected changes in the exchange rate to a one percentage point
shock to interest rate differential at time t in currency i, conditional on lagged values, we estimate

   se                          US        e                                  US
    it+h+k - sit+k = k (iit - it ) + k (sit+h+k-1 - sit+k-1 ) + k (iit-1 - it-1 ) + µi +     it+h+k ,   (3)

where the coefficient of interest is k and reports the response of expected exchange rate change
to interest rate differential shocks at k month ahead over a horizon of h. Similarly for the UIP
premium/expected excess returns (), we run the following with a similar interpretation for k :

              e                  US      e                      US
              it+h+k = k (iit - it ) + k it+h+k-1 + k (iit-1 - it-1 ) + µi +      it+h+k .              (4)

Figure 4 shows these impulse responses for emerging markets in Panel A and advanced economies
in Panel B. We plot the response of expected change in the exchange rate to one percentage point
interest rate differential shock on the left panel and the response of the UIP premium to the same
shock on the right panel. In contrast to the overshooting literature, we do not observe a U-shaped
dynamic, but rather an inverted-U-shaped one for emerging markets and no dynamics at all for
advanced countries. The exchange rate is expected to depreciate as a result of a positive shock to
the domestic interest rate in both set of countries. Since the extent of expected depreciation is less
than the one percentage point shock to IR, UIP fails in emerging markets, leading to expected excess
returns as shown in top right panel. Interestingly, expected excess returns is persistently positive
during the entire time, being still significant at month 20. Hence, even if the shock is transitory, UIP
deviations are persistent in emerging markets. In advanced countries, in contrast, one percentage
point shock to interest rate differentials is offset with a permanent expected depreciation in the
exchange rate of the same size as shown in Panel B of Figure 4. The right panel shows the resulting
zero expected excess returns in advanced countries.
   Why is there an inverted-U shaped response of expected change in the exchange rate and
persistent UIP deviations in emerging markets? Figure 5 answers this question. With an IR shock,
investors always expect a depreciation in emerging markets. This implies that the expectations in
the ER term above (se
                    it+h+k - sit+k ) increases on impact relative to current spot rate. As actual spot
exchange rate starts depreciating later, we have the ER term increasing first and then decreasing,
delivering the inverted-U shape dynamics. Similarly, UIP deviations/expected excess returns starts
positive and high and then goes down, as expected change in the exchange rate goes down with
actual depreciation. Since neither expected or actual depreciation can offset the IR shock, UIP
deviations stay positive and persistent over the entire horizon.
   To dig deeper, Figure 6 reports results of an IV regression, where we regress interest rate
differentials on policy uncertainty shocks first and then use residuals from this first stage in the
second stage for impulse responses of expected exchange rate changes and the UIP premium.
As we showed before, EPU index captures the changes in risk sentiments of foreign investors in
emerging markets. We confirm here with a strong first stage regression shown in Figure 7 that,

       only for emerging markets, shocks to policy uncertainty captured by increases in the EPU index are
       positively correlated with the interest rate differentials. This result suggests that domestic interest
       rates respond to risk appetite of foreign investors that increases with higher policy uncertainty.
       This can be due to two channels: domestic interest rates are higher due to increased risk premium
       as a result of higher policy uncertainty and/or monetary authority raises the policy rate as a result
       of lower risk appetite of foreign investors with higher policy uncertainty.21

             21
           Kalemli-Özcan (2019) shows that higher domestic interest rates as a result of uncertainty shocks/lower risk
       appetite of foreign investors are due to higher risk premium on emerging markets. Even though policy rates raise as

Figure 5: Response of Emerging Market Investors' Exchange Rate Expectations to
                                  an IR Shock
 Note: This figure shows the response of expected exchange rate to an interest rate differential shock at 12 month
horizon for 22 emerging markets' currencies over the period 1996m11:2018m12. Expected exchange rate is measured
     using Consensus Forecast surveys. The shaded area shows 95 percent confidence intervals, calculated using
                     Driskoll-Kraay standard errors with a bandwidth lag h + 1 for horizon h.


    IV regressions of Figure 6 show that, as a result of a shock to policy uncertainty (that will
lead to one percentage point IR shock), we still have the inverted-U shape response of expected
changes in the exchange rate and positive expected excess returns (UIP premium). The responses
are both dampened as the curves shift down. This is probably because a one-time exogenous policy
uncertainty shock will not have persistent effects without the endogenous response of interest rate
differentials to such a shock. As shown in the first stage regressions, the endogenous response of
interest rate differentials to the EPU shock is very significant and persistent for emerging markets,
creating the persistent excess returns and UIP deviations in the OLS regressions. The right panel
of 7 shows that there is no such response of interest rate differentials to shocks to policy uncertainty
in advanced economies, which is why we do not report the second stage regression for these countries.


-Fact 4: There are no overshooting and predictability reversal puzzles--for any currency--when
using exchange rate expectations to calculate the UIP premium. In emerging markets, a transitory
increase in interest rate differentials caused by a policy uncertainty shock leads to lower than required
expected depreciations, which creates persistent expected excess returns. In advanced economies, a
positive shock to interest rate differentials leads to a permanent expected depreciation that offsets
the shock.


    What about realized excess returns? We know that realized excess returns turn from positive to
negative for advanced countries (predictability reversal puzzle) and sum of them is negative (Engel

a response to the shock, monetary policy is ineffective and policy rates are disconnected from the market rates.

      5             The Fama Puzzle: Average UIP Premium
      A large literature assesses the validity of the UIP condition employing the so-called Fama regres-
      sions. In this section, we revisit this literature and analyze whether the UIP condition holds on
      average by estimating Fama and excess returns regressions using both ex-post realized and expecta-

                                                                  21
tional data on exchange rates. Section 5.1 presents the Fama and excess return regressions. Section
5.2 evaluates the source of the bias in the Fama regression. Section 5.3, we assess the forecast errors
and whether they relate to the deviations from the UIP condition.



5.1    Fama and Excess Return Regressions
From the pioneering works of Fama (1984) and Hansen and Hodrick (1980), the empirical interna-
tional macro and finance literature usually assumes that agents have full information and rational
expectations (FIRE) and tests the UIP condition using ex-post exchange rate.23 We first revisit
this literature and assess the UIP condition using realized exchange rate, and then release the FIRE
assumption and test it using expectational data.


Fama and Excess Return Regressions under FIRE
To assess the Fama regression, we estimate the following OLS panel regression


                                  sit+h - sit =  F (iit - iU S        F
                                                           t ) + µi + it+h .                                    (5)

where the superscript F denotes that equation (5) is computed using ex-post exchange rate (sit+h ).
If  F = 1, interest rate differentials and exchange rate changes offset each other and the UIP
condition holds on average under FIRE. If  F < 1, the depreciation is lower than implied by the
interest rate differential and there are ex-post excess returns. To test econometrically whether there
are predictable excess returns, we estimate the following regression

                                     F      F         US         F
                                     it+h = 1 (iit - it ) + µi + 1it+h ,                                        (6)

where F                                                                       F
      it+h denotes excess returns estimated using the realized exchange rate. 1 = 0 implies the
                                          F is statistically different from zero, there are predictable
absence of predictable excess returns. If 1
                                 F > 0 implies that the higher the interest rate differential, the
excess returns. In particular, a 1
higher the excess returns on currency i.24 In both equations, we cluster the standard errors by
currency and time.
    Panel A in Table 3 reports the results. Column 1 shows that, for advanced economies, the
Fama coefficient is negative ­albeit non-statistically significant­ suggesting that high interest rate
currencies tend to appreciate, instead of depreciate as implied by the UIP condition under FIRE. In
line with this result, column 3 presents the excess return regression and shows that excess returns
positively and significantly associate with interest rate differentials in these economies. Columns 2
and 4 report the results for emerging markets and indicate that, similarly, there are ex-post excess

   23
      Under the FIRE assumption, the expected exchange rate can be approximated with the ex-post exchange
rate. There can still be an error such that expected exchange rate is equal to the realized rate plus an error term
se
 t+1 = st+1 + t+1 . Importantly, the assumption is that, under FIRE, this error  is i.i.d. and uncorrelated with the
interest rate differential.

      Note that equations (5) and (6) are equivalent and that 1 = 1 -  F (see Appendix C for more details).

returns from investing in their currencies. Although the estimated coefficient of the Fama regres-
sion has the right sign (0.374) ­indicating that is high interest rate emerging market currencies
tend to depreciate as implied by the UIP­, it is statistically different from one. As the extent of
depreciation is not enough, column 4 confirms that interest rate differentials predict excess returns.


Fama and Excess Return Regressions using Expectational Data
As mentioned above, an important implication of the regressions estimated using realized exchange
rate is that they jointly test the UIP condition and FIRE. To disentangle these two, we now employ
expectational data on exchange rates and assess the UIP condition without imposing assumptions
on rationality and full information. In particular, we replace the right hand sides of regressions (5)
and (6) with se              e
              it+h - sit and it+h , respectively, and remove the superscript F .
    Panel B in Table 3 reports the results. Importantly, the coefficients for advanced economies
change substantially when considering subjective expectations. Column 1 shows that the coefficient
is positive and not statistically different from one, which implies that expected exchange rate
changes tend to offset changes in the interest rate differential, as the UIP condition implies. Along
these lines, the coefficient of the expected excess return regression is not statistically differently from
zero, indicating interest rate differentials do not longer predict expected excess returns (column 3
in Panel B). Interestingly, the R2 also increases to 27% suggesting that interest rate differentials
have a higher explanatory power to account for expected exchange rate changes. Columns 2 and
4 present the results for emerging markets. Remarkably, the UIP condition does not hold in these
economies when using survey data. The coefficient of the Fama regression (0.48) is still positive and
has the right sign, but it is statistically different from one. The presence of expected excess returns
is confirmed in column 4, which shows that larger interest rate differentials associate with higher
expected excess returns in emerging economies. It is interesting to note that the coefficient of the
Fama regression estimated with realized and survey data are close to each other, which suggests
that UIP violations cannot be entirely associated with failures to FIRE in these economies.
    This section presents two striking results regarding the UIP condition that we summarized visu-
ally in Figure 9, where we plot the expected (Panel A) and realized (Panel B) rate of depreciation on
the interest rate differentials for advanced economies and emerging markets.25 Importantly, these
two results indicate fundamental differences between advanced economies and emerging markets.
    The first result relates to advanced economies and shows that there is substantial difference
between imposing that agents have FIRE and allowing for subjective expectations. As shown in
Panel A of Figure 9, our group of forecasters expects that exchange rate changes offset interest
rate differentials, as the UIP condition implies. Yet, as shown in Panel B, these forecasts were
systematically wrong because advanced economies' currencies appreciated on average by 19%.                          26


   25
      Note that the slope of these regressions are equivalent to UIP regressions without currency fixed effects and,
hence, pooling currencies together.
   26
      This result confirms earlier studies, which find similar results using survey data for advanced economies (see for
example Froot and Frankel 1989 and Bussiere, Chinn, Ferrara, and Heipertz 2018). Our analysis extend these studies
and shows that this finding is not specific to a particular time period, group of developed economies or survey data,

    Our second result relates to the failure of the UIP condition in emerging markets. Given
our results for advanced economies, it is not surprising that the UIP condition also fails when
assuming FIRE in emerging markets. Yet, it is remarkable that, even when we allow for subjective
expectations, expected exchange rate changes do not offset changes in the interest rate differentials.
In fact, the slope of the expected and actual rate of depreciation on the interest rate differential is
very similar in emerging markets. This result indicates that failures to FIRE cannot fully account for
the violations of the UIP conditions in emerging markets (as it is the case for advanced economies).27
    These novel and striking results raise two important questions. First, what leads to UIP devi-
ations in emerging markets? Second, why do we observe larger deviations from FIRE in advanced
economies than in emerging markets? To dig deeper, in the next sections, we decompose the source
of the bias of the Fama regression and study the nature of forecast errors in both set of economies.




but a more general trend of advanced economies.
   27
      An alternative interpretation of why the UIP condition tends to hold when using survey data relies on surveys
implying risk-neutral expectations. This explanation could account for the different results that we obtain when using
realized and survey data in advanced economies, but they could not explain why the UIP condition tends to not hold
in emerging markets. If surveys imply risk neutral expectations, then the UIP condition ­using expectations­ should
hold for both advanced and emerging economies. As we show below, the different responses in advanced economies
and emerging markets can be related to policy uncertainty prevalent in these later.

5.2                                      Decomposing the Bias in the Fama Regression
To understand the source of the downward bias of the coefficient of the Fama regression, we follow
Froot and Frankel (1989) and decompose the bias arising from forecast errors and from a risk
premium. To assess this, note that the probability limit of the coefficient  F in equation (5) is

Equation (9) shows the bias of the Fama coefficient can be broken down into two terms: bRE and
bRP . The first term bRE represents the covariance between the forecast errors and the interest
rate differential, and captures whether agents make systematic errors in expectations. The Fama
coefficient would be biased downward if higher interest rate differentials lead agents to expect a
larger exchange rate change than the change observed ex-post in data. That is, whenever bRE > 0.
The second term bRP represents a risk premium and is determined by the volatility of the expected
excess return and its covariance with the expected exchange rate change. The Fama coefficient
would be downward biased ­ bRP > 0 ­ if there is a time-varying expected excess return and the
volatility of the excess return is higher than the comovement between the expected excess return
and the expected exchange rate change.
    We employ the survey data to compute bRE and bRP and quantify the two forces. Table 4
shows that the source of the bias differs significantly between advanced and emerging economies'
currencies. Column 1 in Panel A reports the results for the former and shows that the bRE term is
more than an order of magnitude higher than the bRP (1.619 vs -0.220). The larger bRE indicates
that systematic errors in expectations are the main source of downward bias of the Fama coefficient
in advanced economies.30 In contrast, in emerging markets, the bRP term is substantially larger
than the bRE term (0.520 vs 0.106), pointing that a time-varying risk premium is key in biasing
downwards the Fama coefficient (column 2).
    To understand the determinants of the bRE and bRP , we go one step further and break down their
components. Column 1 in Panel B shows that, in advanced economies, the bRE term is high because
the covariance of the forecast errors and the interest rate differentials is high (relative to the variance
of the interest rate differential). In contrast, the bRP term is relatively small because var(e
                                                                                              it+h )
and cov (se      e

different (column 2). The covariance of forecast errors with the interest rate differential is low and,
thus, a low bRE ; and the variance of the expected excess return is high and, thus, a high bRP .

confirms our earlier finding that interest rate differentials play a key role in accounting for UIP
violations in emerging markets.
   In the next sections, we assess econometrically these two different sources of UIP violations:
systematic forecast errors critically affecting advanced economies and a time-varying risk premium
predominant in emerging markets. In Section 5.3, we focus on forecast errors. In Section 6, we
analyze the nature of the risk premium in emerging market currencies and assess how it relates to
policy risk present in these economies.



5.3   Forecast Errors
The last sections provided suggestive evidence that systematic errors in expectations were the main
source of UIP deviations in advanced economies, but they played a less important role in emerging
markets. This result raises the ­paradoxical­ question of whether the failure of the full information
and rational expectation assumption is more important in advanced economies than in emerging
markets. In this section, we assess this question econometrically by studying average forecast errors
and their evolution across time.


-Average Forecast Errors
As shown by Froot and Frankel (1989), the term bRE in equation (9) can be computed by estimating


                                                                27
a regression of the forecast errors on the interest rate differential. This regression allows us to
assess whether the term bRE is statistically significantly different from zero and forecast errors are
systematically related to interest rate differentials, on average. We estimate


                                    sit+h - se               US
                                             it+h =  (iit - it ) + µi + 2it+h ,                                    (10)

where  is the negative of the term bRE in equation (9). Column 1 in Table 5 shows that the
coefficient for advanced economies is negative and highly statistically significant, confirming that
bRE can significantly explain the bias of the Fama coefficient  F in these economies. Remarkably,
the estimated coefficient for emerging markets ­reported in column 2­ is small and non-statistically
different from zero.

    The difference between both set of economies is striking: does it suggest that global investors
make systematic errors in expectations in advanced economies, but they do not in emerging mar-
kets? Furthermore, what does this result imply in terms of investors' over-/under- reactions to
interest rate differential shocks? To assess these questions, we turn now to analyze the evolution
of forecast errors across time.


-Evolution of Forecast Errors
To assess the above questions, we estimate

                             sit+h+k - se                  US
                                        it+h+k = k (iit - it ) + µi +                        it+h+k ,              (11)

where sit+h+k denotes realized exchange rate.31 Figure 10 plots the evolution of forecast errors
following increases in the interest rate differential (blue line) for advanced economies and emerging
markets (left and right panels, respectively). To dissect its determinants, we additionally plot the

projections as we did above in Section 4. The dynamic responses estimated with local projections are similar and

evolution of the realized exchange rate change (green line) and the expected exchange rate change
(red line).
             In advanced economies, forecast errors are negative in short term (before 30 months), but they
become positive in the medium term. This non-linear pattern implies that investors' expectations
over-react in the short-term and under-react in the medium term. More precisely, in the short-term,
investors expect a depreciation (as shown by the red line and implied by the UIP condition), but
the exchange rate appreciates ex-post (green line). Thus, investors' expectations over-react relative
to the ex-post realization of the exchange rate. In the medium term and, in line with the delayed
overshooting literature, the realized exchange rate depreciates and, importantly, this depreciation
exceeds investors' expected depreciation. A higher realized depreciation implies that forecast errors
flip sign (becoming positive) and investors' expectations under-react with respect to the observed
realization. Put it differently, as highlighted by Candian and De Leo (2021), the negative forecast
errors first and positive errors later imply that investors expect that, in the short term, the currency
loses more value than what actually happens ex-post (undervaluation) and, in the medium term,
gains more value (overvaluation).

Figure 10: Forecast Error Responses to an Interest Rate Differential Shock (OLS)
   Note: This figure shows the response of realized exchange rate changes, expected exchange rate changes and
    forecast errors to an interest rate differential shock for 34 currencies ­22 emerging markets and 12 advanced
 economies­ over the period 1996m11:2018m12. Forecast errors and expected exchange rate changes are measured
                                            using Consensus Forecast surveys.


             Remarkably, in emerging markets, forecast errors are negative both in the short and medium
term. This negative sign implies that global investors over-react to increases in the interest rate
differential and always expect a depreciation higher than its ex-post realization. In particular, in
the short term, increases in the interest rate differential lead to ex-post depreciations but, since
investors expect a higher depreciation, forecast errors are negative. In the medium term, the
exchange rate appreciates ex-post, but investors still expect a depreciation. In other words, in
emerging markets, investors over-react to increases in the interest rate differential and expect that


                                                                              29
the local currency always losses more value than what occurs ex-post in data.32
    A natural question to ask is: why global investors always over-react emerging markets? As
argued in Section 4, this pattern relates to policy uncertainty shocks prevalent in these economies.
As shown before, global investors' expected depreciation following interest rate differential shocks
is driven by increases in policy risk. Policy uncertainty increases global investors' investment risk,
which translates into an increase in the interest rate differential and, in turn, into an expected
depreciation. More uncertain returns of foreign investment induce investors to over-react to the
initial shock and expect a larger depreciation than otherwise observed in data.


-Fact 5 (part 1): The classical Fama puzzle disappears in advanced economies in expectations, but
it remains for emerging markets. As a result, while global investors expect zero excess returns and
earn actual positive returns in the short run and negative returns in the long run by investing in
advanced country currencies, the same global investors expect and earn positive excess returns over
the entire horizon from emerging market currencies. The forecast errors in advanced countries are
systematic as they are strongly negatively correlated with the interest rate differentials on average,
where investors first over-react expecting a depreciation when there is ex-post appreciation, and they
under-react later expecting a depreciation that is lower than the actual depreciation. In emerging
countries, on the other hand, although there are forecast errors, they are not systematically corre-
lated with the interest rate differential. The same global investors always over-react in emerging
markets, expecting a depreciation larger than ex-post depreciation. Hence, expected and actual ex-
change rate move together.


Discussion of results
Results presented in this section report different patterns between advanced economies and emerg-
ing markets. In advanced economies, the UIP condition does not hold on average when considering
realized exchange rate changes, but it holds when considering subjective expectations. This indi-
cates that failures to FIRE are a key force explaining UIP deviations in these economies. Along
this line, we found that global investors make systematic errors in expectations, where their ex-
pectations over-react at the onset of interest rate shocks and under-react in the medium term.
These findings provide additional support to the literature documenting that failures to FIRE can
explain UIP violations in advanced economies (e.g. Froot and Frankel 1989, Chinn and Frankel
2016, Bussiere, Chinn, Ferrara, and Heipertz 2018, among others) and that investors expect a
higher undervaluation of the currency first and a higher overvaluation later than what actually
occurs ex-post (Candian and De Leo 2021). Our paper put these two findings together in a unified
analysis and shows that both empirical regularities are consistent with one another. Furthermore,
we extend these results for a larger set of advanced countries and years, and document ­for the
first time­ a contrasting pattern in emerging markets.
   32
      It is worth noting that the estimated coefficients reported in Table 5 are explained by the patterns observed in
the short term.


                                                         30
     In emerging economies, the UIP does not hold either when using realized and expected exchange
rates. This finding raises two puzzling questions. First, does this mean that global investors have
failure to FIRE in advanced economies and not in emerging markets? Second, what explains the
failure of the UIP in emerging markets? To answer the first question, we studied forecast errors
and showed that global investors present failures to FIRE in emerging markets as well. The dif-
ference is that global investors always over-react to interest rate differential shocks and expect a
higher depreciation than what is realized ex-post in data. This differential response arises from the
nature of shocks in emerging markets. In these economies, policy uncertainty shocks lead global
investors to consistently expect that the local currency will lose value in time. To answer the second
question, in the next section, we reassess the drivers of the UIP premium in emerging markets by
digging deeper into the determinants of the EPU index, which ­as shown above­ is a significant
determinant of the UIP premium in these countries.




6        UIP Premium in Emerging Markets: The Role of Policy Risk
Results in the previous sections indicate that the failure of the UIP condition for emerging market
currencies relates to the presence of a time-varying risk premium that associates with global risk
perception and country-specific policy uncertainty. In this section, we go deeper in our analysis
of local policy uncertainty and ask about its main determinants. With this end, we employ three
additional variables reflecting policy uncertainty. A first variable is broadly defined as a composite
country risk that captures political, economics and financial risks in a country. Political risk is the
main component of this variable and weights for 50% of the index. To unpack the determinants of
policy risk, we focus on two key variables used in the construction of the political risk component:
government policy risk and confidence risk. As described in Section 2 and Appendix A.4, govern-
ment policy risk proxies expropriation risk and how democratic and accountable a government is,
and confidence risk captures socio-economic conditions that could affect a government's ability to
implement policies (such as consumer confidence and poverty). These three variables ­composite,
government policy and confidence risks­ capture then the risk to global investors' returns due to
unexpected government actions.33
     We then employ these variables to revisit our main findings above. We start by presenting
the correlation of these variables with the UIP premium. We then reassess the relevance of these
variables in our panel regressions. Finally, we revisit the UIP puzzle and evaluate whether these
variables can help explaining the risk-premium in emerging market currencies and, hence, the down-
ward bias in the Fama coefficient.
    33
      The ICRG further decompose political risk into other sub-components, such as corruption, law and order,
bureaucracy quality, internal and external conflicts, among others. These sub-components capture elements of political
risk that are not significantly related to foreign investors' risk sentiments about unexpected changes in government
policies that can affect their investment returns. In Appendix A.4, we detail thoroughly all these sub-components
and show that the correlation with the UIP premium in emerging markets has usually the wrong (negative) sign and
is low (likely due to the low time-series variation of these sub-components).


                                                         31
Comovement of UIP Premium and Policy Risk Variables
A first glance at the data confirms that the UIP premium highly comoves with the composite risk
in emerging markets. The left graph of Panel A in Figure 11 plots the average composite risk
index (gray-dashed line) and UIP premium (black line) for emerging markets. Notably, these two
lines track each other very closely and their comovement reaches 58%. The higher is the country's
composite risk, the higher is the UIP premium on its currency. Interestingly, the correlation has
the opposite sign and is smaller for advanced economies (-24%) (right graph).
   In Panel B, we plot the correlation of the composite risk index with the two components of
the UIP premium, namely the interest rate differential and exchange rate adjustment. Confirming
our previous findings, in emerging markets, the composite risk highly correlates with the interest
rate differential (76%) and this correlation is much higher than the negative correlation with the
exchange rate adjustment (-45%). This higher correlation with the interest rate differential is
interesting because ­in line with our earlier findings­, it suggests the presence of excess returns
associated with a country-specific composite risk for emerging market currencies. As expected, these
correlations for advanced economies are much smaller and the comovement of the two components
of the UIP premium and the composite risk offset each other.
   To unpack the elements implied in the composite risk and affecting foreign investors' sentiments
on emerging market currencies, we plot in Figure 12 the comovement of the UIP premium with
the two main components of policy risk. The left graph plots the correlation with the government
policy risk and shows that uncertainty about government policies highly and positively correlates
the UIP premium (28%). Similarly, low confidence highly associates with increases in the UIP
premium on emerging markets (62%).
   These patterns in data provide suggestive evidence that country-idiosyncratic policy uncertainty
could be at the origin of the UIP premium and excess returns on emerging markets' currencies. We
turn now to test this econometrically.




Panel Regressions
To assess the correlation of policy risk and the UIP premium in emerging markets, we restimate
regression (2) by replacing the EPU with the composite, government policy and confidence risk
indexes.
   Table 6 presents the results. Column 1 shows that the estimated coefficient for the composite
risk index is positive and highly statistically significant indicating that increases in a country-
specific risk associates with a higher UIP premium on its currency. This coefficient implies that
if composite risk increases from the p25 to p75 (from Chile to Russia in the 2016m6), the UIP
premium increases by 4 percentage points. As above, columns 2 and 3 show that the channel

  Note: This figure shows the correlation of composite risk with the UIP premium and UIP decomposition at 12
      month horizon for 34 currencies ­22 emerging markets and 12 advanced economies­ over the period
1996m11:2018m12. The UIP premium and expected exchange rate changes are measured using Consensus Forecast

of transmission of a composite risk shock is the increase in the interest rate differential. Higher
composite risk increases the interest rate differential and leads to an expected depreciation but,
because the increase in the domestic interest rate is larger, the UIP premium increases. It is worth
noting that the composite risk does not overpower the VIX coefficient ­ which remains similar in
magnitude and highly statistically significant ­, but it overpowers capital inflows.
        Columns 4-6 presents the results for the two components of political risk. Column 4 shows
that increases in government policy risk associates higher UIP premium and column 5 confirms a
similar correlation for confidence risk. Importantly, column 6 includes both variables together and

              Figure 12: Government Policy and Confidence Risks in Emerging Markets
  Note: This figure shows the correlation of between the Government Policy and Confidence Risks with the UIP
  premium at 12 month horizon for 22 emerging markets' currencies over the period 1996m11:2018m12. The UIP
                            premium is measured using Consensus Forecast surveys.


shows that both variables remain positive and highly statistically significant. Furthermore, both
coefficients remain similar in size as those estimated in columns 4 and 5, which indicates that both
variables are capturing different policy risks. Finally, it is worth remarking on the R2 of these
regressions, which reaches almost 17% and is close in size to the 19% observed for the composite
index (column 1) and 17% captured in the EPU index (column 1, Panel C in Table 2). This similar
value of the R2 indicates that the policy uncertainty captured by the EPU and the composite
indexes is highly related to these two narrowly-defined measures of policy risk that capture the
confidence on in emerging markets' government policies.
         These results indicate that both sources of policy risk for foreign investors' returns ­namely
government policies, restricting profit repatriation and creating expropriation risk, and confidence
risk, affecting a government's ability to implement policies­ are key to explain the times-series vari-
ation of the UIP premium on emerging markets' currencies. Importantly, when policy risk variables
are included into the regression, capital inflows lose significance, as before, showing that the impact
of capital inflows on the UIP premium in emerging markets is actually capturing the risk perceived
by foreign investors of investing in these currencies.



The Fama Puzzle Revisited
Section 5 showed that the downward bias of the Fama coefficient in emerging markets was related
to the presence of a risk premium on these currencies. In this section, we evaluate whether this
risk premium and, thus, the bias of the Fama coefficient associates with country-specific policy
uncertainty.
         To evaluate the impact of policy risk on the downward bias of the Fama coefficient, we need

to evaluate how a country's policy risk affects the risk premium and Fama coefficient across time.
This implies obtaining a currency-specific and time-varying risk premium and Fama coefficient,
and assessing their correlation with a country's policy risk. With this end, we estimate the Fama
regression for each currency in non-overlapping 18-months rolling windows, and obtain a currency
i- and window j -specific Fama coefficient, ij . More precisely, we estimate

where j denotes a non-ovelapping rolling window and t is the monthly variation within this window
with a 12-month horizon expectation denoted with h. Under subjective expectations, the risk
premium has a one-to-one mapping with the Fama coefficient. More precisely, the probability limit
of ij is:34

                     plim^ij = 1 - bij,RP                  and             bij,RP =                                                             (13)
                                                                                                var(IRij )

where var(e           e    e
          ij ), cov (sij , ij ) and var (IRij ) are calculated across months within window j for each
currency i. As such, the Fama coefficient estimated using survey data is equal to one minus the
risk premium (i.e. plim^ij = 1 - bijRP ).35

   34
      For expositional simplicity, we removed the time horizon subscript h and note that all our estimates are considered
at 12-month horizon.
   35
      Using survey data to estimate equation (12) eliminates the term bRE , as the regression already considers sub-


                                                                         35
    To assess the relationship between policy risk and the Fama coefficient, we estimate the following
pooled OLS regression:
                                       ^ij = 2 + 3 policy risk + ij ,
                                                                                                                (14)
                                                              ij

where ^ij is the Fama coefficient estimated in regression (12) and policy risk is the mean of policy
                                                                              ij
risk in currency i and window j for each of our policy risk variables. The coefficient 3 captures
the change in the Fama coefficient associated with a change in the policy risk. We then replace
the right hand side of equation (14) with bij,RP and evaluate the correlation between risk premium
and policy risk. This correlation should have the opposite sign than the correlation between policy
risk and the Fama coefficient. In both regressions (12) and (14), we cluster the standard errors by
country.36
    Panel A in Table 7 presents the results for the Fama coefficient. The result for composite risk
is presented in column 1. The estimated coefficient is negative and indicates that an increase in a
country's composite risk associates with a contemporaneous decrease in the Fama coefficient. The
estimated coefficient implies that if the composite risk increases from the p25 to p75 (from Poland
to India in the window 2001m5 to 2002m10) the Fama coefficient would decrease 0.31 percentage
points. In columns 2 and 3, we unpack the composite risk in its two components: government
policy risk and confidence risk. Both risk are negatively correlated with the Fama coefficient, but
only government policy risk is statistically significant.
    In columns 4 and 5, we go one step further and break down government policy risk in its two
sub-components: anti-democratic risk and expropriation risk. Anti-democratic risk captures the
level of autocracy of the government and, thus, the degree of freedom that a government has to
impose policies to its own advantage. Expropriation risk captures the risk of expropriation, the risk
of limiting or banning foreign investors' profits repatriation and payment delays.37 Interestingly,
both anti-democratic risk and expropriation risk are negative and statistically significant, pointing
to a downward bias in the Fama coefficient.
    For completeness, Panel B presents the regressions estimated using the risk premium as bij,RP
dependent variable. The estimated coefficients for composite, government policy, anti-democratic
and expropriation risks are all positive and statistically significant, indicating that higher uncer-
tainty on emerging markets' government policies associate with increases in the risk premium which
­in turn­ downward bias the Fama coefficient.38


-Fact 5 (continuation): In emerging markets, excess returns compensate for the policy uncertainty
affecting foreign investors' risk sentiments.

jective expectations. See Appendix D for a derivation of this relationship.
   36
      We only cluster the standard errors by country, because there is not enough observations across windows to
cluster by time. Note that there are only 13 windows in the sample.
   37
      More precisely, the anti-democratic risk corresponds to the "democratic accountability" variable and expropria-
tion risk corresponds to the "investment profile" in the ICRG dataset.
   38
      In Figure B.1, we come back to the dynamics of the UIP premium and show that anti-democratic risk and
expropriation risk are substantlly correlated with the UIP in emerging markets.

    Lastly, in Appendix E, we conduct a decomposition exercise to assess the channels through
which policy risk creates a downward bias the Fama coefficient. In line with the analysis of the pre-
vious sections, we find that increases in country-specific policy risk are channelled through higher
interest rate differential and, hence, policy risk is "priced-in" the interest rate term. More pre-
cisely, our econometric results indicate that both composite and government policy risks associate
with increases in the volatility of the interest rate differential (var(IRij )), which ­in turn­ raises
the volatility of the UIP premium (var(e
                                       ij )) and, by this mean, downward bias the Fama coefficient.




7    Robustness Tests
In this section, we present several robustness tests, such as controlling for inflation rates, default
risk, assessing the difference of the UIP with the Covered Interest Rate Parity (CIP) condition,
re-estimating regressions with an unbalanced panel, and computing the rolling windows of Section
6 with different lengths.


-Controlling for inflation differentials


    A main concern of the analysis is that high interest rate currencies might correlate with high
inflation rates and, thus, the UIP premium observed in nominal term might vanished in real terms.
To assess this, we re-estimate our panel regressions in equation (2) and add inflation differentials


                                                                       37
as a control. As Table 8, shows, all our results hold true when including inflation differential as a
control. Importantly, the size of the estimated coefficients is very similar to our main estimation
in Table 2, indicating that inflation differentials do not significantly affect the importance of the
EPU and local policy risk variables driving the UIP premium. Several other robustness including
doing the dynamic UIP figures with real UIP deliver the same conclusion.

-Comparing CIP and UIP Deviations


   An influential recent literature, mostly focusing on advanced countries, documented a link
between CIP deviations, global risk perception, financial frictions and USD exchange rates (e.g Du,
Tepper, and Verdelhan 2018, Jiang, Krishnamurthy, and Lustig 2021 and Avdjiev, Du, Koch, and
Shin 2019). In this section, we document that UIP deviations are much larger than CIP deviations
and also have a low correlation with each other over time. Calculating CIP deviations for emerging
markets is much harder given the limited data on hedging, swaps and forwards.
   Going back to our UIP deviation in equation (1), CIP deviation can be written as:


                                               CIP          US
                                               t+h = (it - it ) + (st - ft+h ),                                                        (15)

where ft+h denotes the forward rate. We measure it and iU
                                                        t
                                                          S using either interbank rates (IBOR) or

deposit rates depending on the specification. Both rates come from Bloomberg to follow closely Du,
Tepper, and Verdelhan (2018). To measure st we resort to the International Financial Statistics
(IFS) database and use monthly average spot exchange rates. Finally, to measure ft+h we use
forward rates also available at Bloomberg.


                                                                    38
                  We start following Du and Schreger (2021) (DS) analysis and use their data to plot their CIP
deviations against ours in their sample of 15 emerging markets and 11 advanced countries.39 Figure
13 shows that both series are very highly correlated. It is interesting to note that CIP deviations
in emerging markets are 10 times larger than the ones in advanced countries. Next, we plot ­in

Figure 13: CIP Comparison: Kalemli-Ozcan and Varela (KOV) vs. Du and Schreger
                                      (DS)
      Note: This figure shows CIP comparison in a sample that restrict observations to be the same at date-country
                        pairs in DS and our data. Both series use money market interbank rates.

                  Finally, we plot our CIP and UIP deviations in our larger sample in Figure 15, though we calcu-
late CIP deviations using interbank rates, following Du and Schreger (2021), and then we plot both
deviations in our larger sample using deposit rates for both in Figure 16. These figures show that,
regardless of the interest rates used, UIP and CIP deviations have a very low correlation with each
other over time and sometimes with the wrong sign. Even they might both capture similar time
varying risk premium in interest rate differentials, the difference between forward and spot rates
is much larger than the difference between expected exchange rates and spot rates, hence those
interest rate differentials are mostly offset in CIP deviations, rendering these deviations small. No-
tice that the correlation between UIP and CIP deviations is at best around 30 percent (highest) in
emerging markets even when we used same deposit rates to calculate interest rate differentials for
both.


-Additional Robustness Tests


                  We further conduct three additional tests. First, to make sure that our results are not driven
by any defaulters, we drop from the sample Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico,

         Note: This figure shows CIP and UIP deviations using our data. We use money market interbank rates to
                               construct CIP, while we use deposit rates to construct UIP.


Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, which are the countries in our
sample that defaulted "at some moment" over the last fifty years. Our results are similar and as
strong without including these defaulter countries, as shown in the Table 9.
         Second, to make sure that results are not driven by sample selection, we re-estimate these
regressions for an unbalanced panel of 34 advanced and emerging economies.40 Results reported
­ in Table B.2 in Appendix B ­ confirm the failure of the UIP condition for both advanced and

     Recall that our balanced sample consists on countries for which we have observations for all variables to compute
the Fama and excess return regressions and the composite risk. In the unbalanced panel, we still exclude fixed pegs.

using survey data.
      Finally, to assess whether our analysis on the channel creating a downward bias in the Fama
coefficient in Section 6 is not driven by the length of the window with which we estimate the  coef-
ficient and bRP term, we re-compute these variables for 12-months and 24-months rolling windows
and show in Tables B.3 and B.4 in Appendix B that our results hold true for these different windows.

8    Conclusion
We document five novel facts about Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) deviations vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar for 34 currencies of advanced economies and emerging markets. We use exchange rate expec-
tations from survey data to calculate the empirical counterpart of the theoretical UIP condition.
    The UIP premium co-moves with global risk perception (VIX) for all currencies, whereas only
for emerging market currencies there is a negative comovement between the UIP premium and
capital inflows. The factors behind these comovements differ across two sets of countries: the
comovement of the UIP premium and the VIX is explained by changes in interest rate differentials
in emerging markets, and by expected changes in exchange rates in advanced countries. The
comovement between the UIP premium and capital flows in emerging markets is explained by
local policy uncertainty. Upon conditioning on this factor, the UIP premium in emerging markets
becomes entirely explained by the VIX and policy uncertainty with no role for capital inflows.
There are no overshooting and predictability reversal puzzles, neither for emerging markets or
advanced countries, when using exchange rate expectations to calculate the UIP premium. In
emerging markets, a transitory increase in interest rate differentials caused by a policy uncertainty
shock leads to lower than required expected depreciations over the entire horizon, which creates
persistent expected excess returns. In advanced economies, a shock to interest rate differentials
leads to a permanent expected depreciation that exactly offsets the shock. Consistent with these
dynamic facts, the classical Fama puzzle disappears in advanced economies in expectations, but it
remains for emerging markets.
    Our results show that, while global investors expect zero excess returns and earn actual positive
and negative returns by investing in advanced country currencies, the same global investors expect
and always earn positive excess returns from emerging market currencies. While the expectational
errors are predictable by the interest rate differential in advanced countries, they are not in emerging
markets; rather the fact that expected depreciation is always more than the actual depreciation in
emerging markets, where neither can offset the interest rate differentials is explained by degree of
policy uncertainty. As a result, our interpretation is such that, in emerging markets' UIP premium
arises from investors charging an "excess" risk premium to compensate for such policy uncertainty
--a premium that is over and above the expected and actual depreciation of these currencies.
    Overall, our results have important policy implications. UIP premia constitute the cost of local
currency financing relative to foreign currency financing for emerging markets. The fact that such
financing costs are high on average and they increase even more during crisis times represents an
important new avenue for emerging market monetary and financial policies. There is a recent the-
ory literature suggesting the importance of UIP premium for policy making. Basu, Boz, Gopinath,
Roch, and Unsal (2020), in particular, show a key role in smoothing out the UIP premium in the
face of risk-on/risk-off shocks to attain optimal policies that maximize welfare in emerging markets.
Drenik, Perez, and Kirpalani (2021) develop a model, where policy risk determines the domestic
interest rate and, in turn, the endogenous currency choice of borrowing. Understanding the re-
sponse of UIP premium to shocks and country-specific risks and policies seems to be first order

                                                  42
in understanding capital flows related spillovers to emerging markets from advanced countries and
hence designing the appropriate policies to deal with such spillovers.

Appendix A             Data
In this section, we first present in detail the source of the data used in this paper and the construction
of the individual series. We then provide further details about the Consensus Forecast data on
exchange rate expectations.

Appendix A.1         Source of Data and Construction of Individual Series
Table A1 lists variables that we employ in this paper. We obtain spot exchange rate from IMF
International Financial Statistics (IFS). IFS provides both period end and period average of daily
exchange rates for monthly, quarterly, and yearly frequency.
   We collect market interest rates (treasury bill, money market, and deposit rate) from the
Bloomberg terminal. We choose interbank offered rate as a money market rate. For a given
country and an interest rate, there are various tickers in Bloomberg. We choose the most reliable
and long-spanning ticker after checking whether interest rates are in annual percentage rate with
the same maturity and denominated in local currency. Interest rates are with maturities of 1, 3,
and 12 months in the dataset. As Bloomberg provides daily values for most series, we can get both
period end and period average for monthly, quarterly, and yearly frequency. When interest rates
are missing from Bloomberg, we obtain data from IMF IFS. Though IFS usually gives interest
rates with mixed maturities, some series are with fixed maturity. We refer to country notes of IFS
database to check whether the interest rate is of the same maturity, denominated in local currency
and calculated as period end or average of daily values. If the series has the same characteristics
in all these criteria, we add that series to our database. For some interest rate series, only period
end of period average data is available.
   Exchange rate forecasts are available only at the end of period. Consensus forecast (mean
average) at 1 month, 3 months, 12 months, and 24 months from the survey date. More precisely,
the survey form which is usually received on the Survey Date (often the second Monday of the
survey month), requests forecasts at the end of the month at 1 month, 3 months, 12 months and
24 months. Thus the forecast periods may be slightly longer than these monthly horizons.
   Capital inflows by sector (banks, sovereigns, and corporates) are obtained directly from Avdjiev,
Hardy, Kalemli-Özcan, and Servén (2018). Capital inflows are available at quarterly and yearly
frequency. Aggregate variables including GDP and current account are downloaded from IMF IFS.
For real and nominal GDP and industrial production, we get both non-seasonally-adjusted and
seasonally-adjusted data.
   Forward rates come from Bloomberg. After downloading forward rates, we convert data into
unit of local currency per US dollar. Daily forward rates are available. We download monthly,
quarterly, and yearly data for both period end and average of daily values . We get exchange
rate forecasts from Consensus Economics. We convert forecasts into local currency per US dollar
forecasts using appropriate currency forecasts. We get Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI
global) from J.P. Morgan. We employ the exchange rate regime classification by Ilzetzki, Reinhart,


                                                   48
and Rogoff (2017) to exclude countries with fixed exchange rate regimes.
    We proxy global risk with the VIX, which is obtained from Federal Reserve Economic Data
(FRED). We obtain detailed information about policy risk from the International Country Risk
Guide (ICRG). The International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) rating comprises 22 variables in
three subcategories of risk: political, financial, and economic. We normalize these risk indices x
using the following formula: -(x - µx )/x where µx is the mean and x is the standard deviation
of a variable x in a full sample. We add the minus sign so that higher normalized indices mean
higher risk.
Our sample consists of 12 currencies of advanced economies and 22 of emerging markets over
the period 1996m11 and 2018m12. Table A2 presents the sample of countries and Table A3 the
summary statistics of the main variables used in this paper.

Interest Rates for UIP Calculation
We obtain interest rates to calculate the UIP deviations as follows. First, we replace deposit rates
with money market rates of the same maturity if the data coverage for deposit rates is shorter
than 5 years in a given country. If the data coverage for market rates is shorter than 5 years in
a given country, we replace deposit rates with government bond rates of the same maturity in a
given country. Table A4 shows country-year observations of deposit rates that are replaced with
money market rates or government bond rates.

Interpolation of Quarterly Capital Flows
We interpolate quarterly capital flows to get monthly flows using a cubic spline built in Stata. More
precisely, we use the following Stata command: by id: mipolate `var' date , gen(`var'i) spline, where
id is country group, `var' is flows data, and date is a variable denoting months. The interpolated
flows are generated with a variable name `var'i. This Stata module can be installed by using the
command ssc install mipolate. Before running this command, quarterly flows are imported into the
median month of each quarter. For example, the first quarter flows are imported into February,
which is the median month of the first quarter. Then, the command fills remaining empty months
with a cubic spline interpolation.
   We plot averages of raw data and interpolated data across advanced economies and emerging
markets in Figure A1. We plot both raw quarterly flows (blue solid line with diamond labels) and
monthly flows interpolated using raw quarterly flows (red solid line). We find that interpolated
monthly flows closely track raw quarterly flows with small deviations (the correlation between these
two series is 0.99).

Appendix A.2        Consensus Forecasts
This section provides additional descriptive statistics about the Consensus Forecasts database.
Table A5 presents the average number of forecasters per year for currencies of advanced economies
and emerging markets, separately. As shown in this table, the number of forecasters surveyed is
vast in both set of economies, albeit it is smaller in emerging markets. Table A6 reports the average
number of forecasters for each country across time.

   Table A7 presents examples of the main forecasters for the Euro, Yen, UK Pound, Korean Won,
Turkish Lira and other emerging markets in September 2012. This table shows that the forecasters
surveyed for emerging markets' currencies were also top forecasters in advanced economies. It is
worth mentioning that our database does not provide information on individual forecast series and
does not indicate which forecasters were surveyed. We collect this information from printed monthly
reports created by Consensus Forecasts. These reports provide some examples of forecasters for
main currencies, but they do not provide a complete list of forecasters for each currency. As such,
the information about individual foresters in Table A7 is only illustrative. For this reason, the
empty cells in Table A7 indicate the absence of information about whether the forecaster was
surveyed for that currency and, hence, they do not indicate that the forecaster was not surveyed
for that currency. It could easily be the case that the forecaster was also surveyed, but we do not
know it.

Appendix A.3                Economic Policy Uncertainty Index
We construct the EPU index following the methodology of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016). In
particular, we use the online platform Factiva, which reports journal articles of main international
newspapers. We employ the same search procedure as Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016). Our list
of words contains 218 words and follows closely theirs. Since Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) list
of words is mostly conceived for advanced economies, we include four additional words to better
capture policy uncertainty characteristics in emerging markers (i.e. capital controls, expropriation,
nationalization and corruption). We report below the list of words used in this paper.
    Because we are interested in the perspective of the U.S. international investor, we focus on
news reported in international newspapers (see below the complete list of newspapers). Given the
lower availability of international newspapers, we follow the methodology of Barrett, Appendino,
Nguyen, and de Leon Miranda (2020) to construct our EPU index. This methodology adds total
number of articles in a country and pools all the newspapers together for each country.41 More
precisely, define Xit the number of articles referring to EPU episodes in country i at time t, Yit
total number of articles referring to country i at time t, and Yt =               i Yit   the total number of articles
written at each time t (i.e. the sum of articles across countries). We replicate Barrett, Appendino,
Nguyen, and de Leon Miranda (2020) index as follows

                                                                     Xit
                                                    EP Uit =        12

                                                                    j =1

where Xi =    T         Xit and Y =     T         Yt . We normalize the index to 100 by estimating
                  t=1                       t=1


                                                      N      EP Uit
                                                  EP Uit =          × 100,
                                                             EP U i

                        T
                   1
where EP U i =     T          EP Uit is the average of EPU news for each country across time. We construct
                        t=1
the monthly EPU for the Euro area as follows. We use real GDP data for France, Germany, Greece,
Italy and Spain. This real GDP is expressed in local currency and it is reported at a quarterly
frequency. Prior to 2000, we transform this real GDP measures to US dollars using the observed
average exchange rate in the quarter. From 2000 onward, we assume that all countries use the euro
as the relevant currency, so that there is no need for us to convert them to a common currency.
We linearly interpolate the real GDP of each country to get GDP at a monthly frequency. As a
result, we can aggregate GDP across countries in the eurozone to construct a GDP measure for
                                                                                                  N
the entire eurozone. We then construct the Euro Area EPU Index as EP Ut =                              it EP Uit , where
                                                                                                 i=1

  41
     The difference with Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) is that their index includes a non minor proportion of
local newspapers. Higher heterogeneity across newspapers allows them to first compute the share of news for each
individual newspaper within a country and then add up the total sum for each country. In other words, they do not
pool all articles within a country together.


                                                               55

it = RGDPit /         RGDPit is the share of the eurozone GDP accounted for by country i, EP Uit is
                i=1

we observe a value for EP Uit and their GDP.

Appendix A.4          ICRG: Composite and Political Risks
Our measures of composite and policy risks come from the International Country Risk Guide
(ICRG) dataset which provides data on country's political, economic and financial risks for more
than than 140 countries at monthly frequency. We describe below the definition of each variable
used in the paper and then present the correlation of the sub-components of political risk with the
UIP premium.



A.4.1 Definition of Variables

In our analysis, we employ the composite risk variable to proxy for overall country risk ­ political,
economic and financial risks­, and socioeconomic conditions to capture confidence risk. We pool
investment profile and democratic accountability together to measure government policy risk (i.e.
the average of both variables). Additionally, we use separately investment profile to proxy for ex-
propriation risk and democratic accountability to capture anti-democratic risk. We describe below
all the variables in detail.


-Composite risk. It is a composite of political, financial and economic risk. Political risk contributes
50% of the composite rating, while financial and economic risk ratings each contribute 25%. Polit-
ical risk has 12 components and the assessment is made on the basis of subjective analysis of the
available information. Financial and economic risk each have five components and their assessments
are made solely on the basis of objective data. The components of political, economic and financial
risks are:


-Political risk: government stability , socioeconomic conditions , investment profile , internal conflict ,
external conflict , democratic accountability+ , corruption+ , military in politics+ , religious tensions+ ,
law and order+ , ethnic tensions+ , and bureaucracy quality. The components with  are given up
to 12 points and, hence, have a higher weight, the components with + are given up to 6 points, and
the last component (bureaucracy quality) is given only 4 points.

   · Government stability: this index assesses both of the government's ability to carry out its
      declared programs, and its ability to stay in office. It has three subcomponents that describe
      government unity, legislative strength and popular support.

   · Socioeconomic conditions: this index assesses the socioeconomic pressures at work in society
      that could constrain government action or fuel social dissatisfaction. It has three subcompo-
      nents: unemployment, consumer confidence and poverty.

   · Investment profile: this index assesses factors affecting the risk to investment that are not
      covered by other political, economic and financial risk components. It has three components:
      contract viability/expropriation, profits repatriation and payment delays.

                                                    57
· Internal conflict: assesses political violence in the country and its actual or potential impact
  on governance. The subcomponents are: civil war/coup threat, terrorism/political violence
  and civil disorder.

· External conflict: this index is an assessment both of the risk to the incumbent govern-
  ment from foreign action, ranging from non-violent external pressure (diplomatic pressures,
  withholding of aid, trade restrictions, territorial disputes, sanctions, etc) to violent external
  pressure (cross-border conflicts to all-out war). External conflicts can adversely affect foreign
  business in many ways, ranging from restrictions on operations to trade and investment sanc-
  tions, to distortions in the allocation of economic resources, to violent change in the structure
  of society. The subcomponents are: war, cross-border conflict and foreign pressures.

· Democratic accountability: it is a measure of how responsive and accountable government is
  to its people. As such, it captures the degree of freedom that a government has to impose
  policies to its own advantage. It evaluates several types of government from more to less
  democratic, considering whether it is alternating democracy, dominated democracy, de facto
  one-party state, de jure one-party state, and autarchy.

· Corruption: assessment of corruption within the political system. Such corruption is a threat
  to foreign investment for several reasons: it distorts the economic and financial environment;
  it reduces the efficiency of government and business by enabling people to assume positions of
  power through patronage rather than ability; and, last but not least, introduces an inherent
  instability into the political process. The measure considers financial corruption in the form of
  demands for special payments and bribes connected with import and export licenses, exchange
  controls, tax assessments, police protection, or loans. It also considers potential corruption
  in the form of excessive patronage, nepotism, job reservations, 'favor-for-favors', secret party
  funding, and suspiciously close ties between politics and business.

· Military in politics: considers involvement of militaries in politics,

· Religious tensions: measures the relevance of a single religious group that seeks to replace civil
  law by religious law and to exclude other religions from the political and/or social process;
  the desire of a single religious group to dominate governance; the suppression of religious
  freedom; the desire of a religious group to express its own identity, separate from the country
  as a whole.

· Law and order: this refers to the strength and impartiality of the legal system and the popular
  observance of the law.

· Ethnic tensions: refers to the degree of tension within a country attributable to racial, na-
  tionality, or language divisions.




                                              58
   · Bureaucracy quality: measures the strength and quality of the bureaucracy. High points are
     given to countries where the bureaucracy has the strength and expertise to govern without
     drastic changes in policy or interruptions in government services.

-Economic risk: it includes GDP per capita, real GDP growth, inflation rate, budget balance over
GDP, current account over GDP.


-Financial risk: it includes foreign debt over GDP, foreign debt service over exports of goods and
services, current account over exports of goods and services, net international liquidity as months
of import cover, exchange rate stability.


Eurozone ICRG Risk Variable Construction. We construct a monthly eurozone ICRG risk indexes
as follows. We use real GDP data for the 19 countries that compose the eurozone. This real
GDP is expressed in local currency and it is reported at a quarterly frequency. Prior to 2000,
we transform this real GDP measures to US dollars using the observed average exchange rate in
the quarter. From 2000 onward, we assume that all countries in the Eurozone use the Euro as
the relevant currency, so that there is no need for us to convert them to a common currency. We
linearly interpolate the real GDP of each country to get GDP at a monthly frequency. As a result,
we can aggregate GDP across countries in the eurozone to construct a GDP measure for the entire
Eurozone. We then construct the Eurozone Composite Risk Index as

                                                 Nt
                                        ECRt =         it CRit ,
                                                 i=1

                       Nt
where it = RGDPit /          RGDPit is the share of the Eurozone GDP accounted for by country i,
                       i=1
CRit is the ICRG risk index for country i at time t, and Nt is the number of countries in the
eurozone for which we observe a value for CRit and their GDP. This latter number can change
over time due to reporting issues. However, starting in 1999 all 19 countries in the eurozone have
information on both their GDP and the composite risk index.




A.4.2 Correlation of Sub-Components of Political Risk and UIP Premium in Emerging
Markets

Section 6 focused on two main determinants of political risk correlated with the UIP premium in
emerging markets, namely government policy risk (composed by anti-democratic and expropriation
risks) and confidence risk. In this section, we present the correlation of other sub-components of
political risk with the UIP premium (for emerging markets) not directly employed in this paper,




                                                 59
and show that these correlations have usually the wrong (negative) sign and are typically small.42
    As detailed above, the other sub-components of political risk reported in the ICRG data and
not directly used in the paper are: government stability, corruption, external conflict, internal
conflict, military in politics, religious tensions, law and order, ethnic tensions and bureaucracy
quality. Figure A2 presents the correlation of the UIP premium with each of this components. The
correlation with these other subcomponents is usually small and sometimes has the opposite sign.
For example, it is interesting to note on the correlation with government stability risk (panel a),
which has the wrong sign (negative). This sub-component captures government unity and legislative
strength and, hence, is quite different from from our government policy risk variable (which captures
expropriation risk). Other examples are sub-components of political risk are: corruption, law and
order, religious tensions, bureaucracy quality and ethnic tensions (panels b, c, d, e and f), which
have less time-series variation and are negatively correlated with the UIP premium.
    Therefore, these figures indicate that these sub-components capture elements of political risk
that are not significantly related to foreign investors' risk sentiments, and thus do not significantly
correlate with the UIP premium in emerging markets.




   42
      Recall that the correlation of the UIP premium with government policy and confidence risk was presented in
Figure 12, and the its correlation with anti-democratic and expropriation risks was reported in Figure B.1.

In this appendix, we follow Froot and Frankel (1989) to decompose the bias on the Fama regression
arising from systematic errors in expectations and from a risk premium.


- Decomposition of Fama Regression under FIRE.
Consider that the probability limit of the coefficient  F in equation (5) is given by

                                  ^F =       cov (sit+h - si , IRit - IRi )
                              plim                                                                       (18)
                                                   var(IRit - IRi )

where IRit denotes de interest rate differential, IRit = iit - iU S
                                                                t , and the over-line denotes the
average of the variable for each country across quarters corresponding to the country fixed effects

included in regression (5), i.e. X i =   T     t=1 Xit .       Note that, when we average out across time, we
remove the horizon subscript h, but we still consider our specifications at the same forecast horizon

(12 month in our case). We can define the forecast errors as it +h = sit+h - sit+h and use them
to replace in equation (18) to obtain

   Using the definition of expected excess returns, we can re-write equation (19) as

Appendix E                 The Fama Puzzle Revisited:
                           A Decomposition Analysis
In this section, we conduct a decomposition analysis to unpack the channels through which policy
risk affects the risk premium and downwards bias the Fama coefficient. Recall that the Fama coef-
                                                                                     e         e   e
ficient for country i in window j can be expressed as plim^ij = 1 - bij,RP = 1 - var(ij )+cov(sij ,ij )
                                                                                                       var(IRij )
(equation (13)).
    Mathematically, one could evaluate how an increase in policy risk in window j in country i
affects its Fama coefficient by taking derivatives of this expression with respect to risk. After some
algebra, the change in the Fama coefficient would be

               =-                           -                              +                           .

                                                                                                                    (27)
Equation (27) shows that the change in the Fama coefficient stems from three forces: (i) changes
in the volatility of the UIP premium (first term), (ii) changes in the comovement between the
expected exchange rate change and the UIP premium (second term), and (iii) changes in the
volatility of the interest rate differential (third term). Equation (27) is a mathematical derivation
for a particular country i at window j but, under the assumption that each component of the risk
premium responds homogeneously across time and countries, we can estimate each of these three
forces econometrically.43 That is, we can regress var(e           e    e
                                                      ij ), cov (sij , ij ) and var (IRij ) on policy
                                                                                                         var(e   ij )
risk and obtain the average responses to policy risk across countries and time (i.e.                     policy riskij ,
var(IRij )            cov (se    e
                             ij ,ij )
policy riskij   and   policy riskij ).   Because these derivatives are weighted by the variance of the interest
rate differential in each country i and window j and the last derivate is additionally weighted by the
risk premium term bij,RP , we estimate them econometrically employing Weighted Least Squares.44
More precisely, we estimate


                                          Yij = 4 + 5 policy riskij + 1ij ,                                         (28)

  43
       To understand this assumption, note that equation (27) captures the change in the  coefficient in a country i
at time j upon an increase in policy risk in that period. Yet the econometrician is not interested in each individual
response of each country at each moment of time, but on the average response across time and countries. To compute
average responses, we can assume that each component of the risk premium in equation (27) responds homogeneously
across time and countries, and employ these homogeneous responses to obtain the average response of the Fama
                                                                                                         
coefficient to changes in policy risk. Hence, under this homogeneity assumption, the derivative ­  policyijriskij
                                                                                                                  ­ can
be interpreted as the average response of the Fama coefficient.
    44
       The WLS is a good econometric approximation of the derivatives in equation (27). More precisely, the derivatives
in equation (27) refer to the response of each country i at time j and are weighted by variables at country i and time
j level. So, these are individual responses for each country and time pair. Instead, the WLS weights each observation
for each country and time to compute average responses. Put it differently, the WLS weights each observation to
estimate individual responses, while the derivatives in equation (27) are the average responses weighted by country
and time.


                                                          69
where Yij = {var(e           e    e                                            e              e    e
                 ij ), cov (sij , ij ), var (IRij )}. The regressions for var (ij ) and cov (sij , ij )
are weighted by the variance of the interest rate differential in each country i window j , and that
for var(IRij ) is weighted by the ratio of the risk premium term and the variance of the interest
rate differential in each country i window j .45
    To assess the impact of the policy risk on the Fama coefficient, we focus on the two main
variables of Table 7: composite risk and government policy risk. Panel A in Table E.1 presents the
results for composite risk and shows that the driver of the downward bias of the Fama coefficient is
the increase in the volatility of the UIP premium. In particular, column 1 shows that the coefficient
of the variance of the UIP premium is positive and highly statistically significant, while the other
two coefficients ­ the covariance between exchange rate change and the UIP premium and the
interest rate volatility­ are close to zero. This result indicates that a one standard deviation in
that increases in composite risk associates with a 0.49 percentage points decrease in the volatility
of the UIP premium. We can then use the estimated coefficients to check how each of these three
forces contribute to the bias of the Fama coefficient. As expected, the increase in the volatility of
the UIP premium explains 87% of the bias of the Fama coefficient arising from changes in composite
risk.46
    We then evaluate how composite risk affects each of the component of the variance of the UIP
premium. Recall that the UIP premium in country i in period j is given by e            e
                                                                          ij = IRij - sij and,
thus, its variance is equal to

                           var(e                          e                    e
                               ij ) = var (IRij ) + var (sij ) - 2cov (IRij , sij ).                               (29)

To assess the impact of composite risk on each term of equation (29), we regress each of these
components on composite risk. Panel B in Table E.1 shows that composite risk associates with
increases in both the volatility of the interest rate differential and the volatility of the exchange rate
change. Yet the increase in the volatility of the interest rate differential is larger. The estimated
coefficients imply that one standard deviation increase in composite risk associates with a 0.16
increase in the variance of the interest rate differential and 0.10 increase in the variance of the
expected exchange rate change. The higher increase in the volatility of the interest rate differential
is remarkable because it highlights a disconnect between the interest rate and exchange rate changes,
and suggests that a country's composite risk is priced in the interest rate differential in emerging
markets. In this way, increases in a country's composite risk lead to higher increases in the interest
rate differential, which becomes the source of the UIP premium.

   45
      Alternatively, with time series long enough, one could estimate these regressions separately for each country, i.e.
without imposing homogeneity across countries. That is, one could estimate regression (28) for each country and
obtain individual 4i . Unfortunately, because our data spans only between 1996m11 and 2018m12, we do not have
enough time series variation to estimate these coefficients consistently. As West (2012) shows, in models where the
discount factor approaches one, the coefficient in the Fama regression could be inconsistent in small samples. More
recently, Engel, Kazakova, Wang, and Xiang (2021) show that the slope coefficients of excess return regressions for
advanced economies vary substantially across subsamples of time.
   46
      Note that the sum of the estimated coefficients of equation (27) (0.878) and the coefficient reported in Table E.1
(0.584) are not exactly identical, due to the presence of non-linearities in this decomposition.

   Finally, Table E.2 presents the results for the government policy risk. In line with the results
on composite risk, Panel A shows that the main components accounting for the downward bias of
the Fama coefficient is the volatility of the UIP premium, which ­as shown in panel B­ is mainly
driven by the volatility of the interest rate differential.
