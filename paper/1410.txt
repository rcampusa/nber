                Cyclical Unemployment: Sectoral Shifts or
                          Aggregate Disturbances?


                                 ABS TRACT



     Recent work by David Lilien has argued that the existence of a strong

positive correlation between the dispersion of employment growth rates across

sectors (cY) and the unemployment rate implies that shifts in demand from

some sectors to others are responsible for a substantial fraction of cyclical

variation in unemployment. This paper demonstrates that, under certain

empirically satisfied conditions, aggregate demand movements alone can produce

a positive correlation between     and the unemployment rate. Two tests are

developed which permit one to distinquish between a pure sectoral shift

interpretation' and a pure aggregate demand interpretation of this positive

correlation. The finding that       and the volume of help wanted advertising

are negatively related and the finding that 0   is   directly associated with

the change in unemployment rather than with the level of unemployment both

support an aggregate demand interpretation. A proxy for sectoral

shifts that is purged of the influence of aggregate demand is then developed.

Models which allow sectoral shifts in the composition of demand and

fluctuations in the aggregate level of demand to affect the unemployment

rate independently are estimated using this proxy. The results support

the view that pure sectoral shifts have not been an important source of

cyclical fluctuations in unemployment.

   The business cycle literature typically assumes that aggregate

disturbances, and in particular aggregate demand movements, are the primary

cause of cyclical swings in unemployment (see ,   for   example, Barro [19771;

Baily and Okun [1983]; and Tobin [1980]). The aggregate models utilized by

macroeconomists usually fail to take into account the possibility that shifts

in the sectoral composition of demand can have adverse macro consequences In

an economy where resources are not Instantaneously mobile across sectors. In

a provocative recent paper, Lilien (l982a) argues that shifts In demand from

some sectors to others, rather than movements In the level of aggregate

demand, are in fact responsible for half or more of all cyclical variation in

unemployment in the postwar perIod. Lilien's evidence on this point appears

to have been rather widely accepted (see, for example, Barro [1984];

Bluestone, Harrison and Gorham [19841; Grossman, Hart and Maskin [1983]; and

Rosen [1984]).

    The aggregate demand and sectoral shift explanations for cyclical

unemployment have potentially quite different policy implications. A pure

sectoral shift explanation seems to rule out a useful role for aggregate

demand policies in moderating unemployment fluctuations. Thus, the degree to

which each of these two possible sources contributes to cyclical unemployment

is a matter of considerable Importance.

    Section I of this paper lays out both a pure sectoral shift explanation

and a pure aggregate demand explanation for cyclical fluctuations In the

unemployment rate. We show that either could produce the strong positive

relationship between the cross—industry dispersion of employment growth rates

and the unemployment rate that Lillen appeals to as evidence for his sectoral

shift hypothesis. Section II argues that information on job vacancies can be

used to distinguish between the pure sectoral shift hypothesis and the pure



                                  —1—
aggregate demand hypothesis. Estimates using the Conference Board help wanted

index as a vacancy proxy offer strong support for the primacy of aggregate

demand disturbances in producing cyclical fluctuations in unemployment.

Evidence that the dispersion in employment growth rates is directly correlated

with the change in the unemployment rate, rather than with the unemployment

rate itself, corroborates this view. Section III considers a model which

allows both sectoral shifts and aggregate demand fluctuations to produce

independent effects on unemployment. Empirical estimates based on this model

confirm that pure sectoral shifts have not been an important cause of cyclical

movements in the unemployment rate. Section IV offers a few concluding

comments.


I. Sectoral Shifts, Aggregate—Demand—Induced Business Cycles, and Dispersion
    In Employment Growth Rates

    In this section of the paper, we demonstrate that either pure shifts In

the structure of demand or pure shocks to the level of demand could produce a

positive correlation between the dispersion of employment growth rates and the

unemployment rate. This means that evidence of such a correlation cannot be

taken as compellIng support for the vIew that pure sectoral shifts have been

an important cause of cyclical unemployment.



Sectoral Shifts

    We begin by thinking about a hypothetical economy which never experiences

fluctuations in aggregate demand around its trend rate of growth. If workers

were perfectly mobile and perfectly substitutable, shifts in the sectoral

composition of demand for labor that did not alter the aggregate level of

demand for labor would have no effect on the unemployment rate. Employment

losses in contracting firms would be exactly matched by employment gains in




                                      —2--
expanding firms. However, if frictions are present, then shifts in employment

demand can lead to at least temporary increases in unemployment. This is the

basis for the relationship posited in Lilien's work between at, the

dispersion in observed employment growth rates across sectors (an empirical

proxy for the dispersion in the desired rates of employment growth across

sectors) and U, the unemployment rate.

      We represent the desired rate of employment growth in a particular sector

as the sum of the aggregate trend rate of growth of employment, r, plus a

random sector specific disturbance,



(1)        d ln Ejt =   r   +



where       is assumed to be distributed with mean         and time—varying
                                                     :e0
variance cY* according to the distribution f(c*/at). A shock

to the economy which necessitates that proportionally more labor be allocated

to some sectors and proportionally less to others, but does not move aggregate
                                         *
demand off its trend path, may increase a, the dispersion in desired

employment growth rates, but does not affect F. We will refer to a shock of
                                *
this sort which increaseso as a mean preserving spread in the rates

of growth of labor demand across sectors.V In a frictionless world, the

change in the desired rate of employment growth in a sector will always equal

the change in the actual rate of employment growth in the sector. A mean

preserving spread leaves total employment no different than it would have been

in the absence of the shock. In the presence of frictions, many of the people

losing their jobs in the sectors experiencing negative shocks can expect to be

out of work for some period of time, while searching for employment in the

gaining sectors. Increases incY, the dispersion in desired rates of




                                       —3—
employment change across industries, would raise the number of workers

shifting to new sectors and thereby increase the unemployment rate. Unless

there were some unusual configuration of bottlenecks in the labor market, one

would expect a, the dispersion in desired rates of employment change,

to be tracked reasonably closely bya, the dispersion in actual rates of

employment change. This suggests that, in the absence of aggregate demand

disturbances, pure sectoral shifts in the composition of demand would produce

a positive correlation between the dispersion of employment growth rates and

the unemployment rate.V



Aggregate Demand Fluctuations

    The preceding discussion completely ignores the potential effect of

aggregate demand fluctuations on employment growth dispersion. This causes no

problems for empirical analysis ——   in   the sense that the dispersion of

employment growth rates can still safely be interpreted as a measure of

intersectoral shifts   Th Lilien (1982a) —      provided   that two conditions are

satisfied. First, all sectors must have the same trend rate of growth.

Second, sectors must not differ in their sensitivity to aggregate demand

fluctuations.

    If these conditions are violated, aggregate demand fluctuations can

produce a positive correlation between the dispersion of employment growth

rates (a) and the unemployment rate             even in the absence of

sectoral shifts of the sort motivating the previous discussion. Specifically,

this will happen if either (1) industries' trend growth rates and cyclical

sensitivities are negatively correlated; and/or (2) industries differ in their

cyclical sensitivities and downturns tend to be steeper than upturns. Both of

these sets of requirements seem to be satisfied empirically.




                                          —4-
      The theoretical argument proceeds in two steps. First, we show that,

under either of the specified sets of conditions, aggregate demand

fluctuations will produce a positive correlation between     and the change

in U (A U, equal to U U_1). Second, we show that, with
observations for periods of discrete length, A U and       Itself are

likely to be positively correlated. Taken together, these two results suggest

that aggregate demand fluctuations are likely to generate a positive

correlation between     and U.
      We first consider the implications of a negative correlation between

industries' trend rates of growth and their cyclical sensitivities. This

alone is sufficient for aggregate demand fluctuations to produce a correlation

between      and A U. Consider a hypothetical two—sector economy

driven solely by transitory fluctuations in aggregate demand around its trend

rate of growth. Employment in the first sector trends upward rapidly but is

relatively unresponsive to cyclical movements in GNP; employment in the second

sector trends upward less rapidly but is more responsive to fluctuations in

GNP. (Think of sector one as services and sector two as manufacturing.) We

can write:

(2)        in Eit = + T1t + y1(ln Y —    in Y)
and

(3)        lnE2 = + rt + y2(lnY —      lnY)
where Eit and E2t are employment in the two sectors, t is a time trend,       is

actual GNP, Y is trend GNP, r1> r2 (service employment is growing at a

more rapid trend rate than manufacturing employment) and     <     (service
employment is less cyclically responsive than manufacturing employment). A

measure of the dispersion in the rate of growth of employment across sectors

at any point in time is defined as:




                                       —5—
              = [lt (A inEit— A lnE)2 +                 2t
                                                             (A lnE2t — A   lnE)2]"2

This is approximately equal to:


                 (r1 - 2     +
                                 2    1
                                          -
                                              ' 2 lnY -      A
                                                                 lnY)

if we assume that the two sectors are equal in size to start with, so that the

employment share weights are approximately one half and the growth rate of

total employment (A mEt) is approximately equal to the average of the

growth rates of employment in each of the two sectors.

      How will     move over the business cycle? Figure 1 illustrates

movements in a using hypothetical parameter values and assuming that

lnY — lnY moves like a sine wave (see panel A). At the peak and
again at the trough of the business cycle, the difference A lnEit — A lnE2t

                   —         the difference in the trend rates of growth in
just equals            r2,
the two sectors. The value of A lnEi —A lnE2 reaches a maximum

midway from peak to trough (where GNP is falling most rapidly) and a minimum

midway from trough to peak (where GNP is growing most rapidly). This implies

that      reaches a maximum midway between peak and trough, and a minimum

midway between trough and peak (see panel

        If TJ bears an Okun's law relationship to the percentage deviation of

GNP from trend, then we can write:
                                          *
(5)     Ut = +     0 (ln Yt —        ln
where   B is negative. The change in U will reach a maximum midway from peak

to trough (where GNP is falling most rapidly) and a minimum midway from trough

to peak (where GNP is growing most rapidly). Thus, a.t and A U will

have similar movements and should be positively correlated.




                                                  —6—
      We have demonstrated that the existence of a negative correlation

between industries' trend rates of growth and their cyclical sensitivities is

sufficient to produce a positive correlation between at and A U.

Differences in industries' cyclical sensitivities combined with asymmetry in

the movement of aggregate demand around trend can also produce a positive

correlation between      and A U. If industries differ in their

cyclical sensitivities and trend differences in growth rates are unimportant,

then the dispersion in employment growth rates will be greatest when output is

changing most sharply, whether falling or rising. Suppose that downturns in

GNP always occur sharply over a short period of time, with recoveries in GNP

occurring more gradually over a longer period of time. Then a will tend to

be larger in downturns than in upturns.

      Appealing again to the existence of an Okun's law relationship between

unemployment and the deviation of GNP from trend, the same pattern of output

fluctuation will produce sharp increases in unemployment during downturns and

more gradual reductions in unemployment during upturns. Thus, a will tend

to be large when A U is positive, and smaller when A U is negative; once

again, a. and A U will have similar movements and should be

positively correlated.

      This argument has been developed assuming no difference in industries'

trend rates of growth; business cycle asymmetries of the hypothesized variety

will also contribute to a positive correlation betweena andA U

the case where industries' trend growth rates are negatively correlated with
their cyclical sensitivities, so that this effect can operate to reinforce the

preceding effect.

      Thus far we have shown only that aggregate demand fluctuations can

produce a positive correlation between the dispersion of employment growth




                                       —7—
rates and the change in the unemployment rate, with this possible via either

of two routes. However, if A          and      are positively correlated, then

   and    should also bear a positive relationship to one another. In

actual quarterly data for l951:Q2 to 1982:Q4, the change in detrended

   (A UDTt) and detrended U (UDT) itself have a correlation of

0.256; in annual data for the same time period, A UDTt and UDTt have a

correlation of 0.522.' This positive correlation of TJ and A IJ, does

not imply that the unemployment rate series is necessarily explosive. In

fact, a positive correlation between the level of a variable, X, and its

first difference, X —             is a basic property of a wide variety of
                        X_1,
stationary discrete time stochostic processes. For example, if a random

variable X follows a stationary AR(1) process of the form


      X =   4 X1 + et,    I   4   I < 1,   et white noise,
                                                             1/2
then the correlation between X andA X equals (4)                   > 0.-/   Thus, it

seems quite plausible that an aggregate—demand driven positive correlation

between     and A U could, through a positive correlation between

A U and U, produce a positive correlation betweena and U.



Simulated Effects of Aggregate Demand Fluctuations

   The actual economy is more complicated than the preceding discusson would

suggest. However, so long as there is a negative correlation between

industries' trend rate of growth and the responsiveness of their employment

levels to cyclical swings in GNP and/or it is true both that industries differ

in their cyclical sensitivities and that downturns tend to be sharper than

upturns, we can expect aggregate demand fluctuations to produce a positive

relationship between the dispersion of employment growth rates across sectors




                                            —8--
and the change in unemployment. Since changes in unemployment have been

positively correlated with the level of unemployment, we can thus expect to

observe a positive relationship between the variance of employment growth

rates across sectors and the unemployment rate.

       We have constructed a multiple sector simulation model to demonstrate the

sort of movements in                      U, and U one might observe in the real

world in response to fluctuations in aggregate demand. The essential

ingredients of this simulation model are a set of equations relating the rate

of change in employment in various sectors to change in aggregate demand and

an Okun's—law equation relating the unemployment rate to aggregate demand.

       We specify the change in the log of employment in each of eleven major

sectors as:

                                                                         *
(6)    I   ln   Eit =          +                               — tln         +
                                   r21t        Y1(Ain

where Eit is employment in sector 1, t is a time trend, inY is log (GNP),

lnY is the trend value of log (GNP), and ther's andy's are
                    6/   The results obtained are summarized in Table 1. It is
parameters.—
significant for our purposes that there is a strong negative correlation

across industries between the trend rate of growth in employment at the mean

value of t and the responsiveness of employment to cyclical fluctuations in

GNP. The simple correlation between the estimated value of d in Eit/dt,

evaluated at the mean value of t, and the sum of the y's equals —0.607; the

rank correlation is —0.700.

       The unemployment rate was also specified to be a function of the current

and lagged gaps between actual and potential GNP:

                           4                       *

                                                        -9-
where 1J is the civilian unemployment rate, t, inY and lnY are as

above, and u., ri and the e's are parameters. A time trend was included

in the equation since the unemployment rate seems to have drifted upwards over

time and we are interested in exploring its cyclical movements, not its trend

movements. The parameters in this equation were estimated using data for the

same time period and the same serial correlation correction procedure as in

the employment equations.

      We then simulated various sectors' employment growth rates and the

detrended unemployment rate by substituting the history of realized gaps

between actual and trend GNP for the period from 1950:Ql to 1982:Q4 into our

simulation equation. Casual inspection of this output gap series suggests

that its movements are asymmetric, with downturns steeper than upturns.

Neftci (1984) has recently offered more formal evidence of this sort of

business cycle asymmetry.


      Values of at were calculated according to the formula:

estimates from equation (6), the Eit's are simulated employment levels

Simulated values of the change in detrended             and detrended     itself

were based on equation (7), but with t set equal to zero for all

observations. Given the lags involved, this yielded simulated observations on

      the change in detrended       and detrended       for 127 periods

corresponding to l951:Q2 through l982:Q4.


                                          —10—
       What do the simulated data look like? And how do they compare to actual

data? First, there is a strong positive correlation between a and A UDTt

(p    = 0.665).   Second, A UDTt and UDTt are positively related (p    0.256).

Third, there is a positive correlation between 0t and UDt (p =     0.292). In
actual quarterly data,       and A UDTt have correlation 0.554; A UDTt and UDTt

have correlation 0.256; and       and UDTt have correlation 0.276. Our simulation

results do not prove that aggregate demand fluctuations are responsible for

the positive relationship betweena and the unemployment rate we see in

actual data; however, these results do demonstrate that aggregate demand

fluctuations easily could have produced such a positive relationship. Thus,

the positive relationship betweena and the unemployment rate does not

necessarily imply an important role for sectoral shifts in cyclical

fluctuations.                        -




II.     Differentiating Between the Sectoral Shift and Aggregate Demand Hypotheses

         While either pure sectoral shifts or pure aggregate demand fluctuations

can produce a positive correlation between the dispersion in employment growth

rates and the unemployment rate, the two processes can be distinguished

empirically in other respects. In particular, the behaviour of job vacancies

can reveal which has been the more important cause -of the correlation between

at and U. The relationship between a, and the change in          can

also be informative.



Predictions Concerning Cyclical Movements In the Job Vacancy Rate

        One important difference between the mean—preserving spread sectoral

shift story and the aggregate demand story lies with what each predicts for

the behaviour of the job vacancy rate. If the pure sectoral shift hypothesis




                                         —11—
correctly captured why a, and U are positively related, then a and

V, the job vacancy rate, should also be positively related. In contrast,

the aggregate demand scenario concerning the positive relationship between

   and U generates a negative relationship between a and V.

      These predictions rest on the existence of an inverse cyclical

relationship between U and V. Strong aggregate demand can be expected

to reduce the number of people unemployed and raise the number of vacant jobs;

whereas weak aggregate demand can be expected to raise the number of people

unemployed and reduce the number of vacant jobs. Thus, holding the structural

characteristics of the economy fixed, one might expect to find plots of the

job vacancy rate against the unemployment rate yielding a downward sloping UV

curve. An increase in the unemployment rate that is caused purely by a

negative shock to aggregate demand should be accompanied by a decrease in the

job vacancy rate, as shown in the move from A to B in Figure

      Changes in the structural characteristics of the economy can shift the

entire UV curve either inwards (improvements in worker/job matching) or

outwards (worsening of worker/job matching). Increased dispersion in the

desired rates of employment growth across sectors is one possible cause of an

outward shift in the UV curve. An increase in the unemployment rate caused

purely by an increase in the dispersion of desired employment growth rates

should be accompanied by an increase in the job vacancy rate, as shown in the

move from A to C in Figure 2.-'   f-"



      The contrast of the predicted relationship betweena and Vt

emerging from the sectoral shift story and that emerging from our aggregate

demand story provides a means of empirically determining which is more

important that we exploit in the empirical analysis which follows.

Using the Help Wanted Index as a Job Vacancy Proxy

        Unfortunately, comprehensive job vacancy data have not been collected on

an ongoing basis in the United States. The best available proxy for the

number of vacant jobs is the Conference Board's help wanted index. This index

is essentially an employment—weighted average of the number of help wanted

advertisements in 51 major metropolitan newspapers, deflated so that 1967

equals lOO.-"     Dividing the national help wanted index by total

nonagricultural payroll employment yields a reasonable proxy for the job

vacancy rate. We use this normalized help wanted index (help wanted index

divided by total nonagricultural payroll employment) as a vacancy rate

surrogate in the analysis which follows.

        An important question is whether the normalized help wanted index in

fact does a good job of capturing cyclical fluctuations in the job vacancy

rate. Appendix A presents some evidence on this point which suggests that

short—term movements in help wanted advertising do a good job of tracking

short—term movements in job vacancies.



Patterns of Movement in Annual Data

        The left hand panel of Figure 3 plots the dispersion of employment growth

rates        calculated using annual average employment figures against the

civilian unemployment rate, as in Lilien (l982a); it is clear that         and

Ut are positively correlated. The right hand panel of Figure 3 presents a

similar plot, but with the normalized help wanted index ——    our   proxy for the

job vacancy rate ——   replacing   the unemployment rate. The pure sectoral shift

hypothesis implies that o and the normalized help wanted index should

move together; the pure aggregate demand hypothesis implies that they should

move in opposite directions. The fact that        and the normalized help




                                        —13—
 wanted index move in opposite directions suggests that aggregate demand

 fluctuations, not sectoral shifts, are responsible for the positive

 correlation between      and U observed in annual data.



Unemployment and Help Wanted Index Equations

      The more formal evidence on the relationship between a and U presented

 in Lilien (1982a) consists of unemployment rate models including current and

lagged values of both a and DMR, the unanticipated growth in the money

 supply, plus a lagged value of the unemployment rate, as explanatory

variables. The DMR. terms are intended to capture exogenous shocks to

aggregate demand; if they captured aggregate demand sh9cks perfectly, the a

coefficients presumably would be uncontaminated by aggregate demand

influences. Lilien (l982a) uses annual data to estimate his unemployment

equations; the specification he chooses to focus most of his attention on is:


(9) UtaO+af+c2al+cDMR+a4D+D÷
                       + a7t + u

where U represents the civilian unemployment rate, a is the dispersion in

employment growth rates across eleven sectors, DNR is the unanticipated growth

in the money supply, t is a time trend, the a's are coefficients to be

estimated, and u Is the error term.

      The first column of Table 2 presents an ordinary least squares (OLS)

estimate of equation (9) fit with annual data for the sample period 1949 to

1980. All the variables in this model are identical to those used by Lilien;

our time period differs slightly from his, starting in 1949 rather than 1948,

since 1949 is the earliest year for which we could obtain data to estimate a

comparable help wanted index model. Not surprisingly, we obtain coefficient

estimates very close to those Lilien reports, including large and significant

positive coefficients on both a, and a1.
                                      —14—
        Lilien interprets the positive coefficients on his a terms as evidence

of more rapid structural change raising the unemployment rate. A model like

equation (9) but with the normalized help wanted index ——      proxying for the job
vacancy rate —— as the dependent variable offers a test of this interpretation:


(10)              +          + '3fti +                               +
        NHWI                                    + 13DMRJ 1+ 25't—2

                      b      t—l

                                     7   t

where NHWIt represents the normalized help wanted index, the f3's are

parameters and the other variables are defined above. Positive a

coefficients in the help wanted Index equation would support the structural

change interpretation; negative coefficients would suggest that a is

actually serving as an aggregate demand proxy.

    Column (2)of Table 2 presents an OLS estimate of equation (10) which

matches the unemployment model in column (1). In this help wanted Index

equation, the current value of a takes on a large and statistically

significant negative coefficient; the coefficient on the once—lagged value of

   is also negative though not significant. The fact that the a

variables do not take on positive coefficients —— and in fact assume negative

coefficients ——   In   the help wanted Index equation implies that the positive

a coefficients In the Table 2 unemployment equations cannot be interpreted

as evidence of pure Intersectoral shifts producing cyclical fluctuations in
               11/
unemployment.—



Is a Correlated with U or U?

       A second important difference between the sectoral shift story and the

aggregate demand story lies with whether they Imply that a Is directly

related to Ut or to A Ut. The sectoral shift story leads directly to a




                                             —15—
prediction that a and U should be positively related. In the aggregate

demand story, however, swings in aggregate demand produce a positive

correlation between a and A Ut; a ends up being correlated with

only because A U and U have a positive relationship. Interestingly,

when       is estimated as a function of detrended U and the change in

detrended U using annual data for 1948 to 1980, the following relationship

emerges:

(11)       a = 0.019 + 0.002 UDT + 0.007 A UDT
                                              t
                (0.006)   (0.002)       (0.002)

where the numbers reported in parentheses are standard errors. The data

Indicate that, holding UDTt constant, at is very significantly related

to A UDT; however, holding A UDTt constant, a has no significant

relationship with UDTt. It appears that a and the change in unemployment

are directly related, but that a and unemployment itself are not. While

this result could conceivably be reconciled with the sectoral shift

explanation, It is a much more probable outcome of the aggregate demand
     12/
model.—


III. Decomposing Sectoral Shift and Aggregate Demand Influences
        on the Unemployment Rate

   We have seen that the dispersion in employment growth rates across sectors

Is a poor proxy for the magnitude of pure sectoral shifts In labor demand

occurring in the economy. In this section of the paper, we discuss one

possible approach to better Identifying the true effect of pure sectoral

shifts on short term movements In the unemployment rate. While our approach

Is very similar to that of LIlien (1982b), our conclusions differ markedly

from his. Our results do not provide support for the view that pure sectoral

shifts have been an Important source of cyclical fluctuations in unemployment

in the postwar U.S.


                                       —16—
Creating a Measure of Pure Sectoral Shifts in Labor Demand

    The basic problem with using the a measure discussed in the previous

section of the paper as a measure of pure sectoral shifts is that both

aggregate demand fluctuations and pure sectoral shifts can affect the

dispersion in employment growth rates. The obvious solution is to separate

employment growth rates in various sectors into that part which is linked to

aggregate developments and that part which reflects sector—specific

developments. A reasonable proxy for pure sectoral shifts would then be the

dispersion in the sector—specific components of the employment growth rates.

       The employment growth rate of a given sector can be specified as a

function of aggregate and sector—specific factors. If sectoral employment

growth can be reasonably separated into trend and non—trend components, then

the employment growth rate for a particular sector I can be written as:


(12)          inEit =   r11 +   r21t + SlAt +

where E represents employment, t is a time trend, At is a vector of

aggregate demand variables, S is a parameter vector of sector specific

responses to aggregate terms, and ct is a disturbance term reflecting

non—trend sector—specific factors)' To implement this specification

empirically, one would ideally like to have variables In A that do a good job

of capturing aggregate influences but are also exogenous to sector—specific

shocks. On the one hand, if the variables included in A fail to capture all

important aggregate demand influences, then the error terms in the employment

growth equations will not represent pure sector—specific effects. On the

other hand, if variables affected by sector—specific shocks are included in A,

then employment growth attributed to these aggregate variables could in fact

be the result of sector—specific factors.




                                            —17—
       The following equation represent8 one possible empirical specification:


(13)          lnE1 =          +
                                  T2t +E Yj Dt_ + Cit

where DMR represents unanticipated growth in the money supply and               i   is

assumed to follow an AR(l) process. Thus                  can be written as:

          =
              i6it—l +       e1
where ei is a white noise innovation term. If the L DMR terms captured

all the relevant aggregate influences on sectoral employment growth, then the

        would capture the purely sector—specific influences on growth.

       The estimated innovations from the employment growth equations specified

above can be used to construct a measure of residual dispersion in employment

growth rates, which we will call SIGRESA:

                         NE                    2

(14)
          SIGRESAt
                         E            (.._t)
                       11         t


where N equals the number of sectors, Fj equals employment in sector                     in

period t, Et equals total period t employment, and eit equals the estimated

innovation in the AR(1) error term cit, and ye is the estimated variance of
                                              i

the it'• Since we are interested in isolating innovations to the growth

rate of employment in different sectors, it is appropriate to calculate SIGRESA

using the elt's rather than the Cit's. The eit's represent current

sectoral shifts. The adjustment to past shifts, the lagged                     which make

up c, can affect the unemployment rate and do so through the effect on

lagged SIGRESA's on the unemployment rate. The elt Items are normalized by

v    for comparability with Lilien (1982b); it also turns out that the
ei

normalized SIGRESA measure captures more of the variation In unemployment and

In the help wanted index than does a non—normalized measure.




                                                   —18—
   There is an obvious potential problem with SIGRESA as a proxy for pure

sectoral shifts in labor demand: unanticipated money growth is unlikely to

the be only important exogenous influence on aggregate demand, so that the

residuals used to construct SIGRESA are likely to reflect aggregate as well as

sector—specific influences on employment growth rates. Evidence that the

errors from employment growth rate equations like (13) were positively

correlated across sectors would confirm that there is reason for concern. One

reasonable response is to purge each sector's employment growth equation

residuals of that component which moves together with the average residual.

To do this, we fit OLS versions of equation (13) and calculate the weighted

average residual from these equations for each time period:

                    NE
(15)
              t
        AVERES =   E
                   i=:L t
                            .
                                   t


where Ej equals employment in sector I in period t, Et equals total

period t employment, andj is the period t residual from the OLS version

of sector l's employment equation. This weighted average residual is then used as

an explanatory variable in a new set of employment growth equations:


(16)
        lnEjt F11 +F21t + ZyA Dt_ +Ki AVES

where K is a parameter,         is again assumed to follow an AR(1) process,

and all other terms have been previously defined. The estimated innovations

to the errors from these equations can be used to construct a new measure of

residual dispersion in employment growth rates, which we will call SIGRESB,

defined in exactly the same way as SIGRESA except based on equations like (16)

rather than on equations like (13). Our use of AVERESt in constructing

SIGRESB Is very similar In spirit to Lilien's (l982b) estimation of a time

fixed effect in the employment growth equations which underlie his sectoral




                                         —19—
shift proxy; our approach has the advantage that AVERESt is less likely to

be dominated by large, erratic movements in the employment growth rate of a
                   14/
single small sector.—

        Both our approach and Lilien's approach suffer from the potential

problem that the aggregate component Introduced Into the sector—specific

employment growth equations can itself be affected by sector specific shocks:

In a period in which shocks create a large need to reallocate labor across

sectors, the adversely affected sectors may shrink without the positively

affected sectors growing by the same amount, causing a drop In the average

employment growth rate. However, since the aggregate component will only

capture sectoral employment movements that are systematically associated with

movements in the aggregate component, this should be a serious problem only in

the unlikely event that pure sector specific shocks keep recurring over time

In the same fixed pattern.



Unemployment and Help Wanted Index Equations

        We have estimated both unemployment and help wanted index equations

which   include values of the SIGRESA and SIGRESB measures. The unemployment
equations and the sectoral shift proxies appearing in them have been specified
to make   our results as comparable as possible to those reported in Lilien

(1982b): the SIGRESA and SIGRESB measures were constructed using the

normalized innovations to the residuals from AR(l) employment growth

equations estimated with data for 29 sectors for the 1953:Ql to 1982:Q2 sample

period;       the current and eight lagged values of one or the other of these

sectoral shift proxies, plus a constant and the current and eight lagged

values of DMR, were included in each equation; and all the equations were

estimated allowing for an AR(4) error structure with data for the 1958:Ql to




                                      —20—
1982:Ql sample period. The differences between our models and the central

model in Lilien (l982b) are as follows: our DMR variable may not be identical

to his; we use a detrended unemployment rate as the dependent variable rather

than including a time trend directly in the estimating equation; and, of

course, neither our SIGRESA nor our SIGRESB is identical to Lilien's measure

of residual dispersion in employment growth rates. Only the last of these
                                   16/
differences is apt to be important.—

      The first column of Table 3 summarizes the parameter estimates from an

unemployment equation for the civilian unemployment rate which includes

current and lagged values of SIGRESA as explanatory variables. The sum of the

coefficients on these SIGRESA terms implies that a one standard deviation

change in SIGRESA is associated with a 0.962 percentage point (or 0.759

standard deviation) change in the detrended unemployment rate. Figure 4a

plots both the actual detrended unemployment rate (UDTt and a detrended

"natural unemployment rate" series (UDT) calculated as the predicted

value of unemployment based on the column (1) estimates, assuming that the

SIGRESA terms take on their actual values, but that the DMR terms uniformly

equal zero. It is clear from inspection of this plot that the actual

unemployment rate moves around a good deal more than the natural rate series;

over the l958:Ql to l980:Ql sample period, UDTt has a standard deviation of

1.267 and a range of 4.970, while UDTt has a standard deviation of only
                              17/
0.515 and a range of only 2.133.—

      As noted above, one serious concern with the SIGRESA series is that the

employment growth equation residuals upon which it is based are likely to

include a substantial aggregate demand component, in addition to capturing

sector—specific influences. The errors in the sectors' employment growth

equations are in fact highly correlated. Over the l953:Ql to l982:Ql sample




                                     —21—
                                                    A
period,   all twenty—nine of the individual equation ej's, the innovations to

the equation (13) errors from which SIGRESA is calculated, are positively


correlated with the employment—weighted average elt. Twenty—five of these

twenty—nine positive correlations are significant at the 0.05 level; only the

innovations to the errors in the tobacco manufacturers equation, the petroleum

refining equation, the federal government equation and the state government

equation are not significantly positively correlated with the weighted average

      Some common unobserved factor or factors appear to be affecting the

employment growth rates of many if not all of the twenty—nine sectors. The

help wanted equation estimates reported in column (3) are consistent with the

view that the error innovation terms used in constructing SIGRESA contain an

aggregate demand component in addition to any sector—specific component. The

sum of the coefficient on the current and lagged SIGRESA terms is not

significantly positive; rather, it is slightly, though not significantly,

negative.

      The fact that the errors from which SIGRESA terms were constructed

appear to contain an important common cross—sector component motivated our

construction of SIGRESB, following the approach described above. The second

column of Table 3 presents an unemployment equation which Includes current and

lagged values of SIGRESB as an explanatory variable. The point estimates of

the sum of the coefficients on the nine SIGRESB terms in this model Imply that

a one standard deviation change in SIGRESB Is associated with only a 0.278

percentage point (or 0.219 standard deviation) change in the unemployment

rate; moreover, this point estimate is not significantly different from zero.

Figure 4b plots both the actual detrended unemployment rate and a detrended

natural rate series based on the point estimates of the coefficients in the

column (2) model. This plot reveals a rather dramatic contrast between the




                                      —22—
cyclical volatility of the actual detrended unemployment rate, which swings

around quite widely, and the comparative stability of the natural rate

series. Over the 1958:Ql to 1980:Ql sample period, UDTt has a standard

deviation of 1.267 and a range of 4.970; the UDT' series based on the

column (2) model has a standard deviation of only 0.190 and a range of only

0.829. The sum of the SIGRESB coefficients in the help wanted index equation

column (4) is also small and ins1gnificant.!'I2!

       In our view, these results provide no support for the view that pure

sectoral shifts are an important source of cyclical variation in the aggregate

unemployment rate.



IV.   Conclusion
      Some previous research has taken the fact that the dispersion of

employment growth rates and the unemployment rate are positively correlated to

Indicate that the former bears a causal relationship to the latter. We have

provided evidence which strongly contradicts this interpretation. Our

preferred interpretation is that fluctuations in aggregate demand affect both

the dispersion of employment growth rates and the unemployment rate, producing

a positive correlation between the two.

      More generally, our work suggests the following two propositions.

First, any labor market dispersion measure should be interpreted cautiously,

since aggregate demand fluctuations, not just sector specific shocks, can have

an important effect on such measures. Aggregate—demand—induced recessions are

markedly uneven in their impact; the consequences of declines In aggregate

demand can all too easily be mistaken for the consequences of long—term

structural problems in particular sectors. Second, information on job

vacancies can be very helpful for understanding why changes in the

unemployment rate have occurred.


                                     —23—
        The major substantive conclusion of the paper is that pure sectoral

shifts, as distinct from aggregate disturbances, appear to have contributed

very little to observed post—war cyclical fluctuations in the unemployment

rate.

   point during the upturn, a would decrease to zero, increase a bit, fall

   back to zero, then finally increase again as the economy moved from trough

   to peak. However, there would have to be larger differences between the

   cyclical responsiveness of the two sectors and/or larger fluctuations of

   GNP around trend over shorter time periods than seems reasonable for this

   to happen. Even if this flip—flopping pattern did emerge, a and dU

   would still be positively correlated.

4. We present results based on values of U with a linear trend removed

   both here and elsewhere, since we are concerned with explaining short term

    fluctuations in unemployment, independent of trend movements In the level

   of unemployment. Using detrended data rather than non—detrended data

   never has an important effect on the results.



5. This positive relationship between the level of a variable and the change

    in the variable depends on the length of the time intervals between

   observations. It appears to shrink in importance for finer measurement

    intervals of the unemployment rate series. As noted above, the

   correlation between UDTt and A UDTt is only 0.256 in quarterly data

   for 1951 to 1982, as compared to 0.522 in annual data for the same time

    period.



6. We began by estimating lnEjt equations for this simulation. The AR(l)

   corrected lnEit equations yielded first order autoregressive parameters

   quite close to 1 with some residual serial correlation remaining.

   Estimating A lnEi equations thus seemed more appropriate. None of

    the conclusions derivable from the simulation were affected in any

    significant way by whether we worked with 1nEj or A lnEj parameter

   estimates. There isa time trend in the A lnEj equations because we

   had included both t and t2 in the underlying lnEjt equations.



7. For theoretical models which produce this inverse relationship between

    U and Vt (commonly referred to as the Beveridge curve), see Holt and

    David (1966), Hansen (1970), and Jackman, Layard and Pissarides (1983).




                                     —29—
8. Secular increases in the U.S. unemployment rate have been linked to

    outward shifts in the Beveridge curve; see, for example, Abraham (1982),

   Medoff and Abraham (1982) and Medoff (1983). Katz (1983) discusses the

    likely consequences of mean preserving spreads in desired employment

   growth rates for movements in both unemployment rates and job vacancy

    rates, with particular reference to sorting out among possible causes of

   cyclical fluctuations in unemployment.



9. The increased unemployment caused by a mean preserving spread in desired

    employment growth rates could generate feedbacks reducing aggrete

    demand. Absent such feedbacks, a mean—preserving spread would cause

    vacancies to rise one—for—one with unemployment; with feedbacks, the short

    run increase in the number of vacancies might be less than the short run

    Increase in unemployment. Increases In unemployment attributable to the

    feedback following a mean preserving spread should not be considered

    Increases in the natural rate in the sense of Lilien (l982a), since they

    could be reversed by aggregate demand policy In the same way as

   unemployment caused directly by a negative shock to aggregate demand.



10. Preston (1977) discusses the data and methodology used In creating the

   help wanted index in considerable detail.



11. We also estimated models like those reported in Table 2 with all the

    different specifications reported in Lilien (l982b); with an AR(l) error

    structure rather than a lagged dependent variable; and with data for

    several different time periods. Our qualitative conclusions appear to be

    very robust.




                                     —30—
12. Johnson and Layard (1983) present a similar model with a. specified as

    a function of current and lagged unemployment. Using annual data for the

    period 1949 to 1980, they obtain coefficients on Ut and U_1 that are

    essentially equal but opposite in sign. They interpret this result as

    evidence that a is related to the change in unemployment, not to

    unemployment itself.



13. This basic specification, which we have arrived at using fairly ad hoc

    reasoning, can be more formally justified. Lilien (1982b) derives this

    structure from a model of a multisectoral labor market with limited labor

   mobility across sectors and a gradual process of adjustment of

    sector—specific labor forces to permanent sector—specific shocks. A major

   problem with this model is that it allows no role for vacancies.



14. When we estimated our own fixed effects model using a maximum likelihood

   approach, the fixed effect estimates were completely dominated by the

    residuals from the mining sector equation.



15. These 29 sectors are the same sectors utilized in Table 1 except that

    durable goods and nondurable goods manufacturing are broken into their 20

   two—digit SIC component industries. The employment data are from the BLS

    establishment payroll survey.



16. We were not able to ascertain precisely what money equation generated the

   DMR series used in Lilien (1982b). Our money equation used Nl as the

   dependent variable, with pre—1959 Ml data taken from Barro and Rush

   (1980); and the post—1959 Ml data from the Federal Reserve Bulletin; the




                                     —31—
   equation was fit for the sample period 1948:Q4 to l982:Q4 and included

    four lagged values of Ml, four lagged values of the interest rate on three

    month treasury bills, and a time trend. We fit models with detreixied

    values of the dependent variables because when we simply included a time

    trend in the estimating equations, the coefficients it assumed seemed

    unreasonably large. This specification decision had virtually no effect

    on the coefficients of the sectoral shift proxies or of unanticipated

    money.



17. Another way of assessing how much of the variation in UDT is accounted for
                          *                          2
    by movements in UDT would be to look at the R from a regression of
              *
   UDT on UDT .       However, this produces misleading results; the coefficient
          *
    on UDT in this model is in the present case 1.830, which means that any
                  *
    swings in UDT are exaggerated In terms of their effect on UDT.


18. In addition to the models reported here, we also experimented with a

    variety of alternative specifications. These included: creating SIGRESA

   and SIGRESB variables calculated using non—normalized residuals; Including

    eight lags rather than only four lags of ADHR In the employment growth

    equations used to produce SIGRESA and SIGRESB (for consistency with the

    Inclusion of eight lags of DMR in the unemployment and help wanted index

    equations); and estimating the unemployment and help wanted index

    equations for time periods Including earlier years. In most of these

    alternative specifications, the conclusions concerning the effect of the

    residual dispersion measures on unemployment and on the help wanted index

    were even less favorable to the sectoral shift hypothesis than those

    reported here.




                                         —32—
19. If AVERES, a measure of the change in aggregate demand conditions, belcngs

    in the employment growth equations used to create SIGRESB, then for

   consistency some comparable level of aggregate demand conditions variable

    belongs in the unemployment and help wanted index equations which include

   SIGRESB.   A reasonable approach    to constructing such a variable would be

    to cumulate the values of AVERESt over time; including this cumulative

   AVERES   variable   in the column (3) and column (4)   models of Table 3

   actually reduced the estimated effect of SIGRESB still further.

a! All equations were estImated wIth seasonally adjusted quarterly data for
     the 1958:Ql to 1982:Q1 sample period. Detrended Ut, the civilian
     unemployment rate with a linear trend removed, has mean [standard
     deviation] 4.769 [1.267]; detrended NHWIt, the normalized help wanted
     Index with a linear trend removed, has mean [standard deviation] 1.075
     [0.237]. All models were fit allowing for an AR(4) error structure; the
     TSP LSQ procedure was used to specify the estimating equations. Standard
     errors are reported in parentheses.

      growth equation estimated for the sample period 1953:Q1 to l982:Ql which
      includes a constant, a time trend and the current plus four lagged values
      of the change in unanticipated money as explanatory variables; and
      v is the variance of the e1 's over the 1953:Q1 to 1982:Q1 period.

     SIGRESA has a mean [standard deviation] of 0.878 [0.307] over the sample
     period for the models presented here.

el   SIGRESB is defined analogously to SIGRESAt, except that the
     employment growth equations which yield SIGRESBt also include SRESt,
     the employmented—weighted period t average of the errors from OLS
     employment growth equations like the AR(l) models described in footnote
     b, as an explanatory variable. SIGRESB has a mean [standard deviation]
     of O.882[0.248J over the sample period for the models presented here.

d/   The pre—1959 money supply data (Ml) used to create DMR came from Barro
     and Rush (1980) and the post 1959 data from the Federal Reserve
     Bulletin. The money equation which generated DMR. was fit over the sample
     period 1948:Q4 to 1982:Q4 and included four lagged values of Ml, four
     lagged values of the inteeet rate on three month treasury bills and a
     time trend. DMR has a mean [standard deviation] of 0.000 [0.0061 over
     the sample period for the models presented here.

                  Advertising Versus Short Term Movements in
                                 Job Vacancies


    Some insight into how well cyclical swings in help wanted advertising

track cyclical swings in job vacancies can be obtained using job openings data

collected monthly in Minnesota from January 1972 to December 1981. Monthly

help wanted index data are available for Minneapolis/St. Paul for the same

time period. Thus, we are able to compare month to month movements in help

wanted advertising and job vacancies.i"

    We estimated equations of the following form:


(A—i)    in NHWIA =    + I311nVR + y S + 3 T + u

where NHWI represents the city help wanted index divided by metropolitan area

nonagricultural payroll employment, VR represents the metropolitan area

vacancy rate, S is a vector of eleven month dummies, T is a time trend, the

y's and 13's are coefficients to be estimated, and u is an error term. The

published help wanted index data are seasonally adjusted; the available job

vacancy data are not. Rather than seasonally adjust the job vacancy data, we

deseasonalized the help wanted index numbers. A vector of month dummies was

then included in the estimating equation to correct for possible differences

in the pattern of seasonality in the two series. Since we are interested in

how short term movements in the two series compare, not in any possible trend

divergences between the two series, we also included a time trend in the

estimating equations. The estimated coefficient on the lnVR term is equal to

0.884 with a standard error of 0.051. This coefficient estimate is

significantly less than 1.0, which suggests that help wanted advertising may

be somewhat less cyclically responsive than job vacancies. Our main concern

is how closely the two series track each other once trend and cycle have been

controlled for; the equation R2 is a respectable 0.800.


                                 —43—
    The limited pertinent, evidence we have available thus suggests that short

term movements in help wanted advertising track short term movements in job

vacancies reasonably well.1 The fact that the fluctuations in the two

series seem to have somewhat different amplitudes relative to their mean

values does not in and of itself cause any problems with using the normalized

help wanted index as a vacancy rate proxy. Given the deficiencies of the

available job vacancy data, the imperfect correlation between movements in the

two series may be as much attributable to noise in the vacancy data as to

noise in the help wanted index data.

 1. See Abraham (1983) for a more detailed discussion of the Minnesota job

     vacancy data. These Minnesota statistics are the only available vacancy

     data which cover the entire nonagricultural economy of some geographic

    region; were collected for a time period long enough for the economy to

    pass through a complete business cycle; and could be matched with help

    wanted index numbers based on a count of number of help wanted

    advertisements. Thus, they are the only vacancy data which we could use

    for the purpose at hand.



2. Abraham (in progress) considers the separate issue of whether the

    normalized help wanted index and the job vacancy rate have moved together

    over longer periods of time.
