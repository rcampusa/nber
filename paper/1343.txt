                      The 1981—82 Velocity Decline:
              A Structural Shift in Income or Money Demand?

     The velocity of both Ml and M2 appears to have experienced a sharp
and persistent downward shift during 1981 and 1982. The implications of
this shift are reexamined within the context of the previous literature
on quarterly econometric equations explaining the demand for money.

     The traditional specification of money demand equations popularized
by Chow and Goldfeld relates real balances to output, interest rates,
and lagged real balances, all expressed as log levels. A consistent
finding has been a large coefficient on the lagged dependent variable.
While this has been interpreted as Indicating substantial adjustment
costs in portfolio behavior, it is also consistent with lags or
"inertia" in price adjustment due to the presence of long—term wage and
price contracts. The fact that the traditional Chow—Goldfeld money
demand specification encountered large post—sample prediction errors at
the time of the first oil shock in 1973—75 may suggest that a new inter-
pretation of adjustment costs is required. It may be costly to adjust
nominal balances by shifting to alternative assets, but it is costless
for agents to allow real balances to shrink in response to an unantici-
pated price shock, as in 1973—75.

     A substantial amount of evidence is provided on the relationship
between money, income, and interest rates, using alternative dynamic
specifications. The post—1973 prediction error in a demand equation for
Ml is reduced by three—quarters when the equation is specified in
nominal first—difference form rather than in the form of real levels in
logs. Results indicate much smaller post—1979 prediction errors for
equations describing "simple—sum" M2 than for simple—sum Ml, Divisia Ml,
or for Divisia M2 measures of the money supply.

                            I. INTRODUCTION


Monetary Policy and the 1981—82 Decline in Velocity


     The behavior of Ml velocity during the period 1981—82 has set off a

new debate about monetary policy in general and monetary targeting in

particular. Between 1953:Ql and 1979:Q3 the velocity of Ml grew on

average at 3.0 percent per year, but then slowed to a rate of 0.4

percent between 1979:Q4 and l983:Q2. Over the shorter five—quarter

interval between 1981:Q3 and l982:Q4, the velocity of Ml fell absolutely

by 5.5 percent. This episode calls into the question the case for

Federal Reserve targeting on the growth rate of Ml, long espoused by

leading monetarists and adopted by the Fed as a central component of

policy during the three years following October, 1979. Because it

focussed its monetary policy during this period on Ml growth, the

Federal Reserve has been accused of allowing the 1981—82 velocity

decline to be transmitted directly into a dramatic drop in the growth

rate of nominal GNP, from an average annual rate of 10.4 percent in the

three years before 198l:Q3, to an average annual rate of only 2.7

percent between 198l:Q3 and 1982:Q4. This nominal Gr'TP growth rate

collapse was the proximate cause of double—digit unemployment in late

1982 and spurred proposals that the Fed shift from targeting on monetary

aggregates to direct targeting on the growth rate of nominal GNP.1

    The implications of the 1981—82 velocity decline for monetary




    'Previous discussions include Gordon (1984b, 1984c).

policy depend on its origin. The familiar undergraduate textbook expo-

sition of the IS—LM model shows that shifts in velocity can originate in

either the commodity (IS) or money (LM) markets. As Poole demonstrated

in his classic (1970) analysis, for any given variance of IS shifts,

targeting on the money supply rather than the interest rate reduces the

variance of total spending if the demand for money is a stable function

of spending and the interest rate, while targeting on the interest rate

is more desirable and on the money supply less desirable, the more the

money demand function exhibits instability. Thus the behavior of

velocity in 1981—82 appears to reopen the debate over the stability of

the money demand function that is already treated in the large

literature on the "Goldfeld money demand puzzle (Goldfeld 1973, 1976;

Judd—Scadding 1982). If a well—specified money demand equation

estimated through 1979 or 1980 proves to be unstable in 1981 and 1982,

in the same way that many equations estimated through 1972 proved to be

unstable in 1973—76, this would further undermine the case for monetary

targeting.


Alternative Approaches

    Any attempt to design econometric tests that quantify the extent of

instability (if any) in the 1981—82 episode immediately confronts diffi-

cult conceptual issues. These arise because the behavior of velocity,

i.e., the ratio of nominal spending (PQ) to money (M), is addressed by

several hitherto unrelated strands of literature. Clearly the enormous

literature on "structural" money demand equations, including that on the

Goldfeld puzzle, has implications for velocity behavior. But so also

does the literature on St. Louis—type reduced—form equations in which
                                                3




the change in nominal spending is the dependent variable, explained

mainly by current and lagged changes in money. Equally relevant are

equations explaining money and/or spending in Sims—type vector auto-

regressive models (e.g., Sims 1980a, 1980b). More recently Tatom

(1983), the first to address the 1981—82 velocity episode quantita-

tively, has estimated equations that directly specify the rate of change

of velocity as the dependent variable.

     The relation between the money demand and St. Louis approaches can

be discussed initially in terms of a simple money demand equation of the

Goldfeld type. The money demand approach involves variables expressed

in log levels——the quantity of real balances (Mt —                   Pr),   real income

      one or more interest rates (Rn), and the lagged dependent

variable:


            —
                     = a0   +
                                aiQ
                                      —
                                          a2R
                                                +
                                                    a3(M1
                                                              —
                                                                       + e,               (1)


where E is an error term. Taking the derivative of each term with

respect to time, we can write the implied evolution of velocity growth

as follows, where lower—case letters indicate growth rates:


            =        +   —m     =               +         —                   — e.
                Pt                  (l—a1)q         a2r       a3(m                        (2)


In this framework the velocity decline of 1981—82 might be explained by

a decline in real income growth (if a1 < 1), by negative growth in the

interest rate, by rapid growth in real balances last period, or by

positive realizations of the growth—rate error term e——i.e., a contin-

uous increase in the log—level error term 41.

     Some of the issues to be addressed in this paper can be introduced

by writing an equation that explains nominal CNP growth                        +   q)   as

depending on current and lagged money growth (nit), changes in the inter-

est rate (rt), and possible changes in another variable (xe), e.g.,

high—employment expenditures in the St. Louis model:


      Pt +          =      +
                               (L)m          +
                                                 2(L)r   +
                                                             3(L)x   +
                                                                         e,                 (3)


where the coefficients are allowed to be polynomials in the lag

operator. The path of velocity growth implied by (3) is:

     It       is evident that (2) and (4) differ in numerous ways, yet each

purports to describe the evolution of velocity changes. Specification

differences may yield differing conclusions regarding the significance,

magnitude, and even the sign of shifts in the error terms e and e.

This paper develops a parallel analysis of the 1981—82 period of velo-

city decline, and of the 1973—79 period previously identified as invol-

ving shifts in the money demand function (1). After an initial discus-

sion of specification and estimation issues, it turns to estimation of

equations in which levels and changes in various monetary aggregates,

and changes in nominal spending, are alternative dependent variables.


Plan of the Paper

     Part II contains a discussion of specification and estimation

issues, some of which are summarized in the differences between (2) and

(4) above. Among these are the questions of levels vs. changes, real

vs. nominal variables, specification of lag distributions, and

exogeneity. These issues apply to the interrelated literatures on money

demand, money supply, and money reaction functions, as well as to
                                        5




 reduced form equations of the St. Louis and Sims types. Then in Part

 III we turn to the basic characteristics of postwar U. S. data on

 income, money, velocity, and interest rates. Unique features of the

 post—1979 period are highlighted, including the differing behavior of

 simple—sum and Divisia monetary aggregates. The estimated equations for

 levels and changes in monetary aggregates are contained in Part IV, and

 for changes in nominal spending in Part V. Considerable attention is

 paid to the reasons for the differing performance of log level and rate

of change specifications, and to the relation between money demand

functions and reduced—form income change specifications. The paper

concludes in Part VI with a summary of the main results on the nature of

velocity shifts, and with some general recommendations for future

research on money demand.



        II. NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE ECONOMETRICS OF MONEY DEMAND


Simultaneity and Exogeneity

     Equation (1) above is written in exactly the form estimated by

Coldfeld (1973). When estimated for l953:Q1—1972:Q4, a sample period

close to that in his original article, the estimated parameters and t

ratios are as follows:2


          Mt —     = 0.032    + O.045Q — O.013R + O.941(M           —      (5)
                                                                1
                     [0.34j    [6.281       [—6.031   [41.41

_______________                         R2 =   0.990, S.E.E. = 0.00505


2The only important differences between (5) and Coldfeld's basic
equation are that to simplify the subsequent exposition we use only the
Treasury bill rate to represent Rt and omit Goldfeld's second interest
rate, that on time deposits, and also we do not perform the Cochrane—
Orcutt correction for first—order serial correlation.
                                   6




     Without regard to the poor post—sample forecasting performance of

(5), to be discussed subsequently, several features immediately stand

out. First, the specification relates the current level of real balan-

ces to the lagged dependent variable and to two endogenous variables,

real output and the nominal interest rate. The specification thus

assumes away the questions of simultaneity and exogeneity that play a

leading role in recent discussions (Sims, l98Oa) of vector—

autoregressive (VAR) models. In the specification of a VAR model,

separate equations are provided to explain each endogenous variable, in

this case real balances, real output, and the interest rate. The usual

practice is to omit contemporary right—hand variables at the estimation

stage, thus forcing any contemporaneous correlation between, say, real

balances and real output, to show up as a correlation between current

innovations (error terms) in the real balance and real output equations.

Simulations of the effect of an exogenous shock require that some

assumption be made about the causal ordering of the relation. As shown

by Gordon and King (1982, p. 212—3), it is impossible to avoid making an

arbitrary decision about the ordering, and any such choice amounts to a

decision about admitting current variables into the estimating equation.

    The necessity for this arbitrary choice is usually swept under the

rug in the discussion of money demand equations, but it seems just as

plausible to assume that money is exogenous in the short run as to

assume as in (5) that output is exogenous. In fact the direction of

contemporaneous influence may have shifted over time, since the Fed has

moved from interest rates to monetary aggregates as its main target. As

recognized in the recent surveys by Laidler (1980) and Judd—Scadding

(1982), it seems plausible to explore as alternatives to (5) the
                                       7




 possibilities that interest rates and/or real CNP adjust to exogenous

 changes in money. The St. Louis practice of estimating equations for

nominal GNP change which include contemporaneous money change on the

right—hand side involve an alternative assumption about the direction of

short—run dynamic adjustment.

     A plausible sequence of events can be illustrated in the IS—LM

model. The initial exogenous event is a shift in money supply or demand

that moves the LM curve. Because the financial market clears faster

than the commodity market, the economy moves initially to the crossing

point of the current output level with the new LM curve. Thus the

monetary shift and the resulting change in the interest rate occur

almost simultaneously (and are observed to be simultaneous in quarterly

data). Subsequently the change in the interest rate and in money,

through their respective substitution and wealth effects, induce a

change in spending and cause the economy to move to the intersection of

the IS curve with the new LM curve.3

     Consider the implications of this sequence for equation (5). If the

sequence is initiated by an exogenous increase in the money supply, the

contemporaneous correlation between Mt —    and Rt is negative.

However, if initiated by a shift in the money demand function, that

correlation is positive. Each episode of a money demand shift contri-

butes a positive correlation that cancels out part or all of the nega-

tive correlation provided by the money supply shifts and thus biases

toward zero the allegedly "structural" coefficient a2. Worse yet, the




3This adjustment process in the IS—LM model is applied to the 1981—82
recession in Gordon (1984), p. 151.
                                    8




size of this bias depends on the mix of supply and demand shifts

occurring in a particular sample period, and out—of—sample drift of the

"Goldfeld puzzle variety could result from a change in this mix.

Similarly, the low estimated    coefficient on current output could

result simply from lags in the response of output to monetary change.


Serially Correlated Money Demand Shifts and the Effects of Supply Shocks

     There remains the interpretation of the large a3 coefficient on the

lagged dependent variable, a universal feature of estimates of the

Goldfeld specification, no matter which particular variables are used to

represent    and Rt (see Judd—Scadding, 1982, Table 1, pp. 996—7).

Consider first the influence of demand shifts that exhibit positive

serial correlation. Since there is no other variable on the right—hand

side of (5) to explain this source of change in the dependent variable,

all of the explanation is attributed to the lagged dependent variable.

More generally, the omission from the specification of y relevant

variable which happens to exhibit positive serial correlation causes an

upward bias on the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable.

     More generally the Goldfeld specification may in part represent a

spurious relation in the sense of Granger—Newbold (1974), and it may be

possible to improve the performance of post—sample dynamic simulations

by differencing (Plosser—Schwert, 1978). The large coefficient on the

lagged dependent variable may result mainly from a trend in the

dependent variable that is not filtered out by prior detrending or by

inclusion of a trend as an explanatory variable.

    These factors, a downward bias in the coefficients on output and

the interest rate, and an upward bias in the coefficient on the lagged
                                    9




dependent variable, help to explain the tendency of the post—1972

predicted values of (5) to drift in dynamic simulations, responding

little to changes in output and interest rates and tracking little of

the actual observed change in real balances. But there is another

important feature of the post—1973 period which has received extensive

attention in the literature on price changes (e.g., Gordon, 1977, 1982),

but apparently none in the literature on money demand. Despite the

much—discussed inertia in the U. S. inflation process, the rate of

inflation exhibited a sharp increase in 1973—74. I have previously

attributed this jump to the simultaneous effects of an increase in the

relative prices of food and energy, of a depreciation in the dollar, and

of the termination of the Nixon—era price controls.4 Then again in 1979—

80 there was another sharp acceleration in the inflation rate at the

time of the second oil shock ('OPEC II") and following a substantial

depreciation of the dollar in 1977—79.

     Now consider the response of the real demand for money implied by

specification (1) and (5). Goldfeld's inclusion of the lagged dependent

variable is based on the partial adjustment scheme of Chow (1966), in

which real money balances adjust with a lag to changes in money demand

caused by changes in real output and the interest rate. Presumably the

reason for the gradual adjustment is the existence of transaction costs

which cause optimizing individual agents to choose voluntarily to delay

full and instantaneous adjustment to every change in output and the

interest rate. What is the impact on individuals of a supply shock that

causes a sudden 10 percent jump in the price level? Because transaction




   similar verdict is reached in Eckstein (1980).
                                     I0




costs depend on transfers of nominal balances among currency, demand

deposits, and alternative forms of asset holding, each agent minimizes

transaction cost by allowing a full 10 percent decline in real balances.

There is no lagged adjustment at all in the response of real balances to

the supply shock, erroneously labelled in the Coldfeld literature as a

"money demand shift."

     Thus, in aggregating from the individual to the entire economy,

Chow, Goldfeld, and their followers have neglected the fundamentally

different ways in which the numerator (M) and denominator (P) of real

balances influence individual agents. The adjustment costs affecting

nominal balances (N) depend on a set of considerations other than the

factors (e.g., length and degree of indexation of wage contracts) that

influence   the degree of inertia in the adjustment of the price level.
The fact that the Goldfeld equation and conventional Phillips—curve wage
and price equations went off the track after 1972 does not appear to be
mere coincidence. Before 1973, both nominal money growth and inflation

were inertia prone, whereas after 1973 the variance of inflation

increased dramatically relative to that of money growth. To make this

point, Figure 1 displays the actual values of Mt        plotted against

the fitted values when (5) is simulated dynamically for the ten years

following the end of the l953:Q1—1972:Q4 sample period. The bottom

frame exhibits the detrended log level of the GNP deflator. We note

that sharp drops in actual real balances occur precisely at the time of

the two major supply shock episodes, 1973—early 1975 and 1979—80.

    What seems to have occurred is that Goldfeld estimated his original

demand for money equation over the same quiescent 1953—72 period which

misled Fama (1975) into claiming that the real interest rate was con—

 stant, and that misled numerous investigators into thinking that the

Phillips curve was a stable function of unemployment and lagged wages or

prices. The resemblance between Goldfeld's equation and a Phillips

curve is evident when we rearrange (1) as follows:


               —           =                                          —
                    a3P1       —a0   —aiQ + a2R ÷ Mt —         a3M1       e.   (6)


Let us assume that the interest rate can be decomposed into a real

interest rate, which can be written as a constant plus a linear function

of real output, and an expected inflation term, which is simply equal to

last period's actual rate of inflation:


             Rt =    0÷        +
                                    't—l   +
                                               e.
We now rewrite (6) with this expression for the interest rate substi-

tuted for Rt, and with the additional assumption that, because of the

values close to unity for a3, found in most empirical research, a3 in

(6) can be approximated by 1.0:


             Pt = a2p0 + (a2pi_ai)Q            +               ÷ a2eR —   M
                                                    a2p1   +
                                                                          e.   (7)



(Recall that lower—case letters represent rates of change, and so
   =     —
                    and mt = Mt —    Mt_i.)
       If we can view (7) as an approximation to the reduced—form infla-

tion equation implied by most pre—1973 Phillips curve research, then we

can interpret post—1973 prediction errors as caused by the omission of

variables to represent the effects of supply shocks and flexible ex-

change rates. These factors caused the rate of inflation to accelerate

relative to the prediction of an equation like (7). Converted back into

its "dual," the money demand equation (1), the supply shocks had the
                                       12




effect of introducing a serially correlated negative error term that has

been misinterpreted as a 'money demand puzzle."


The Case for Spending Changes as the Dependent Variable


     The two preceding sections develop two independent sets of reasons

to reject (1) as a plausible formulation of the relation between money

and spending. First, because the financial market is likely to clear

faster than the commodity market, it is likely that money and interest

rates are simultaneously determined, and that output experiences its

major adjustment in a subsequent period. While all three variables are

endogenous, the postulated timing relationship, if true, suggests that

treating output rather than money as the dependent variable is more

sensible in studies of quarterly dynamics. Second, the role of supply

shocks in raising the growth rates of prices and reducing the growth

rate of output, while leaving the growth rate of nominal CNP relatively

unaffected, suggests that the study of reduced—form macroeconomic rela-

tionships may be usefully dichotomized into questions involving (a) the

response of nominal GNP changes to changes in nominal money and interest

rates, and (b) the division of those nominal GNP changes between infla-

tion and real GNP changes. If we write nominal GNP changes as depending

on past changes in money and interest rates, and the inflation rate as

depending on its own lagged value, on the level and change in

(detrended) output and on the influence of supply shocks (zt), we can

determine output change as a residual. Thus:


            +
                       f(mt_1,rt_1);                              (8)


                Pt =                        implying              (9)
                                        13




                     =
                         li(m_1, ri              zr).                  (10)

if   this dichotomy is valid, then velocity changes are determined com-

pletely by (8) and are entirely independent of supply shocks and other

factors determining the rate of inflation:


                          —m    =                    —
                  Pt +                f(mt_1,r._i)       m.            (11)


We conclude, then, that the topic of this paper is best studied in the

framework of (8). One possible econometric specification of (8) is the

VAR equation (3) written above in Part I. The conventional Goldfeld

money demand specification is rejected, because it mixes      up the conse-
quences   of supply shocks, portfolio shifts, and lags in the response of

spending to financial market events, under the misleading rubric of the

'structural money demand equation."



                     III. BASIC FEATURES OF THE DATA


      This section presents descriptive statistics on the growth rates of

spending, money, and velocity, as well as on the level of short—term and

long—term interest rates. The period between 1953:Q1 and 1979:Q3 is

divided into three roughly equal intervals of nine years each. The

period after 1979:Q3 is treated as a separate interval, reflecting the

widespread interest in the impact, if any, of the change in Federal

Reserve targeting procedures that took place in October, 1979. Varia-

bles examined in the tables in this section are nominal GNP, nominal

final sales, the Treasury bill rate, the corporate bond rate, and six

different monetary aggregates. These include the monetary base, simple—

sum Ml and M2, and the Divisia growth rates of Ml, M2, and M3. In
                                   14



addition six velocity change measures are examined, expressed as the
change in nominal final sales minus, respectively, the change in   the   six
monetary aggregates.

Changes in Spending and in Monetary Aggregates

     The top half of Table 1 exhibits mean rates of change, and the

bottom half displays standard deviations of rates of change, expressed

alternatively as one—quarter and four—quarter changes. There are five

columns in the table, corresponding to the three nine—year intervals

(1953—61, 1962—70, and 1971—79), and two alternative measures for the

period extending form 1979:Q4 to 1983:Q2. The straightforward calcula-

tion in the fourth column is supplemented by an additional figure in the

fifth column that excludes the two quarters most affected by the Carter

credit controls (1980:Q2 and l980:Q3).

    The collection of mean rates of change in the upper section of

Table 1 confirms the well—known fact that nominal spending and monetary

growth accelerated together from the decade of the 195Os to the 196Os

and the l97Os. The slowdown in spending growth after 1979 contrasts

with an unchanged growth rate for the monetary base and a slight accel-

eration for the conventional Ml measure; this is the counterpart of the

decline in Ml velocity growth that occurred in 1981—82. There is con-

siderable diversity among the six monetary aggregates, with a slight

deceleration after 1979 for the conventional M2 measure and a sharp

deceleration for the Divisia M2 and M3 aggregates.

    A central feature of the recent debate is the differing interpreta-

tion by monetarists and nonmonetarists of the Fed's monetary policy

between 1979 and 1982. Nonmonetarists claim that the Fed aggravated the

1981—82 recession by adhering too closely to the longstanding monetarist

recommendation of Ml targeting and thus ignored the consequences of the

persistent decline in Ml velocity. Monetarists counter that the Fedts

actions bore no resemblance to nionetarist recommendations for a constant

growth rate monetary rule, since the quarter—to—quarter variance of

monetary growth increased markedly after 1979. In fact monetarists have

tended   to blame several of the unusual features of the 1979—82 period,
including high interest rates and an increase in the demand for money,
on   the high variance of Ml growth.

      The bottom half of Table 1 exhibits several measures of the stan-

dard deviation of spending and monetary growth. Each cell contains two

figures separated by a slanted line; the first represents the standard

deviation of successive one—quarter rates of change, and the second

represents the standard deviation in quarterly data of overlapping four—

quarter rates of change. The four—quarter variance is emphasized here

to reflect the finding of previous research on St. Louis—type equations

that nominal spending growth responds to a four—quarter moving average

of monetary change, not just to a single quarter. When the standard

deviation of one—quarter changes of Ml is examined, we find a marked

increase from 2.0 percentage points in 1971—79 to 5.2 points in 1979—

83. The latter figure is reduced to 3.6 points when the credit control

quarters (l980:Q2—3) are omitted, but this still represents almost a

doubling of the standard deviation. Much of this increase in Ml vari-

ance, however, appears to represent quarter—to—quarter movements that

are not sustained over a full year, since the post—1979 increase in the

standard deviation of overlapping four—quarter changes is less marked.

For conventional M2 and for all three of the Divisia measures, the
                                     It)



standard deviation of four—quarter overlapping changes   actually

decreased after 1919, and this is true even ii the middle 1980 quarters
are not excluded.
     Table   2 uses the same format as Table 1 to summarize the recent

behavior of the rate of change of six different velocity measures and of

the level of the nominal Treasury bill and corporate bond rates. In the

top section the sharp slowdown in velocity growth for the monetary base

and Ml is a familiar result, but less well known is the reverse phenome—

non——a sharp acceleration in velocity growth for Divisia M2 and M3. The

Divisia calculation seems to make no appreciable difference for Ml but

converts a mild slowdown in M2 velocity into a marked increase.

     The array of standard deviations in the bottom half of Table 2

tells a consistent story of more variable velocity and interest rates

after 1979 by every measure shown. It is interesting to note that, when

the middle quarters of 1980 are omitted, the standard deviation of velo-

city growth is lowest for the monetary base on a one—quarter change

basis, and lowest for the base and for divisia Ml on a four—quarter

change basis. Despite the widespread attention paid to the unstable

behavior of Ml velocity in 1981—82, the variance of M2 velocity is

actually higher than that of Ml velocity during 1979—83 by both the

conventional and Divisia measures.

     Table 3 summarizes the changes between the 1971—79 and 1979—83

intervals (with l980:Q2—3 omitted) for both means and standard devia-

tions. Here again we see that there is a marked slowdown in monetary

growth and acceleration in velocity growth for Divisia M2 and M3, but

the reverse for conventional Ml and Divisia Ml. The ratios of standard

deviations demonstrate the familiar increase in Ml variance on a one—

quarter basis, much emphasized by the monetarists, but the less familiar

decline in the variance of M2 and all three Divisia indexes on a four—

quarter change basis. The standard deviation of velocity increases

after 1979 for all monetary measures and does so more on the four—

quarter change basis than the one—quarter change basis. This indicates

that, while the extra variance of money after 1979 took the form of

quarter—to—quarter wiggles that did not persist for a year, the

increased variance of velocity took the form of persistent shifts last-

ing a year or longer.

     The apparent persistence of post—1979 velocity shifts has an impor-

tant implication for policy. While the Fed cannot act rapidly enough to

offset velocity movements lasting only a single quarter, it may be able

to offset at least part of serially correlated velocity movements last-

ing a year or more. This is the essence of the case I have made else-

where in support of a nominal spending growth target for the Fed and it

renders ineffective the recent attack by Karl Brunner (1983) on my

nominal GNP targeting proposal, since his demonstration is valid only if

velocity "is controlled approximately by a white noise process."



        IV. ALTERNATIVE EQUATIONS EXPLAINING REAL AND NOMINAL
                         MONETARY AGGREGATES


The Goldfeld Specification


     Figure 1 has already exhibited the pattern of persistent serially

correlated errors that typically result when a Goldfeld—type demand for

money equation is subjected to a post—sample dynamic simulation. In

Table 4 we examine the post—sample tracking ability of several versions

of the Goldfeld specification and compare these to an alternative
arrangement of the same variables. The first line displays the basic

result written above as equation (5). Here the dependent variable is

the log level of real Ml, and the explanatory variables are the logs of

real GNP and of the Treasury bill rate, and the lagged dependent varia-

ble. The equation is estimated for 1953:Ql through 1972.:Q4, yielding a

sample—period standard error of estimate of .00505, or roughly half a

percentage point. However, in a dynamic simulation for the period

1973:Ql through 1979:Q3, the root—mean—squared error (RNSE) is .110, or

eleven percent, and the mean error is —.099. Thus on average the actual

value of real balances during 1973—79 is ten percent below the predicted

value. The three right—hand columns of Table 4 exhibit the standard

error when the sample period is extended to 1979:Q3 (.00627), and the

performance of the extended equation in a dynamic simulation for l979:Q4

through 1983:Q2. The 1979—83 RMSE is .03 and mean error is —.023, so

that the equation has the same tendency to overpredict real Ml, albeit

with a smaller error than during 1973—79.

       Additional variants of the Goldfeld specification are shown on the

next   three lines of Table 4. Because a notable feature of the 1981—82
episode is the decline in nominal GNP relative to nominal personal con-
sumption expenditures   (PCE), it has been suggested that the velocity

puzzle could be partly explained if money demand depended more on

consumption than on total spending. However, Table 4 shows that when

real PCE is substituted for real GNP in the Goldfeld specification, the

in—sample and out—of—sample performance of the equation is uniformly

inferior. Versions are also shown with real M2 as the dependent varia-

ble, and real GNP and real PCE as alternative income variables, with

results that are quite similar to those for Ml. Perhaps the only en—

couraging feature of these results is the relatively small post—sample

error for the M2/GNF equation when simulated over the 1979—83 period.


An Alternative Specification

     Our discussion above in Part II criticized the Goldfeld specifi-

cation for applying the Chow gradual adjustment approach to real

balances, on the grounds that individual agents face different sets of

transaction costs to achieve changes in nominal balances than in

response to externally—imposed changes in the price level. Another

potential weakness in that specification is the possibility of a spur-

ious regression when a lagged dependent variable is allowed to enter an

equation for a variable that is not detrended yet contains a pronounced

trend.

     The bottom half of Table 4 exhibits equations which alter both of

these features of the Goldfeld approach. In place of log levels all

variables are defined as first differences. And both the monetary and

income variables are expressed in nominal rather than real form.

Finally, a series of lagged terms is allowed to enter, rather than just

one. Thus the specification can be written as:


            m =     + a1(L)(p+q)   +
                                       a2(L)r   +
                                                    a3(L)m   1
                                                                 +
                                                                     e',   (12)


where the L notation as before indicates a polynomial in the lag

operator.

     The first line in the bottom half of Table 4 exhibits results when

(12) is estimated with the quarterly rate of change of Ml as the depen-

dent variable, and the current and three lagged values of quarterly real

GNP changes is the explanatory income variable. Also included are the
                                     LU




 current   and three lagged changes in the Treasury bill rate, and four

 successive lags of the dependent variable. The coefficients shown in

Table 4 are sums of coefficients, and it is evident that the alternative

specification yields higher coefficients for income and lower coeffi—

cients for the lagged dependent variable than the Goldfeld specifica-

tion. The standard error of estimate is also lower, and this is

particularly true for the extended 1953—79 sample period (units of

measurement are comparable across the two specifications when the rate

of change is calculated as the first difference in the log). Also

impressive is the fact that the standard error does not increase at all

when the end of the sample period is extended from 1973 to 1979.

Corresponding to this evidence of stability is the important result that

the post—sample dynamic simulation for 1973—79 yields a RNSE of only

.025 as compared to .110 in the Goldfeld specification, and a mean error

of only —.018 as compared to —.099. These measures of simulation per-

formance are made comparable for the one—quarter change specification by

calculating the fitted log level of Ml as the 1972:Q4 actual value plus

the cumulated one—quarter—change errors.

     Figure 2 compares the actual and fitted values from the log—level

specification for real balances with implied fitted values from the

alternative approach (the latter is the cumulated fitted log level

series for nominal Ml minus the actual log GNP deflator). While the

alternative specification yield.s a much improved prediction performance

for 1973—83, it still indicates the existence of money demand puzzles in

1976—78 (when there was too little money) and in 1982 (when there was a

sharp unexplained increase in the level of real balances).

    It is possible to allocate the source of the improvement in

 prediction performance for the alternative fitted series in Figure 2

 between the two major differences in specification——nominal vs. real and

 changes vs. log levels. This can be done by calculating 1973—79 post—

 sample dynamic simulations for four versions: log level real, log level

 nominal, one—quarter—change real, and one—quarter--change nominal. In

 each case the sample period is l953:Q1—l972:Q4, and the errors for the

 one—quarter—change versions are calculated by cumulating errors into the

 implied fitted log level series, as described above:


                              Prediction Record, 1973:Ql—l979:Q3
                              Mean Error            RNSE

         Log Level Real        —.0985               .1101

         Log Level Nominal     —.0772               .0919

         Change Real           —.0440              .0514

         Change Nominal        —.0179              .0252


Thus it appears that both aspects of the change in specification make a

major contribution to the improved post—sample predictive performance of

the nominal change version. In terms of the absolute reduction in the

prediction error, the shift from log levels to rates of change is more

important than the shift from a real to a nominal specification.



    V. ALTERNATIVE EQUATIONS EXPLAINING CHANGES IN NOMINAL SPENDING


     The introduction to this paper contrasted explanations of velocity

changes based on equations explaining the evolution of money and alter-

native equations in which nominal spending is the dependent variable.

This section describes results obtained when specification (3) above is

estimated for postwar quarterly data on nominal spending, nominal money,
                                   22




and the Treasury bill rate. As summarized in Table 5, the results are

identical in all details to those shown in the bottom half of Table 4,

except that the roles of the dependent and first independent variable

are switched. Now the dependent variable is the one—quarter rate of

change of spending, and the list of independent variables includes the

current and three lagged changes in money and in the Treasury bill rate,

as well as four values of the lagged dependent variable. Table 5 shares

with Table 4 its display of results for an "early" sample period

(l953:Ql—1972:Q4) and corresponding post—sample dynamic simulation

interval (l973:Q1—1979:Q3) and an "extended" sample period (1953:Q1—

1979:Q3) and corresponding post—sample dynamic simulation interval

(1979:Q4—1983:Q2). The only difference between nominal GNP and final

sales is the inclusion of inventory change in the former and its

omission from the latter. By including the nominal final sales version

of spending, we are interested in whether the inclusion or exclusion of

inventory changes makes any difference in the study of shifts in

velocity and money demand.

    The first few columms of Table 5 display the sums of coefficients

in the 1953—72 versions of the equations. In all six versions the

current and lagged changes in money are strongly significant, and the

current and lagged changes in the Treasury bill rate are significant in

all versions but the last one listed. The sum of coefficients on the

lagged dependent variable is negative in most versions, highlighting an

interesting difference between positive serial correlation of money

changes and negative serial correlation of income changes. The modest

increase in the standard errors of estimate in all of the spending

equations in Table 5, as contrasted with the money change equations in
                                    23




 the bottom half of Table 4, is consistent with the higher standard

 deviations for spending changes observed for the l9SOs and l97Os in the

 statistical summary of Table 1.

      The post—sample dynamic simulation performance of all the 1953—72

nominal spending equations is quite poor. The mean errors and RMSE

statistics are calculated in the same way as in Table 4, by cumulating

one—quarter—change errors into implied fitted values of log levels.

Each of the six equations for 1953—72 displays a tendency to drift, with

the major error occurring in the form of a substantial underprediction

of spending changes in 1976—78. Thus the Goldfeld money—demand puzzle

emerges in a stronger form in Table 5 than in the bottom half of Table

4, albeit restated in a different way. The question now becomes, "why

was the growth of nominal spending in 1976—78 more rapid than could have

been explained by the earlier behavior of money growth and changes in

interest rates?' A full resolution of this puzzle is beyond the scope

of the paper. A fruitful avenue may lie in an exploration of the

difference between nominal and real interest rates; we know that the

l970s were distinguished by low or negative values of real interest

rates and by unprecedented increases in the real value of home prices,

and these two factors could have contributed to the ebullience of

nominal spending growth during the 1976—78 interval.

     The post—sample prediction performance of the nominal spending

equations in Table 5 is markedly superior when the sample period is

extended to 1979:Q3, and dynamic simulations are performed for l979:Q4—

1983:Q2. Leaving aside the results for the nominal PCE variable in the

last two lines of the table, it appears that M2 yields a relatively

accurate forecasting performance. The mean error in the nominal GNP

 equations that use M2 as the explanatory monetary variable is only

 .00/5, the lowest of any of the post—sample mean errors in Tables 4 or

 5. At least in this limited way the results here support the verdict of

Tatom (1983) that there was no velocity puzzle in 1981—82, at least in

 the form of sharp or unprecedented forecasting errors. The RMSE

statistics indicate that the post—sample forecasting performance of M2

in both the nominal Gt'P and nominal final sales equations is superior to

that of Ml, despite a slightly higher in—sample standard error of

estimate. However, M2 does very poorly in tracking the post—sample

behavior of nominal personal consumption expenditures (PCE).

     While much attention has recently been given to Divisia aggregates

of monetary change, there appears to be little evidence in our results

of a superior forecasting record of Divisia aggregates in the 1979—83

period. Because the available data on Divisia aggregates extends back

only to 1969, we cannot repeat all of the tests displayed in Tables 4

and 5. Instead here we briefly summarize the results of analogous

experiments in which changes in nominal spending are explained for the

period 197O:Ql—1979:Q3 on the basis of alternative monetary change

aggregates and of the other variables listed in Table 5. Then, based on

these estimated coefficients, dynamic simulations are calculated for

1979:Q4 through l983:Q2. Because the results are similar for nominal

final sales and nominal PCE, the followhg table summarizes the results

only for equations explaining quarterly changes in nominal GNP:

     The estimated equations for changes in nominal money and nominal

spending represent alternative rearrangements of the same variables.

However, the pattern of lag coefficients in the various equations pro-

vides an interesting interpretation of endogeneity—exogeneity relation-

ships among changes in spending, monetary aggregates, and the Treasury

bill rate. Because Table 4 includes three lagged values of monetary

changes in equations explaining spending, it is possible to use the

results already estimated to perform Granger exogeneity tests. This

test would, for instance, describe money as exogenous with respect to

nominal GNP if lagged values of nominal GNP do not make a significant

contribution to equations in which money is the dependent variable.

     An entire paper could be written on the nature of exogeneity

relationships between money and spending. Here we take advantage of the

symmetry between specifications (3) and (12) to provide a brief summary

of the role of lagged money and spending variables for the 1953—79

sample period. In the following table each number is a significance

level; as before asterisks are used to denote significance levels of 5

percent or better (*) and 1 percent or better (**).    Each significance

level describes an F test in which a particular set of lagged variables

is respectively included and excluded from a particular equation:

       The implications of this table are surprising, at least to me. The

strongest feedback relationship is from          the   Treasury bill rate to money.

This would he compatible with an interpretation of the money equations

as describing the evolution of (a) money demand, or (b) a money reaction

function when the Fed is trying to stabilize interest rates. The only

equation in which there is strong evidence of feedback from spending to

money is in the equation explaining changes in Ml as a function of

current and lagged changes in nominal PCE. Contrary to the assumption

of St. Louis—type equations, three out of the four variants reveal no

significant feedback from money to spending. This occurs only in the

version explaining changes in nominal GNP          growth by current and past
changes In Ml growth, but not in versions involving nominal PCE or M2.

Equally    important is the lack of any strong influence of past interest

rate changes on nominal GNP or PCE.

       The absence of a strong feedback from money to spending, excent for

the Ml—nominal GNP    equation,   suggests that further research in this area

might well follow the lead of King (1983), who shows that there is a

weak influence of past changes in the monetary base on income hut a

strong influence of past changes in the money multiplier (i.e., Ml

divided by the base). King's hypothesis is confirmed in my own pre—

liminary explorations of the relations among the base, multiplier, and
                                      27




spending (Gordon, 1984c). The strong influence on interest rates on

money exhibited above suggests the possibility of a channel running

between interest rates and the money multiplier to iiasured monetary

aggregates, and from there to spending.



                                VI. CONCLUSION


     This paper took as its point of departure the puzzling decline of

velocity in 1981—82. Along the way it examined and criticized the con-

ventional approach to the estimation of money demand equations. Still

remaining is a quantitative description of the 1981—82 episode. When

the specification of Table 5 is estimated for the "extended" period

1953:Q1—1979:Q3, the following post—sample simulation errors result when

nominal GNP changes are used as the dependent variables and Ml and M2 as

alternative dependent variables. As before, errors in the one—quarter

changes are cumulated to yield a fitted value of the log level of

spending, starting from the actual value in 1979:Q3. The following

shows the actual and fitted log levels of velocity, calculated as the

actual and fitted log levels of nominal GNP minus the log levels of Ml

and N2, respectively:


                  Log of Ml Velocity                Log of M2 Velocity

      The conclusion I reach from these results is that there was a major

 downward shift in the velocity of Ml in 1981—82, and that this shift

 displays a iste over several quarters. Errors for M2 are much

 smaller, exceeding one percentage point only in 19BO:Q4—198l:Q4 (actual

 velocity higher than predicted) and in l982:Q4—1983:Q2 (actual
                                                                   velocity
 lower than predicted). The superior performance of M2 in these ex-

 periments does not necessarily mean that M2 can be used as a monetary

 target, because there seems to be little feedback from       M2 changes

to current changes in nominal GNP or PCE, as shown in the above summary

of exogeneity results.

     The main conclusion of this paper is that the standard log—level—

real specification used in most previous studies of the demand for money

is deeply flawed. However, on the more substantive issue of velocity

shifts in 1976—78 and 1981—82, this paper raises as many questions as it

settles. By any measure there seems to have been a reduction in money

demand and increase in velocity in the 1976—78 period which cannot be

explained by any past behavior of changes in spending, money, or inter-

est rates. There was a reverse shift toward higher money demand and

lower velocity in 1981—82. The fact that the post—sample simulation

errors are much larger for Ml than for M2 in 1981—82 suggests that the

underlying explanation in that episode may lie in changing financial

regulations that affected components of Ml more than those of M2. But

the earlier 1976—78 episode still warrants further investigation, since

it does not seem to be synchronized with the timing of financial

innovations.
