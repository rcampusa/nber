This paper proposes a theoretically based and easy-to-implement way to measure the systemic risk
of financial institutions using publicly available accounting and stock market data. The measure models
the credit enhancement taxpayers provide to individual banks in the Merton tradition (1974) as a combination
put option for the deep tail of bank losses and a knock-in stop-loss call on bank assets. This model
expresses the value of taxpayer loss exposure from a string of defaults as the value of this combination
option written on the portfolio of industry assets. The exercise price of the call is the face value of
the debt of the entire sector. We conceive of an individual bank’s systemic risk as its contribution
to the value of this sector-wide option on the financial safety net. To the extent that authorities are
slow to see bank losses or reluctant to exercise the call, the government itself becomes a secondary
source of systemic risk. We apply our model to quarterly data over the period 1974-2013. The model
indicates that systemic risk reached unprecedented highs during the financial crisis years 2008-2009,
and that bank size, leverage, and asset risk are key drivers of systemic risk.

           Each new financial crisis intensifies efforts by policymakers and academics to improve

strategies and protocols for monitoring and resolving losses at large, complex, and politically

influential financial institutions. Key problems include the need to develop timely measures such

as CoVar (Adrian and Brunnermier, 2008) and SRISK (Brownlee and Engel, 2015) that link the

risk exposures undertaken by individual institutions to the risk of a breakdown in the financial

system as a whole. This risk of breakdown is known as systemic risk.

           We follow Engle, Jondeau, and Rockinger (2012) in defining an individual bank’s

systemic risk as its propensity to be undercapitalized when the financial system as a whole is

undercapitalized. This definition allows us to include in the risk-generation process the channels

through which regulation and supervision might mitigate or amplify this risk. It is well known

that the existence of a safety net incentivizes banks to increase their exposure to ruinous losses,

to under-reserve for these loss exposures, and to conceal such losses when they occur (Kane,

1989; Demirguc-Kunt and Huizinga, 2004; and Skinner, 2008). Profit-driven safety net abuse is

deeply implicated in modern financial crises (Rochet, 2008).                        Even though policymakers

recognize the depth of this incentive problem and seek to monitor the regulatory arbitrage it

produces, profit-maximizing managers are driven to extract value from financial safety net

support in hard-to-observe ways.

           When tail risks drive a large, complex, or politically influential bank into insolvency, the

difficulty of exercising the government’s call can transform safety-net management into a nasty

game of chicken whose outcome generates bailout expense for taxpayers.1 When deep or

widespread insolvencies emerge, fiscal and monetary authorities typically shift losses to

    This is essentially what is known popularly as the “too big to fail” problem.

taxpayers because it is the path of administrative and political least resistance (Honohan and

Klingebiel, 2003; Veronesi and Zingales, 2010; Laeven and Valencia, 2013).

       Regulators such as Timothy Geithner argue that it is in society’s best interest to minimize

the possibility of contagious defaults. As long as sovereign and cross-country credit support

remains credible, authorities can prevent widespread substantial spillovers of actual defaults

from taking place.      This has led officials around the world to block actual defaults by

“systemically important” firms. They have done this by guaranteeing such a firm’s access to

credit even when difficulties it encountered in rolling over its liabilities strongly suggested that it

had become economically insolvent.

       The goal of this paper is to propose a measure of systemic risk that is based in theory and

easy to implement using publicly available financial and stock market data. Our methods are

rooted in academic literature for modeling credit risk pioneered by Merton (1974). Merton

models stockholder equity as a put option that stockholders write on firm assets. Merton (1977,

1978), Marcus and Shaked (1984), Ronn and Verma (1986), Duan, Moreau and Sealey (1992)

and others have adapted this approach to express the value of US deposit insurance as if it were a

one-year put option written by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In this paper,

we build on this tradition, but reinterpret the losses to which banking-sector activity exposes

taxpayers through the safety net as an implicit contra-liability that transfers responsibility for

covering the losses of insolvent banks to taxpayers.

       To fashion a role for forbearance, we interpret this contra-liability as the value of the

combination of a put option written on the losses that can be generated by a portfolio of

aggregate bank assets with a call on these same bank assets whose exercise price equals the face




                                                  3
value of aggregate bank debt.2 This interpretation treats the taxpayer put and call as helping to

complete markets and lets us calculate each individual bank’s systemic risk as its contribution to

the value of the banking sector’s aggregate portfolio of put-call positions.

         From a contracting perspective, the option is a credit enhancement and the disruptive

effects on the real economy from bank distress are separable from this. The value of the put and

creditor predictions about the role of forbearance in exercising the associated call are impounded

into the stock price, borrowing rates, and margin requirements for derivative contracts of every

firm whose economic insolvency seems unlikely to be resolved promptly. The net value of the

portfolio of twinned options provides a gross estimate of the cost to taxpayers of supporting the

banking system. Given that benefits tend to dwarf deposit insurance premiums in crisis

circumstances, during panics, it may be a good approximation of the net costs as well.

         We estimate our model over the period 1974-2013, using quarterly data on U.S. bank

holding companies. This 30-year observation window lets us compare the behavior of systemic

risk during the financial crisis period 2008-2009 with its behavior in earlier crises and recessions.

         The results track the effects of bank risk taking and regulatory forbearance on taxpayer

risk exposure during and in advance of the last four business-cycle expansions and contractions,

reaching an all-time high at the peak of the 2008-2009 crisis. We estimate the annualized per-

quarter value of sample banks’ stand-alone and systemic risk using financial statements from the

Compustat database for U.S. banks and daily stock returns from CRSP. The cyclical and long-

period patterns that our model generates conform to conventional wisdom about how sectoral

risks actually varied over time. This supports our contention that our measure of risk tracks the

broad ways in which banking risk has waxed and waned over recent business cycles.
2
 The simplicity of this approach is that the model need not limit the debt of banking organizations to deposits nor
explicitly model differences in maturity and credit quality.

       Our paper proceeds as follows. Section I interprets the safety net as a contracting

structure that generates a contingent mix of benefits and obligations for taxpayers, regulators,

and protected institutions. Section II explains the assumptions we use to model banking-sector

exposure to default and individual banks’ contribution to systemic risk. Section III describes the

data sources and sampling procedures we use, and presents summary statistics for our estimates

of sectoral and individual systemic risk. Section IV examines the evolution of sectoral and

individual systemic risk over time. Section V analyzes the cross-sectional variation in sectoral

and individual systemic risk. Section VI summarizes our findings.



                    I. BANK AND TAXPAYER POSITIONS IN THE SAFETY NET

       It is instructive to think of a country’s safety net as an incomplete contracting structure.

Contracts imbedded in this structure assign explicit and implicit responsibility for preventing,

detecting, and paying for crippling losses at protected institutions. The parties to the contracts

are banking organizations (“banks”), regulators, nonbank taxpayers, and institutional

stakeholders. Regulators may be conceived as parties to all safety-net contracts and to enjoy a

great deal of ex post flexibility in setting and enforcing contract terms. Although counterparties

cannot trade their positions in these contracts, they can lessen their exposure to loss by lobbying

and other forms of political or hedging activity.

       There is no reason to expect that the balance of costs and benefits the safety net generates

is the same either for all banks or for all nonbank taxpayers. For a sample of banks, this paper

tracks the value of banks’ individual and aggregate claims on the safety net over time. At each

date, the value of an individual institution’s claim on the safety net is the expected difference

between the benefits of the particular protections it enjoys and the costs that safety-net


                                                    5
administrators might impose upon it. In principle, the discounted value of current and future

costs and benefits could be entered on institution balance sheets as intangible contra-assets and

contra-liabilities, respectively. Both costs and benefits may be treated as put options whose

control rights lie in the hands of regulators who are understood in difficult circumstances to favor

forbearance over strict and prompt exercise of taxpayers’ stop-loss rights. Protected institutions

are long an option to put losses in excess of stockholder capital to other banks and nonbank

taxpayers in various ways and short two other options. The first is an obligation to surrender the

assets to the FDIC if regulators exercise their right to take over an insolvent bank. Their second

position is an option to cover their share of safety-net expenses, including the future costs of

replenishing the insurance fund for losses incurred at other banks. The costs in a bank’s short

positions include explicit insurance premiums and various costs of complying with (and

sometimes circumventing) burdensome restrictions that safety-net managers might impose on

their operations.

       Community banks have long complained that, on average, giant money-center and

regional banks enjoy a more favorable mix of safety-net costs and benefits than they do.

Moreover, they maintain that compliance burdens generated by the Dodd-Frank Act are

aggravating this situation. Our analysis provides an easy way to investigate and confirm this

claim quantitatively.

       We focus especially on the period 2008-2009, which coincides with the maturing of the

mortgage securitization crisis that began in August, 2007. During that period, unprecedented

losses were incurred by large and systemically important U.S. financial institutions in particular.

A comprehensive review of salient events contributing to the crisis can be found in Acharya,




                                                 6
Schnabl, and Suarez, 2013, Gorton (2009), Laeven and Valencia (2012), Brunnermeier (2009),

Adrian and Shin (2010), and Lo (2012).

       It is not necessary to sort out the causal origins of the crisis to see that the systemic risk

of U.S. financial institutions increased dramatically during this period, and was aggravated by ad

hoc and inconsistent policy responses (Kane, 2010). Authorities initially offered massive

liquidity support to troubled banks and began to lower interest rates. Because bailout programs

seemed to rob low- and middle-income Peter to pay rich Paul, the crisis surfaced popular concern

about the unfairness of too-big-to-fail policies (Veronesi and Zingales, 2010).

       Other researchers propose alternative measures of systemic risk with which our results

can be compared.      Billio, Getmansky, Lo, and Pelizzon (2012) compare several of these

alternative systemic risk measures. Lehar (2005) and Avesani, Pascual, and Li (2006) propose

the probability of default as a measure of systemic risk, and they estimate this using CDS,

option, and equity market data. Additional measures include: conditional value at risk (CoVaR)

proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2008), marginal expected shortfall (MES) proposed by

Acharya, Pedersen, Philippon, and Richardson (2010) and extended by Brownlees and Engle

(2015), and network-based measures of systemic risk based on interbank contagion as, e.g.,

proposed by Cont (2010). Kim and Giesecke (2010) study the term structure of systemic risk.

       Our measure differs from other measures of systemic risk in two important dimensions.

First, our measure uses readily available stock market data on banking firms, and not data that

are either not readily available (such as data on financial networks and interconnectedness) or

market-value data for debt and derivatives that are available in thin markets or only for a small

subset of firms. Jarrow (2012) shows that implied default probabilities from CDS spreads cannot

provide reliable estimates. Second, our methods finesse the need to address the


                                                 7
interconnectedness of banking firms directly.         Instead, our measure of a banking firm’s

contribution to systemic risk gauges interconnectedness implicitly. It encompasses not only

contagion risks arising from direct contractual linkages between banks, such as those that occur

through interbank loans, but also from indirect linkages from balance sheet exposures to

common external shocks. We regard the more timely and comprehensive availability of the input

data our model needs to be a major advantage of our measure of systemic risk. In these respects,

our measure resembles that of Brownlees and Engle (2015). But whereas these authors focus on

estimating losses banking stocks might suffer during severe stock market declines, our model

tracks safety-net subsidies across a longer history and treats all phases of stock-market behavior

equally.



                  II. MEASURING STAND-ALONE AND SYSTEMIC BANK RISK



                             A. Structural Model of Bank Default

       Our measures of stand-alone and systemic bank risk extend the structural model of

deposit-insurance benefits developed by Merton (1977). Merton assumes that the value of bank

assets is governed by geometric Brownian motion and that bank liabilities have a zero coupon

and mature in one year. One year is assumed to be the frequency of audit by bank regulators as

well. At the time the debt is due, the bank is assumed to default if the asset value falls below the

face value of debt. In earlier work, Merton (1974) showed that stockholders’ stake in such a firm

can be viewed as a call option on firm assets whose exercise price equals the face value of debt

and whose tenor (i.e., option maturity) equals the maturity of the debt. These assumptions let us

view the value of risky debt as the value of risk-free debt less the value of creditors’ side of a put


                                                  8
option on firm assets. Because it expresses the value of creditor loss exposure, this limited-

liability put represents the fair cost of guaranteeing bank creditors against losses due to default

during the period it covers.

            Our model portrays stockholder equity as a single-period European call option on the

bank’s assets and treats bank equity as the sum of a dividend-unprotected European call option

and the present value of dividends distributed before the option’s expiration date. The model

expresses the value of a bank’s equity, E, as:

                                       E  DIV  (V  DIV ) N ( x1 )  DN ( x 2 ) .                                        (1)

In (1), E is the value of bank equity, V is the value of bank assets, DIV is the present value of

interim dividends distributed in the year before the debt becomes due, D is the face value of

outstanding deposits and other debt, and N(xi) states the probability that the variate value x is 

xi, given that x is distributed with zero mean and unit variance.3,4

            The value of the limited-liability put can be extracted from the conservation-of-value

condition that the value of bank assets equals the value of all claims on those assets:

                                                         LLP  E  D  V .                                                 (2)

Substituting equation (1) for E, the value of the limited-liability put becomes:

                                    LLP  D(1  N ( x2 ))  (V  DIV )(1  N ( x1 )) .                                     (3)

The fair value of the annual premium for insuring a dollar of debt against creditor losses due to

default can then be found by dividing the LLP value obtained in (3) by the face value of debt, D:

                                  2
           ln[(V  DIV ) / D]   V T / 2
    x1                                     , x 2  x1    V   T , where V is the instantaneous standard deviation of asset
3

                     V T
returns and T = 1 is the assumed maturity of debt.
4
  We do not mean to imply that distributions with jumps or heavier tails could not be used or that such distributions
might not give more accurate estimates (see, e.g., Bollerslev and Todorov, 2011).


                                                                   9
                               IPD  [1  N ( x2 )]  (V  DIV )[1  N ( x1 )] / D .                              (4)

Because the explicit deposit insurance premiums that U.S. banks pay to the FDIC are minimal

(prior to the recent crisis, 97 percent of FDIC-insured institutions paid zero premia to the FDIC),

the fair value premium estimate can in most cases be interpreted as the subsidy a bank manages

to extract from the safety net.



                        B. Measuring Stand-Alone and Systemic Bank Risk

         There is a long tradition in the literature on deposit insurance to use the fair annual

premium for insuring a dollar of deposits against depositor losses to measure fluctuations in the

size of the FDIC’s exposure to individual-bank default. Following this tradition, we make IPD as

defined in equation (4) our measure of stand-alone bank risk. Using equation (4) requires

knowledge of the value of bank assets, V, and asset risk, V, which are not directly observable.

Earlier literature [e.g., Marcus and Shaked (1984) and Ronn and Verma (1986)] solved this

problem by estimating V and V by numerical methods using two option-pricing equations. The

first equation is the call-option formulation (1) for equity, E. The second equation links V to E,

V and E as follows:

                                              V = E(E/V) / N(x1).                                               (5)

         Our calculations use the following definitions. The value of equity, E, is calculated as the

number of outstanding shares times the share price. The face value of debt, D, is calculated as the

sum of the balance-sheet values of total liabilities (quarterly Compustat item LTQ) and preferred

equity (PTSQ).5 The present value of the next four quarterly dividends, DIV, is calculated


5
  The results are similar when the face value of debt is calculated as the sum of the balance-sheet values of deposits
(quarterly Compustat item DPTCQ), long-term debt (DLTTQ), debt in current liabilities (DLCQ), and preferred


                                                         10
assuming that, for the next four quarters, the bank will pay the same dollar amount as the last

quarterly cash dividends per share (DVPSXQ) times the number of shares outstanding (CSHOQ)

and using the yield on one-year Treasuries.6 The equity risk, σE, is measured as the annualized

standard deviation of one year of daily stock returns. This approach to modeling and estimating

individual bank risk has been applied in a large number of papers (see, for example, Pennacchi,

1987; Hovakimian and Kane, 2000).

        Our goal is to use this framework to measure both: (1) the fragility of the entire banking

sector (i.e. a portfolio of banks) as the value of the put option on the portfolio of aggregate

sample-bank assets with an exercise price equal to the aggregate sample-bank debt, and (2) the

contribution that each individual bank makes to this notion of systemic risk. The details of this

calculation are as follows. At the end of each calendar month, we form a value-weighted

portfolio of all sample banks. We then calculate daily portfolio returns for the 12-month period

preceding the date of portfolio formation. In addition, we calculate this portfolio’s market value

as the sum of market values of component banks on the date of portfolio formation and portfolio

debt as the sum of debt values of component banks as of the last fiscal quarter ending on or

before the date of portfolio formation. For example, for the portfolio formed on June 30, 2000,

we use stock returns from July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000, market values of equity as of June 30,

2000, and book values of debt as of June 30, May 31, or April 30, depending on the end of the

last fiscal quarter of each bank. In forming these portfolios, we limit the sample to banks with



equity (PTSQ). However, this alternative calculation cannot be performed for non-bank financial institutions that
were part of Supervisory Capital Assessment Program and are presented later in Table 8.
6
  In Figure 5, we contrast results for this “dividend forbearance model” with estimates in which bailout packages
include an immediate “dividend stopper.” As suggested by the intensity of troubled banks’ efforts to use the
outcomes of Federal Reserve stress tests to win permission to increase or resume dividends, estimates of IPD that
ignore the possibility of dividend disbursements (such as Carbo, Kane, and Rodriguez, 2011) develop much smaller
values.


                                                       11
non-missing values of market value of equity, book value of debt, and at least 246 reported daily

returns.

       We use these portfolio values to solve equations (1) and (5) numerically for the synthetic

values of banking-sector assets, VBS, and banking-sector asset risk, VBS. We plug these values

into equation (4) to obtain a fair value of the premium appropriate for guaranteeing a dollar of

debt against losses that would be generated by a hypothetical default of the whole banking

sector, IPDBS. Because the values of the assets held by various banks are imperfectly correlated,

the value of the put option on the portfolio of bank assets is less than the value of the portfolio of

put options on assets of individual banks. To the extent that this correlation varies over time, the

time profile of our sectoral risk measure will diverge from the time-series profile of the average

of individual-bank IPDs.

       We estimate an individual bank’s systemic risk as its contribution to the sectoral IPD.

Specifically, for each bank i and month t, we modify our overall bank portfolio by removing this

particular bank from the portfolio and using the procedure we have just described to estimate the

hypothetical insurance premium for a sectoral portfolio that excludes bank i: IPDBSi,t. At each

date, t, an individual bank’s systemic risk emerges as the difference between the insurance

premium for the portfolio that includes the bank and the insurance premium for the portfolio that

excludes it:

                                   IPDS i ,t  IPDBS t  IPDBS i ,t .                             (6)

       Our procedures for calculating the insurance premia from option-pricing equations (1)-(6)

incorporate a number of simplifying assumptions. These include assumptions about the structure

and the characteristics of debt and the assumption that regulators resist pressure for forbearance

and shut down economically insolvent banks promptly. Such assumptions introduce


                                                  12
measurement errors into our estimates and limit the economic significance of the numerical

values of individual estimates. Nevertheless, the risk measures we develop rise and fall

appropriately over recognized business cycles and crisis periods, which establishes a

presumptive case for their qualitative usefulness and reliability. On the hypothesis that the

measurement errors do not vary systematically across banks and across time, our estimates can

serve both as a timely guide to the ebb and flow of the systemic risk posed by the banking sector

as a whole and as a way to identify specific institutions whose activities impose substantial risk

on the safety net. The advantage of our method is that it is easy to implement using readily

available data, unlike other methods that require data that are not readily available, such as

information on counterparty risk and interbank exposures, or data that are available only for a

subset of firms, such as CDS spreads.

       Our measure of an individual bank’s contribution to systemic risk reflects the spillovers

imposed on other banks when the bank fails (for example, through interbank exposures).

However, our measure of systemic risk [as is the case for other methods relying on financial data

to measure systemic risk (e.g., Acharya et al. 2010)] cannot capture knock-on effects on

employment and economic growth. For this reason, they all underestimate the full impact of

systemic risk.

       Our concept of systemic risk is related to, but different from systematic risk. Systematic

risk is typically measured by the beta coefficient that a firm’s equity return receives in market-

model regressions. Our measure of systemic risk captures the expansion of systematic risk in

extreme circumstances (as evidenced by the high realizations of our measure during the recent

crisis). But our measure of individual-bank systemic risks estimates indirectly the linkages that

tie the risks taken by any one sample bank to the systemic risks incurred by other banks. These


                                               13
linkages transfer extreme risks from one or a few banks across the system and, as the Allen and

Gale model (2001) explains, can threaten its integrity.



                        III. SAMPLE SELECTION, DATA, AND SUMMARY STATISTICS

           Our primary sample consists of commercial banking organizations (with a 3-digit SIC

code value of 602) with at least one million dollars in total assets. Bank-level data from 1974

through 2010 are constructed from two sources. Daily stock prices and returns are obtained from

CRSP. Quarterly balance-sheet accounting data come from Compustat (both Bank and

Fundamentals). Macroeconomic data, such as the consumer price index (CPI), one-year Treasury

yields, and real GDP growth rates are downloaded from the website maintained by the Federal

Reserve Bank of St. Louis.7 Annualized standard deviations for stock returns are calculated using

daily returns for the latest quarter and a screen requiring a minimum of 58 non-missing returns

within the quarter. These screening criteria leave us with 40,522 bank-quarter observations.

           Table 1 reports the number of quarterly observations and the mean values of assets and

Tier 1 capital by year. The number of sample banks starts at 497 in the first quarter of 1974,

expands steadily during the 1970s, remains stable in 1980s, almost triples in the fourth quarter of

1993, remains relatively stable during the rest of the precrisis period, and declines thereafter.

Average asset size for sample banks tends to grow over time, except it drops substantially in

1994 when the Compustat database for banks expanded its coverage to include a large number of

relatively small banks. Tier 1 capital ratios, which are available from 1993 on, hover around 11-

12% prior to the crisis and have risen into the 14% range since. The remaining sections of the

paper explore the time-series and cross-sectional behavior of our measurements.

                            IV. AGGREGATE TIME-SERIES RESULTS



                 A. Variation in Stand-Alone and Systemic Risks over Time

       In this section, we examine the time-series behavior of differently aggregated measures

of bank risk. For each of the 160 calendar quarters from 1974 to 2010 and for each sample bank,

we calculate values for an appropriate individual guarantee fee (expressed as an Insurance

Premium for Debt, IPD), implied volatility of assets, V, implied capital ratio, E/V, and Tier 1

capital ratio. The quarterly time series of mean IPD values (i.e., stand-alone risk) is plotted in

Figure 1. The chart shows that the mean value of IPD at sample banks surged during cyclical

contractions and fell back afterwards. But our evidence shows that the mean value of the stand-

alone put grew larger in the 1990s and fell back more slowly in later business cycles. Because a

large number of small banks is added in the fourth quarter of 1993, data before and after that date

must be compared cautiously. Nevertheless, from a large-bank perspective, the 40 years of data

show the dangers of trying – as envisioned in the Basel system of capital control – to contain the

taxpayer loss exposure mainly by regulating the book value of bank leverage. The data show that

implied capital (Figure 2) and implied asset volatility (Figure 3) fluctuated substantially over

each cycle. But during 1993-2013 the value of regulators’ control variable --on-balance-sheet

Tier 3 capital (Figure 4)-- changed hardly at all.

       Although IPD, implied capital, and asset volatility are not publicly reported or explicitly

monitored by banking regulators today, these measures have the advantage that they can be

calculated promptly from available data. Unlike methods that rely on the prices of credit default

swaps or on data measuring interbank exposures to one another, stock prices are available in




                                                 15
deep markets in real time and regulators collect intraquarter balance-sheet data for large banks

and could collect these data more frequently if they wished.

       Swings in our synthetic measurements prove much more extensive than the swings in on-

balance-sheet capital depicted in Figure 4. It is clear that although accounting leverage declined

during the 1990s, hidden leverage expanded in advance of the crisis. The difference between

reported and opportunity-cost values of leverage underscores the dangers of trying to control a

bank’s risk-taking by controlling its reported risk-weighted capital position. To control systemic

risk, it is necessary also to allow for the effects of the innovative ways in which bank managers

are bound to arbitrage patterns of fixed risk weights and unchanging statistical definitions of

regulatory capital.

       Increases in individual-bank risk are especially worrisome when they propagate through

the banking sector. Figures 5A and 5B plot the time-series behavior of sectoral IPD (labeled

IPDBS). These charts underscore the extraordinary depth of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. A

comparison of Figures 1 and 5 shows that, although pre-2008 financial crises led to substantial

increases in mean IPDs, the aggregate risk of the banking sector (IPDBS) remained low because

significant parts of the financial system remained sound. Even in the absence of policies

designed to limit dividend payouts in banks receiving so-called “live-bank” assistance, the

insurance premium for the sectoral portfolio never exceeded a few basis points. In contrast, at the

peak of the crisis, Figure 5A that, if we assume dividend forbearance, the mean annualized IPD

reached 450 basis points. Figure 5B shows that this value could have been reduced by about 100

basis points if authorities had promptly stopped dividend payouts at assisted banks, something

the Dodd-Frank Act allows them to do going forward. In addition to the effect of sharp increases

in mean stand-alone risk, the surge in taxpayer loss exposure was driven by an increased


                                                16
correlation in credit risk within the banking sector. Figure 6 reports average correlations of

individual-bank returns with an equal-weighted portfolio of sample banks. This chart shows that

correlation between individual-bank returns grew in advance of systemic distress, and grew

especially sharply during the years leading up to the crisis.

       Figure 7 plots the time-series behavior of the cross-sectional mean of our measure of

individual-bank systemic risk. The mean value of systemic risk is small and moves only slightly

during most of the sample period, but in 2008-2009 the mean value surges dramatically, reaching

-2000 basis points in 2009. Although we maintain that the negative sign attached to these values

supports the claims made by community banks, this sign may seem counterintuitive and

surprising at first. Our interpretation is as follows. During a very deep financial crisis, bank asset

and equity values become more positively correlated, especially at very large and interconnected

banks. This means that the benchmark sectoral portfolios become much less diversified and that

adding a large bank to the sectoral portfolio offers little or no diversification or financing benefit.

On the other hand, assuming that small banks have very different business plans, portfolio risk,

and tax exposures than large banks, their asset values and survival would not be greatly

threatened by the collapse of the securitization and mortgage-lending bubbles. During crisis

periods, these banks give more support to the safety net than the safety net gives them in return.

       An average bank in our sample is a relatively small bank. A negative mean value for

individual-bank systemic risk during the crisis years supports community-bank claims that the

future premiums and regulatory burdens regulators are likely to place on the assets of smaller

banks exceed the current costs of supporting these banks’ liabilities. As explained in the next

section, even though the contribution to mean systemic risk becomes negative during the crisis

period, the systemic risk of particular sample banks and the sector as a whole became positive


                                                  17
and very large during this period. Figures 8, 9, and 10 show that for very large banks systemic

risk surged and sectoral leverage and volatility expanded.

        The results presented in Figures 1-7 are summarized in Table 2. The table reports mean

values separately for the precrisis period (1974-2007), crisis (2008-2009) and postcrisis (2010-

2013) years.    Both statistically and economically, stand-alone risk (IPD) and sectoral risk

(IPDBS) run markedly higher during the crisis period. The table reports values in two ways: per

dollar of debt (in basis points) and in dollar value. While mean per-dollar values are negative,

mean dollar values of IPDBS are positive. This implies that larger banks tend to increase the

aggregate cost of guaranteeing the debt of the sectoral portfolio and that, on average, smaller

banks help taxpayers to finance this cost. In keeping with the literature on regulatory arbitrage,

asset and equity risks became significantly higher and implied bank capital became significantly

lower during the crisis period. In contrast, the differences in these periods between Tier 1, Tier 2,

and Tier 3 capital ratios are insignificant. These findings support Dodd-Frank and Basel

initiatives seeking to impose a capital surcharge or incremental dollar premium for banks of very

large size.

        As noted earlier in this section, the time trends and patterns presented in Figures 1-7 and

our first two tables are consistent with small-bank complaints and with academic understanding

of how banking risks varied over time. We interpret this as evidence that our measures of stand-

alone and systemic risk capture the broad outlines the behavior of these risks.



               B. Time-Series Forecasts of Commercial Banking Sector Risk

        An important academic and practical question is whether increases in sectoral risk can be

predicted and, if so, what explanatory factors might be identified. Table 3 reports on regression


                                                 18
models that use current values of bank sectoral risk (IPDBS) to forecast future sectoral risk at

one-to-twelve month forecasting horizons. At the one-month horizon, predictive power is strong:

the slope coefficient is 0.868, the t-statistic is 38.3, and the R2 is 0.754. The magnitude and

significance of the slope (and therefore model fit) decline monotonically as the forecast horizon

grows. At the nine-month horizon, the slope is no longer significant and the R2 of the regression

becomes trivial. These results suggest that rising levels of sectoral risk can serve as early-

warning indicators of further increases over the next few months and could be used to frame a

forward-looking policy response to evidence of impending crisis.

       We next expand the forecasting model to examine whether business-cycle and banking-

industry characteristics might also help predict systemic pressures in advance. We introduce two

business-cycle variables: the US growth rate in real GDP and a recession indicator based on

NBER business-cycle expansion and contraction data. To measure banking concentration, we

use a Herfindahl index constructed based on the book values of sample-bank assets (whose time-

series behavior is shown in Figure 11). Panel A of Table 4 reports the results of regressions

using current values of the NBER business-cycle variable to predict systemic sectoral risk

contemporaneously and at horizons extending from one to twelve months. The recession

indicator significantly predicts sectoral risk at every horizon. The GDP growth rate has a

significantly negative effect on bank sectoral risk over 2- to 8-month horizons. At longer

horizons, the magnitude of the growth-rate coefficient declines and becomes insignificant

beyond the nine-month horizon. R2 lies in the 10% to 14% range for horizons of nine-months or

less. For longer horizons, the influence of the growth rate declines monotonically, and the R2

drops off to 4.7% at the 12-month horizon.




                                               19
        Panel B of Table 4 adds the sectoral Herfindahl index to the set of predictors. The results

show that when the banking sector becomes more concentrated (i.e., as the Herfindahl index

rises), sectoral risk rises, too. The effect of the Herfindahl index is statistically significant at all

horizons and the R2 of individual regression models average about six percentage points above

corresponding regressions that omit the Herfindahl variable. These results suggest that the

dramatically more concentrated structure Figure 11 shows for the US banking system in recent

years may have increased its susceptibility to systemic crisis. While there is considerable

industry resistance to the idea of breaking up large banks or capping their asset growth, our work

provides another drop in a rapidly filling bucket of evidence that mega-banking organizations

pose hard-to-manage problems for our nation’s financial stability.



                                     V. BANK-LEVEL RESULTS



                                       A. Univariate Results

        This section focuses on variations in stand-alone risk (IPD) and systemic risk (IPDS)

across individual banks. We start by examining the impact of bank size on stand-alone and

systemic risks. For each year and quarter, we sort banks into size quartiles, based on the book

value of their assets. For each quartile, Table 5 contrasts the mean values of key variables during

the precrisis period (1974-2007), crisis (2008-2009) and postcrisis (2010-2013) years. Results

are qualitatively unaltered if we partition the sample by medians rather than means.

        In the first two periods, the stand-alone risk premium tends to decrease across the first

three size quartiles, backs up a bit in quartile 4, but remains below the levels shown for quartiles




                                                  20
2 and (especially) quartile 1. The stand-alone premium for the fourth quartile drops off in the

postcrisis years.

         While the smallest banks consistently pose the largest stand-alone risks, the pattern is

different for systemic risk. Systemic risk increases in the large-bank quartile. This finding holds

in all periods. This supports the hypothesis that a country’s largest banks are the main source of

systemic risk, which helps to validate our use of 1974-1992 data. However, before and after the

crisis, the difference we observe between the smallest and the largest quartiles is a mere 0.2 to

0.3 basis points. During the height of the crisis, the difference surges to over 600 basis points, a

number that is significant economically and statistically.

         Interquartile patterns of variation in equity, asset volatility, and implied capital resemble

those shown for stand-alone risk. Equity and asset volatility tend to be highest and market capital

ratios tend to be lowest for the smallest banks. Tier 1 capital ratios vary only slightly and are

highest for small banks.

         Table 5 indicates that banks that pose high stand-alone risk differ from those with high

systemic risk: stand-alone risk falls with asset size, while a bank’s contribution to systemic risk

increases with size. This shows that systemic risk does not arise as a straightforward aggregation

of individual-bank stand-alone risk.

         Table 6 shows how different the top fifteen sample banks for stand-alone risk (Panel A)

are from the fifteen banks that posed the most systemic risk (Panel B). There is not a single

instance of overlap between these lists. As in Table 5, high stand-alone risk is found in small

banks, but high systemic risk depends on a bank’s business plan and can be posed by banks of all

sizes.




                                                  21
         Table 7 identifies the 30 largest financial institutions in our sample by total assets in their

2007 fiscal year. It also states the maximum stand-alone and systemic risk premiums they

experienced during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The high levels of these maxima underscore

how much value federal credit support contributed to these banks and to their counterparties due

to the subsidized terms on which it was supplied.

         Next, we assess the validity of our measure of systemic risk by comparing our estimates

with those obtained from stress tests conducted by regulators and with more elegant measures of

systemic risk proposed in the literature. Specifically, we compare our measure of systemic risk

with the capital shortfall calculated in the supervisory Capital Assessment Program conducted in

February 2009 (referred to as SCAP) and with the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) calculated

by Acharya et al. (2010) from data in periods during which stock market returns lie below their

fifth percentile (taken to represent extremely bad outcomes). For 18 of the institutions that the

Fed stress-tested in March 2009, Table 8 compares our risk measures with the indices of capital

shortfall prepared by the Federal Reserve, Acharya et al. (2010), and Brownless and Engle

(2015) for these firms.8

         The correlation between our dollar measures of stand-alone and systemic risk and the

SCAP measure of capital shortfall are respectively 0.723 and 0.791, indicating that our more

timely and simpler-to-compute measures of risk are good approximations for complicated

regulatory efforts to measure capital shortfall at major financial institutions. This supports the

usefulness of our measure of systemic risk. Still, our data suggest that some banks generated far

more systemic risk than was suggested by SCAP or acknowledged by regulators. The

  The values of our measures of stand-alone and systemic risk presented in the table are for the fiscal quarters
starting in July 2008 and ending in June 2009. The values of SRISK are from Brownlees and Engle (2015) as
reported for first quarter of 2009.


                                                          22
correlations with the MES measure of capital shortfall developed by Acharya et al. (2010) are

lower at 0.461 for stand-alone risk and only 0.202 for systemic risk. The correlations of the

stand-alone and systemic risk premiums with the SRISK measure of Brownlees and Engle

(2010) are 0.072 for stand-alone risk and only 0.462 for systemic risk. The relatively low values

of the last two correlations suggest that they may span different components of systemic risk, so

that regulators might find all three approaches useful supplements to data now being generated

with considerably more effort by stress tests.



      B. Regression Evidence of Other Influences on Stand-Alone and Systemic Risk

       The univariate analysis presented thus far suggests that bank size is a key driver of

systemic risk. However, relating risk only to size is apt to exaggerate its effect on risk appetites.

We think it is useful to consider the effects of at least a few other variables on stand-alone and

systemic risks.

       This section introduces controls for two determinants of credit risk: leverage and asset

volatility. Our method of calculating IPD makes stand-alone risk an explicit function of leverage

and asset volatility, and these variables' contribution to systemic risk is obviously substantial. In

addition, one might expect stand-alone risk to increase with the weight of insured deposits in an

organization's funding structure since non-deposit debtholders have a stronger incentive to worry

about risk-shifting than depositors do. A similar effect might be observed even for systemic risk.

However, on the dual hypothesis that systemically important banks tend to have more complex

balance sheets and that complexity raises the odds that an institution will be allowed to operate

for long periods as a government-supported zombie institution, then banks with high deposit-to-

asset ratios may prove less risky systemically.


                                                  23
       Table 9 reports multiple regression equations for our measures of stand-alone risk (Panel

A) and systemic risk (Panel B), using size, deposits, leverage, and asset volatility as regressors.

Because substantial variation occurs in sectoral credit risk over time, we adopt a Fama-MacBeth

framework. This means that we estimate regressions separately for each quarter and analyze the

distribution of coefficients that emerges. In particular, we study the means of time series of

regression estimates. Because the distributions of the coefficient estimates are highly skewed

with particularly large values observed during the financial crisis, we use non-parametric

methods to assess their statistical significance.      Our inference focuses on the number of

coefficient estimates that show the same sign as the time-series mean. Significance tests are

conducted for the 160 quarters in the full sample period 1974-2013 and for the four crisis

quarters separately using a sign test.

       The tests reinforce the hypothesis that systemic risk does not arise as the simple

aggregation of individual-bank risk and that systemic risk is related to asset risk and leverage in a

substantial way. Once we control for leverage and asset risk, the negative effect of size on

stand-alone credit risk actually disappears. The average size effect is positive, though not

significantly so, both in the full sample and during the four crisis quarters.          The positive

influence of size on systemic risk is significant even with these controls and is positive during all

four crisis quarters. This reinforces the hypothesis that bank size and leverage are key drivers of

systemic risk.

       The effect of deposits on stand-alone risk is significantly negative in the full sample but

is significantly positive in the crisis quarters. The deposit effect proves significantly negative for

systemic risk in both the full sample and crisis subperiod. This pattern of results is consistent

with the hypothesis that authorities' rescue propensities provide banks that have more complex


                                                 24
liability structures with forms of implicit credit support that tempt such firms to make themselves

systemically riskier.

       To test whether stand-alone and systemic risks are especially large for giant institutions,

Table 10 re-estimates these regressions adding indicators of great size to the right-hand side.

“Large” is an indicator set to one for top 10 percent (by book value of assets) of banks in each

calendar quarter. “Very large” is an indicator set to one for the top 5 percent of banks (by book

value of assets) in each calendar quarter. Neither indicator is significant in stand-alone risk

regressions. This is consistent with our earlier findings that asset size is not a major determinant

of stand-alone risk.

       On the other hand, in the systemic risk regressions, the large-bank indicator is

significantly positive both in the full sample and during the four crisis quarters. The very large

bank indicator is significantly positive during the financial crisis but not in the full sample. The

magnitudes of these coefficient estimates imply that, during the financial crisis, systemic risk

premia for large banks ran almost 400 basis points higher than the risk premia of smaller banks.

The risk premia for the top 5 percent increased by an additional 400 basis points. Taken together,

these results indicate that taxpayer loss exposure reached unprecedented highs during the

financial crisis, and that not only leverage and asset risk but also bank size were key drivers of

systemic risk.



                               VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

       The great financial crisis underscored the need to devise a timely and comprehensive

measure of the risk that particular institutions impose on the financial system as a whole. This




                                                25
paper introduces a theoretically based measure for systemic risk that is easy to implement using

publicly available financial and stock market data.

       The value of a firm’s taxpayer put represents the government’s implicit equity stake in its

future operations. Unless this stake is monitored and serviced at a market rate of return,

beneficiary firms are incentivized to increase the value of the credit enhancement that the put

conveys by undertaking excessively risky and hard-to-monitor balance-sheet positions. Bubbles

in the prices of hard-to-regulate assets caused by these risk-shifting activities harm the real

economy by diverting resources from more appropriate activities. Crisis-management policies

that unconditionally support the credit of large zombie firms prolong macroeconomic downturns.

They do this by encouraging bank managers to gamble for resurrection rather than to focus on

loans and investments that could more reliably expand job opportunities and customer profits.

       Time trends and patterns in our aggregate and individual measures of systemic risk are

consistent with the outcomes of formal stress tests and with popular and academic understanding

of how systemic and individual risks varied over time and across institutions. In particular, we

find that during crises bank size is a key driver of systemic risk. We conclude that, although our

estimates of systemic and stand-alone risk might be biased in some way, they capture the

qualitative behavior of these risks. Our findings support the strategy of imposing a graduated

capital surcharge on banks of large size and suggest how such premia might be made

commensurate with measures of each bank’s quarter-by-quarter contribution to systemic risk.

       Our ultimate goal is to help to enhance financial stability. We believe our methods

provide a useful starting point for tracking systemic banking pressures in a more timely fashion

and for promptly identifying institutions whose activities might generate dangerous amounts of




                                                26
systemic risk. Because our measure is so uncomplicated, we hope further research will refine our

methods and deepen everyone’s understanding of systemic risk.

Table 4. Time-series regressions predicting banking sector risk using business cycle and
banking structure variables

This table reports time-series regressions predicting banking sector risk (IPDBS) at various horizons using its current
values as well as business cycle and banking structure variables. Regressions in panel A include recession indicators
and GDP growth and regressions in panel B also include the Herfindahl index of banking assets. Banking sector risk
is estimated using the dividend forbearance model. Recession indicator is based on NBER US business cycle
expansion and contraction data. GDP growth is the real GDP growth rate. Herfindahl index is calculated based on
book asset values of sample banks. Financial statement data are from the Compustat database for U.S. banks and
daily stock returns are from CRSP.

Table 7. Stand-alone and systemic risk premiums: Thirty largest banks by the book value
of assets
This table reports the 30 largest banks by the book value of assets (in millions of dollars) in fiscal year 2007. The
reported risk measures are for the dividend-forbearance model and state the maximum values reached during the 12
months from July 2008 to June 2009 when the commercial banks’ sectoral risk was the highest. The risk measures
are in basis points.

                                                                               Stand-alone risk      Systemic risk

Table 8. Comparison of our measures of stand-alone and systemic risk with two other measures of capital shortage

This table shows a comparison of our measures of stand-alone and systemic risk (average values for the period starting in July 2008 and ending in June 2009)
with two other measures of capital shortage for 18 of the 19 institutions that the Federal Reserve subjected to stress tests in early 2009. SCAP denotes the capital
shortfall calculated in the supervisory Capital Assessment Program conducted in February 2009, MES is the Marginal Expected Shortfall calculated by Acharya
et al. (2010) from data in periods during which stock-market returns lie below their fifth percentile, and SRISK is from Brownlees and Engle (2015).

Table 9. Cross-sectional quarter-by-quarter regressions for stand-alone and systemic risk
This table reports mean coefficients of cross-sectional quarter-by-quarter regressions of stand-alone and systemic
risk at sampled US bank holding companies. Regression results are reported separately for the whole period and for
the four quarters starting in quarter 3 of 2008 and ending in quarter 2 of 2009. Results in panel A are for regressions
of stand-alone risk (IPD) and results in panel B are for regressions of systemic risk (IPDS). The risk measures are in
basis points. Size is lagged CPI-adjusted book value of assets in billions of dollars. Deposits is lagged ratio of
deposits to total assets in %. Asset volatility is standard deviation of asset returns (in %) implied by the call option
model of bank equity. Implied capital is market value of equity as the percentage of the value of assets implied by
the option model of bank equity. The reported slope coefficients, R 2, and the numbers of the observations are the
averages from quarterly cross-sectional regressions. The columns labeled “Same Sign” report the number of
coefficient estimates whose sign is the same as the reported mean coefficient. The p-values come from a
nonparametric sign test.

Table 10. Cross-sectional quarter-by-quarter regressions for stand-alone and systemic risk:
Additional controls for size
This table reports mean coefficients of cross-sectional quarter-by-quarter regressions of stand-alone and systemic
risk at sampled US bank holding companies. Regression results are reported separately for the whole period and for
the four quarters starting in quarter 3 of 2008 and ending in quarter 2 of 2009. Results in panel A are for regressions
of stand-alone risk (IPD) and results in panel B are for regressions of systemic risk (IPDS). The risk measures are in
basis points. Size represents the lagged CPI-adjusted book value of assets in billions of dollars. Large is an indicator
set to one for the top-10 percent of banks (by book value of assets) in each calendar quarter. Very large is an
indicator set to one for the top-5 percent of banks (by book value of assets) in each calendar quarter. Deposits
represent the lagged ratio of deposits to total assets expressed as a percent. Asset volatility is the standard deviation
of asset returns (in %) implied by the call option model of bank equity. Implied capital reports the market value of
equity as a percentage of the value of assets implied by the option model of bank equity. The reported slope
coefficients, R2, and observation counts are averages from quarterly cross-sectional regressions. The columns
labeled “Same Sign” report the number of coefficient estimates whose sign is the same as the reported mean
coefficient. The p-values come from a nonparametric sign test.
