A New Measure of College Quality to Study the Effects of College Sector and Peers on Degree
Attainment

                                              ABSTRACT

Students starting at a two-year college are much less likely to graduate with a college degree than similar
students who start at a four-year college but the sources of this attainment gap are largely unexplained.
In this paper we simultaneously investigate the attainment consequences of sector choice and peer
quality among over 3 million recent high school graduates. This analysis is enabled by data on all
PSAT test-takers between 2004 and 2006 from which we develop a novel measure of peer ability for
most two-year and four-year colleges in the United States- the average PSAT of enrolled students.
We document substantial variation in average peer quality at two-year colleges across and within
states and non-trivial overlap across sectors, neither of which has previously been documented. We
find that half the gap in bachelor’s attainment rates between students who start at two-year versusfour-
year institutions is explained by differences in peers, leaving room for structural barriers to transferring
between institutions to also play an important role. Also, having better peers is associated with higher
attainment in both sectors, though its effects are quite a bit larger in the four-year sector. Thus, the
allocation of students between and within sectors, some of which is driven by state policy decisions,
has important consequences for the educational attainment of the nation’s workforce.

1. Introduction

        Many students who aspire to earn a bachelor’s degree and with the academic credentials

to start at a four-year college instead begin at a two-year or community college (Bowen,

Chingos, McPherson, 2009; Smith, Pender, and Howell, 2013). Starting at a community college

is appealing because it is an inexpensive way to earn credits and prepare for upper division

coursework. For example, for the 2014-15 academic year, the average published tuition and fees

for a student attending an instate public two-year college is $3,350, an instate public four-year is

$9,140, and a private four-year is $31,230 (College Board, 2014). 1 On the other hand, research

suggests that observably similar students who start at two-year colleges are much less likely to

attain a bachelor’s degree (Rouse, 1995; Doyle. 1999; Long and Kurlaender. 2009; Reynolds,

2012; Goodman, Hurwitz, and Smith, 2014). 2 In fact, Bound, Lovenheim, and Turner (2010)

find that shifts from the 4-year to 2-year colleges can explain a large share of the decline in

college completion rates between 1972 and 1992. A limitation of this research is that it doesn’t

inform why students starting at two-year schools perform worse than those that start in four-year

colleges. Two-year colleges differ from four-year colleges in many ways that may influence

outcomes, including financial resources, peer students, a requirement to transfer, and student

intentions and preparation. Increasing college resources, altering peer exposure, streamlining

transfer processes, and improving student preparation are quite distinct policy responses so

distinguishing between these explanations is important.

  Net tuitions are substantially lower but the gaps between sectors remain on average.

  Using administrative data from the state of Texas, Miller (2007) and Andrews, Li, and Lovenheim (2012) also find
that sector has substantial impacts on earnings as well.

                                                        1
         This paper contributes to this literature in two ways. First, it is arguably the first to

measure the influence of college quality in the community college sector, 3 made possible by the

construction of a new measure of average peer ability that is comparable within and across

sectors. 4 Previous studies have used instructional spending to measure community college

quality (Stange, 2012), yet this is a weak measure of institution quality and doesn’t capture the

role of peers, an important input into the education production function. The second contribution

is to quantify the role of peer ability in explaining the BA attainment rate difference between

traditional college students across the two- and four-year sectors. Our measure of peer ability

uses a unique dataset on nearly 3 million Preliminary SAT/ National Merit Scholarship

Qualifying Test® (PSAT) takers in 2004-2006 merged to enrollment and completion data from

the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). The PSAT has strong coverage across the country

even for those enrolling in two-year colleges, allowing us to measure peer ability in a way that is

comparable across sectors and similar to that of the average SAT or ACT, which is a common

measure of college quality used to study four-year colleges. We document substantial variation

in average peer ability at two-year colleges across and within states and non-trivial overlap

between sectors, neither of which has previously been documented. Kurlaender, Carrell, and

Jackson (2014) also document considerable variation in outcomes among the 108 community

colleges in California, even after accounting for student selection. They find that accounting for

average peer characteristics substantially reduces, though does not fully eliminate, this

institutional variation. 5


3
  We use “sector” to distinguish between two-year and four-year colleges. Some research and organizations
(Department of Education) refers to “sector” as the difference between public and private colleges.
4
  We recognize that PSAT score is not the only measure of ability of a student or college, but for ease of exposition,
we will use “ability” interchangeably with our measures that rely on PSAT scores.
5
  The authors note that controlling for average group characteristics also partially controls for selection on
unobservables under reasonable assumptions and provides a lower bound of the variation in school quality (Altonji

                                                          2
         We address selection into sector and peer quality by controlling for a rich set of college

and student controls. Like previous researchers, we observe that recent high school graduates

that start at four-year colleges are approximately 50 percentage points more likely to earn a

bachelor’s degree within six years than those starting at two-year colleges. Approximately half of

this gap remains after controlling for average peer PSAT scores and own student PSAT score.

Thus even comparing students with the same test scores and attending institutions with similar-

achieving peers, those attending a two-year institution are 29 percentage points less likely to earn

a bachelor’s degree. Both own and peer ability, as measured by PSAT score, are strong

predictors of degree attainment, though own ability is relatively more important in the two-year

sector and peer ability is relatively more important in the four-year sector. These broad patterns

are quite robust to extensive student and institutional controls, including measures of student

aspiration to earn a bachelor’s degree. The implication is that while peers and resource

differences are important contributors to the low BA attainment rate of students starting at

community colleges, other factors such as structural barriers to transfer may be equally

important.

         This paper proceeds as follows. The next section delineates the possible reasons that two-

year students have lower BA attainment rates than four-year students. Section 3 introduces our

data and analytic sample. Section 4 describes the new measure of peer quality- average PSAT of

students at each college -and documents the variation in peer composition across and within

sectors. As this measure of peer quality in the two-year sector was not previously available, we

anticipate that this section may be of interest in and of itself.                     Given the importance of

overcoming selection in inferring causality, Section 5 examines the determinants of student


and Mansfield, 2014). So the reduction in college quality effects observed could be because of selection or a direct
role of peer characteristics in explaining institutional quality.

sorting into sector and college quality explicitly. Empirical methods and our main results on

degree completion are presented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes with a discussion of the

implications.

2. Peers, Resources, Transfer, or Selection?

    Prior research on the effect of starting at a two-year versus four-year college is mostly silent

on the underlying mechanism. There are at least three broad explanations. First, measured

college quality (including inputs such as peer ability or instructional spending) is significantly

lower at two-year colleges than four-year colleges. A large literature suggests that college quality

– broadly defined – has an important role in promoting student success in the four-year sector

(Light and Strayer, 2000; Cohodes and Goodman, 2014; Long 2008; Smith 2013) though the

evidence on the two-year sector is thin and less positive. 6 Both Stange (2012) and Bound,

Lovenheim, and Turner (2010) find no effect of additional spending in the community college

sector on students’ attainment.

    The academic achievement of students’ peers is a particular component of quality that could

influence student achievement in higher education, either directly through peer-to-peer

interaction or indirectly by improving the efficiency of teaching and educational production. 7 For

instance, Carrell, Fullerton, and West (2009) find large effects of being assigned to higher-

achieving peers at the Air Force Academy. Unlike prior work that focuses on randomized

roommate assignment and finds small or modest peer effects (Sacerdote, 2001; Zimmerman,

2003; Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2006), their setting alters students’ entire cohort of peers,



6
  There is also a larger literature that examines the effects of college quality on earnings: Black and Smith (2004),
Dale and Krueger (2002, 2011), Hoekstra (2009), Saavedra (2008), Brewer Eide and Ehrenberg (1999). These
studies also mostly ignore two-year colleges.
7
  For broad surveys of the evidence on and challenges to estimating peer effects in education see Sacerdote (2011;
2014). A more theoretical treatment is provided in Epple and Romano (2011). Winston and Zimmerman (2004)
discuss this issue specifically in the context of higher education.

                                                           4
akin to switching colleges. In fact, the existence of peer effects helps explain otherwise

anomalous pricing, admissions, and competitive behavior of institutions and the extent of

stratification observed in the higher education system (Winston and Zimmerman, 2004). Yet we

know little about the importance of broad measures of peers to explaining differences in student

outcomes among community college students. Given that community colleges do not employ

selective admissions, among other differences, the role of peer effects could be quite different

than in the four-year sector.

    A second class of explanation is that students in the two-year sector face additional structural

barriers not encountered by four-year students, namely, the need to transfer institutions in order

to earn a bachelor’s degree. Transferring requires additional college and program search and

application, could result in the loss of credits already earned, and often disrupts students’ non-

academic lives and support by requiring students to move. Few of these barriers confront

students that are transitioning from lower to upper division status at four-year colleges and

universities. Though articulation agreements and guaranteed admissions programs aim to ease

this transition, there is not strong evidence of their effectiveness (Anderson, Sun, and Alfonso,

2006; Roksa and Keith, 2008)

    Lastly, it could be that students attending two-year colleges have traits or intentions that

make them less likely to complete degrees than those starting at four-year colleges. Thus the

lower BA attainment rate of community college students could merely reflect selection and not

the causal effect of initial sector per se.

    In this study we aim to isolate the contribution of the first factor to degree attainment, with a

specific focus on the role of peer student ability, which has not been explored previously.

3. Data Sources and Analytic Sample



                                                 5
3.1. Data Sources

          Our main data source comprises records of high school students who took the

Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test® (PSAT) merged to college

enrollment information from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). Both were obtained

from the College Board, who administers the PSAT and merged on NSC records for all PSAT

takers.

          The PSAT is a standardized test that helps students determine their level of readiness for

college, be it through inherent ability or achievement, and also determines eligibility for various

scholarships. 8 In 2004, 2.9 million students took the test, approximately 1.4 million of which

were high school juniors (the 2006 cohort in our sample). In contrast, approximately 1.5 million

students took the SAT in 2006 (1 million seniors) and a similar number took the ACT. Thus the

number of students taking the PSAT is quite a bit higher than either SAT or ACT in isolation. In

2004, 54.8% of junior test takers were female and 34% of respondents were non-white.

Participation in the PSAT varies by state and district, as it is mandatory in Maine and Delaware

and numerous districts. Our analysis uses all students who took the PSAT and graduated high

school from 2004 to 2006. 9

          PSAT has three sections- math, critical reading, and writing- each ranging from a score of

20 to 80. For this analysis, we focus on the math and critical reading scores, which are the two

subscores most comparable to the SAT and hence our composite PSAT ranges from 40 to 160.

The mean score among the 2004 cohort is approximately 49 in math and 48 in critical reading




8
  We use the term “ability” throughout but PSAT may not measure something like IQ, but rather, measure
achievement, motivation, and subject matter learned- all of which may play a role in peer effects.
9
  We don’t actually know whether the student graduates high school but it is based on their expected graduation
date, as self-reported on all College Board assessments.

                                                         6
and a combined average of 94. 10 In all analysis we standardize these composite test scores to

have a mean of zero and standard deviation one in the population of test-takers separately in

these three cohorts.

         Along with the student’s PSAT scores, these data also include high school GPA, basic

demographics, home zip code, and enrolled high school. 11 Using home zip code, we merge on

the time-invariant population and percent of population with a bachelor’s degree or higher, along

with the time-varying county unemployment rate. 12

         Institution of first enrollment for these PSAT-takers is obtained from the National

Student Clearinghouse (NSC), which collects postsecondary enrollment information on more

than 94 percent of students enrolled in U.S. postsecondary institutions. 13 Data from the NSC

allow us to observe which college, if any, a student enrolls in after high school graduation and

also track transfer and completion. The data were merged with NSC in 2012 for the 2004 and

2005 cohorts and 2013 for the 2006 cohort. Thus we observe degree completion up to eight

years after high school graduation for the 2004 cohort and seven years for the remaining cohorts,

though, we primarily focus on six year graduation rates.

         From Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS),we assemble data on

college characteristics, including tuition, expenditures, enrollment, percent of part-time students,

percent of students who are under 25, latitude and longitude, and sector (two-year or four-year,

public or private, and not-for-profit or for-profit). These are used to create measures of the

11
   High school GPA and demographics are self-reported by the student. Self-reported income is only available for
students who also took the SAT.
12
   Unemployment rates come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and population and educational attainment comes
from the Census Bureau’s decennial census.
13
   A large fraction of non-participating colleges are for-profit institutions. For more information on the limits of
NSC, see Dynarski, Hemelt, and Hyman (2013).

                                                          7
characteristics of colleges attended and of colleges in close proximity to students during high

school. We also collect the population and percent of population with a bachelor’s degree or

higher for the zip code in which each college is located, along with the county level

unemployment rate. 14 Finally, using college location information we construct measures of the

community and higher education system surrounding each college, including the average PSAT

score of students living within 25 miles, the average PSAT score of nearby colleges, and

proximity to and characteristics of nearby two-year and four-year colleges.

3.2. Analytic Sample

         We start with the universe of students who took the PSAT and graduated high school

between 2004 and 2006. We make several exclusions in order to construct our analytic sample,

starting with the exclusion of students who enroll in a college where fewer than 50 students who

took the PSAT across the three cohorts. This ensures that the calculated average PSAT of

students at each college is a relatively stable measure of peer aptitude. 15                     We also exclude

students who do not enroll in college or enroll in a for-profit college. Finally, we exclude

students who are missing some key variables, such as zip code, high school GPA, and tuition and

expenditures at the enrolled colleges. After these exclusions, we make sure we have a balanced

panel of colleges across cohorts.

         Table 1 contains summary statistics for the final sample of 3.36 million students,

separately by sector of first enrollment. Our sample is quite comparable to a nationally-

representative sample of 2004 high school graduates that enroll in public and non-profit colleges,

so our results are likely to generalize to all “traditional-age” entering college students in the US.

14
   These data are collected from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau, but only the unemployment
varies over time.
15
   Requiring fewer or more students or using a count in separate years rather than across years does not substantively
change our results. We combine cohorts across the three years since students interact and learn with different
cohorts in college and students can delay entry after high school.

                                                          8
However, it is important to note that our sample does not reflect the average student in

community college. In addition to “traditional-age” students, community colleges serve older

students, working professionals, those who took a few years off, or those who did not take the

PSAT- none of which are in our sample. 16 Thirty seven percent of students starting at two-year

schools ultimately attend a four-year school and sixteen percent ultimately receives a bachelor’s

degree within six years. The bachelor’s degree attainment rate is significantly higher (68%)

among students who start at a four-year institution. Though this difference in BA attainment rate

across sectors is striking, this table also suggests several possible explanations. One plausible

explanation is selection. As has been documented previously, students attending community

college have lower achievement test scores and high school grades, are disproportionately from

communities with low educational attainment, and are more likely to be underrepresented

minorities. These students may, independent of sector attended, be less likely to attain a BA

degree. However, students at community colleges also experience much lower levels of

educational resources; spending per student is $5,300 lower in the two-year sector and average

peer aptitude (as measured by average PSAT) is also much lower (and discussed in much more

detail in the next section). They also tend to live further from four-year colleges, perhaps

impeding successful transfer.



4. A New Measure of Institutional Quality




16
   Table A1 in the appendix compares our analysis sample to two nationally-representative samples of students
separately for 2-year and 4-year enrollees: 2004 college-going high school seniors from the Education Longitudinal
Study of 2002 and 2003/2004 beginning postsecondary students from the Beginning Postsecondary Study
2004/2009. Our analysis sample is quite comparable in terms of BA attainment, transfer behavior, sex and racial
composition, and high school GPA to recent high school graduates nationally. Our sample has higher rates of
attainment and transfer than all entering college students (the BPS sample), which includes more students who
delayed college entrance after high school.

                                                        9
        The merged PSAT and NSC data permit us to construct measures of average student

achievement of traditional-aged students at the majority of public colleges in the U.S., as well as

many private non-profit ones. Historically, this has been impossible because many two-year

college students do not take the SAT or ACT and these scores are not reported to or by most

two-year institutions, even among students that do take these exams.

        For each two- and four-year college, we calculate the average PSAT score of enrolled

students who took the exam between 2004 and 2006, standardized by the mean and standard

deviation of all test-takers in each cohort. After restricting the sample to students who attend

colleges that have at least 50 students who took the PSAT, this leaves 695 out of the 1061 public

two-year (community) colleges, 434 out of the 711 public four-year colleges and universities,

and 621 out of the 1,662 private non-profit four-year colleges and universities. 17

        By construction, our measure of peer ability captures the characteristics of the recent high

school graduates who attend each school, but does not necessarily reflect the characteristics of

the older students at the school or students who didn’t take the PSAT. Many institutions,

particularly two-year colleges, serve older students. As one check of the validity of the average

PSAT score as a measure of peer ability, we compare average PSAT to average SAT score at the

institution level among four-year colleges. These two measures are highly correlated (correlation

coefficient ≈ 0.9), yet importantly the average PSAT score is available for more institutions,

particularly two-year colleges. We also examine the robustness of our results to alternative

moments of the PSAT distribution within colleges: the median, 25th, and 75th percentiles. Finally,



17
  The official counts come from IPEDS. We exclude for-profit colleges, most of which do not fit our criteria. Table
A2 in the appendix compares the characteristics of institutions included and excluded from our sample based on the
requirement for 50 PSAT test-takers. Excluded institutions tend to be smaller, more likely to be private and more
expensive (among 4-year colleges), and serve older students. Again this suggests that our analysis reflects the
experience of traditional-age students (and colleges that serve traditional students) then those of older students.

                                                        10
in some analyses we control for other characteristics of the student body (fraction part-time,

fraction less than 25 years old) which may be correlated with average PSAT.

4.1. Variation in Peer Quality

       Figure 1 depicts the distribution of average PSAT score across public two-year and four-

year colleges in the U.S. Four facts are noteworthy. First, there is substantial variation in student

ability across colleges. Some colleges enroll very high-ability students while others enroll mostly

low-ability students. This is well documented and is the motivation for much of the prior

research on college quality. Second, the distribution of four-year colleges is shifted to the right of

that of two-year colleges. The average ability of incoming students at four-year colleges is higher

than that of two-year colleges. Again, this is well documented and motivates the need to address

selection into the two-year sector when trying to examine the effect of sector. Third, there is

substantial heterogeneity among two-year colleges. Previous research has mostly treated all two-

year colleges as a homogeneous outside option for bachelor’s degree aspiring students, ignoring

any variation in peer quality within the two-year college sector. Lastly, there is non-trivial

overlap between the two sectors, with some two-year colleges attracting students (on average)

that are as high achieving or even more high-achieving than those at four-year colleges. This is a

new fact and one that has not previously been documented.

       Figure 2 shows the distribution of average PSAT scores at each institution separately for

each state and sector. While there is variation across states, clearly much of the variation in peer

quality operates between institutions within states. Furthermore, almost all states have public

two-year colleges that attract students that are as high-achieving as some of the less-selective

four-year colleges in the state. This overlap across sectors within states will be our main source

of variation to identify the effect of peer composition on student achievement conditional on



                                                 11
sector. When restricting our analysis to public colleges, as in Appendix Figure 2, we see similar

variation and overlap across sectors within states.

4.2. Correlates of Average PSAT of Colleges

       To better understand the correlates of this variation, we fit simple OLS models of the

relationship between the average PSAT score of students at college j and various characteristics

of the college, its neighboring colleges, and the local area in which it resides. We are primarily

interested in three categories of factors: (1) policy characteristics under the control of the

colleges themselves, such as tuition and spending; (2) market characteristics such as number,

proximity, and characteristics of nearby two-year and four-year colleges (public and private);

and (3) local population characteristics such as population size, income, educational attainment,

and achievement of students in nearby high schools. On average, two-year colleges in our sample

(see Appendix Table A2) have an average normalized PSAT of -0.37, spend $4,032 per student,

and charge in-state students $2,823 per year. They are 28.6 miles (on average) from the nearest

other two-year school, 18.9 miles from the nearest four-year school, have 2.4 other two-year

colleges and 5.4 four-year (public or private non-profit) colleges within 25 miles. Four-year

colleges have higher-achieving students (average PSAT is 0.246), spend more on their students,

and charge higher tuitions.

       One of the strongest predictors of community college average PSAT is the average PSAT

of students residing nearby (see Appendix A3). That is, community colleges whose local student

population is high achieving also tend to attract high-achieving students. This is true without

local area controls or with state and county fixed effects. In fact, the average PSAT of nearby

high school students explains one-third of the variation in community college average PSAT.

Our analysis also suggests that two-year colleges located far from four-year colleges tend to



                                                 12
attract higher-ability students; being ten miles further from the nearest four-year college is

associated with an average PSAT score that this 0.017 standard deviations higher. Average

student ability is also higher at two-year colleges that have fewer nearby competitors (both two-

year and four-year) within 25 miles. This pattern is consistent with a model of sorting where

two-year colleges serving larger markets are better able to attract high-achieving students. Two-

year colleges that compete against more four-year colleges for students, by contrast, attract

students of lower average ability. Tuition and expenditure, of geographic competitors or the

colleges themselves, generally have a weak relationship with average student ability.



5. Student Sorting

5.1. Empirical Specification

        We first assess the factors that determine the sorting of students into colleges at the

individual-level. We view this both as informative in its own right and to identify sources of bias

in our analysis examining student outcomes. Any factor that influences sector and peer quality

choice that may also influence degree attainment is potentially a source of bias if not controlled

for.

        We estimate reduced-form models of sector and college choice as represented in

Equation (1). 18




18
   We view this as an approximation to a multinomial choice model, where students choose from a large
set of colleges, each with characteristics that vary by college (e.g. sector or college quality) or college-
student match (e.g. distance). In the full choice model, the probability that a student chooses any one
college will be a function of the characteristics of the individual, the characteristics of the college in
question, and the characteristics of all other colleges. Thus the characteristics of the college chosen by
individual i will be a complex non-linear function of individual traits and the traits of all colleges in a
student’s choice set. Our reduced-form model can be thought of as a simplified linearization of this more
complex model.

                                                    13
                𝐷𝑗(𝑖) = 𝛾0 + 𝛾1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖 + 𝛾2 𝑋𝑖 + 𝛾3 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖 + 𝛾4 𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖 + 𝑒𝑖𝑖 (1)



Let 𝐷𝑗(𝑖) denote the characteristic of college j that is chosen by student i. We are primarily

interested in two characteristics: 4𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑗(𝑖) , an indicator denoting four-year institutions, and

�������
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗(𝑖) , the average PSAT score at school j 19

        Most of the literature focuses on the role of student characteristics, such as test scores,

high school grade point average, race, income, and parent background as key determinants of

sector and college quality. We include these as PSATi and Xi , respectively. To assess the

importance of environmental factors that may also influence student college choices, we also

include a vector of area characteristics (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖 ), including the average test scores of the high

school attended by students, characteristics of the students’ zip code area (population and

fraction of population with a bachelor’s degree), county unemployment rate and either state or

county fixed effects. Finally, we assess the role of characteristics of the college choice set

available to students, 𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖 , which includes the distance to, concentration of, and resources

of nearby two- and four-year colleges.

        Unobserved determinants of college choice (peers, teachers, parent social networks) are

likely to be correlated among students attending the same high school, making high school the

natural level at which to cluster standard errors. Furthermore, several of our key variables are

either defined at the high school level (e.g. high school average GPA) or get most of their

variation across high schools (e.g. proximity to nearby colleges). This again supports the

decision to cluster standard errors at the level of high school.


19
  The subscript j(i) makes explicit the school-level characteristic is a choice by individual (i). We
subsequently drop the (i) subscript from college-level characteristics when talking about the effects of
college characteristics, though the choice nature of these variables remains implicit.

                                                    14
5.2. Results

         Tables 2 and 3 present evidence on the determinants of sector and college quality choice,

respectively. As has been documented previously, in Table 2 we find that higher-achieving

students (higher PSAT scores and high school GPA) are more likely to attend four-year colleges

directly after high school. Column (2) adds characteristics of high school attended and the local

area. These environmental factors are very important: students attending high schools with high

achieving peers or whose community has many college graduates are much more likely to attend

four-year colleges. These patterns (and magnitudes) are quite similar even when state or county

fixed effects are controlled for (specifications 3 and 4). Specification (5) adds characteristics of

students’ college choice set. As expected, students that have more two-year colleges in close

proximity or who live closer to a two-year college are more likely to attend two-year college,

while the opposite is true for those living near more four-year colleges. Expenditure of nearby

colleges has an opposite effect than expected: the sector that is better resourced tends to attract

fewer nearby students. We also find that sector choices of high achieving students are less

sensitive to distance to and density of nearby colleges. 20 In results not reported, estimates are

virtually identical when the tuition of the nearest 2-year and 4-year colleges are included. 21

         Table 3 presents the same specifications, but with average PSAT of the college attended

as the outcome. Models are estimated separately by sector. There is evidence of assortative

matching between colleges and students: higher-achieving students tend to attend college with

other high achieving students. Underrepresented minorities attend colleges with lower-achieving

peers, even after controlling for own achievement. This is true in both sectors, though there are

striking differences in the importance of student characteristics to student sorting across sectors.

20
  These results are reported in Appendix Table A4.
21
  Tuition of the closest four-year school is negatively related to the likelihood of enrolling in a four-year college,
but tuition of the closest two-year is unrelated.

                                                           15
Student achievement and demographics (Specifications 1 and 5) explain 40% of the variation in

chosen peer quality of individuals at four-year institutions, but only 18% in the two-year sector.

Student achievement (PSAT and high school GPA) in particular is a much stronger predictor of

the peers experienced by students in the four-year sector, almost certainly reflecting the fact that

many four-year schools have an admissions process that is at least modestly selective. On the

other hand, local area characteristics, such as the average PSAT of students’ high schools and

unobserved state and county characteristics are much more important in the two-year sector.22

The final column includes characteristics of nearby colleges. Here the predictions are less clear-

cut than in sector choice. Among students attending a two-year college, having more four-year

colleges nearby (or having the closest one closer) is associated with attending a community

college with lower peer ability. This is particularly true for high-achieving students, as reported

in Appendix Table A4. Again, estimates are virtually identical when the tuition of the nearest 2-

year and 4-year colleges are included.

         Our analysis thus provides evidence of sorting: more capable students tend to start at

four-year colleges and also attend institutions with high-achieving peers, though the latter effect

is much weaker among students opting to attend two-year college. This finding that student-

driven sorting is much more prominent for four-year college students than those attending

community college echoes prior work by Stange (2012). Many four-year colleges are at least

modestly selective (based on student achievement) while two-year colleges have open

enrollment and students usually just attend the closest one.


22
  Including county FEs instead of state FEs somewhat attenuates the coefficients on HS Average PSAT and percent
of population with a BA and increases the R-squared to 0.651 in the 2-year sector, but otherwise has little effect on
coefficient estimates. For the four-year sector, a specification with county FEs is identical to that with state FEs,
suggesting that unobserved local factors have virtually no impact on college choice among 4-year college students.
These patterns are consistent with students largely attending community college in their county, so county FEs
explain much of the variation in college quality among community college students. These results are available from
the authors upon request.

                                                         16
         The implications for our empirical analysis of student outcomes are two-fold. First, it will

be important to control for student ability and local area characteristics (particularly high school

average PSAT) as they influence students’ college and sector choice and are also likely to impact

outcomes. Second, non-random selection into college quality may be less problematic in the two-

year rather than four-year sector, as selection appears to be driven more by community rather

than student characteristics. We elaborate on these issues in our discussion of empirical model

below.

6. Postsecondary Attainment

6.1 Empirical Specification

         To assess the effects of sector and peer quality on degree completion, we estimate

Equation (2):

                𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 4𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑗 + 𝛽2 �������
                                          𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗 + 𝛽3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖 + 𝛽4 𝑋𝑖 + 𝛽5 𝑍𝑗 + 𝑒𝑖𝑖             (2)

         Our primary outcome (𝑌𝑖𝑖 ) is an indicator for completion of a bachelor’s degree within

six years, though we also examine completion of any degree (associate’s or bachelor’s degree)

and completion within different time windows. Our primary explanatory variables are 4𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑗

and �������
    𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗 , which are an indicator for attending a four-year institution and the average PSAT

score at school j, respectively. We include students’ own PSAT score and a wealth of individual

characteristics (𝑋𝑖 ), including sex, race/ethnicity, high school GPA, and several characteristics of

the students’ home area. State fixed effects are included in all regressions. We also control for

other characteristics of the institution (𝑍𝑗 ), including control, in-state and out-of-state tuition,

expenditures per student, enrollment, percent of part-time students, and percent of students who

are under 25.




                                                 17
        The first parameter of interest, 𝛽1, measures the combined effect of all sector attributes,

                                                                    �������𝑗 ) or expenditure per
net of those included in the model such as average student ability (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

student (included in 𝑍𝑗 ). 𝛽1 is identified by students with similar characteristics attending schools

with similar peers, yet in different sectors. Figure 2 demonstrated that many states have some

two- and four-year institutions with comparable average student ability, which form the basis for

identifying 𝛽1.The second parameter of interest is 𝛽2, the effect of average peer ability on own

educational attainment, which is permitted to differ by sector and student ability. The effect of

peer quality is identified from differences in outcomes between observably similar students

attending schools with different levels of peer ability in the same sector.

        Unbiased estimation of these parameters requires that sector and peer quality are

uncorrelated with other (unobserved) determinants of degree outcomes, at both the student and

college level. For example, if among students of a given ability level, disadvantaged students

were more likely to attend schools with lower-ability peers, then any lower attainment for this

group may be due to the economic disadvantage, rather than lower peer quality. Exploiting very

rich observable information about the students and colleges, we rely on a selection-on-

observables assumption to overcome the inherent selection bias problems, as is done in much of

the prior literature (Long and Kurlaender, 2009; Stange, 2012; Reynolds, 2012; Bound,

Lovenhiem, Turner, 2010). 23 The results in Table 3 suggest it is important to control for student

ability and local area characteristics (particularly high school average PSAT) as they influence

students’ college and sector choice and are also likely to impact outcomes. However, non-

                             �������𝑗 colleges may be less problematic in the two-year rather than
random selection into higher 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃


23
  We do not attempt to employ an instrumental variables procedure as we have two potentially endogenous
variables (4𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑗 and �������
                        𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗 ) but the standard proximity instruments used by Long and Kurlaender (2009) and
                     �������
others do not impact 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗 in obvious ways that satisfy the exclusion restriction.

four-year sector, as selection appears to be driven more by community rather than student

characteristics. Nonetheless, our estimate of 𝛽2 may include the contribution of unobserved

student characteristics in addition to the direct effect of peer quality. Similarly, since controls for

observables are unlikely to completely eliminate unobserved student differences across sectors,

our estimate of 𝛽1 may combine factors we are interested in (e.g. transfer and articulation

policies, psychic or informational barriers to transfer) with student selection. However, Altonji

and Mansfield (2014) show that controlling for average student observables (e.g. �������
                                                                                 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗 ) may

actually account for sorting on unobservables under a standard sorting model. This suggests that

our conclusion about the importance of factors beyond peers in explaining the four-year versus

two-year BA attainment gap may still hold even after accounting for selection on

unobservables. 24

         We generalize our basic specification in two important ways. First, to examine

differences in the importance of peer quality between sectors, in many specifications we interact

both average PSAT of college with sector and own PSAT with sector. To our knowledge, the

relationship between average peer ability and educational attainment has not been previously

documented for the two-year sector. Second, we include interactions between own PSAT and

average PSAT of college to test for complementarity in peer effects. That is, do relatively able

students benefit more from interacting with high-ability peers than less-able students? Though

the relationship between peer quality and degree completion at four-year colleges has been well-

documented (Long, 2009; Smith, 2013), such a relationship has not been estimated for two-year

colleges.

           Figure 3 presents a graphical illustration of our main findings. The figure plots the

fraction of students at each college that earn a bachelor’s degree within six years of high school

graduation as a function of the average PSAT score of students at the college, separately by

sector. Solid lines are smoothed plots from a locally-weighted regression and the 95%

confidence interval is shaded around the plots. There is a strong relationship between average

student ability and graduation rates in both sectors. A one standard deviation in mean PSAT

score is associated with a 20 to 25 percentage point gain in the graduation rate. There is also a

striking difference in average graduation rates across sectors: students at four-year colleges are

much more likely to earn a degree. To preview our main finding, Figure 3 demonstrates that this

cross-sector gap is large even at colleges with similar levels of average peer ability. Four-year

colleges have graduation rates about 25 percentage points higher than two-year colleges whose

students have the same average PSAT. This is our first suggestive evidence that the performance

gap between the two sectors reflects a combination of both peer ability and other non-peer

factors.

           Table 4 presents OLS estimates of equation (2) with an indicator for receiving a

bachelor’s degree within six years as the outcome. The first two columns present simple

regressions of the outcome on mean college PSAT and a sector indicator, respectively. 25

Combining all colleges, a one standard deviation increase in mean PSAT score is associated with

a 39.8 percentage point increase in likelihood of receiving a bachelor’s degree. The comparable

figures for attending a four-year (rather than two-year) college is 51.5 percentage points. In line

with the previous literature, these estimates suggest that sector and peer quality have an

incredibly strong relationship with student success. Each of these effects are diminished, though

still remain large and significant, when both characteristics are included simultaneously (column
25
     All models also include year and state fixed effects.

                                                       20
3). Approximately 40 percent of the bachelor’s degree attainment gap between the sectors can be

explained by average peer quality. This changes little when student PSAT and the average PSAT

of students’ high school are included as controls, though both of these factors are individually

very predictive (column 4).

       Our preferred specification is (5), which permits the effect of own and peer PSAT score

to vary by sector and also includes a full set of individual controls, including sex, race/ethnicity,

high school GPA, and characteristics of the local population (size, unemployment rate,

educational attainment). Own PSAT is a stronger predictor of success at two-year colleges than

at four-year colleges (coefficient on student PSAT X four-year college interaction is negative).

However, the effect of average peer quality is stronger in the four-year sector. A one standard

deviation increase in peer ability is associated with a 3 percentage point increase in bachelor’s

degree attainment at two-year colleges (95% CI = 0.3 to 5.2 percentage points) and a 14

percentage point increase in bachelor’s degree attainment at four-year colleges. Starting at a two-

year college is associated with a 32.5 percentage point lower rate of BA attainment (95% CI =

30.9 to 34.2 percentage points).

       To examine effect heterogeneity, specifications (6) and (7) permit the effect of peer

quality to differ with student own ability. If own and peer ability are complements in educational

production, then we expect the interaction to be positive. Specification (6) imposes that this peer

complementarity is the same in the two- and four-year sectors, while (7) permits the

complementarity to differ by sector. We see evidence of complementarity in the two-year sector,

but the opposite in the four-year sector. Two-year college students with high test scores benefit

the most from exposure to high-ability peers (consistent with complementarity in production),

while the opposite is true at four-year institutions.



                                                  21
     6.3 Robustness Tests

         Sector and average student ability are only two of the potentially large number of

important attributes of colleges that determine student success. Table 5 probes the sensitivity of

these patterns to controls for various other institutional characteristics. 26 The first column repeats

our final specification from Table 4. In column (2) we control for instructional spending per

student. Accounting for spending differences between institutions has little impact on our

estimates, as aggregate spending has minimal association with student outcomes once sector,

peer ability, and student characteristics are controlled for. 27 Specification (3) controls for a rich

array of other institutional characteristics, including in-state and out-of-state tuition, percent of

students who are part-time, number of students, and percent of students who are under 25 years

old in order to isolate the effect of average peer ability and sector from these other college-level

factors. Though the effect of sector is diminished by about one-third, it remains large and

significant. Interestingly, average peer ability still remains a stronger predictor of outcomes at

four-year schools than two-year schools, while own ability is more important at two-year

schools. The pattern of heterogeneity is also unchanged: high ability students benefit the most

from improvements in peer quality at two-year schools, while low ability students benefit the

most from peer quality at four-year schools.

         Columns (4) through (6) further investigate the robustness to controlling for students’

four-year intentions (proxied by SAT score sending) and restricting the sample in various ways.

We first restrict to only “SAT states” – the 22 states in which more students take the SAT than

the ACT- so as to mitigate some of the selection bias that could stem from non-random PSAT

26
   Appendix Table A5 also demonstrates that our results are nearly identical when using various moments of the
PSAT distribution within colleges, including the mean (our base measure), median, 25th percentile, and 75th
percentile.
27
   In fact, spending is negatively associated with outcomes in the two-year sector. This result was found in some of
the specifications reported by Stange (2012) and also Bound, Lovenhiem, and Turner (2010).

                                                         22
test-taking. Results are largely unchanged. We next restrict to the 9 states where more than 75%

of high school graduates take the PSAT. 28 In this specification, the coefficient on the average

PSAT of the college drops from 0.0551 to 0.036 and is only marginally significant. While the

coefficients are not statistically different from one another, it may suggest that the previous

results suffered from selection bias. The alternative explanation to selection bias is that the 9

states differ in other ways, such as student composition or articulation agreements between

colleges.

         The estimates from our final specification with the full sample (Table 5, specification 4)

suggest that both peer ability and sector have independent effects on graduation. For a student in

the middle of the PSAT distribution, starting at a four-year college is associated with a 20.7

percentage point increase in the likelihood of earning a bachelor’s degree within six years (95%

CI = 18.0 to 23.3 percentage points). A one standard deviation increase in mean PSAT score of

peer students is associated with a 5.3 (10.1) percentage point increase among students attending a

two-year (four-year) school (95% CI = 3.0 to 7.6 percentage points for two-year students). Own

ability also matters, though less so for students at four-year schools. The fact that sector is still so

important even after accounting for peer ability, expenditure, and several other college attributes

suggests that structural factors such as credit transfer policies and the disruption of having to

relocate to another college in order to earn a degree are important.

     6.4 Alternative Outcomes




28
   This 75% threshold corresponds to the fraction of high school graduates that go on to college and also happened
to be a natural break in the data. This is not to imply that all college-goers in these states took the PSAT, but it is
likely to be a very high fraction did.

                                                           23
        Table 6 examines other outcomes. The first three columns examine bachelor’s degree

attainment over different time horizons (our base model using 6 years is repeated in column 2).29

Most of our results are qualitatively similar, though stronger when looking at a longer time

horizon. This is because few students with average PSAT scores and attending colleges of

average quality actually graduate within four years, so sector differences widen over longer time

horizons. Of course, a bachelor’s degree may not be the goal of many students that enter two-

year colleges. The next two sets of columns examine attainment of an associate’s degree or any

degree (associate’s or bachelors). Much of the attainment gain of starting at a four-year

institution or attending a two-year college with more able peers operates via shifting students

from associate’s to bachelor’s degrees. Attending a two-year college with higher achieving peers

is associated with lower rates of associate’s degree attainment, particularly for high-ability

students. Starting at a four-year institution also makes it extremely unlikely that students will

earn an associate’s degree, which is unsurprising given that only 2% of students starting at a

four-year institution in our sample receive an associate’s degree. Columns (7) to (9) examine the

outcome of whether students earn any degree (associate’s or bachelor’s). Starting at a four-year

institution is ultimately associated with a 7-8 percentage point increase in the likelihood of

earning any degree, but peer quality only influences degree attainment in the four-year sector.

However, students’ own ability is a more important predictor of degree attainment in the two-

year sector rather than the four-year sector.

7    Interpretation and Discussion

        Wide differences in student outcomes exist across sectors of higher education and

between institutions within sectors. In fact, closing these performance caps between institutions


29
  The 8-year completion rates only use the 2004 cohort but previous results are not sensitive to only using 2004
cohort, thus ruling out cohort effects.

                                                         24
and sectors has been one consistent theme of many higher education policies undertaken recently

by the Obama Administration and many states. Performance funding is being discussed,

advocated, and enacted by many states that explicitly ties state appropriations to institutional

performance and the student outcomes are one of the key inputs into the college ratings scheme

recently considered by the Obama Administration. 30

        However, identifying the sources of these outcome differences has been difficult due to

limited information about the two-year sector. In this paper we have used a novel dataset on all

PSAT test-takers in the U.S. to construct a measure of peer ability that is comparable across

sectors and available for many two-year colleges. Our main contribution is to be able to compare

institutions within the two-year sector and to compare institutions with similar peers across

sectors. Since two-year colleges are generally open admission, almost all previous research on

college quality has grouped them together, ignoring any heterogeneity within the two-year

sector. Our analysis suggests that this simplification misses a lot: there is substantial variation in

peer quality across two-year institutions and some two-year institutions actually attract students

that are quite similar to less-selective four-year institutions. This overlap permits us to examine

how much of the outcome gap between the two- and four-year sectors is attributable to peer

quality, a chief input in educational production. We find that substantial differences in student

outcomes exist across sectors even between institutions with similar students. This holds true

even after controlling for other observed institutional characteristics, such as spending, tuition,

student age, percent part-time, and size. Thus structural factors, such as barriers to transferring

between institutions, are likely as (if not more) important an explanation for the sector gap than

input differences.

       Across several outcomes and specifications, we also find interesting differences in the

relative importance of own and peer ability across sectors. In determining bachelor’s or any

degree attainment, students’ own ability is relatively more important in the two-year sector,

while peer ability is relatively more important in the four-year sector. One interpretation is that

individual traits – such as the ability to navigate a complex transfer process or balance school

with other commitments – are more important in the two-year setting, which has less structure

and institutional support. By contrast, peers help serve that role at four-year institutions.

Regardless of the explanation, this finding suggests that the nature of the production process is

different across sectors, an area that should be explored further.

       Our results also have implications for understanding college choice and policy,

suggesting that the decision on where to enroll is even more nuanced than is typically discussed.

The quality of the two-year college, as measured by average PSAT scores, matters, perhaps as

much as it does for four-year colleges. Thus, students may not want to consider their local two-

year college as the only alternative, but rather, carefully weigh it against the four-year options

and even other two-year options, which may be more distant. Similarly, policies that incentivize

two-year over four-year enrollment, such as “free community college,” may lower some

students’ chances of receiving a bachelor’s degree, though, it depends on the relative college

qualities a student faces.

       Our results also have implications for many of the accountability measures currently

being discussed. Since these typically target institutions in isolation, they miss an important

determinant of two-year college success, such as transfer processes that are largely determined

by external institutions or systems. This focus on the performance of individual institutions may

thus create incentives for these institutions to target outcomes they have control over, such as



                                                 26
associate’s degree attainment, at the expense of bachelor’s outcomes (that depend on other

institutions).

        Our study has two chief limitations. First, we employ a “selection-on-observables”

assumption; unobserved factors (e.g. unmeasured student motivation or preparation) may thus

cause us to overstate the independent contribution of sector and own peer ability in explaining

BA degree attainment. However, under certain assumptions about the sorting process, our

conclusion about the importance of factors beyond peers in explaining the 4-year vs. 2-year BA

attainment gap may still hold even after accounting for selection on unobservables (Altonji and

Mansfield, 2014). A more focused attempt to isolate the importance of peers in a community

college setting using experimental and quasi-experimental variation would be a welcome

contribution to the literature on peer effects in higher education, which has focused on university

students. A second limitation is one of generalizability, as our analysis necessarily focuses on

“traditional-age” college students that enroll shortly after high school graduation. Our sample is

quite representative of these types of students, but we are not able to say whether our results

generalize to the older students that constitute a large share of community college students.

Assessing the importance of peers to these students’ success is a second important area for future

research.

Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the college level. *** means significant at 1% level, ** at 5%, and * at 10%. All
regressions control for year and state fixed effects and student controls (include sex, race/ethnicity, parental low-income status, high
school GPA, home zip code's population and bachelor's degree attainment rate, and home county's unemployment rate). College
controls include in-state and out-of-state tuition, percent of students who are part-time, number of students, and percent of students
who are under 25 years old. SAT States are the 22 states in which more students take the SAT than the ACT. PSAT States are the 9
states in which at least 75% of high school graduates take the PSAT. All measures using PSAT are standardized by the mean and
standard deviation of all PSAT takers in the corresponding year.

Notes: National samples tabulated using NCES PowerStats Version 1.0. ELS Sample drawn from 11,656 students who were high school seniors in
2004 and who responded to the third follow‐up of the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (weighted by F3QWT). BPS sample drawn from
16,100 students who were beginning postsecondary students in 2003/2004 who responded to the 2009 follow‐up of the Beginning Postseconday
Study 2004/2009 (weighted by WTB000). Both samples restricted to students whose first PSE was a public 2‐year, a public or non‐profit 4‐year.
Initial sector and outcomes for ELS sample are taken 8 years after high school graduation. Average HS GPA for ELS and BPS is calculated by
taking the weighted sum across 0.50 categories. "Took SAT" for ELS sample includes 6‐7% of students that took either the SAT or ACT, but were
not sure which one. "Took SAT" in BPS only for students < = 24 years old. "No delayed PSE enrollment" is defined as enrollment within the first
six months after HS graduation for the ELS sample and within the first academic year after high school graduation for the BPS sample. BA
attainment rates for analysis sample are presented for the 2004 cohort only in order to have a consistent sample for 6‐year and 8‐year BA
attainment rates.

Notes: An observation is a college-year. In sample colleges have at least 50 PSAT test-takers combined across the 2004-2006 cohorts. Out-of-sample colleges report at
least these data. Outcome variables and average PSAT are calculated only from observed PSAT takers in that cohort. All for profit colleges are excluded. Local area
characteristics (population, percent of population with Bachelor's degree, unemployment rate) are calculated for the county in which the college is located.
