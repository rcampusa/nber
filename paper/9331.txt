               We analyze consumption and portfolio behavior in a life-cycle model with realistic

borrowing costs and income processes. We show that even a small wedge between borrowing costs and
the risk-free return dramatically shrinks the demand for equity. When the cost of borrowing equals or
exceeds the expected return on equity – the relevant case according to the data – households hold little
or no equity during much of the life cycle. The model also implies that the correlation between
consumption growth and equity returns is low at all ages, and that risk aversion estimates based on the
standard excess return formulation of the consumption Euler Equation are greatly upward biased. The

demand for equity in the model is non-monotonic in borrowing costs and risk aversion, and the standard
deviation of marginal utility growth is an order of magnitude smaller than the Sharpe ratio.

1     Introduction

This paper analyzes consumption and portfolio behavior in a life-cycle model with

borrowing costs that exceed the risk-free investment return. The agents have stan-

dard time-separable preferences with modest risk aversion and mild impatience, face

realistic income processes, and can invest in risky and risk-free assets.

    We show that a wedge between borrowing costs and the risk-free return has several

important eﬀects on consumption and portfolio behavior. First, even a modest wedge

dramatically shrinks the demand for equity throughout the life cycle. Second, when

the borrowing rate equals or exceeds the expected return on equity – the relevant

case according to the data – households hold little or no equity until middle age.

Third, the correlation between consumption growth and equity returns rises with

age, but it is low at all ages for reasonable parameter choices. Fourth, risk aversion

estimates based on the standard excess return formulation of the consumption Euler

Equation are greatly upward biased. The bias diminishes, but remains large, for

“samples” of households with positive equity holdings. Fifth, households borrow to

ﬁnance consumption but not to ﬁnance large equity positions. In each respect, the

introduction of a realistic wedge between borrowing costs and the risk-free return

greatly improves the ﬁt between theory and empirical evidence.

    Table 1 reports data on the size of the wedge. The bottom two rows show that

household borrowing costs on unsecured loans exceed the risk-free return by about six

to nine percentage points on an annual basis, after adjusting for tax considerations

and charge-oﬀs for uncollected loan obligations. Since 1987, roughly two percentage

points arise from the asymmetric income tax treatment of household interest receipts

and payments. However, the bulk of the wedge arises from transactions costs in the

loan market. Despite the evident size of these transaction costs, they have been largely

ignored in theoretical analyses of life-cycle consumption and portfolio behavior. They

have also been ignored in most empirical studies of asset-pricing behavior.

                                           1
   Aside from the wedge between borrowing costs and the risk-free return, our life-

cycle model is entirely standard. None of our results rely on strong risk aversion, a

high degree of impatience, habit formation, other types of nonseparability, self-control

problems or myopia. Nor do they rely on equity market participation costs, informa-

tional barriers, time-varying asset returns, enforcement problems in loan markets, or

hard borrowing limits (other than the lifetime budget constraint).

   According to our analysis, the cost of borrowing and the shape of the expected

life-cycle income proﬁle are key determinants of equity accumulation. The variance of

undiversiﬁable labor income shocks also has important eﬀects on equity holdings, and

the risky nature of labor income is an important source of cross-sectional heterogeneity

in consumption and asset holdings conditional on age.

   Our analysis also highlights several other results. First, equity holdings and mar-

ket participation rates are non-monotonic in the cost of borrowing, both reaching a

minimum where the borrowing cost equals the expected return on equity. As this

result suggests, the properties of our model are not “in between” those of the canon-

ical model with equal borrowing and lending rates and alternative models with hard

borrowing limits. Second, relative to a model with a no-borrowing constraint, house-

holds defer equity market participation when faced with realistic borrowing costs.

As a consequence, households accumulate less equity over the life cycle when faced

with realistic borrowing costs as compared to a no-borrowing constraint. Third, eq-

uity holdings and participation rates are non-monotonic in the degree of risk aversion

when borrowing costs exceed the risk-free return. Fourth, once we consider realistic

borrowing costs, neither sizable deviations from optimal portfolio shares nor delayed

participation in equity markets until, say, age 50 involves large welfare costs.

   On the asset-pricing front, our analysis helps resolve two closely related aspects

of the equity premium puzzle: Why do people hold so little equity when faced with

a substantial equity premium? And, why is the covariance between consumption


                                           2
growth and asset returns so low? Answers to both question follow from the high

borrowing costs reported in Table 1. These data imply a small or negative “leverage”

premium on borrowed funds that are invested in the stock market. This fact, when

combined with upward sloping income proﬁles or mildly impatient consumers, means

that households accumulate little or no equity until middle age, and they can have

modest equity holdings even on the verge of retirement.

   The paper proceeds as follows. The balance of the introduction discusses related

research and reviews some well-established facts about life-cycle consumption and

portfolio behavior. Sections 2 and 3 describe the model and the choice of parameters.

Section 4 discusses life-cycle portfolio choice and consumption in our model, and

section 5 compares model implications with empirical evidence. Section 6 oﬀers some

concluding remarks, and an appendix describes our numerical solution method.


1.1    Relationship to the Literature

Our model departs modestly from the seminal work on life-cycle portfolio behavior by

Merton (1969) and Samuelson (1969). Indeed, our model is identical to Samuelson’s

discrete-time setup except for three elements: the wedge between borrowing costs and

risk-free returns, the presence of undiversiﬁable income shocks, and the use of realistic

income proﬁles. The wedge and the undiversiﬁable labor income shocks necessitate

a computational approach to the analysis, which we pursue using the same methods

as in Judd, Kubler and Schmedders (2002).

   We also build on other research in ﬁnance and macroeconomics. Brennan (1971)

shows that a wedge between borrowing costs and risk-free returns is easily handled in

the standard one-period model of mean-variance portfolio choice. The wedge implies

that households cannot attain points above and to the right of the tangency portfolio

along the standard capital market line. Higher borrowing costs reduce the demand for

equity in the one-period setting, given standard mean-variance preferences. Heaton


                                           3
and Lucas (1997) show that a borrowing rate that exceeds the risk-free return reduces

equity holdings for an inﬁnitely lived agent.

   We incorporate key life-cycle elements into a many-period setting with realistic

borrowing costs and endogenous wealth accumulation. In our model, unlike Brennan

or Heaton-Lucas, higher borrowing costs raise the demand for equity in reasonable

circumstances. The causal mechanism behind this result involves the impact of bor-

rowing costs on precautionary savings and life-cycle asset accumulation. More gen-

erally, life-cycle factors play a central role in both equity market participation and

equity accumulation behavior in our model.

   Many researchers have explored the eﬀects of hard borrowing limits on portfolio

choice in life-cycle models. For example, Constantinides, Donaldson and Mehra (2002)

consider a three-period model with no borrowing, and Gomes and Michaelides (2002)

consider a calibrated many-period life-cycle model. We show that allowing households

to borrow at a rate above the risk-free return yields more realistic behavior with

respect to asset accumulation, equity market participation and borrowing itself than

a blanket prohibition on borrowing.

   Section 5 shows that our model generates a standard deviation of marginal utility

growth that is an order of magnitude smaller than the Sharpe ratio. This result

appears inconsistent with Hansen and Jagannathan (1991), who argue that the Sharpe

ratio represents a lower bound on the standard deviation of marginal utility growth.

Our result should not come as a complete surprise, however. Other researchers (He

and Modest, 1995, and Luttmer, 1996) show that the existence of trading frictions

can potentially reduce the implied lower bound on the volatility of marginal utility

growth. We show that one particular, and easily quantiﬁed, friction does indeed

reconcile a high Sharpe ratio with low volatility of marginal utility growth.

1.2    Some facts of life-cycle consumption and portfolio choice

Three well-established sets of empirical results are relevant to an assessment of our

model. First, a large percentage of households hold no equity – a phenomenon some-

times referred to as the “participation puzzle.” According to Vissing-Jorgenson (2002),

only 44 percent of households held stock in 1994, a big increase over the 28 percent

ﬁgure for 1984. Participation rates rise with age (Poterba and Samwick, 2001), educa-

tion and income (Mankiw and Zeldes, 1991, Brav and Geczy, 1995), and self-employed

workers are more likely to hold stock (Heaton and Lucas, 2000). To a large degree,

low equity market participation can be traced to the fact the many households have

little or no ﬁnancial wealth (Lusardi et al., 2001).

    Second, most households that do hold equity hold very little. Vissing-Jorgensen

(2002) reports that the median level of equity holdings for stockholding households is

about 21 thousand dollars, and the mean is 95 thousand dollars. Ameriks and Zeldes

(2001) ﬁnd that the level of stockholding rises with education, income and age.

    Third, at least as far back as Grossman and Shiller (1982), many researchers

have observed that the covariance of consumption growth and equity returns is very

low, even for most households that hold equity. That is, given standard preferences

and a plausible degree of risk aversion, the estimated covariance violates standard

consumption-based asset pricing relations. Several researchers have also shown, how-

ever, that the covariance is higher for households that hold equity. See, for example,

Mankiw and Zeldes (1991), Brav and Geczy (1995), Brav, Constantinides and Geczy

(2002) and Attanasio, Banks and Tanner (2002).



2     A Life-Cycle Model

We consider a partial equilibrium model of household consumption and portfolio

choice. The household life cycle consists of two phases, work and retirement, which


                                           5
diﬀer with respect to the character of labor income. During the working years, log

labor income (ỹt ) evolves as the sum of a deterministic component (dt ), a random

walk component (η̃t ), and an uncorrelated transitory shock (ε̃t ):

                                    ỹt = dt + η̃t + ε̃t .

This type of income process is widely used in life-cycle studies of consumption and

asset accumulation.

   During the retirement years, a household receives a fraction of its income in the last

year of work. Ideally, we would specify retirement income as some fraction of, say, the

highest n years of work income – consistent with most deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans

and with social security. However, such a structure is computationally burdensome,

because it increases the dimensionality of the state space. As a computationally

easier alternative, we ﬁrst calculate the ratio of the average value of dt in the highest

n working years to the value of d in the last year of work. We then multiply this ratio

by realized income in the last year of work to get the retirement basis. Finally, to get

retirement income, we multiply the retirement basis by a number between zero and

one called the replacement rate.

   To see why this procedure is useful, look at Figure 1, which shows expected

labor income proﬁles for various education groups. Note, for example, that expected

labor income in the ﬁnal year of work is lower relative to lifetime expected income

for college-educated households than for households with post-graduate education.

Hence, setting retirement income to the same fraction of income in the last working

year for all households would eﬀectively assign a relatively low replacement rate to

college-educated households. The retirement basis serves to adjust for diﬀerences

among education groups in the shape of the lifetime expected income proﬁle.

   Households can trade three ﬁnancial assets. They can buy equity with stochastic

net return r̃E , save at a net risk-free rate rL , and borrow at the rate rB ≥ rL . House-

holds cannot take short positions in equity, nor can they borrow negative amounts.

                                              6
Net indebtedness cannot exceed the present value of the household’s lowest possible

future income stream, discounted at the borrowing rate of interest.

        A household chooses a contingency plan for consumption, borrowings and asset

holdings at date t to maximize

subject to a sequence of budget constraints, where ca is consumption at age a, Et

is the expectations operator conditional on time-t information, β is a time discount

factor, and U (·) is an isoelastic utility function. We solve numerically for the optimal

solution using a backward induction algorithm, as described in the appendix.



3         Parameter Settings and Discretization

Tables 2 and 3 summarize our parameter settings. We set the coeﬃcient of relative

risk aversion to 2 in our baseline speciﬁcation, but we also report results for other

values ranging from 0.5 to 8. We set the annual time discount factor to .95.1

        Following Campbell (1999), we set the annual risk-free investment return to 2%,

the expected return on equity to 8% and the standard deviation of equity returns to

15%. We set the correlation of equity returns and labor income shocks to zero.2 In

line with Table 1, we set the baseline borrowing rate to 8%.
    1
        Compelling evidence on the value of the subjective discount factor is scarce. See the discussion
in Engen et al. (1999). Much, perhaps most, previous research on consumption and portfolio choice
over the life cycle adopts values near .95 or .96. Our model generates realistic asset accumulation
behavior for values in this neighborhood. Substantially lower values (e.g., .90) lead to very little
wealth accumulation over the life cycle, and substantially higher values (e.g., 1.0) imply much greater
wealth accumulation than seen in the data.
  2
    Davis and Willen (2000) present evidence of non-zero correlations between labor income shocks
and equity returns. They also consider the implications of a non-zero correlation for life-cycle
portfolio choice in a model with the borrowing rate equal to the risk-free investment return.



                                                      7
      For the life-cycle income processes, we adopt parameter values estimated by Gour-

inchas and Parker (2002) from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) and the

Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The GP income measure is “after-tax fam-

ily income less social security tax payments, pension contributions, after-tax asset

and interest income” in 1987 dollars. GP also subtract “education, medical care and

mortgage interest payments” from their measure of income, because “these categories

of expenditure do not provide current utility but rather are either illiquid investments

or negative income shocks.”3 They restrict their sample to male-headed households

and attribute the head’s age and education to the entire household.

      To estimate the deterministic component of income for each education group, GP

ﬁt a ﬁfth-order polynomial in the head’s age to CEX data on log family income.

They also ﬁt a ﬁfth-order polynomial to their entire sample, pooled over the ﬁve

education groups. To estimate the standard deviation of transitory and permanent

income shocks, GP use the longitudinal aspect of the PSID. Since the income measures

reported in household surveys contain much measurement error, the raw variance es-

timates substantially overstate income uncertainty. To adjust for this overstatement,

we adopt GP’s suggestion to reduce the estimated variance of the transitory shock

by one half and the variance of the permanent shock by one third. Table 3 reports

the standard deviation of the income shocks after adjusting for measurement error.

      The expected income proﬁles displayed in Figure 1 reﬂect three elements of the

GP income processes: (i) the proﬁle of the deterministic component; (ii) the variance

of the transitory shock to log income, which aﬀects the level of expected income; and

(iii) the variance of the permanent shock, which aﬀects the level and slope of expected

income. The proﬁle for the middle education group, not displayed in Figure 1, is very

similar to the proﬁle for the pooled sample.

      We discretize the state-space using the Tauchen and Hussey (1991) method. Our
  3
      Without these deductions, household income would be about 27% higher.



                                               8
model has three sources of randomness: a permanent labor income shock, a transitory

income shock and an asset return shock. We specify two discrete points for the

permanent shock, two points for the transitory shock and three points for the asset

return shock, so that the random shocks obey a twelve-state Markov chain.

        Our discretization procedure does not generate zero income in any state of na-

ture. In this respect, our speciﬁcation diﬀers from that of GP. The diﬀerence is not

innocuous: by assuming that agents have non-zero probability of zero income, GP

preclude borrowing.4 In our setup, households can and do borrow.

        In our numerical analysis below, we often turn oﬀ one or both labor income shocks.

We do this for two reasons: ﬁrst, to help understand the impact of income uncertainty

on equity demand and, second, to show that many of our results do not rest on income

uncertainty. Whenever we shut oﬀ one or both income shocks, we also readjust the

deterministic income component to preserve the same expected income proﬁle.



4         The demand for equity over the life cycle

Before analyzing portfolio choice, we ﬁrst introduce some terminology and provide

intuition. We then explore how four parameters of the household decision problem

aﬀect the demand for equity over the life cycle: (1) the borrowing rate, (2) risk

aversion, (3) undiversiﬁable labor income shocks, and (4) the shape of the income

proﬁle. Lastly, we turn to the issue of non-participation in equity markets.

        Borrowing capacity is the present value of future labor income (including retire-

ment income), when discounted at the borrowing rate, along the lowest possible future
    4
        If zero income is possible in the last period of life, households that borrow in the penultimate
period run the risk of negative consumption in the ﬁnal period. With isoelastic utility and relative
risk aversion of at least 1, the possibility of negative consumption, no matter how remote, leads
to inﬁnitely negative utility. Thus no households borrow in the penultimate period. The same
argument extends to earlier periods of life by induction.



                                                     9
income path. The equity premium is the diﬀerence between the expected return on

equity and the risk-free investment return. The leverage premium is the diﬀerence

between the expected equity return and the borrowing rate. When the cost of borrow-

ing exceeds the risk-free investment return, the equity premium exceeds the leverage

premium. Hence, the net return on equity depends on the source of funds invested,

as depicted in the following table.

          Source of funds        Opportunity cost Net equity return

          Liquid wealth          Risk-free return    Equity premium

          Borrowing capacity     Borrowing rate      Leverage premium

   Given a realistic equity premium (say 6%), a household invests all or much of its

liquid wealth in equity. When the leverage premium is positive, a household may also

borrow to ﬁnance equity holdings, but it holds less equity than an otherwise similar

household with greater ﬁnancial wealth. When the leverage premium is negative,

households do not draw on borrowing capacity to invest in equity. That is, with

a zero or negative leverage premium, equity demand varies closely (often one-for-

one) with liquid wealth. In turn, liquid wealth depends principally on the shape of

the lifetime income proﬁle and the strength of consumption-smoothing motives. For

example, a household with a sharply upward-sloping income proﬁle saves little, and

thus acquires little equity, early in life. The upshot is that the evolution of liquid

wealth over the life cycle is a key determinant of equity demand.


4.1    Eﬀect of the borrowing rate

How does the borrowing rate aﬀect the demand for equity over the life cycle? First, a

higher borrowing cost lowers borrowing capacity by reducing the present value of labor

income. Second, a higher borrowing rate lowers the leverage premium. And third, the

borrowing rate aﬀects the evolution of wealth over the life cycle. A low borrowing rate

depresses liquid wealth by encouraging greater borrowing for consumption smoothing

                                          10
purposes and by substituting for precautionary wealth holdings that households would

otherwise accumulate to smooth transitory income shocks. But a low borrowing rate

can also increase liquid wealth: if the leverage premium is positive, borrowing to

invest in equity enables the household to increase wealth over time.

   As these remarks suggest, there is a non-monotonic relationship between the cost

of borrowing and the demand for equity. For example, consider our baseline speciﬁ-

cation with no labor income risk for a household from the pooled sample. Figure 2

shows its life-cycle equity holdings (averaged over many draws) for alternative bor-

rowing rates. When the borrowing rate equals the risk-free return of 2%, households

invest large amounts in equity throughout the life cycle, a result that is not sensitive

to the shape of the income proﬁle. Thus, the standard model with rB = rL implies

equity holdings that greatly exceed what we see in the data.

   A borrowing rate of 5% yields much lower equity holdings throughout the life cycle.

Why? An increase in the borrowing rate from 2% to 5% implies a reduction in the

leverage premium from 6% to 3% and a decline in borrowing capacity. The eﬀect on

a very young household is easily understood: since it has no liquid wealth, a smaller

leverage premium and lower borrowing capacity mean lower equity demand. Less

obviously, the disparity in equity holdings persists into retirement. Two forces are at

work. First, households with a non-zero replacement rate still have borrowing capacity

in retirement. As shown in Figure 3, households with a positive leverage premium

continue to borrow until the year before death. So even in retirement, the size of the

leverage premium aﬀects equity demand. Second, a higher leverage premium earlier in

life leads, in expectation, to higher wealth accumulation by retirement, as illustrated

in Figure 4. A household with a 2% borrowing rate has much greater liquid wealth

at retirement than a household with a 5% borrowing rate.

   Equity demand behaves diﬀerently when the leverage premium is zero or negative.

With a borrowing rate equal to 8%, the household from the pooled sample does not


                                          11
invest in equity until age 54 (Figure 2). That is, it never pays to invest borrowing

capacity in equity when the leverage premium is zero or negative. However, the

household still borrows when young for consumption-smoothing purposes (Figure 3),

provided that the cost of borrowing is not too high, so that liquid wealth is negative

during much of the life cycle. Although the household from the pooled sample with

a zero leverage premium stops borrowing after age 53, asset accumulation and equity

demand are smaller than cases with a positive leverage premium.

   At borrowing rates above 8%, households hold more equity than at a borrowing

rate equal to 8% (Figure 2). In this region, higher borrowing rates lead to less

borrowing early in life (Figure 3), earlier participation in equity markets (Figure 2)

and greater liquid wealth at retirement (Figure 4).

   Figure 5 shows average demand for equity as a function of the borrowing rate,

computed using the age and education weights in the Gourinchas-Parker CEX sample.

As seen in Figure 5, average equity demand is smallest when the borrowing rate

equals the expected return on equity. At this trough, equity demand in the model

with risky labor income is less than 10% of its value in an otherwise identical model

with borrowing rate equal to the risk-free return. For the model with no labor income

risk, average equity demand at rB = E(r̃E ) is less than 1% of its value at rB = rL .

   Further increases in the cost of borrowing above E(r̃E ) raise average equity de-

mand.   In particular, higher borrowing costs discourage consumption smoothing

through the loan market, so that households begin accumulating wealth earlier in

the life cycle. Note, however, that the equity demand function is rather ﬂat to the

right of rB = E(r̃E ). Hence, when borrowing rates equal or exceed the return on

equity, the demand for equity is an order of magnitude smaller than in a standard

model with equal borrowing and lending rates.

   To sum up, we emphasize three points. First, even a modest wedge between bor-

rowing and lending rates sharply reduces the demand for equity. Second, a borrowing


                                          12
rate equal to the return on equity minimizes the demand for equity. This result is

particularly notable since the borrowing rates reported in Table 1 lie near estimates

of the expected return on equity. Third, introducing a realistic borrowing rate into

an otherwise standard life-cycle model dramatically shrinks the demand for equity.


4.2        Eﬀect of undiversiﬁable labor income risk

How does undiversiﬁable labor income risk aﬀect the demand for equity over the life

cycle? First, greater income risk makes households with proper preferences eﬀectively

more risk averse, which reduces equity demand at given levels of liquid wealth and

borrowing capacity. Second, greater income risk intensiﬁes the precautionary saving

motive, which encourages wealth accumulation for consumption-smoothing purposes.

These two eﬀects work in opposite directions.

       Figure 6 shows that the ﬁrst eﬀect dominates when rB = rL , so that labor income

uncertainty lowers equity holdings. In contrast, the second eﬀect dominates when

rB = E(r̃E ). This case diﬀers from the case with rB = rL for two reasons. First, when

rB = E(r̃E ), younger households hold no equity in the absence of income uncertainty.

Hence, they cannot oﬄoad risk by reducing their equity holdings, and the ﬁrst eﬀect

is shut oﬀ. Second, it is more costly to rely on borrowing as a consumption-smoothing

device at a high interest rate, so that the precautionary motive for asset accumulation

becomes stronger. As a result, income uncertainty increases equity demand when

rB = E(r̃E ).5


4.3        Eﬀect of relative risk aversion

How does an increase in the relative risk aversion parameter aﬀect the demand for

equity over the life cycle? Greater risk aversion lowers a household’s appetite for risk,
   5
       We discuss the distinct eﬀects of permanent and transitory income shocks on the demand for
equity in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 below.


                                                13
and its demand for equity, at a given level of liquid wealth. But risk aversion also has a

powerful eﬀect on the evolution of liquid wealth over the life cycle. Higher risk aversion

means higher precautionary savings, which raises wealth. Higher risk aversion also

means a lower elasticity of substitution under our preference speciﬁcation, which leads

to more borrowing and less wealth accumulation with a rising income proﬁle.

   As these remarks suggest, stronger risk aversion can mean higher or lower equity

demand, and the eﬀects can vary signiﬁcantly with age. When the borrowing rate

equals the risk-free return, higher risk aversion leads to lower equity holdings through-

out the life cycle. When the borrowing rate equals the return on equity, the story

is more complicated, as shown in Figure 7. Observe that a household with RRA=1

holds less equity throughout life than a household with RRA=.5 or one with RRA=4.

A household with RRA=8 holds more equity early in life than any other case shown,

but it holds less equity at the end of life.

   What drives these results? Since the leverage premium is zero, the main issue is

how liquid assets evolve over the life cycle. A household with RRA=0.5 has a high

elasticity of substitution, which makes it willing to reduce consumption early in life.

As a result, it borrows less early in life than a household with RRA=1. In turn,

lower borrowing and more investment lead to higher wealth accumulation throughout

the life cycle. A household with RRA=4 accumulates assets early in life because of

a strong precautionary motive. The additional savings early in life lead to greater

wealth throughout life than the household with RRA=1. Finally, what about the

household with RRA=8? Early in life, it invests more than the other cases shown,

reﬂecting its strong precautionary saving motive. But all along, unlike the other

households, it ﬁnds the risk-free asset highly attractive. As it ages, it continues to

direct a large fraction of its portfolio to the risk-free asset, so that it experiences a

substantially lower return on its asset portfolio.

   Figure 8 shows that the average demand for equity is a non-monotonic function


                                               14
of the risk aversion parameter when borrowing costs exceed the risk-free return. For

relative risk aversion below 2 or above 7, equity demand rises with risk aversion, as

predicted by a simpler model with rB = rL . For relative risk aversion between 2

and 7, equity demand is a declining function of the risk aversion parameter. Equity

demand is near its minimum for relative risk aversion values near 2 or 3.


4.4        Eﬀect of the expected labor income proﬁle

How does the shape of the expected income proﬁle aﬀect the demand for equity? The

answer hinges on the cost of borrowing. When rB = rL and labor income is risky

(certain), the shape of the income proﬁle has little (zero) eﬀect on equity demand.

In contrast, when rB ≥ E(r̃E ), the demand for equity is highly sensitive to the

shape of the income proﬁle.6 The explanation for this sensitivity is straightforward:

households borrow only for consumption-smoothing purposes when rB ≥ E(r̃E ), so

they hold no equity until they attain positive ﬁnancial wealth. The age at which this

occurs depends on the shape of the income proﬁle.

       Consider the case with rB = E(r̃E ). Figure 9 compares life-cycle equity demand

for a household from the pooled sample and no labor income risk to an otherwise

identical household with a ﬂat income proﬁle. We set income in the ﬂat proﬁle to

the simple mean of baseline labor earnings during the working years. The household

with a ﬂat proﬁle invests in equity throughout life, whereas the household with the

upward-sloping baseline proﬁle waits until age 54. Early investment, compounded by

the high return on equity, means that the household with a ﬂat proﬁle accumulates

large wealth and equity positions before the baseline household even begins to invest.

       Figure 10 shows the eﬀect of the income replacement rate during retirement on

equity holdings. In this ﬁgure, we vary the replacement rate while holding ﬁxed
   6
       The shape of the income proﬁle also aﬀects equity demand in the intermediate case with rB ∈
(rL , E(r̃E )), but the eﬀect is stronger when rB ≥ E(r̃E ).



                                                   15
the other income parameters. The more income a household expects to receive in

retirement, the less it saves and the less it invests in equity. The nature of retirement

income also aﬀect the optimal portfolio mix. When replacement rates are low, or

when pensions take the form of deﬁned contribution plans invested heavily in equities,

households are more likely to invest in the risk-free asset in addition to equity.


4.5        Non-participation in equity markets

When the leverage premium is zero or negative, a household invests in equity if and

only if its net liquid wealth position is positive. Since households can borrow in our

model, net liquid wealth is often negative or zero, and the household holds no equity.

This pattern of borrowing and non-participation in equity markets is fully consistent

with rational, time-consistent behavior by patient, mildly risk averse households.

       Table 4 shows participation rates for diﬀerent age groups using the pooled-sample

income process and baseline parameter settings. The table highlights several points.

First, a borrowing rate above the return on equity raises participation rates condi-

tional on age. This eﬀect on participation arises for the same reason that additional

increases in the cost of borrowing above E(r̃E ) lead to greater asset holdings.

       Second, when permanent income shocks are not too important, a speciﬁcation

with rB = 8% implies equity market participation rates that are very low for younger

households and that then rise gradually after age 40, as seen in the table. In contrast,

participation rates are very high throughout life when rB = 99%. Since households do

not borrow at a 99% rate under our parameter settings, this speciﬁcation is equivalent

to a model with a no-borrowing constraint. Thus, a model with realistic borrowing

costs delivers much more realistic participation behavior than a model with a no-

borrowing constraint.7
   7
       A model that allows for limited borrowing at the risk-free rate also implies very high equity
market participation. In addition, it has the unpalatable implication that old households borrow to



                                                  16
    Third, temporary and permanent income shocks have quite diﬀerent eﬀects on

equity market participation. In other words, the impact of income uncertainty on

participation behavior depends on the persistence of the income shocks. We take up

this issue in Section 5 below.

    Not shown in the table is the ambiguous eﬀect of risk aversion on equity market

participation. Participation rates are high for very low levels of risk aversion (RRA <

1) and for high levels (RRA > 4), but they are considerably lower for intermediate

levels (1 ≤ RRA ≤ 4). The explanation for the non-monotonic relationship between

participation and risk aversion parallels the explanation given above for the non-

monotonicity in the level of equity holdings.



5     Does our model ﬁt the facts?

Section 1 reviewed several facts about life-cycle consumption and portfolio behavior.

We now assess the ﬁt between those facts and predictions of the model. Where the

model fails to ﬁt the facts, we assess whether the failure is large or small in a welfare

sense.


5.1      Fact 1: Non-participation in equity markets

To get a better sense of what drives participation behavior in the model, Table 5

shows how average participation rates vary with several aspects of the speciﬁcation.

Two points are immediately clear from Tables 4 and 5. First, the model can generate

low participation rates when borrowing rates exceed the risk-free return. Second,

when ﬁt to the GP data on income shock variances, the predicted participation levels

exceed those observed in the data.

    In evaluating this failure of the model, it is worth emphasizing that we have not
ﬁnance equity holdings.



                                           17
modelled any liquidity advantage for the risk-free asset. Given the modest liquid

wealth positions of many households in our simulations, equity market participation

would be much lower if we incorporated some reason to hold small liquid wealth

positions in the risk-free asset. We make a related point below when we quantify the

welfare costs of non-participation from the vantage point of the model.

   Tables 4 and 5 also show that permanent and transitory income shocks aﬀect

participation quite diﬀerently. The introduction of permanent income shocks raises

participation in all scenarios shown, and speciﬁcations with only permanent shocks

exhibit full participation at all ages. In contrast, transitory income shocks push

outcomes away from zero and 100% participation. Hence, relative to a speciﬁcation

with no income risk, transitory income shocks tend to raise participation at younger

ages. But relative to a speciﬁcation with permanent income shocks, the introduction

of transitory income shocks lowers participation at younger ages.

   The explanation for these results involves the consumption-smoothing role of bor-

rowing. Borrowing is not helpful in smoothing permanent income shocks, but it

is useful for smoothing transitory shocks. In particular, a suﬃciently bad transitory

shock (or shock sequence) causes the household to draw down liquid wealth and resort

to borrowing, at which point it ceases to hold equity. The consumption smoothing

role of borrowing is highly sensitive to the borrowing rate – the higher the borrowing

rate, the more households act to reduce the likelihood of borrowing. This behavioral

response can be seen in Table 4 as a positive relationship between rB and participa-

tion, conditional on age, when only transitory income shocks are present. In short,

transitory shocks create a motive to hold equity when the household would otherwise

hold none, but they also give rise to circumstances in which some households exhaust

their asset holdings and turn to borrowing.

   Turning to cross-sectional evidence, empirical studies consistently ﬁnd that equity




                                         18
market participation rates rise with age.8 As seen in Table 4, this empirical regularity

is well matched by the predicted life-cycle pattern of participation in the model with

transitory income shocks. In this respect, our analysis provides a simple explanation

for a widely observed empirical regularity.

       Empirical studies also ﬁnd that participation rates rise with education. In con-

trast, our speciﬁcations predict lower participation rates for the top two education

groups, because they face steeper expected income proﬁles. It is unclear whether this

mismatch reﬂects a failure of the model or an inadequate calibration. For reasons of

data availability, our simulations confront all households with the same environment

except for the diﬀerences among education groups in the income processes. However,

small diﬀerences among education groups in borrowing costs, risk aversion and time

discounting, or small changes in the baseline values for the income shock variances,

can alter the predicted relationships between participation rates and education.


5.2        Fact 2: Average and life-cycle demand for equity

For realistic borrowing rates, our model predicts small equity holdings, roughly in

line with the data. The impact of borrowing costs on average equity demand can be

seen in Table 5. The column headed “DKW” shows predicted average equity holdings

when rB = E(r̃E ), while the column headed “Std” shows average equity holdings in

an otherwise identical model with rB = rL . Comparing these two columns shows that

the borrowing cost wedge dramatically reduces equity demand in every speciﬁcation.

       Focusing now on cases with rB = E(r̃E ), some speciﬁcations imply tiny values for

average equity demand, as illustrated by the row with RRA=4 and no labor income

risk. Speciﬁcations with risky labor income imply substantially larger equity holdings,
   8
       Isolating age eﬀects from time and cohort eﬀects requires an identifying assumption. However,
to the best of our knowledge, every study that considers the issue concludes that age has a positive
eﬀect on participation in equity markets.



                                                  19
in line with the discussion in Section 4.2. Table 6 shows that a realistic borrowing

rate leads to much lower equity holdings at all ages. Table 6 and Figures 6 and 7 show

that equity holdings rise sharply with age until late in the life cycle when rB = E(r̃E ).

   Some commentators have suggested that our results on equity demand, equity

market participation and the covariance between consumption and asset returns

would not survive the introduction of margin loans. However, a few observations

make clear why the introduction of margin loans would not greatly aﬀect our results.

First, initial margin requirements on equity are 50% or higher. Thus, for a household

with one thousand dollars in liquid wealth, a margin loan enables the household to

adopt an equity position of no more than two thousand dollars. Second, the data

show a large wedge between margin loan rates and risk-free returns. Kubler and

Willen (2002) report that as of July 8, 2002, the rates on margin loans of less than

$50,000 at ﬁve major brokerage houses (The Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments,

Charles Schwab, Salomon Smith Barney and UBS Paine Webber) exceed the rate on

90-day U.S. Treasury Bills by 357 to 570 basis points, depending on brokerage house

and loan size. Even at these rates, brokerage houses require credit checks and reserve

the right to deny margin credit or impose higher margin rates. Finally, the combi-

nation of unsecured borrowing and margin loans does not oﬀer an attractive leverage

premium. For example, at an 8% expected return on equity, a risk-free rate of 1.68%

and a 4.63% margin loan premium, the expected return on a margin-levered equity

portfolio is (1/.5)8 − (1.68 + 4.63) = 9.69%. Combined with a wedge of 7.5 percentage

points on unsecured borrowing, roughly the midpoint of the Table 1 values, the fully

levered portfolio oﬀers a leverage premium of 9.69 − (1.68 + 7.5) = .51%. That is,

the fully levered portfolio oﬀers an expected return premium of 51 basis points with

a standard deviation of 2 × 15= 30%.




                                           20
5.3    Fact 3: Covariance of consumption and equity returns

How does our model ﬁt the facts about the covariance of consumption growth and

equity returns? Much better, in three respects, than models with equal borrowing

and lending rates. First, our model’s implied covariance between minus marginal

utility growth and equity returns lies well below the excess return on equity. Second,

if one applies standard formulas to calculate risk aversion using data generated by

our model, one overestimates risk aversion, often by a factor of ten or more. This im-

plication rationalizes the implausibly large estimates of risk aversion in consumption-

based asset-pricing studies. Third, our model rationalizes the rejection of standard

consumption-based asset-pricing relationships in samples that are restricted to house-

holds with positive equity holdings. We now develop these three points in turn.

   First, consider the covariance between minus marginal utility growth and equity

returns. According to standard models with equal borrowing and lending rates,
                                                     
                                               ∆MU
                  E (r̃E ) − rL = cov r̃E , −           ≡ covM U              (1)
                                                 
                                              E(∆M U)

That is, the excess return on equity equals minus the covariance between equity

returns and the growth rate of marginal utility. Equation (1) is central to most

consumption-based asset pricing studies. It fares poorly in confrontations with the

data for standard preference speciﬁcations.

   As shown in Tables 5 and 6, equation (1) fails to hold in versions of our model

with realistic borrowing costs. Table 6 shows that covM U is (near) zero for young

households and reaches a maximum of 2.3 prior to retirement in the version of the

model with risky labor income. In contrast, the standard model implies that covM U

equals 6.0 at all ages.

   We can interpret covM U as the equity premium implied by consumption behav-

ior. In particular, suppose we observe a consumption process and know the utility

function. In addition, suppose we assume that households face equal borrowing and

                                          21
lending rates. Then from equation (1), we would infer an equity premium of 0.2% in

our baseline speciﬁcation with no labor income risk and 1.1% with risky labor income

(ﬁrst and third rows of Table 5). In other words, we would mistakenly attribute the

low covariance of consumption growth and asset returns to a low equity premium,

not diﬀerential borrowing and lending rates.

   We can also follow Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) and interpret the same infor-

mation in another way. Equation (1) implies that the standard deviation of marginal

utility growth is bounded below by the Sharpe ratio. We can use our model to calcu-

late the actual standard deviation of marginal utility growth, reported in Table 5 in

the “HJ” column. Note that only when the borrowing cost wedge is zero or very small

does the HJ statistic equal or exceed the Sharpe ratio (38%). For realistic borrowing

costs, the model implies that the standard deviation of marginal utility growth is

much smaller than the Sharpe ratio.

   Second, consider the estimation of risk aversion from consumption-based asset-

pricing relationships. Recall from Hansen and Singleton (1983) that, if asset returns

and consumption are jointly log-normal and individual utility is of the time-separable

isoelastic form, then equation (1) implies
                                 E(r˜E ) − rL + .5 var(r̃E )
                            γ=                                                     (2)
                                     cov(r̃E , ∆ log c̃)
where γ is the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion. The columns headed “Implied

RRA” in Tables 5 and 6 calculate risk aversion using equation (2).

   Inspecting these tables reveals that equation (2) greatly overestimates risk aver-

sion when borrowing rates exceed lending rates. In the baseline speciﬁcation with

permanent and transitory income shocks (Row 3), the Implied RRA is 13.0, more

than six times the true value. In the baseline speciﬁcation with certain labor income

(Row 1), the Implied RRAA is 60.9, more than thirty times its true value.

   Third, consider the consequences of restricting samples to households with positive

equity holdings. Starting with Mankiw and Zeldes (1991), researchers have argued

                                             22
that equations (1) and (2) are unreasonable descriptions of reality for households that

do not participate in equity markets. But, as the argument goes, perhaps equations

(1) and (2) approximate reality for households that invest non-zero amounts in equity.

This type of argument leads to equity ownership as a sample selection criterion in

studies of consumption-based asset pricing relationships.

   To evaluate this approach in terms of our model, the bottom row of Table 6

reports statistics for “samples” restricted to equity market participants. This selection

criterion leads to a better ﬁt between theory and data, but the theory continues to

perform poorly if we maintain that the data are generated by a world with rB =

rL . For example, restricting the sample to equity market participants lowers the

Implied RRA from 55.8 to 15.7 in the speciﬁcation with no income risk, as compared

to a true RRA value of 2.0. If one instead recognizes that the borrowing rate is

several percentage points above the risk-free return, then the theory explains why

consumers appear so risk averse in consumption-based asset pricing studies, why the

implicit equity premium appears so small, and why the Hansen-Jagannathan bound

is violated.


5.4    Facts we don’t match

Our model fails to match the facts on at least two dimensions. First, as we discussed

above, versions of the model with large permanent income shocks predict higher

equity market participation rates than seen in the data. Second, the model predicts

that many households hold equity but not the risk-free asset. Moreover, unless risk

aversion is high, the model predicts small portfolio shares in the risk-free asset for

households that invest in both assets.

   We now investigate the welfare signiﬁcance of these model failures. Our main

message is simple: When borrowing rates are in the neighborhood of the return on

equity, the welfare costs of delayed participation in equity markets or the wrong


                                           23
bond-equity mix are small. Even the right to hold equity can have modest welfare

consequences in a life-cycle model with a zero or negative leverage premium. The

situation is very diﬀerent in the standard model. When the borrowing rate equals

the risk-free investment return, delayed equity market participation and the wrong

bond-equity mix imply large welfare costs. These observations are not intended to

downplay the shortcomings of our model. Rather, they suggest that there is ample

scope for other factors – participation and transaction costs, alternative preferences, a

desire for liquidity, information costs and so on – to strongly inﬂuence equity holdings,

once we recognize that borrowing costs exceed the risk-free return.

   To carry out the welfare comparisons, it is useful to focus on certainty-equivalent

consumption levels, which we report in Table 7. To obtain certainty-equivalent con-

sumption, we ﬁrst calculate lifetime expected utility, U , for a given consumption

proﬁle. We then ﬁnd the constant level of consumption, c, that yields the same level

of lifetime expected utility. That is, we solve
                     
                     T
                                c1−γ              1 − γ γ−1
                           βt        =U   for c = T        U ,
                     t=0
                                1−γ                 t=0 β t

where β is the time discount factor, and γ is relative risk aversion.

   For example, consider a household with less than high school education, no income

risk and an 8% borrowing rate. According to Table 7, that household is indiﬀerent

between the optimal lifetime consumption plan and a ﬂat proﬁle with consumption

of $17,850 per year. If the same household is not allowed to trade equity, certainty-

equivalent consumption falls to $17,800. In other words, the right to trade equity is

worth about $50 per year, or less than .3 percent of annual consumption. Table 7

considers three departures from optimal behavior: non-participation in equity markets

throughout life, non-participation until age 50 with optimal behavior thereafter, and

optimal participation subject to a 50-50 bond-equity portfolio mix.

   Perhaps the most notable feature of Table 7 is the small cost of delayed equity

market participation, given realistic borrowing costs. In the speciﬁcation with no

                                           24
income risk and an 8% borrowing rate, the cost of waiting until age 50 to invest in

equity is essentially zero. The costs of delayed participation are larger for speciﬁca-

tions with risky income, but less than $400 per year for every group. Costs on this

order are not trivial, but they seem well within range of reasonable values for the

costs of participating and transacting in equity markets.

    The standard life-cycle model with rB = rL tells a starkly diﬀerent story. For

example, the costs of delayed participation until age 50 when rB = rL range from 14

to 23 thousand dollars per year, which amounts to more than ﬁfty percent of annual

consumption. In other words, the standard model implies enormous welfare costs for

widely observed departures from theoretically predicted behavior. These costs are

far too large to be rationalized by plausible costs of participating and transacting in

equity markets.



6     Concluding Remarks

Realistic borrowing costs dramatically shrink the demand for equity in the canonical

life-cycle model of consumption and portfolio choice. The model’s theoretical impli-

cations about the average level and life-cycle pattern of equity holdings are roughly in

line with the data, given realistic borrowing costs. In addition, a realistic borrowing

rate greatly improves the performance of the theory along several dimensions that

feature prominently in consumption-based asset pricing studies.

    The implications of our model diﬀer in noteworthy respects from those of models

that abstract from life-cycle considerations and from models with hard borrowing

limits. For example, equity demand and equity market participation rates are non-

monotonic in borrowing costs and risk aversion in our model. The opportunity to

borrow at realistic rates in a life-cycle setting also has important consequences for

life-cycle wealth accumulation, which in turn drives the demand for equity. Because



                                          25
households face an upward sloping income proﬁle, they borrow in the early part of

the life cycle, which causes a substantial delay in the age at which they ﬁrst invest in

equity or ﬁrst accumulate substantial equity holdings.

   Our analysis points to several directions for future research. We mention three

here. First, our model implies that households accumulate little or no liquid wealth

until middle age, which is consistent with much empirical evidence (e.g., Lusardi,

Cossa and Krupka, 2001). Given its simplicity and its assumption of patient, time-

consistent, rational consumers, our model and analysis challenge claims that house-

holds save too little. A natural next step, which we are currently pursuing, is to

enrich the model to account for housing consumption and wealth and for the liq-

uidity beneﬁts of safe assets. We plan to evaluate this richer version of the model

against a number of facts about consumption, home ownership, wealth accumulation

and portfolio choice over the life cycle.

   Second, our analysis puts the spotlight on the role of borrowing costs and leverage

as key factors in the demand for risky assets. This paper does not consider other

ways to leverage equity investments such as margin loans or investments in levered

mutual funds. Margin loans provide limited scope for levered equity holdings, but

corporate bonds, government securities, real estate and small business wealth are

often subject to less stringent restrictions on leverage. Kubler and Willen (2002)

consider an extended version of our model to address portfolio choice in a broader

setting that encompasses a fuller menu of risky assets and leveraging methods.

   Third, our model has strong testable implications for the life-cycle behavior of eq-

uity holdings and for the covariance between consumption growth and equity returns.

In particular, as a household ages, the model predicts rising equity holdings and an

increasing covariance between consumption growth and equity returns. These impli-

cations can be tested using now-standard econometric methods applied to (synthetic)

panel data on consumption and portfolio holdings.

Appendix: Computational details
We solve the model by backward induction. At age 80, the solution is trivial: consume
everything. We then solve for optimal consumption and portfolio choice at age 79
conditional on liquid wealth, income, the state of the world and the (degenerate)
policy rule at age 80. Next, we solve for consumption and portfolio choice at age 78 –
again conditional on liquid wealth, income, the state of the world and the calculated
optimal policy rule at age 79. And so on.
     The problem therefore reduces to solving simple two-period optimization problems
and to approximating policy rules as functions of some minimal set of state variables
(including current age). This appendix focuses on two aspects of the solution pro-
cedure: how to reduce the endogenous state space to one variable, and how to solve
the two-period problem eﬀectively. First, we use preference homotheticity to simplify
the problem and reduce the number of continuous state variables to one. Second, we
discuss how we solve the two-period optimization problem.
     A little notation will help. Let zt be a Markov chain with ﬁnite support z ∈
{1, ..., S} and transition π. Gross equity returns are R̃E (zt ), and the gross borrowing
and lending rates are RB and RL , respectively. A date-event z t is a history of shocks
(z1 , ..., zt ). Let y(z t ) denote income at time t.
     Preference homotheticity allows us to simplify the problem by combining wealth
and income into one variable (Deaton, 1991). Suppose we have solved for optimal
policy rules from time t + 1 on. Suppose at date t, we are in state z with income
yt and wealth Ξt . The optimal policy rule for next period speciﬁes investment of
  i
Ft+1   (Ξt+1 (z  ), yt+1 (z  ); z  ) in asset i = B, L, E at time t+1. Bellman’s principle implies
that the solution to the two-period problem below constitutes optimal portfolio choice
at t in state z with income y and liquid wealth Ξ.

              xt+1 =                ξ(z ) − f L (ξ(z  ); z  ) + f B (ξ(z  ); z  ) − f E (ξ(z  ); z  ) ;

                  f L ≥ 0, f B ≥ 0, f E ≥ 0.

Observe that the policy rules are now functions of a single endogenous state variable,
ξ, the ratio of liquid wealth plus current income to current income. This reduction
in the dimensionality of the state space greatly simpliﬁes computation.
    We can recover the solution to the original problem (3) by multiplying the solution
to the transformed problem (4) by current income:

                                 c t = yt xt
                               F L = yt f L , F B = yt f B , F E = yt f E

    To solve the transformed two-period problem, we solve the associated Kuhn-
Tucker conditions – a nonlinear system of equations and inequalities that is necessary
and suﬃcient for optimality. Following Garcia and Zangwill (1981, pages 65-68),
we use a change of variables to eliminate inequalities in the Kuhn-Tucker conditions
and state the optimality conditions as a system consisting solely of equations. The
resulting system has 3 unknowns corresponding to the three asset holdings.
    In particular, let ηj ∈  for j = 1, 2, 3, and deﬁne the Kuhn-Tucker multiplier for
asset j, µj = (max{0, −ηj })3 . The consumer’s holding of asset j is θj = (max{0, ηj })3 .
Note that θ and µ are twice continuously diﬀerentiable, and that the complementary
slackness conditions hold:

 (max{0, ηj })3 ≥ 0,         (max{0, −ηj })3 ≥ 0,             and (max{0, ηj })3 · (max{0, ηj })3 = 0.

    We implement our solution algorithm using Fortran 90. A simple Newton method
usually works well as a nonlinear equation solver when a good starting point is known.
In some cases we need to use homotopy methods (as implemented in HOMPACK, see
Watson et al (1987)) to solve the system.
    Lastly, we draw attention to two practical aspects of our computational solution.
First, the range of ftj (ξ; z) will generally depend on t and z. In practice, we set
arbitrary bounds on the range that vary only with t. We then verify that these

                                                        31
bounds never bind in the simulations. Second, in generating ftj (ξ; z), we don’t solve
(4) for every possible value of ξ. Instead, we solve (4) for a ﬁnite number of values of ξ
and use cubic spline interpolation to ﬁll in the rest. See Judd et al. (2002) for details
on spline interpolation. Since the true policy functions have non-diﬀerentiabilities,
we use 50 knots for each spline interpolation to obtain suﬃcient accuracy.
    Maximal relative errors in Euler equations lie below 10−6 . Running times on a
Pentium III computer with a 1.2 Ghz processor and 1 GB of RAM clustered around
four or ﬁve minutes but range from 2 minutes for models with no labor income risk
and borrowing rates above the expected return on equity to about 15 minutes for
models with labor income risk and borrowing rates below the return on equity.
