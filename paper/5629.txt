                                                ABSTRACT



        This paper describes the real wealth accumulation         of American youth and relates this

behavior to variations in real constant-quality     house prices in their localities of residence.   We

argue that increases in the real constant-quality   house price have two offsetting effects on wealth.

First, the greater the local constant-quality   price of housing, the greater the wealth needed to meet

the lender imposed down payment constraint if housing demand is price inelastic.              However,

increased real constant-quality    house price reduces the likelihood of home ownership and thus

the desire the accumulate wealth needed for a down payment.

        Using a panel data set for youth age 20-33 for the years 1985 through 1990 we find that

the combined     direct and indirect impact of variations in real constant-quality      house price on

wealth is modest for changes near the average real house price, but youths’ wealth declines

substantially   in areas with high real house price.

I. Introduction

        Many have argued that wealth is an important determinant of home ownership,

largely owing to the down payment requirement of the secondary market and FHA (Jones

1989; Linneman and Wachter 1989; Zorn 1989). The less is wealth, the more binding is

the constraint and the lower is home ownership. 1 However, wealth of nonowning

individuals is largely an endogenous variable, depending on their decisions about forming

households, working hours, and saving earned income (Haunn, Hendershott,           and Kim,

1994).2 Treating wealth as a determinant of home ownership puts the cart before the

horse; more likely, it is the desire to become home owners that leads young individuals to

accumulate wealth rather than wealth growth causing ownership.         In fact, we are able to

document a relation between wealth accumulation and the predicted home ownership rate,

both concurrent and five years in the fiture.

        We are especially interested in the role real house prices play in the link between

wealth accumulation and the likelihood of home ownership.        Because the price elasticity of

housing quantity demand is less than unity in absolute value,3 the required down payment

will be larger in areas with high real constant-quality   house prices, and thus a household

desiring to become an owner must accumulate more wealth in such areas.4 However, the

higher is the real house price (relative to rents), the higher is the cost of owning relative to

renting and thus the less attractive is home ownership,     Moreover, the down payment

constraint is more difficult to meet in these high cost areas, causing some young

households choose to forego home ownership.         The lower desired ownership in high price

areas will reduce saving (Yoshikawa and Ohtake 1989; Engelhardt 1994; Sheiner 1995).

The effect of higher real house prices on wealth accumulation is the net of less saving

owing to fewer intended owners but greater saving by those with positive intentions,

        The next section of the paper reviews studies that test the relationship between

house prices and wealth. Then, we describe the primary data set, the National

Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), and the secondary data set drawn from the repeat


                                                2
sales Freddie Mac~annie     Mae constant-quality house price index. The descriptive

analysis in Haurin, Hendershott,     and Wachter (1995) is reviewed and selected

relationships between wealth and house price are presented in section IV. In section V,

the econometric model is described and estimation results are listed. Section VI highlights

the interesting findings.



II. Review of Studies on Wealth and the Tendency to Own a Home

        The paper by Yoshikawa and Ohtake (Y-O, 1989) explains female labor supply

and household savings. They argue that utility maximizing renter households choose

whether to pursue either a strategy of fiture renting or one where they will become home

owners. Those who select the renter path will not be influenced by the constant-quality

price of home ownership.    They hypothesize that those planning to become owners will

save more the higher is the price (especially in Japan where the down payment averages

40% of house value).s However, an increase in the relative price of owning, resulting

from higher real constant-quality    house prices, decreases the tendency to own.G Thus,

higher house prices cause some potential owners to become permanent renters, lowering

their savings, while those households remaining on the path to ownership increase their

savings. The combined effect is ambiguous.

        Their data include a variable indicating whether a household has a housing

purchase plan (dichotomous),       They first estimate a probit equation and find that a higher

price of land reduces the number of households having a purchase plan. In separate

selectivity bias corrected estimations of household savings rates on land prices, they find

that those households who plan to own have a higher rate of savings if land prices rise, but

those who plan to rent are unaffected.     Among those with a purchase plan, the impact

upon the savings rate of increased land prices is about zero when both the conditional

impact and the tendency to switch desired tenure are accounted for. Among all renters,

they find that increased land prices reduce the savings rate of households age 25-55.


                                                 3
         Questions about the study include the nature of the sample and the choice of

explanatory variables used. Because the sample is limited to renters, households that

successfully accumulate sufficient wealth to become owners are systematically excluded

from the analysis. This elimination of “successful savers” may bias the estimation results,

Turning to specific variables, the use of land price rather than constant-quality      house price

is a limitation.   Also, they include current wealth in the ownership and savings rate

estimations, failing to account for its endogeneity, and their estimation of the tendency to

own (participation in a savings plan for ownership) excludes key variables such as the

price of owning relative to renting.

        Engelhardt (1994), using a Canadian data set, analyzes the relationship between

saving for a down payment and constant-quality       real house prices. The approach is similar

to Yoshikawa and Ohtake: Canadian renters chose whether to participate in the Registered

Home Ownership Savings Plan that provided a tax benefit to savings used for the purchase

of a home. Some tax benefit accrues to participants even if they never intended to own

due to the deferral of taxes, but other IRA-like programs were available as substitutes.

        In the probit participation equation, Engelhardt finds that the higher is real house

price, the lower is participation in the plan, but the effect is weak.7 Engelhardt then

estimates selectivity bias corrected savings equations for participants and nonparticipants

and finds no response to high house prices by nonparticipants         (similar to Y-O). In

contrast to Y-O, Engelhardt finds that savings fall as constant-quality      house prices rise for

participants, although the effect is only marginally significant. The combined effect is one

of strong discouragement;    high house prices reduce both the tendency to own a home and

the rate of savings for those who plan to own. A weakness of this study includes its

measure of house prices; only six Canadian regions adjusted for two categories of city size

are included, and apparently house prices are not deflated by regional price indexes.

Further, the data are cross-sectional   and are limited to renters,
        A third study by Sheiner (1995) finds that increased house prices lead to increased

renter wealth.   She used a 1984 cross section of the PSID in 26 U.S. metropolitan areas.

For 25 to 34-year-old households, a $10,000 increase in real house price yielded an

increase in net worth of $400,

        All these studies have limited their obsewations to renters. This limitation is a

concern because of the possibility of adverse selection of households who have not

successfully saved for ownership,   We report results for panel data that includes renters

and home owners.     The inclusion of owners requires us to adjust for their real wealth

accumulation via real capital gains on housing and declines in the real value of their

mortgage.8

        These studies also employed cross-sectional data, which is a concern because prior

research on wealth accumulation has shown that cross-sectional estimation can lead to

biased results (Jianakoplos, Menchik, and Irvine 1989). Panel data allow us to use a richer

model of the stochastic error structure, helping to compensate for omitted variables and to

obtain unbiased estimates.

       Finally, we focus on wealth rather than annual saving, Saving is smaller and

subject to greater variation than is wealth; thus, identi&lng significant explanatory factors

is more difficult. Also, down payments are in levels, not rates of change in wealth. Thus,

households have a targeted amount of desired wealth based on desired house value.



IIt. Model of Wealth Accumulation        and the Tendency to Own a Home

       Two opposing economic forces affect the desire of middle and high permanent

income renters to become owners. A positive force is the well-known U. S. tax advantage

of home ownership for higher permanent income (tax bracket) households @user and

Sanders 1983; Litzenberger and Sosin 1978), which provides an incentive to save and

accumulate the required down payment.g An opposing force is the intertemporal

distortion in consumption of young households caused by saving to accumulate the down


                                              5
payment (Artle and Varaiya 1978). The greater is the cost of this distortion compared

with the present value gain in tax benefits, the less likely a household will plan to be a

home owner any time soon.        The probability of ownership is a measure of the net impact

of these forces, We hypothesize that the greater is this probability, the greater are savings,

ceteris paribus.

        Variations in constant-quality       real house prices can affect the time to first home

ownership. 10 The higher are house prices relative to rents, the lower is desired home

ownership. Also, higher real house prices will increase the down payment on the desired

house (because the demand for housing is price inelastic) and thus the intertemporal

distortion caused by saving for the down payment.

        We first estimate the probability of home ownership as a reduced form equation

including as explanatory variables exogenous socio-demographic           and economic factors

including the real price of housing, which should have a negative impact. This approach

avoids the endogeneity problems inherent in the user cost approach to estimating the

ownership equation. 11

        Next, we estimate a wealth accumulation equation including as explanatory

variables the predicted probability of owning, real constant-quality       house price, and a

vector of socio-demographic      controls.    The expected coefficient of the probability of

ownership is positive. Because the needed down payment varies with the expenditure on

the house and this expenditure will rise or fall depending on whether the housing demand

is inelastic or elastic, the sign of the coefficient of real constant-quality   house price in the

wealth equation could be positive or negative, However, because existing econometric

evidence points to an inelastic demand, we expect a positive coefficient.



IV. Date Sources and Measurements

        The scope of this study requires a comprehensive data set containing variables

descriptive of the economic/social/demographic         characteristics of young households and


                                                   6
indicators of local shelter costs. Our basic data set is the National Longitudinal Survey of

Youth (NLSY), housed at the Center for Human Resource Research, Ohio State

University.   Beginning in 1979, a national survey of youth age 14-21 was administered to

about 10,000 civilian respondents.   The retention rate has been about 90°/0 in subsequent

years, Data are collected by personal survey except in 1987, which was collected by

telephone (NLS Handbook 1993),

        The NLSY sample is composed of a general sample and supplemental samples of

blacks and poor whites, These supplements permit more reliable testing of hypotheses

related to race/ethnicity and low income. Sample weights are provided each year,

allowing statements to be made about the national population of youth. The NLS

Handbook discusses details of the sampling methodology and survey design. Although the

survey began in 1979, wealth data are reported only in broad categories before 1985, and

no housing data were collected in 1991. Thus, our analysis of wealth accumulation is

limited to the period 1985-1990.

        Supplemental data on constant-quality   house prices are obtained for388 counties

in 101 metropolitan areas from the Freddie-Mac/Fannie-Mae      repeat sales house price

index. We match sumey respondents’ counties of residence to these data. 12 Because these

data are indexes, we need a single cross section of house price levels to obtain level data.

We use the 1987 American Chamber of Commerce data (ACCRA 1987).

       Nominal variables vary both over time and across space. We control for both by

deflating using the panel data set of state deflators reportedinMcMahon(199      1) covering

1985-1990.13 Other variables used in this study are derived from responses to survey

questions in the NLSY (NLS Handbook 1993),

       The wealth variable is the sum of net worth in five categories: housing, vehicles,

other consumer durables, farm/business, and financial instruments.   Within the housing

category, an owner’s estimate of both current house value and current mortgage debt are
reported.   In H-H-W (1995), we compared NLSY wealth data with those in the Survey of

Consumer Finances and found good comparability in the two national samples.’4



V. Descriptive Results

        Table 1 presents the age-wealth relationship derived by H-H-W (1995). Reading

across a row shows the increase in real wealth gained by households categorized by the

1985 age of the respondent,    We find that real wealth increases rapidly; it takes about four

years to triple at ages 20-23 and double at ages 24-28. The mean amual increase is 22Y0,

ranging from 8. 1°/0in 1985-86 to 33.3°/0 in 1986-87. This increase in household real

wealth results from saving, capital gains, and marriage. 15

        Reading Table 1 southwest to northeast tracks the change in wealth of a particular

age respondent across different years. The transcribed data (Table 2) reveal a modest

decline in age-constant real wealth in 1986, largely due to a decline in real farm prices.

For ages 22-28, real wealth is greater for respondents of a particular age comparing the

latest year data available to 1985 (the exception is age 27), This result suggests that the

real wealth-age profile of young households was rising over the 1985-90 period.

        H-H-W find that wealth is related to many demographic variables including the

respondent’s gender, race/ethnicity, and marital status. The mean wealth of single female

respondents is only 65°/0 of male respondents,   Single whites average about three and a

half times more wealth than blacks, Marned whites’ wealth is nearly three times that of

married blacks.

       H-H-W also find that real wealth levels are related to two measures of human

capital, highest grade completed and score on an analytical aptitude test, The results show

that wealth rises with education except that the wealth of more highly educated but young

respondents is low compared with less educated youth when the highly educated youth are

still in school fill time. The aptitude test measures age-adjusted abilities in mathematics
and reading. The difference in wealth comparing highest to lowest quartile is dramatic

(about 450%).

 Home Ownership and Real Wealth

          Home ownership and real wealth are highly correlated.    Table 3 (from H-H-W)

presents the real wealth profile of eight groups of households including those who rented

continuously during 1985-90, first time owners in each year 1986 to 1990 (five groups),

those who owned prior to or became owners in 1985, and others (e.g., those few who

switched from owning to renting).     Two results are notable,

          First, significant wealth accumulation occurs during the year of purchase of the

house, Household wealth more than doubles for people becoming owners in all years

except 1986 (50°/0 increase).   One explanation for this is the correlation of first ownership

with the year of marriage during which the wealth of two individuals is combined (9°/0 of

the sample married in the year they became a home owner). Wealth also increases by 33

percent on average in the year before first ownership, when 7% of the sample married).

Another explanation for the jump in wealth during the year of purchasing a home is gifis

or inheritances.   H-H-W find that the percentage of households receiving these in the year

of first home ownership is significantly greater than that received by renters or existing

owners.    The mean size gifi is $5,224, and of those households that received a gift and

purchased a house in the years 1988-90, the average value of the gift equaled 16% of the

purchase price of their house. More than 60% of gifts received during the year of

purchase were at least 5V0of the values of the houses, and more owners continue to

receive gifis/inheritances than do renters, suggesting a pattern of continuing parental

support for a few years after first home ownership.

          The second, and possibly most notable, result is that the wealth of nonowners is a

good predictor of the timing of their fiture shift to home ownership.    For example,

households that became owners in 1990 had lower wealth in 1985 than did households

that became owners in 1989. This relationship holds for fl other combinations of years,


                                               9
Wealth increases across rows, comparing Owner-1990 with Owner- 1989, . . . . to Owner-

1985). Moreover, households that became owners in 1990 had greater wealth than did

those renting in 1990 for at least the five prior years.

            These results suggest that both marital status and the probability of becoming a

home owner are important determinants of wealth. The relationship of wealth to fiture

home ownership suggests that the probability of ownership is important to real wealth

accumulation even at low probabilities and becomes quite strong at high probabilities.

Real Wealth and Constant-Quality                          Real House Prices

        The relationship between the real wealth of renters, partitioned by aptitude scores

(and thus presumably permanent income), and real constant-quality                          house price is

displayed in Table 4 (from H-H-W).                           For households with midlevel and high analytical

aptitude scores, the data show a positive relation between wealth and constant-quality

house price exists through the 75th percentile, afier which the relationship turns negative.

For households with low test scores and thus presumably low permanent income and little

incentive to own, there is no relation between wealth and constant-quality                       real house

price. 16



VI. Econometric Model and Results

        The procedure consists of two steps: estimation of the probability of owning

(current and five years forward), followed by the estimation of the wealth equation.                          Both

estimations use the 1985-90 panel data and appropriate panel data estimation techniques.

Probability of Current Ownership

        We assume that the tendency to own (yit) is linearly related to a vector of

exogenous socio-economic                    and demographic variables and a stochastic error consisting of

a household specific component (ui) and a time varying component (v~):

                  Yit   =   xit~   +   Ui   +   Vit   =   xit~   +   Cit.




                                                                        10
Further, ownership (dichotomous)     occurs if yi, exceeds a critical value (here, normalized

to o):

                 Oil = 1 if yt ~0, and= O otherwise.

The “random effects” error structure assumes var(ui + vit) = G.* + av2, and p = COrr(Eiq

ei~+l).17 The results of this estimation are used to predict a household’s current tendency

to own in each year of the panel,

         Results of the reduced-form estimation of the probability of home ownership in the

current year are presented in Table 5. Explanatory variables include indicators of whether

the respondent is Male, Black, and Married.     If married, the spouse’s age and highest

grade completed (HGC) are also relevant. Other variables are measures of the

respondent’s age, highest grade completed, and analytical aptitude, the locality’s constant-

quality real house price and amount of gifis received. Quadratic terms for aptitude, house

price, and respondent and spouse’s age and HGC are included, Interaction terms with

house price and Black are included to allow variations in house price to affect households

differently.

         The Chi-squared of this panel data probit estimation is quite significant as are most

of the explanato~   variables. The correlation coefficient (p from above) is 0.88, indicating

that estimation errors for a household persist over time; that is, the standard estimation

approach would consistently over or under-predict the estimation residuals of a household

from 1985-90.    Of the 6324 observations (1 054 households for six periods), the estimation

correctly predicts 4288 of 4721 (90. 8°/0) cases of renting and 845 of 1603 (52.7°/0) cases

of owning. The sample mean predicted probability of owning is 0.20, rising from roughly

0.12 in 1985 to 0.33 in 1990.

         Because of the complexity of the equation, simulation results are needed to clarifi

variables’ impacts. For a white married male respondent, the probability of ownership is

0.46 at mean house price ($87,170) and at means of the other explanatory variables, 1s

The effect of variations in Hprice on the current estimated probability of owning is


                                              11
nonlinear.     If Hpnce is one standard deviation below its mean (s.d. = $21,974), ownership

probability remains about the same. At one standard deviation above the mean constant-

quality house price, the probability falls to 0.40 (a 11 percent drop), and at two standard

deviations above the mean, the ownership probability falls to 0.31 (another 22 percent

drop),lg

           The probability of ownership is much lower for black respondents even if

evaluated at the same sample means of the explanatory variables. At mean Hprice, the

ownership probability is 0.18. At one standard deviation below the mean, the probability

of ownership rises slightly to 0.19, while at one and two standard deviations above the

mean, the ownership probability for black households falls to 0.15 and 0.10.

           Marriage has an enormous impact as we expected.      Marriage to a high school

graduate age 26 increases the probability of ownership for a white youth from 0,13 to

0.46. Age also has a large impact on the probability of ownership,      For a youth and

spouse, an increase in age from 26 to 32 raises the probability of ownership from 0.46 to

0.83.

Probability that Current Renters Wil[ Own in Five Years

           A similar method is used to estimate the probability that 1985 renters will be

owners in 1990. The sample consists of all respondents because exclusion of current

owners would result in selection bias.20 The dependent variable is the actual 1990

ownership status. Explanatory variables include 1985 socio-demographic         variables (with

age updated five years) except gifis/inheritances and marital status, both being forecasts of

the 1990 outcome.2] We also control for current ownership status by including the 1985

probability of ownership in the equation,     With a sample size of 1064, 89% of instances of

future renting are correctly predicted and 47% of fiture ownership (results are presented

in Appendix 2). We use the estimation results to predict fiture ownership for the 1985-90

panel; that is, ownership rates in 1990-95.




                                                12
Real Wealth

         The second step estimates the structural real wealth equation.      In general, wealth

accumulation is presumed to depend on liquidity, retirement, and bequest motives. For

many young households, purchasing a home is the start of their retirement plan.

         In this study, we highlight the impacts of variation in the probability of owning and

in real local house prices on real wealth (WL). The econometric model again uses the

random effects approach:

                   w, = Zit~ + Pi + Vit

where E(~i) = E(vit) = O, and pw = co~(~i + vit, pi + vit+l). We also allow the vit error

term to be autocorrelated;     thus, v il+l= Piv it + ~it.22 Explanatory variables include

demographic indicators: Male, Black, Squared Age, Married, Spouse Age, and a variable

SumMarry measuring the total number of years married during the sample period .23

Educational attainment measures include four variables: HGC, Spouse HGC, Aptitude,

and Squared Aptitude.      We also include a Squared Age-HGC interaction because of the

likely delayed increase in wealth for respondents achieving post baccalaureate education.

Each of these variables indicates the status of the respondent in year t corresponding to

wealth in that year.

        One of the focal variables is the probability of home ownership predicted in the

first step of the procedure.   We expect that the greater this probability, the greater the

need for early wealth accumulation for a down payment, default insurance fees and closing

costs.24 To allow for a nonlinear response of real wealth to variations in Probown, we

include its square. Preliminary testing revealed that only the squared term was significant,

We also include the probability of ownership five years in the fiture (Probown5) to

capture the impact of fiture ownership tendencies on current wealth accumulation,

        The other highlighted variable is local real house price, Hprice. Variations in

constant-quality   real house price affect wealth indirectly through the squared Probown and

Probown5 variables (reduce the probability when Hprice rises) and directly by changing


                                                13
the quantity of housing demanded and the needed down payment,         The quantity of housing

demanded by a household depends negatively on the real constant-quality      house price in

the locality, but the down payment depends on the expenditure on the house; that is, the

product of Hpnce and housing quantity.     Thus, variations in expenditure with Hprice

depend on the price elasticity of demand of owned housing; if less than unity, we expect

increased Hpnce to raise expenditures on housing and thus the needed down payment,

We test for separate impact of Hprice on black and other youth because the price elasticity

of demand may differ among groups.

        Another economic variable is the cumulative amount of gifts received by the

household.   This variable was hypothesized to be important to the growth of wealth during

the preownership period by Mayer and Englehardt (1994) and was found to be an

important component of the down payment by Haurin, Hendershott,         and Wachter (1995).

        Because our sample contains both renters (4380 obsewations)      and owners (282

first time owners and 1662 post first year owners), we must account for any exogenous

gains in real wealth accruing to owners. Because we have owner estimates of the house

value, we can measure housing capital gains. Yearly gains are deflated and cumulated to

year t from 1985 or the year of first ownership yielding Capgain. We expect a coefficient

somewhat less than unity because households have time (three years on average) to

increase consumption in response to real housing capital gains, as predicted by

intertemporal utility optimization.

        We also created a variable that measures the difference between cumulated

nominal housing capital housing gains and the real gain (Diffgain). If the down payment

constraint were binding, then it is likely that a nominal capital gain would lead youth to

reduce equity in the house and move consumption closer to the optimal path. This

“consumption rebound” is predicted by the models of Artle and Varaiya (1 978) and

Engelhardt (1994), We expect a coefficient between zero and minus unity.




                                              14
        Lastly, we include the cumulative change in the real book value of a household’s

mortgage.    Over time, home owners pay down their mortgage and its real value declines

due to inflation, We control for this change in real wealth by home owners, which we

view as forced saving, expecting a coefficient between O and -1.0.25

        Estimation results are reported in the first panel of Table 6. The adjusted R2 is

0.39. The correlation of household residuals is 0.50, and a Lagrange Multiplier test of the

estimated random effects model compared with a simple pooled data model (no household

specific error component) yields a value of 4415, which is significant at the 0.001 level.

The estimated autocorrelation     of the it error terms is only 0.05. We conclude that use of

panel data techniques for this estimation is necessary. Further, the magnitude of many

coefficients changes by more than 50 percent comparing the random effects model with

simple pooled data OLS results (see the second panel of Table 6),

        In the initial estimation, we find that the coefficient of Diffgain is -1.41,

significantly different from O but not from -1,0. Because the point estimate of-1.41 is

implausibly large, in subsequent estimation we restricted the coefficient to equal -1,0.

This restriction does not affect the other regression coefficients.

        The probability of ownership is an important determinant of real wealth

accumulation of youth. The quadratic term (Squared Probown) is quite significant,

suggesting that household saving surges the nearer is the transition to ownership,      Also,

the coefficient of the ownership probability in five years is positive and significant. An

increase in the current probability of owning from 0.1 to 0,2 raises real wealth by $580,

measured at the means of the other explanato~        variables and holding the fiture

probability of owning constant.    Further increases in Probown to 0.3 and 0.4 raise wealth

by an additional $960 and $1,350. A dramatic comparison of impacts on wealth contrasts

a household with current and fiture probabilities of owning of 0.2 and 0.5 to one with

values of 0.7 and 0.9, respectively.   The estimated difference in real wealth is $10,400,

nearly equal to average wealth in the sample,


                                                15
         The impact of increased Hprice on real wealth occurs directly and through the

indirect effect on Probown and Probown5.         The direct effect is positive and significant for

nonblack households.     A one standard-deviation     increase in Hprice raises real wealth by

$820 or about 4% of the increase in constant-quality       house price. This evidence is

consistent with an inelastic housing demand. The result for black households differs. The

sum of the coefficients of Hprice and Hprice*Black is not statistically different from O;

thus, black households do not increase their wealth if house price rises (Probown and

Probown5 held constant).2b

        Increased Hprice lowers both Probown and Probown 5. This effect tends to

reduce wealth, offsetting the direct positive effect of Hprice on the required down

payment, For white households, wealth peaks just below the sample mean Hprice. As

Hprice continues to rise the marginal impact of the direct down payment effect remains

constant but the discouragement     effect grows. The result is an inverse-U effect on

wealth, 27 For black households, there is no direct Hprice effect; thus, the discouragement

of ownership effect embodied in the probability of ownership variables dominates at all

house prices.

        To contrast our results with those in the literature, we estimated a model omitting

household specific random effects and the probability of home ownership variables (Table

6). We find that the coefficient of Hprice is now negative and significant as in Engelhardt

(1994). For a one standard deviation increase in Hprice, real wealth falls by $650. If we

include household specific random effects, the coefficient of Hprice is still negative, but

smaller, and is marginally significant (t ratio is 1,8).

        The coefficient of the Glfi variable is 0.94, thus households receiving a gifi of

greater than $100 add nearly the entire gifi to wealth (“spending” the gift on a down

payment adds to wealth).     The real capital gain variable for home owners has a coefficient

of 0.80, indicating some conversion of real housing gains into consumption (20 cents per




                                                16
dollar gain) over an average three-year period. The coefficient of the cumulative change

in the real mortgage balance is -0.53, indicating a greater offset (47 cents).2g

        The impact of marriage requires evaluating four coefficients (Marry, SumMarry,

Spouse Age and HGC). The estimated wealth of a white male respondent age 26 with 12

years of education married for one year to a similar spouse is $15,500.    In contrast, the

same youth, but unmarried, has wealth of $8640. This large impact is expected because

the wealth of two individuals is combined upon marriage and married couples wish to use

the wealth as home equity rather than consuming it.

        The impact of age on real wealth is also large. A married white respondent of age

26 has just over half the wealth of one age 32 ($15,500 versus $27,810).     A similar result

occurs for an unmarried youth comparing age 26 with 32 (8,640 versus $14,060).          Also,

the impact of more education is positive as expected.    Comparing a married white couple

with husband and wife age 26 and educated for 12 years to a household where both have

16 years of education but are otherwise similar, we find wealth is $3,600 greater.



VII. Summary of Findings

        The literature on tenure choice has shown household wealth to be highly correlated

with home ownership,    This result is not surprising given that home owners must

accumulate sufficient wealth to meet market imposed down payment requirements, default

insurance fees, and other closing costs and wish to accumulate additional wealth because

marginal borrowing costs on high LTV loans are high (see note 4). Our focus is on the

factors affecting the accumulation of wealth.

       A descriptive analysis of a 1985-90 panel data set of U.S. youth age 20-27 (in

1985) suggests that the desire for home ownership is an important determinant of real

wealth accumulation.   Thus we anticipated that the greater is this desire, the shorter will

be the expected duration until purchasing a home and the greater would be real wealth. In

the econometric analysis of household wealth, we include estimates of the squared


                                                17
probability of current home ownership and the level of the five-year forward probability.

We find these variables to be very significant and their impact on real wealth to be strong

and highly nonlinear.

        The small literature on the relationship of wealth to real constant-quality       house

prices has found various results ranging from dominance of a discouragement          effect

(“consumption      of despair”) to a positive relationship.   We argue that spatial and

intertemporal variations in real house prices may affect both the probability of home

ownership and the quantity of housing demanded.          We find that increases in real constant-

quality house prices reduce the probability of ownership, thus reducing real wealth. This

result agrees with that of Yoshikawa and Ohtake (1989) for Japan and Engelhardt (1994)

for Canada. We also test for a price effect on the quantity of housing demanded if

ownership probability is held constant.      Increased house price raises respondents’ wealth

(consistent with an inelastic demand for housing) more for whites than blacks, This result

differs from Engelhardt but generally agrees with Y-O,
         Overall, we find that variations in real constant-quality   house prices have a

significant net effect on the real wealth accumulation of youth, For white respondents, the

relationship of wealth and real house price has an inverse U-shape, peaking near the mean

house price. For black respondents, there is little variation of wealth for house prices

below the mean; thereafter, wealth falls with increasing house prices.

       We find that many other socio-econornic and demographic variables affect the

wealth of youth,     Significant effects are noted for gender, age, highest grade completed,

analytical aptitude, and marital status. These variables affect wealth both directly and

indirectly through the probability of home ownership.

1The stagnant U.S. home ownership rate since 1980 has led to calls for Federal actions to
lower this requirement (e.g., in the fall of 1994, the Clinton Administration proposed zero
down payment loans), However, Green’s analysis (1996) suggests that underwriting
standards are not responsible for the stagnant aggregate rate in the 1980s. In 42 of 50
states, the ratio of house prices to income declined, and in 47 states the ratio of housing
expenses to income fell.

2Unexpected gifis and real capital gains change wealth exogenously (but can be offset).

3Rosen (1 979) suggests an elasticity of about -0.7.

4 Households have an incentive not only to make the minimum down payment, but to
make a 20 percent down payment. Generally private mortgage insurance is required on
loans with less than 20 percent down, and the one-third percentage point extra charge on
10 percent down loans is applied to the entire loan balance. If the loan rate on an 80V0
loan is 8% and on a 90°A loan is 8.34Y0, the marginal rate being charged on the last 10% is
11% (solve 80(8) + 1O(X)= 90(8.34) for x),

5. They ignore the negative effect of increased house price on housing demand.               Unless
demand is inelastic, higher house prices will lower the required down payment.

GWhile real rents tend to be higher in high real house price areas, the ratio still rises,

7 A larger effect is obtained when the price/income ratio is used, but this reflects the effect
of low real income, not low real house prices.

8 The preferred sample would be renters plus the first year (or two) of home ownership.
This would require significantly more complex panel data estimation owing to the
variation in the length of individual panel members.

9 Renting is optimal, possibly for their lifetime, for low income households because
landlords’ tax benefits (reflected in the rent) exceed those that they can obtain as owners.

10For inframarginal renters, these variations have no impact.

1’ The user cost approach requires an estimate of income to calculate marginal and tenure
choice tax rates; however, income is clearly endogenous for young households given that
they select labor supply.

‘2 The quality of the data was discussed in H-H-W (1995).             In general, its reliability
appears good.

“ The number of local area CPIS is limited, thus using state data allows all observations to
remain in the sample.     The population weighted mean price index is: 1985=100,
1986=102.5, 1987=105.4, 1988=108.6, 1989=112.0, and 1990=113.9.



                                               21
14In the ~SY      data set, reported wealth is truncated to protect privacy. Because we
delete households with wealth exceeding the truncation points from our sample, the
wealth profiles are not overly influenced by a few extraordinarily wealthy households.

15Reading down a column yields a cross-sectional       snapshot of wealth for households age
20-28 in 1985, 21-29 in 1986, etc.

‘bH-H-W also show that home ownership rates vary inversely with real house prices.

17This model was developed by Butler and Moffltt (1982). Technical details concerning
the maximum likelihood estimation procedure are given in the Limdep Manual, version 6.0
(p. 440).

‘8Age of respondent and spouse is 26 and both have 12 years of education.

19The sample minimum and maximum Hprice obsemations           occur at two s.d. and three s.d.
from the mean.

20 If 1985 owners are excluded, we systematically omit respondents who successfully
saved and purchased a home. The residual sample consists of 20-27 year old youth who
failed to become owners; thus, no effect of age on eventual ownership is found. Lacking
any age effect on the tendency to own yields the improbable conclusion that 1990
ownership rates are similar to 1985 rates. Inclusion of 1985 owners solves this problem.

2]We use a tobit model to forecast gifts and a probit model for marriage.

22The estimation procedure is generalized least squares (Greene, 1996, p. 299).

23The coefficient of the Age variable differed little from zero.

24During the 1985-90 period, the secondary market generally required 5 percent down
plus a 1.5 percent first year insurance premium. FHA required 3 to 5 percent down plus a
largely borrrowable 3.8 percent up-front insurance premium, Closing costs and escrow
accounts are another one to two and a half points for high LTV loans (FHA borrowers
could borrow most of the closing costs)..

25The longer the household is post ownership, the easier it is to offset the decline in real
mortgage debt via home equity loans or refinancing.

26 This result assumes that the Freddie/Fannie repeat sales price index and our cross-
sectional scaling of this index is accurate for locations occupied by black households.

27 For our married white 26 year old, estimated wealth at various Hprices from two
standard deviations below mean Hprice to two above is ($13,600, $15,230, $15,500,
$14,370, and $12,870).

28Other coefficients are relatively unchanged by the omission of the mortgage variable.
