The Effect of Cigarette Excise Taxes on Smoking Before, During and After Pregnancy

                                       ABSTRACT



       Recent analyses suggest that cigarette excise taxes lower prenatal smoking. It is unclear,
however, whether the association between taxes and prenatal smoking represents a decline among
women of reproductive age or a particular response by pregnant women. We address this question
directly with an analysis of quit and relapse behavior during and after pregnancy. We find that the
price elasticity of prenatal quitting and postpartum relapse is close to one in absolute value. We
conclude that direct financial incentives to stop smoking during and after pregnancy should be
considered.

                                                           I. Introduction

           Prenatal smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomes in the

United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1990). Approximately 20 percent of all

low birth weight births are attributable to smoking, and the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)

is three times greater for women who smoke (Institute of Medicine 1985; DiFranza and Lew 1995). Nor

is the impact of maternal smoking limited to the perinatal period. The American Academy of Pediatrics

considers environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) a major risk factor for lower respiratory illness, middle ear

effusion and asthma in children (American Academy of Pediatrics 1977).

           Maternal smoking has also become an important element of the debate over the optimal level of

cigarette excise taxes. Unlike the public health community, economists tend to include only the external

costs of smoking—costs imposed on others—in the calculation of optimal tax levels (Manning et al.

1991; Viscusi 1995). Economists assume that parents account for or internalize the possible damage of

cigarettes to the fetus or infant when deciding to smoke.1 The assumption has strong implications. Evans

et al. (1999), for instance, find that if considered external, the costs of maternal smoking adds between

42-72 cents per pack to the costs of smoking in 1994 dollars. Since state and federal excise taxes

averaged 75 cents in 2000 (Orzechowski and Walker 2001), the consequences of maternal smoking alone,

if treated as external, would justify the present level of taxation.

           Recent work by economists suggests that increases in the excise tax for cigarettes may be an

effective means of lowering the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women. In two papers (Evans

and Ringel 1999; Ringel & Evans 2000), authors use national natality files and report participation

elasticities of -0.5 and -0.7, which exceed the consensus estimate of aggregate elasticities of -0.3 to -0.5

(Chaloupka and Warner 2000). Another study that also uses national natality files reports a participation

elasticity of -.35 (Gruber and Köszegi 2001) The obvious advantage of national natality data is the size of

the sample and its national coverage.

    The obvious exception would be the medical and remedial costs of maternal smoking borne by taxpayers.


                                                               1
        However, these studies are limited to an analysis of smoking at a single, but unspecified point

during pregnancy. Consequently, it is unclear whether the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy

associated with state excise taxes reflects the response to taxes by women of reproductive age, or a

particular response by pregnant women (Ebrahim et al. 2000). The distinction has important implication

for policy. If taxes have no effect on quit rates during pregnancy, but do lower the prevalence of

smoking among women of reproductive age, then efforts to lower smoking during pregnancy might best

be directed at smoking initiation among adolescent girls. Pregnancy, on the other hand, may provide

important motivation for women to permanently quit. As a result, policies directed specifically at

pregnant women may be more welfare enhancing than excise taxes directed at all smokers.

        In this paper, we analyze the effect of cigarette excise taxes on smoking before, during and after

pregnancy. With information on the prevalence of smoking at multiple points in time, we extend the

literature on maternal smoking and taxes with an analysis of prenatal quit and postpartum relapse rates.

We present a simple model that links quit rates to changes in smoking participation before and during

pregnancy. The model provides guidance as to the presence of potential selection effects in conditional

analyses based on samples of pregnant smokers. Moreover, our focus on quit probabilities provides

comparisons of the effectiveness of taxes as a smoking cessation intervention to clinical trials of prenatal

smoking cessation programs based on education and counseling. If taxes are associated with increased

quit rates during pregnancy, then taxes may provide an important complement to other smoking cessation

interventions as well as a source of funding.

        Data are from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS): a random, stratified

monthly survey of recent mothers overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

We combine data from 10 states over 7 years (1993-1999) and construct a sample of 115,000 women.

Although the number of states is limited, the detailed information on smoking and a richer set of

covariates makes PRAMS a significant source with which to analyze the effect of cigarette taxes on

maternal smoking.




                                                      2
                                              II. Background

        The U.S. Surgeon General’s 675-page report, Women and Smoking, details the distinctive

hazards faced by women who smoke. “Although women and men who smoke share excess risks for

diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and emphysema, women also experience unique smoking related

disease risks related to pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, menstrual function and cervical cancer” (U.S.

Department of Health and Human Resources 2001, p. 5). Despite the additional risks faced by women,

there is only a modest literature on differences in the price sensitivity of cigarettes by gender. Farrelly and

Bray (1998) use available panels from the National Health Interview Survey of individuals 18 years and

older between 1976-1993 and obtain an overall elasticity of -0.26 for men and -0.19 for women.

Participation elasticities are less: -0.18 and -0.09 for men and women, respectively. Lewit and Coate

(1982) find participation elasticities between -0.13 and -0.39 for women 20 to 35 years of age, neither of

which is statistically significant. The comparable elasticities for men range from -0.29 to -1.28.

Chaloupka and Pacula (1998) report smoking participation elasticities of -0.59 for women and -0.93 for

men. All three studies use cross-state variation in prices to estimate elasticities. Thus they assume that

the unmeasured factors that influence smoking in West Virginia are the same as in Maine. This leaves the

studies vulnerable to significant omitted variable bias. Nevertheless, a consistent finding is that women

are less sensitive to taxes than are men.

        Studies of the effect of cigarettes taxes on prenatal smoking are quite recent. Evans and Ringel

(1999) are the first to exploit the smoking indicator that was added to national natality files in 1989. With

over 10 million births they estimate participation elasticities and conditional demand elasticities for

women who gave birth between 1989 and 1992. They include a full set of state and month fixed effects

and thus rely on within-state-and-month variation to identify effects of taxation. They find that a 10

percent increase in cigarette excise taxes lowers smoking participation by 5 percent, but has no effect of

the number of cigarettes smoked. Their estimates are unaffected by adjustments for border crossing or

clean indoor air laws. In a more recent version with this design, Ringel and Evans (2001) add three more

years of natality data in order to explore the heterogeneity of responsiveness to taxes by pregnant women.



                                                       3
In this analysis they report a participation elasticity of –0.7, which the authors note is several times

greater than the participation elasticity for the general population. Moreover, the absolute value of the

elasticity increases with socio-economic status. Women who are married, older, and more educated have

elasticities that generally exceed one. As before, taxes have no effect on the number of cigarettes smoked

during pregnancy.

        Evans and Ringel’s elasticities have important policy implications. If pregnant women are more

sensitive to changes in prices than non-pregnant women, then other financial incentives in addition to

taxes could achieve significant declines. For instance, health insurance premiums could be raised for

women who continue to smoke during pregnancy or bonuses awarded for women who quit.

        However, other evidence suggests that Evans and Ringel’s estimates are optimistic. Real

cigarette prices have risen 60 percent since 1997. Given an elasticity of –0.7, we could expect a 42

percent drop in maternal smoking. In fact, the proportion of women who smoke during pregnancy has

fallen from 13.2 in 1997 to 12.2 percent in 2000, a 7.6 percent decline. Clearly, other factors besides

price affect prenatal smoking. Gruber and Köszegi (2001) also use natality data and obtain an overall

elasticity of -0.35 , which implies an even lower participation elasticity. Beside the extra year of data,

Gruber and Köszegi aggregate births into monthly cells, which may explain differences with Ringel and

Evans (2001).

        The other surprising result obtained by Ringel and Evans (2001) is the positive relationship

between the absolute value of the elasticities and socio-economic status. For instance, the elasticity of

participation is -3.39 for college educated pregnant women and -0.49 for women with a high school

degree. Part of the discrepancy is attributable to the low prevalence of smoking among college-educated

women and its effect on the elasticity computation. However, even the marginal effects of taxes on

smoking (in absolute value) are greater for the highly educated. This finding is counter to the result that

low-income smokers are more sensitive to the price of cigarettes than higher income smokers (Farrelly

and Bray 1998; Evans et al. 1999).




                                                       4
           The study by Gruber and Köszegi (2001) merits note because the authors find that pregnant

women are forward looking in their smoking behavior. Excise taxes that have been enacted, but not yet

in effect reduce smoking among pregnant women. The elasticity of cigarette consumption with respect

to prices is -0.15.

           Another recent study uses longitudinal data from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey

to examine the relationship between cigarette prices and maternal smoking (Bradford 2002). Women

who gave birth in 1988 are surveyed again in 1991. Since some women have had an additional child or

have become pregnant at the time of the 1991 interview, the author is able to analyze the effect of

pregnancy on smoking and the interaction of pregnancy and prices. He finds that the price elasticity of

smoking is almost identical for both pregnant and recently pregnant women at about -0.30. The most

significant limitation to this analysis is the lack of controls for national trends. Real cigarette prices rose

between 1987 and 1991 while smoking prevalence declined. In an earlier draft, the author acknowledged

that dummy variables for time wipe out the effect of price. With approximately 6,000 women at four

points in time in the sample, there may be insufficient within-state variation in prices to identify price

effects.

           In summary, the literature on the effect of cigarette taxes on smoking by women of reproductive

age is remarkably sparse. There is consistent evidence that pregnant and non-pregnant women are

sensitive to cigarette prices and taxes. Nevertheless, several important questions remain. First, do

pregnant and non-pregnant women respond differently to taxes? The relatively large elasticities obtained

by Evans and Ringel imply an interaction between pregnancy and taxes in a model of smoking

participation. Ebrahim et al. (2000) question such interactions. They show that the ratio of smoking

prevalence between pregnant to non-pregnant women is stable between 1987 and 1996, which they

interpret as a decline in ever-smoking among women of reproductive age. We can address this question

more directly by analyzing the association between taxes and quit rates during pregnancy. If the

elasticity of smoking participation before and during pregnancy is the same, then taxes will have no effect

on quit rates.



                                                       5
        We can also follow up on Gruber and Köszegi (2001) and offer some insight as to forward-

looking behavior among women who are about to become pregnant. PRAMS has information on whether

the pregnancy is intended or unintended. We also know whether women who were ever smokers have

stopped smoking three months before pregnancy. Many women consider the risk to the fetus as the most

important reason to quit. In addition, smoking lowers the probability of conception. Thus, we expect that

women who are trying to become pregnant are more likely to stop smoking in anticipation of these costs

than women whose pregnancies are unintended.

        Finally, we can test whether taxes are associated with post-partum relapse rates. Approximately

40 percent of women quit smoking upon the realization that they are pregnant. Such behavior

underscores the importance of fetal damage as a “cost” of smoking.             The fact that about approximately

75 percent of women who quit smoking during pregnancy relapse within one year of delivery suggests

that these costs are viewed as largely temporary, or at least greater than the costs of second hand smoke

on the newborn. Consequently, taxes as a proportion of the total costs of smoking are probably greater in

the post-partum than the prenatal period and may have a greater impact on smoking. The analysis of

taxes and post-partum relapse rates represents a novel contribution of this analysis.



                                          III. Analytical Framework

1. The reservation price of smoking

        We develop a simple model to study cigarette consumption decisions made by women in each of

three periods surrounding pregnancy: the period before (b), the period during (d), and the period after (a).

In each period (p = b, d, a), her current period utility function (U) depends on the number of cigarettes

smoked (Cp ) and another good (Xp ) and is quadratic in these two goods:

                 U = α x X p − (1/ 2)α xx X 2p + α cC p − (1 / 2)α cc C 2p − β b Z bC b − βd Zd C d − βa Z a C a . (1)

The parameters αx, α xx, αc, αcc, βb, βd, and βa are positive. The variables Zb, Zd, and Za are dichotomous

indicators that equal one in the periods before, during, and after pregnancy, respectively. Hence βdCd

represents the cost in utility terms imposed on her fetus by a pregnant woman who smokes during


                                                           6
pregnancy and βaca represents the cost in utility terms imposed on her child by a mother who smokes after

pregnancy. We assume βb < βa < βd. This guarantees that some women will quit smoking during

pregnancy and also guarantees that not all quitters will restart.

          Let Tp be the price of a pack of cigarettes, let µ be the marginal utility of wealth, and let the

market rate of interest equal the rate of time preference for the present. Then a woman will not smoke in

the period before pregnancy if the monetary value of the marginal utility of cigarettes evaluated at C = 0

[(αc/µ) - βb/µ)]—termed her ‘reservation price’—is smaller than or equal to T b, and she will smoke if her

reservation price exceeds T b. In symbols

                           Cb = 0 if (αc/µ) - (βb/µ) ≤ T b

                           Cb > 0 if (αc/µ) - (βb/µ) > T b.                                     (2)

During the pregnancy period (d), condition (2) becomes

                           Cd = 0 if (αc/µ) - (βd/µ) ≤ T d

                           Cd > 0 if (αc/µ) - (βd/µ) > T d.                                     (3)

According to equation (3), with the money price of a pack of cigarettes held constant, a woman is less

likely to smoke when she is pregnant than when she is not pregnant because her reservation price—the

maximum price at which she is willing to become a consumer of cigarettes—falls from αc/µ -βb/µ to αc/µ

- βd/µ.

          This simple framework generates demand functions for smoking participation and for the number

of cigarettes smoked conditional on positive consumption. Price is expected to have a negative effect on

each outcome, and both should fall during the pregnancy period. However, we are interested in the effect

of cigarette excise taxes on the decision to quit smoking during pregnancy and to restart after delivery.

The framework we have presented highlights that, as a first approximation, the decision to stop smoking

or for that matter to stop consuming any good depends on changes in the reservation and money prices of

that good between two consecutive periods rather than on the absolute levels of these prices. In

particular, a reduction in the reservation price of cigarette smoking between periods t and t+1 or an

increase in the money price of cigarettes between these two periods will cause some people to quit


                                                         7
smoking. The quit rate in period t+1 should, however, be zero if these two variables remain the same.

But we know from the clinical literature that between 30 to 40 percent of smokers quit when they become

pregnant (Quinn, Mullen, and Ershoff 1991). This points to a decrease in the reservation price of

smoking caused by an increase in the health costs of this behavior (βd/µ exceeds βb/µ in our notation),

since rarely is there a change in the price of cigarettes in the brief period from before pregnancy to the

realization of conception. The question, therefore, is what role does the level of the price play, if any, in

the decision to quit smoking during pregnancy? Put differently, why might high-tax states have higher

quit rates than low-tax states?



2. Relationship between smoking participation and quitting

         The quit probability can be viewed as a conditional participation equation with implications for

the elasticity of smoking participation before and during pregnancy. To illustrate, let Π be the probability

of continuing to smoke in the pregnancy period and note that Π is equal to 1 - Q, where Q is the quit rate.

As an identity,

                                    Sd ,
                              ∏=                                                                                  (5)
                                    Sb

where Sd is the probability of smoking during pregnancy or the smoking participation rate during this

period at the aggregate level and Sb is the smoking participation rate in the period prior to pregnancy. 2

The smoking participation rate in each period is negatively related to the “full price” of cigarettes in that

period. The latter price is defined as

                             Fp (p = b, d) = Tp + (βp /µ) = Tp + Mp,                                              (6)


2
  Let Nb be the number of smokers before pregnancy and let Nd be the number of smokers during pregnancy. Assume nobody
starts smoking or resumes smoking after getting pregnant. Then Nd = Nb - Q, where Q is the number of women who quit. Let N
be the total number of women. Then

                              Nd Nb Q N b .
                                =  −
                              N   N Nb N

Rewrite this as Sd = Sb(1 - Q) or Sd = SbΠ.




                                                             8
where Mp is the monetary value of the utility or health cost of smoking in period p. Note that from now

on, Mp is added to the money price rather than subtracted from the reservation price.

            Suppose that T b is equal to T d. Differentiate equation (5) with respect to the common value T and

convert all terms to elasticities to obtain

                                ρ = ηd - ηb.                                                              (7)

According to equation (7), the elasticity of the probability of continuing to smoke during pregnancy with

respect to money price (ρ) is negative if the elasticity of smoking participation during pregnancy with

respect to money price (ηd) is larger in absolute value than the elasticity of smoking participation with

respect to money price before becoming pregnant (ηb). 3 The reverse holds if ηb is larger than ηd. A zero

elasticity for the probability of smoking continuation implies that taxes have no differential effect on

pregnant women. This would support the contention that the decline in smoking participation during

pregnancy reflects the general decline among women of reproductive age (Ebrahim et al. 2000).

            Let εp be the elasticity of smoking participation with respect to the full price and let Kp be the

share of money price in full price. Then

                                ρ = Kdεd - Kbε b.                                                         (8)

Clearly Kd is smaller than Kb since the health cost of smoking is greater in the period during pregnancy

than in the period before it. Hence, if the full price elasticity were the same in each period, one obtains

the somewhat counterintuitive result that an increase in the money price of cigarettes raises the

probability of continuing to smoke during the pregnancy period or lowers the probability of quitting. The

full price elasticity is unlikely, however, to be constant because this implies that the probability of



3
    The money price elasticity of smoking participation in period i is defined to be negative:

                                        ∂ ln Si .
                                 ηi =
                                        ∂ ln T
Note that the elasticity of Q with respect to T (ϕ) is given by




                                                                   9
smoking is specified as a log-linear function. This specification does not take account of the distribution

of reservation prices and does not constrain the participation probability to fall between zero and one.

        Suppose that the reservation price has a uniform distribution with a minimum value of δ and a

maximum value of γ. Then it is easy to show that the probability of smoking in period p is

                          Sp = (γ - T - Mp )/(γ - δ),                                                 (9)

and the elasticity of Sp with respect to T is

                          ηp = - T/(γ - T - Mp ).                                                     (10)

Clearly ηd is larger in absolute value than ηb since Md exceeds Mb. From equation (7), the elasticity of

the probability of continuing to smoke during pregnancy with respect to T (ρ) is negative, and the

elasticity of the quit probability with respect to T is positive.

        Now suppose that the reservation price has a normal distribution so that the probability of

smoking can be specified as a probit function. This specification constraints Si to lie between zero and

one both theoretically and empirically. Let φp be the probit coefficient of money price in each period.

Then

                          ρ = T(φdλd - φbλb),                                                         (11)

where λp is the inverse of the Mills ratio. Since λp is negatively related to the probability of smoking and

since women are less likely to smoke in the pregnancy period, λd exceeds λb. Thus, ρ is negative if φd

equals φb and could be negative even if φd is smaller in absolute value than φb. Moreover, given the

strong possibility of lagged as opposed to instantaneous adjustment, φd might well exceed φb.

3. Potential selection effects

        A final consideration is that reservation prices before and during pregnancy are not observed and

must be replaced by their determinants. One of these determinants is the unobserved propensity or taste

for smoking. Denote this propensity by VQ and define it such that an increase in VQ causes an increase in

the quit probability. Note that this disturbance term surely is negatively correlated with the disturbance


                                    ∏                ∏ 

term in the equation for smoking participation before pregnancy (VS*), where S* is a latent variable

governing the propensity to smoke before pregnancy, and an increase in VS* causes S* to rise. In a

sample of women who smoked prior to pregnancy, a woman from a high price state is likely to have a

high value of VS*. Hence T b and VS* are positively correlated in the quit sample (and T b and VQ are

negatively correlated) even if they are uncorrelated in the population at large.

         The positive association between T b and VS* will bias downward the effect of taxes on quit rates.

However, we can obtain insight as to the importance of such selection effects by comparing estimates of

the price elasticity of quitting during pregnancy estimated directly to the same elasticity obtained from the

participation equations. Specifically, we will estimate smoking participation equations before and during

pregnancy as a function of T b. Provided taxes are exogenous, we can back out an unbiased estimate of

the quit elasticity (see footnote 3). We can compare this estimate to the one obtained directly by

regressing the probability of quitting during pregnancy on T b. If the estimate from the direct estimation

is substantially less than the estimate obtained from the unconditional participation equations, then we

would have evidence of selection effects. 4

         To summarize, we have outlined a framework in which the conditional probability of quitting

during pregnancy may be positively related to cigarette taxes. If true, then we should find that the

elasticity of smoking participation during pregnancy exceeds in absolute value the elasticity of smoking

participation before pregnancy. This would be consistent with recent work based on natality data in

which the elasticity of smoking participation during pregnancy appears substantially greater than the

elasticity of participation among women of reproductive age (Evans and Ringel 1999; Ringel and Evans

2001). Two caveats exists. First, changes in the non-monetary price of smoking associated with

childbearing can yield negative quit elasticities (equation 8). Second, a larger proportion of women who


4
  One way to account for the bias just outlined is to fit a bivariate probit model with sample selection (Wynand and van Praag
1981; Greene 2000). We experimented with such models but identification proved difficult. We used taxes at age 14 to predict
smoking participation just prior to pregnancy. However, taxes at 14 had limited explanatory power. One reason is that we did
not know the mother’s state of residence at birth or more importantly, at age 14. This form of measurement error would tend to
bias out estimates downwards.




                                                              11
smoke just prior to pregnancy in high-tax states are likely to have a stronger preference for smoking than

their counterparts in low-tax states. As a result, the elasticity of quitting with respect to the monetary may

be biased downwards in a sample of pregnant smokers.



                                      IV. Empirical Implementation

1. Data

          The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is a random, stratified monthly

survey of recent mothers selected from birth certificates. PRAMS was initiated by the Centers for

Disease Control in 1987 as a response to the slowdown in the rate of decline in infant mortality and the

absence of any decline in the rate of low birth weight births. PRAMS surveys are carried out by

participating states following explicit guidelines developed by the CDC. Each month the PRAMS staff in

each state selects between 100 and 250 recent mothers from birth certificates by stratified systematic

sampling with a random start. Stratification variables, such as birth weight and race or ethnicity, vary

among states. All states over-sample women at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sampled

mothers are then sent a self-administered questionnaire two to six months after delivery; non-respondents

are followed up by telephone. Response rates average between 70 and 80 percent after follow up. (See

http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/drh/methodology.htm for more details.)

          Twenty-five states participated in PRAMS in 2000 up from five states in 1988. We use surveys

from 10 states that participated for at least 5 of the six years between 1993 and 1999: Alabama, Alaska,

Florida, Georgia (1993-1997), Maine, New York State (excluding New York City) Oklahoma, South

Carolina, Washington and West Virginia. There are 115,000 observations, a total that, when weighted,

represents approximately 4,605,470 births, or 17 percent of deliveries in the U.S. over the same period.

          The questionnaire in PRAMS asks women if they ever smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their

entire life. Those that answer ‘yes’ are asked to record the number of cigarettes or packs of 20 cigarettes

they smoked per day, on average, in the three months before they were pregnant. They may also respond

by indicating that they smoked less than one cigarette per day, that they didn’t smoke at all, or that they



                                                     12
do not know. The same set of questions are asked about the period three months before delivery and at

the time of the survey, which occurs between 2 and 6 months after delivery.

           We are primarily interested in the change in smoking behavior.5 We create four dichotomous

indicators of change. The first is one if the woman ever-smoked but did not smoke three months before

pregnancy (Quit_ever_before).        The second is one if the woman smoked three months before pregnancy

but not three months before delivery (Quit_before_during). The third indicator is one if the woman

stopped during pregnancy, but resumed between 2 to 6 months postpartum (Resume). And the final

indicator is one if the woman smoked before but not postpartum (Quit_before_after). We refer to these

women as “permanent” quitters. The importance of permanent quits is that women who stop smoking

during pregnancy, but resume postpartum, are still at double the risk for SIDS (Schoendorf and Kiley

1992).

           We do not analyze smoking intensity with PRAMS, but we do control for pre-pregnancy

cigarette consumption in the Quit_before_during , Resume, and Quit_before_after equations.

Consumption before pregnancy is a measure of the stock of smoking capital (Becker, Grossman and

Murphy 1994). The clinical literature indicates that the lightest smokers prior to pregnancy are the most

likely to quit during and least likely to resume (Li et al. 1993; Quinn, Mullen, and Ershoff 1991;

Fingerhut, Kleinman and Kendrick 1990). We create a trichotomous indicator of pre-pregnancy

consumption: less than 10 cigarettes per day, between 10 and 20 cigarettes per day and more than 20 per

day. We eliminated women who did not know how much they smoked before pregnancy (n=4325),

during pregnancy (n=2808) and after delivery (n=2381).

           PRAMS also contains covariates in addition to those on birth certificates. These include health

insurance status at delivery, family income, and pregnancy intention. We use pregnancy intention to test

for forward-looking behavior. Women are asked whether at the time that they first realized that they were

pregnant if they wanted to become pregnant then, or at some other time (mistimed) or not at all

(unwanted). We characterize pregnancies that are mistimed or unwanted as unintended. Smoking


5
    We analyze smoking participation three months before delivery in order to compare PRAMS to published works.


                                                        13
imposes two potential costs on women who want to have children. First, smoking inhibits conception.

Second, and more well known, is the risk of adverse birth outcomes (U.S. Department of Health and

Human Resources 2001). Thus, women who are trying to become pregnant may be more likely to quit in

the three months before pregnancy due to these anticipated costs, than women whose pregnancies are

unintended.

2. Reported Smoking

         A limitation of self-reported smoking is the potential for underreporting. Clinical studies or

prenatal smoking that use biological markers to estimate exposure find that a little as 10 and as much as

30 percent of prenatal smoking is not reported by the women. Birth certificates capture less smoking than

hospital medical charts (Piper et al. 1993; Buescher et al. 1993) and the prevalence of smoking as

reported in PRAMS exceeds that reported on birth certificates. The latter is likely an underestimate of the

true difference between birth certificates and PRAMS since birth certificates ask about smoking at any

time during pregnancy and PRAMS specifically asks about smoking in the three months before delivery.

If smoking were equally well reported on PRAMS and birth certificates, the percentage of women

reporting smoking anytime during pregnancy should exceed the percentage reporting smoking during the

last trimester, since the latter group is a subset of the former. For example, in the National Household

Survey on Drug Abuse, 20 percent of women reported smoking at any time during pregnancy, but only 16

percent reported smoking during the last trimester.

         Figure 1 compares smoking during pregnancy from three sources: the Behavioral Risk Factor

Surveillance System (BRFSS), PRAMS and birth certificates. 6 Women in the BRFSS are asked about

smoking and later asked whether they are pregnant at this time. If we accept that there are few false

positives, then PRAMS is superior to birth certificates and the BRFSS as a screen for smoking. Smoking

in the last three months of pregnancy is between 1 and 2 percentage points higher than what is recorded




6
  The BRFSS is a monthly telephone survey of adult health practices and behaviors by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and State health departments. Initiated in the early 1980’s, the BRFSS interviews approximately 125 adults per
month in each state (Remington et al. 1988). Fifty states now participate. We use data from 1987 to 2000. There are 33 states
in 1987, a number which rises to 50 by 1993. We limit the sample to women 18 to 44 years of age.


                                                              14
for smoking during pregnancy on birth certificates. Also noteworthy is that the prevalence of smoking

based on birth certificates is similar in nine of the 10 PRAMS states to all available states. 7

3. Econometric model

         We use probits to estimate smoking participation and quit models. The basic specification is as

follows:

                    Pr ob( Sijt = 1) = Φ (∑ σ k X kijt + φT + τ j + τ t + eijt ),
                                             k

where Sijt is one if woman i, in state j, and year t smokes. Let Xkijt be maternal characteristics, T is the

level of state and federal taxes in 1982-84 dollars, t j and t t are state and year fixed effects respectively,

and eijt is the residual. All analyses are weighted with the survey weights and we use robust procedures

for the standard errors that cluster on state and year.



                                                       V. Results

1. Smoking participation

         We first use PRAMS to analyze the effect of state cigarette excise taxes on smoking participation

before, during and after pregnancy. Results are shown in Table 1. For each outcome in, we present

separate regressions for a contemporaneous tax and taxes lagged approximately nine months. 8 Estimates

should be interpreted as the marginal change in probability of each outcome given a one cent change in

the real tax. We also present price elasticities for each outcome under the assumption that a one cent

increase in taxes causes a commensurate increase in price (Evans et al. 1999).

         Taxes are negatively related to smoking before, during and after pregnancy. Of the six estimates,

five have t-ratios greater than one, although only two are statistically significant at conventional levels

(p<.05). Implied price elasticities range from -0.23 to -0.91.9 The largest elasticity pertains to taxes three

months before pregnancy on smoking participation three months before delivery. For two of the three


7
  New York, one of the 10 PRAMS states, did not report smoking on the birth certificate.
8
  The decision to lag nine approximately nine months exploits the space between reporting period. Thus, women are asked about
smoking three months before delivery as well as three months before pregnancy, a spacing of nine months. Similarly, women
are asked between 2 and 6 months postpartum, upwards of nine months after they were asked about smoking before delivery.



                                                             15
outcomes, the lagged exceed the contemporaneous estimate. The weakest association is the relationship

between taxes three months before delivery and smoking participation also three months before delivery

(column 3). This is not surprising given that the vast majority of women quit early in pregnancy

(Fingerhut, Kleinman and Kendrick 1990). Women who smoke in the last trimester are likely to have the

strongest preference for smoking and thus, the least sensitive to changes in monetary prices.

2. Quit and relapse behavior

         As we argued above, pregnancy causes a large decrease in the reservation price of smoking due to

the risks it poses for the fetus. Thus, even if taxes and prices remained unchanged, we expect between 30

and 40 percent of women who smoke prior to pregnancy to quit during pregnancy. The question we

address in this section is whether states with high taxes have higher quit rates and lower relapse rates than

states with lower taxes.

         Figures 2 through 5 display four outcomes related to changes in smoking behavior around the

time of birth. In each Figure, we show separate series for New York and Washington, Alaska and Maine

and the other six states in PRAMS. The grouping is based on changes in state excise taxes. New York

and Washington raised taxes between 1993 and 1995; Alaska and Maine raised taxes one month apart in

1997.    The other six states did not increase state excise taxes over this time period.10

         There is no apparent association between state excise taxes and quit rates three months before

pregnancy among ever smokers (Figure 2). Quit rates during pregnancy rise sharply after 1994 in New

York and Washington and are relatively flat in the other states between 1993 and 1996 (Figure 3); and

although there is an increase in quit rates in Alaska and Maine after 1996, it is difficult to distinguish the

rise from the upward trend in quit rates in the non-tax-changing states (Figure 3). There is no obvious

association between the rate of postpartum relapse and the timing of the state tax changes. Nevertheless,

relapse rates are similar in 1993 among all states but noticeably less among the tax-changing states in

1999 (Figure 4). Finally, permanent quit rates defined as the percent of women who smoked before

 We assume that a one cent increase in taxes increase price by the same amount.
10
  Federal tax increases bracket our study period. The federal excise tax increased from 20 to 24 cents in January, 1993 and from
24 to 32 cents in January, 2000.


                                                              16
pregnancy but who do not smoke postpartum jumped sharply in New York and Washington after 1995

(Figure 5). In short, there is some visual evidence that smoking behavior changed in the wake of state

excise tax increases, but the strength of the association is not apparent. We turn, therefore, to the

regressions of quit behavior.

        Table 2 shows the means for the covariates that we use in the quit regressions stratified by year

and tax-changing states. A salient feature is that the intensity of smoking prior to pregnancy in the two

groups of states is similar in 1993. Approximately 20 percent of pregnant smokers in tax-changing and

non-tax-changing states smoke less than 11 cigarettes (light smokers) and 16 percent smoked more than a

pack per day (heavy smokers) in 1993. By 1999 there are more light smokers and fewer heavy smokers

in the tax-changing states relative to the non-tax-changing states. There is also a noticeable shift in the

age distribution of pre-pregnancy smokers. The proportion of teens among pre-pregnant smokers

increases from 12 to 18 percent between 1993 and 1999 in the tax-changing states and from 16 to 19

percent in the non-tax-changing states. The shift in age may explain in part the relative increase in light

smoking. We turn therefore, to the multivariate estimates in order to adjust for the changing

characteristics of pre-pregnant smokers in the quit models.

        The probit regressions pertain to the four quit probabilities shown in Figures 2 through 5. We

associate taxes at the beginning of each quit period with quitting behavior. Thus, we use taxes at age 14

in the equation of ever smokers who no longer smoke three months prior to conception

(Quit_ever_before); similarly, we use taxes three months before conception in the quit equations during

pregnancy (Quit_before_during) and permanent quits (Quit_before_after) and taxes three months before

delivery in the relapse models. Results are displayed in Table 3. Taxes at age 14 are strongly and

positively correlated with quitting prior to pregnancy. The elasticity is 0.66 (column 1). Taxes before

pregnancy significantly increase the likelihood that a woman will quit before delivery (column 2). The

implied price elasticity is 1.04. Taxes are also associated with a lower probability that a woman will

resume smoking between 2 to 6 months postpartum, although the estimate is not is not statistically

significant (column 3). The last estimate associates taxes with what we call “permanent” quits: women



                                                     17
who smoked before pregnancy but not after. Permanent quits include women who smoked during

pregnancy and stopped postpartum, although this represents only 10 percent of “permanent” quitters.

         The responsiveness of prenatal smokers to taxes is large enough to account for a substantial

portion of the rise in quit rates in recent years. From 1993 to 1999 among PRAMS states, the quit rate

during pregnancy rose from 37.3 to 46.4 percent and the weighted average tax rose from $0.33 to $0.40.

The coefficient on tax in column 2 implies that quit rates would have risen by approximately 2.5

percentage points due to taxes alone, or over a quarter of the actual change.11 We obtain a similar result

based on the change in prices. For instance, prices rose from $1.33 to $1.41 (6.1%) in real 1982-84$ from

1993 to 1999 in our PRAMS states. Given a price elasticity of 1.04, we would expect the quit rate to rise

to 39.6%, which again is approximately a quarter of the observed change in quits. 12

         As we argued above, the quit elasticity obtained from the sample of pre-conception smokers may

be biased downwards since women in high-tax states that smoke may have a greater taste for smoking.

To obtain insight as to possible selection effects, we use estimates from the participation equations in

Table 1 to back out the implied quit elasticity.13 From this exercise we obtain a quit elasticity of 0.84,

which is less than the estimated elasticity, but reasonably close.

         We also display the marginal effects of selected covariates in Table 3. As noted above, women

who intend to become pregnant are much more likely to quit smoking prior to pregnancy, than women

whose pregnancies are unintended. Once conception is known, however, there is no difference in

smoking behavior by pregnancy intention. We interpret this finding as support for the importance of

future “prices” on current behavior. Another notable finding is the robust impact of first births on quit

behavior. Although women delivering their first child are 7 percentage points less likely to quit prior to

pregnancy, once pregnant their smoking behavior changes much more than women of higher order births.

Specifically, women having a first birth are 14 percentage points more likely to quit during pregnancy, 10


11
   2.5 = .0035*($0.40-$0.33).
12
  The price changes might appear modest. However, we use the price three months before pregnancy. Thus, many of the
pregnancies in our 1999 sample were unaffected by the large price increases that followed the tobacco settlement in November of
1998. In fact, if we use the price three months before delivery, the change in 1982-84 dollars between 1993 and 1999 in our 10
PRAMS states is from $1.23 to $1.71 or 39 percent.




                                                              18
percentage points less likely to resume after delivery and 10 percentage points more likely to quit

permanently relative to women who deliver a higher order birth. As a percentage of the mean of each quit

behavior, these effects are very large. One speculation is that women use previous birthing experience to

adjust the expected costs of smoking. Even for women who smoke, the probability of a low birth weight

birth is only about 0.12, or double of those that don’t. Thus, the high probability of a good birth outcome

despite smoking may lead women to discount the risk of prenatal smoking. One way to test this would be

to include a measure of previous adverse birth outcomes. We lacked such data in PRAMS. However, in

a study of consecutive births in Georgia, researchers found that women who smoked during their first

pregnancy were less likely to smoke in the second, if the first infant had died. Interestingly, a first birth

of low birth weight had no effect on smoking during the second pregnancy (Dietz et al. 1997).

            The other noteworthy result pertains to prior smoking behavior among those who quit. As shown

in Table 4, light smokers, those that smoke less than a half a pack a day, are much more likely to quit than

heavier smokers. In our sample, for instance, 71 percent of light smokers, 36 percent of moderate smokers

and 22 percent of heavy smokers quit during pregnancy.

3. Sensitivity analysis

            One concern is that our results are sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of a particular state,

since we have only 4 states in which tax changes were enacted (Alaska, Maine, New York and

Washington). In Table 4 we present additional estimates of the marginal effect of taxes on the probability

of quitting during pregnancy. We focus on quits from before to during pregnancy given the health

consequences of quitting and the robustness of our initial findings. Each row is from a separate

regression in which we have altered the specification or the sample. Row 1 repeats the estimate from

Table 3 for convenience. The specification in row 2 includes no covariates other than state and year fixed

effects. In rows 3 through 6 we drop one of the tax-changing states and in rows 7 through 10 we include

only one of the tax-changing states. Except for when we include New York (row 9), marginal effects

range from .0020 to .0042 and are statistically significant in 7 of the 8 cases. In the last row we include


13
     Using the formula in footnote 8 and estimates from Table 1, the implied quit elasticity equals [-0.30- (-0.91)]*(.58/.42)= 0.84.


                                                                  19
only the tax-changing states. In this specification we rely on the variation in the timing of the tax

increases to provide the relevant “comparison” state. The marginal effect falls by almost half when we

include only the four tax-changing states. Nevertheless, changes in taxes still explain almost a quarter of

the increase in quits over the study period.14

         The next set of analyses explores the heterogeneity of taxes on quit probabilities by parity,

maternal schooling and pre-pregnancy smoking. We consider only binary stratification because of sample

size limitations. Estimates are shown in Table 5. Although none of the differences in marginal effects

within each category is statistically significant, we find that the marginal effect of taxes on quit

probabilities are greater among women with first births, less education and more pre-conception smoking.



                                                   VI. Conclusion

         In this paper we examine whether increasing cigarette taxes is an effective way to reduce

smoking among pregnant women. One justification for raising taxes would be that they influence

pregnant women more, and thus change behavior most where the externalities are greatest. We find strong

support for the use of taxes in our quit equations. We estimate that a 10 percent increase in cigarette taxes

would increase the probability of a woman quitting by 10 percent, a result that holds up in separate

regressions stratified by education, parity, and pre-pregnancy smoking and with various combinations of

states. Since higher costs of smoking appear to be quite effective in inducing women to quit smoking

during pregnancy, direct financial incentives to stop smoking during and after pregnancy should be

considered.

         We also find that women who smoke during pregnancy are not a random cross-section of

reproductive-age smokers. In particular, more women who intend to become pregnant quit prior to

pregnancy than women whose pregnancy was unintended. We also find that women delivering their first

child are much more likely to quit during pregnancy and less likely to resume postpartum than women


14
 The weighted average of real state taxes rose by 15.5 cents between 1993 and 1999 in Alaska, Maine, New York and
Washington. The percent of women who quit smoking during pregnancy increased by 13.0 percentage points, from 34.3 in 1993




                                                           20
with previous live births. Perhaps cessation policies aimed specifically at first-time mothers would

persuade more women to quit than a general program aimed at all pregnant women.

          One concern is that quit and relapse elasticities based on a sample of pregnant women who smoke

are biased since smokers in high-tax states would have a stronger preference for cigarettes than women in

low-tax states. Using the relationship between quit and participation elasticities, we show that the

elasticity of quitting during pregnancy estimated directly is close to the quit elasticity that we obtain with

the difference in participation elasticities before and during pregnancy. We interpret this result as some

evidence that the conditional estimates based on a sample of smokers are not obviously contaminated by

pre-pregnancy attrition in high-tax states.

          Maine, Washington and New York have increased cigarette excise taxes by a simple average of

30.5 cents in constant dollars since 1999. Based on our estimates, quit rates should increase 5.8

percentage points in these states. 15 If realized, these changes compare favorably to the change in quit

rates achieved by prenatal smoking cessation programs. A meta-analysis of prenatal smoking

interventions found that quit probabilities were approximately 6.6 percentage points greater for those in

treatment relative to control groups (Dolan-Mullen, Ramirez and Groff 1994). The recent tax increases

in New York and Washington are large and probably unrepresentative of future tax increases in most

other states. Nevertheless, they underscore the potential of increasing the monetary costs of smoking

during pregnancy to affect quit rates.

          Taxes appear to be nearly as effective in reducing relapse rates as in encouraging quitting. We

find that a 10 percent rise in taxes reduces the likelihood of resuming smoking by 10 percent. However,

despite the increased taxes of recent years, half of all quitters resume smoking within six months of

delivery and 75 percent resume within a year, suggesting that their reservation prices tend to return to pre-

pregnancy levels. One interpretation is that new mothers do not perceive postpartum smoking to be as

harmful as prenatal smoking despite recent research on the relationship between smoking and SIDS,



to 47.3 in 1999. Thus, .0019*15.5 = 0.029 which is 22 percent of the change. We obtain a similar result if we use the quit
elasticity of 0.67 and a real price change of 14 percent.
