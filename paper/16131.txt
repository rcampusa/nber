Urban Policy Effects on Carbon Mitigation

                                              ABSTRACT

The geographical location of economic activity within the United States has important implications
for carbon mitigation. If households clustered in California’s cities rather than in more humid southern
cities such as Memphis and Houston, then the average household carbon footprint would be lower.
Such households would consume less electricity and this power would be generated by cleaner electric
utilities. Within metropolitan areas, urban economic theory predicts that households create less greenhouse
gas emissions when they live closer to the city center. This study uses three data sets reporting on
household driving, public transit use and residential electricity consumption to provide evidence in
support of the claim of a negative association between center city living and a household’s carbon
footprint.

Introduction

       Suppose that a household was choosing between living in Houston or San Francisco. In
each city, what would this household’s annual carbon footprint be?       Glaeser and Kahn (2010)
estimate that a standardized household would create 12.5 extra tons of carbon dioxide per year if
it moved to Houston rather than moving to San Francisco. In Houston, the same household
drives more, lives in a bigger home, uses more residential electricity – electricity that is
generated by power plants with a higher carbon emissions factor.       Using data from the year
2000 across 64 major metropolitan areas, Glaeser and Kahn (2010) document that Pittsburgh is
the city with the median residential household footprint of 28.3 tons of carbon dioxide per year
while San Francisco is the third “greenest” metropolitan area and Houston is the third
“brownest” metro area. This cross-sectional descriptive work creates a benchmark for
comparing cities’ household carbon emissions from transportation, electricity consumption and
home heating, at a point in time and tracking city trends over time.
       Given that greenhouse gas emissions are a global externality, households are unlikely to
internalize the carbon consequences of moving to a city such as Houston rather than San
Francisco. Why is San Francisco “greener” than Houston? San Francisco is blessed with a
temperate climate. Northern California’s electric utilities emit less greenhouse gas emissions
than their Texas counterparts. Due to its amenities, land prices are higher in San Francisco and
its residents live in smaller homes than their Houston counterparts. Land prices are highest
downtown and this encourages economy activity to be highly compact. Such population density
in San Francisco encourages households to live a walking, “new urbanist” life. This “low
carbon” lifestyle would be rare in sprawling Houston.
       Over the last 100 years, people and jobs have been moving away from center cities. The
average person who lived in a metropolitan area lived 9.8 miles from the City Center in 1970 and
this distance grew to 13.2 miles by the year 2000. While privately beneficial, this trend has
helped to exacerbate the challenge of mitigating greenhouse gas production. Suburbanites drive
more, and live in larger homes that require more heating and cooling than their urban
counterparts.
       This paper uses three different data sets to document that households who live in center
cities drive less, use public transit more, and consume less electricity than observationally similar
households who live in the suburbs. This center city/suburban differential is largest in the

                                                  3
Northeast’s monocentric cities such as New York City. Given that households choose where to
live, this differential could be caused by both residential self selection and a true causal
“treatment effect” of urban living. If these correlations are due to a “treatment effect”, then any
pro-center city policy, such as policies directed towards reducing inner-city crime, is likely to
reduce a metropolitan area’s carbon footprint.

Urban Transportation

Miles Driven as a Function of Urban Form

          The Department of Transportation has recently released the 2009 National Household
Transportation Survey (NHTS) micro data.2 This micro data set is distinctive because it reports
household vehicle mileage for a large representative sample of households. Using a special
version of the data set that has census tract identifiers, I restrict the sample to households living
within 35 miles of a major city center. For each household, I observe which metropolitan area it
lives in, its distance to the City Center and its distance to the closest rail transit station using data
from Baum-Snow and Kahn (2005). I estimate ordinary least squares regressions using
observations on over 92,000 households based on equation (1):

                                                                               (1)

          In this regression, the dependent variable is the household’s total miles driven in the last
year. I trim the dependent variable and set the dependent variable equal to the 99th percentile of
the empirical distribution for observations in the top percentile. In Table One, columns (1) and
(2) are identical except that the results in column (2) include metropolitan area fixed effects. In
these regressions, I control for household income, the number of people in the household and the
age of the head of the household. Controlling for these demographic factors, my primary
interest is to measure the association between a household’s total miles driving and its location
within the metropolitan area, the population density where it lives, and whether it lives within
one mile of a rail transit line. The results are roughly similar with and without metropolitan
area fixed effects. As shown in Table One, distance from the city center is positively correlated
with miles driving. Moving a household from the 25th percentile of the distance to the city

                                                    4
center distribution to the 75th percentile of this distribution is associated with driving an extra
1,300 miles per year. A household’s census tract’s population density is negatively correlated
with miles driving. Moving a household from the 25th percentile of the population density
distribution to the 75th percentile of this distribution is associated with a driving 2,400 fewer
miles per year. In both regressions, proximity to a rail transit line has a negative effect on
driving. All else equal, households who live within one mile of a rail transit line drive 1,900
fewer miles per year than households who live more than one mile from a rail transit line. This
correlation must reflect both sorting effects (selection) and a treatment effect due to easy access
to fast public transit.

        These correlations are suggestive about the role that urban policy plays in encouraging
driving less. If households were randomly assigned to homes, then OLS estimates of equation
(1) would be of immediate use to policy makers in determining how urban policies affect an
important part of the household carbon footprint (miles driven). But, we know that households
self select where they want to live. Liberal/environmentalists are likely to self-select and choose
to live in the high density areas, close to center city and close to subway stations (Kahn and
Morris 2009). An active research agenda in urban planning examines the importance of
attitudes, beliefs and preferences in determining residential location choice and travel behavior
(e.g. Cao, Handy, and Mokhtarian, 2006; Cao, Mokhtarian, and Handy, 2007; Krizek, 2003).




Public Transit Use from 1970 to 2000

        In previous research, I have examined how worker public transit varies across cities and
over time for cities that have expanded their rail transit systems (Baum-Snow and Kahn 2005).
This work has public policy implications because rail transit construction is a favorite urban
policy for encouraging center city growth and compact urban development.

        Communities differ with respect to their distance to the CBD and their distance to rail
transit stations. Rail transit is a fast means for commuting to the city center. As discussed in
Glaeser and Kahn (2001 2004), a fundamental challenge for urban policy in battling climate
change is that jobs continue to suburbanize. When people work in the suburbs, they do not use


                                                   5
public transit to commute there. But, in cities such as New York City with a vibrant center city
core, public transit remains an important commuting mode.

         To examine how rail transit access affects commute mode choice, I use census tract level
data for 42 major metropolitan areas. I examine how proximity to the CBD and proximity to rail
transit correlates with public transit use. I use a geocoded census tract panel data set from 1970,
1980, 1990 and 2000 and observe public transit use by workers (the percent of the census tract
who commute using public transit), while restricting the sample to tracts within 35 miles of a
major city’s CBD.

         In Table Two, the dependent variable is a tract’s public transit use share. Each column
reports a separate regression. I include all metropolitan areas that are within 35 miles of a city
center that has a rail transit system. Controlling for metropolitan area fixed effects, several facts
emerge. Relative to the omitted category (1970), the propensity to commute by public transit has
declined each decade. The propensity to commute by public transit declines with distance from
the city center and increases if a tract’s centroid is within one mile of a rail transit station. These
results are robust to controlling for tract demographics such as the share black and the share
college graduate (see column 2).




Differences in Residential Energy Consumption between Urban and Suburban Households

         In this section, I examine household residential energy consumption for center city versus
suburban residents and I compare how energy consumption varies across geographical regions of
the nation. I use micro data from the 2005 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) for
households who live in urban and suburban areas.3 While the RECS data does not provide
information on the exact metropolitan area where a household lives, it does provide information
on the household’s Census Division, cooling degree days where the home is located, and the
household’s urban versus suburban status. I estimate versions of equation (2).

              ln                                                                       2

          Controlling for a household’s income, and the number of people in the home, why would
electricity consumption differ for suburban versus urban households? In a classic monocentric
city, all jobs are located in the Central Business District. Land prices decline with distance from
the city center to compensate households for longer commutes. If land prices are lower in the
suburbs, then suburban homes will be larger and the households who live there will consume
more energy.     As documented by Glaeser and Kahn (2001, 2004), employment has been
suburbanizing but major center cities such as New York City and others in the North East
continue to be major employment centers. I predict that suburbanites in regions where a large
share of employment continues to be downtown (and thus the monocentric model has more
predictive power) will feature a larger center city/suburb energy consumption differential.

          The energy consumption regressions are reported in Table Three. In column (1), the
dependent variable is the log of household electricity consumption. Controlling for the
household’s income and demographics, the average suburbanite outside of the Northeast region
consumes 10% more electricity than the average urbanite. In the Northeast region, this
differential is much larger. The average suburbanite in the Northeast consumes 51% more
electricity than the average urbanite. The divisional dummies show the spatial variation in
energy consumption with the East South Central division having the highest residential
electricity consumption.4 Column (2) shows a similar Northeast urban/suburban differential for
natural gas consumption. This suburban/center city differential could simply reflect selection
rather than a “treatment effect”. In column (3), the dependent variable is a dummy that equals
one if the household lives in a single detached home. Single detached homes are likely to be
larger than apartments in multi-family housing. Larger homes require more electricity. The
probability that a household lives in single family home is higher in the suburbs and much higher
(23.5 percentage points) in the Northeast suburbs. This evidence supports the claim that the
urban/suburban electricity consumption gap is larger in monocentric cities because of the within
metropolitan area differences in the housing stock. In a metropolitan area with a uniform
distribution of employment and no spatially differentiated amenities, I would not expect to

observe spatial differences in residential energy consumption because the price of land would be
the same throughout the area.




Conclusion

       The “macro” debate about the costs and benefits of adopting carbon pricing has not
discussed how carbon mitigation incentives will affect competition between center cities and
their suburbs or between “low carbon” cities such as San Francisco and “high carbon” cities such
as Houston. The low carbon city is a city that is compact and dense, and offers fast, frequent
public transit that helps people commute to downtown.

       Across regions there are large differences in the household carbon footprint. Glaeser and
Kahn (2010) find that cities in California such as Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco,
have the smallest residential carbon footprint while cities in the South, such as Memphis,
Oklahoma City, Houston and Nashville, have the largest carbon footprint. Their results suggest
that housing development policies that lower barriers to development in California’s coastal
cities would “green” the overall national average. Housing economists have ranked cities with
respect to the stringency of their anti-growth policies. The “low carbon” cities identified by
Glaeser and Kahn tend to be the same cities that have high land use regulation (Glaeser, Gyourko
and Saks 2005, and Quigley and Raphael 2005).         Glaeser and Kahn (2010) argue that housing
regulation does not cause a low carbon footprint. They argue that the anti-growth cities are
“green” because of their local climate conditions and their relatively low electric utility
emissions factor (using natural gas rather than coal).    This claim merits future research.

       If carbon legislation is past soon, the residents of the low carbon cities will face less of a
tax burden and this will be capitalized into local land prices. Previous incidence studies have
focused on geography and income categories but not the center city/suburbs dimension (Hassett ,
Mathur, and Metcalf 2007). The introduction of a significant carbon tax may help to reverse a
fifty year trend in the suburbanization of households and firms (Glaeser and Kahn 2004).

       Such a tax could reduce the current carbon gap between cities such as San Francisco and
Houston. In the long run, in the presence of such a tax, Houston’s transport infrastructure,


                                                  8
residential building stock, and portfolio of electric utilities might resemble San Francisco’s.
Urban economists have tried to use the “natural experiment” of the OPEC Oil Shocks to examine
whether high gas prices encourage densification (Muth 1984). These short run shocks did not
increase the demand for center city living in the 1970s.

          This paper’s evidence suggests that center city residents do produce less carbon
emissions than their suburban counter-parts. A productive future line of research could use panel
data to disentangle whether the observed correlation between center city living and the low
carbon lifestyle represents a self selection effect or a true causal effect.5 If future research
substantiates the causal role of center city living, then this raises the public policy issue of how
do we encourage more households to live downtown?          Policies that improve the center city’s
quality of life and local public goods bundle can achieve this goal. The vibrancy of a downtown
can be spurred by fighting crime and by improving urban public schools (Berry-Cullen and
Levitt 1998).

estimate the impact of urban form on obesity. By observing weight changes for migrants from
center cities to suburbs (and vice-versa), they reject the claim that “sprawl is making us fat”.

The unit of analysis is the household. The dependent variable is the household’s annual mileage.
The sample includes all households in the 2009 NHTS who live in a census tract whose centroid
is within 35 miles of a city center. *** indicates statistical significance at the 1% level.
Standard errors are reported in brackets. The standard errors are clustered by census tract. The
omitted category is a household who lives more than a mile from the closest rail transit line.
Dummy variables for the household’s income category are included in the regressions but their
coefficients are suppressed. Miles driven has a mean of 17,925 and a standard deviation of
19.061.
