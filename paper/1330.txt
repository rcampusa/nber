                             RECENT U.S. TRADE POLICY
                           AND ITS GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS



                                     ABSTRACT

    The purpose of this paper is to describe United States trade policy since
World War II, and to assess the possibility for ongoing U.S.
                                                             trade—policy
leadership.

    U.S. trade policy has shown remarkable consistency since World War II. It
has never been as purely free—trade—focussed as some commentators suggest, but
it has not recently shifted toward isolationism as dramatically as alarmists
fear. It has almost always been best described as "open, but fair," with injury
to import competitors being the measure of "fairness." The general consistency
of U.S. trade policy over time is quite remarkable given the frequent change of
political party in power, especially in the executive branch, but also in the
Congress.

    U.S. trade—policy leadership seems still potentially strong despite a
decline in U.S. hegemony. It is clearly strong in a protectionist direction.
Any shift toward aggressive insularity justifies parallel trade—policy
aggression in the eyes of trading partners. It is arguably strong in a liberal-
 izing direction as well. The U.S. seems ideally poised for aggressive trade—
policy peacemaking; perhaps multilaterally, but perhaps also bilaterally;
perhaps with its traditional industrial trading partners, but perhaps also with
Japan and newly industrializing Asian countries that play so important a role
in U.S. trade, and that, on many matters, may be closer in spirit to U.S. economic
    philosophy than Europe, Canada, or Latin America.

                          1. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY


    The purpose of this paper is to describe United States trade policy

since World War II, and to highlight some of its implications for Japan

and her more recently industrializing neighbors in East and Southeast Asia.

As such, It is aimed at filling the void that Lawrence B. Krause (1982, p. 72)

observed in his recent essay on U.S.—Japanese competition in members of the

Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN):


             In formulating and executing foreign poilcy, the United
             States must recognize that its form of government is
             difficult for foreigners to understand. Even close
             European allies have trouble following the meaning
             behind every policy swing in Washington and responding
             appropriately to it. The difficulty arises in part from
             U.S. policy mistakes. Also, foreigners are frequently
             unable to distinguish those American policies that stem
             from fundamental American interests and thus are constant
             from one administration (and Congress) to the next from
             those policies that are subject to reversal. Developing
             countries with short institutional memories must be
             forgiven if they confuse the American policies that should
             not be taken too serious with those that should.

Filling this void has grown even more important as trade with East and

Southeast Asia has grown. The region supplied 40 percent of all U.S. imports

in 1982, almost doubling its 1962 share of 21 percent (United States (1984,

Figure 10)). And the region purchased 16 percent of all U.S. exports in 1982,

up from 10 percent in 1962. Without Japan, the growth is proportionally even

more dramatic: the region's share of U.S. imports more than tripled from 5 to

16 percent, and its share of U.S. exports purchased doubled from 5 to 10 per-

cent.

    U.S. trade policy over this period was fairly consistently liberal.

In fact future economic historians will undoubtedly stress trade
                                       2




liberalization as the most distinctive feature of U.S. commercial policy over

the past 50 years. As Table I indicates, through a series of 30 bilateral

agreements and 8 multilateral negotiations, tariffs have been steadily cut to

only about 20 percent of their 1930 average level.1 The increased use in recent

years of nontariff measures modifies this liberalization picture somewhat, but

the trend in protection over the period has clearly been downward.

   Although tariff reduction has been the dominant thrust of U.S. trade policy

since the early 1930s, there have been important shifts in the nature and

extent of U.S. support for this trade liberalization. Underlying the dif-

ferent shifts in postwar U.S. trade policy are three more basic economic and

political influences. They are: first——and most important——the emergence and

subsequent decline of the United States as a hegemonic power; second, the per-

sistence during the entire period of a politically significant group of domestic

industries (whose composition changed somewhat over time) that were opposed to

duty cuts on the import products with which they competed; and, finally, the

efforts by Congress to reduce the enhanced powers granted the President during

the economic emergency of the 1930s and the political emergency of World War II.

     There are a number of important conclusions of the discussion for

industrializing developing countries. First, U.S. trade policy has shown

remarkable consistency since World War II.   It has never been as purely free—

trade—focussed as some commentators suggest, but it has not recently shifted

toward isolationism as dramatically as alarmists fear. It has almost always

been best described as 'open, but fair," with injury to import competitors being

the measure of "fairness."

   U.S. import relief policy is perhaps of greater interest to East and

Southeast Asian nations than any other aspect of U.S. trade policy, since

it is in U.S. imports from the region that the most dramatic growth has taken

place. U.S. import relief policy also shows great consistency, although dif-

ferent vehicles for delivering it have been selected at different times from

among the escape clause, unfair trade remedies, adjustment assistance, and

orderly marketing agreements. For the first two vehicles, different mixes of

tariff and non—tariff instruments have been employed at various times also.

The choice of tariff or non—tariff instrument has importance because it

affects the complexity and predictability of U.S. trade policy, and because it

determines the division of implicit revenues between the U.S. and its export

suppliers.

    The general consistency of U.S. trade policy over time is all the more

remarkable given the frequent change of political party in power, especially

in the executive branch, but also in the Congress. Party affiliation, in fact,

seems no longer to be a useful predictor of U.S. trade initiative. A more use-

ful predictor appears to be some measure of Executive versus Congressional

control. The two branches of U.S. government have, different outlooks on trade

policy due to differences In constituencies. Conflict has punctuated relations

between branches of government much more often than between political parties.

Platform attempts by parties to distinguish themselves from each other on trade

policy turn out more often than not to be sheer posturing.

   U.S. trade policy leadership is still potentially strong despite the decline

in U.S. hegemony. It is clearly strong in a protectionist direction. Any

shift in U.S. trade policy toward aggressive insularity justifies parallel

trade—policy aggression in the eyes of its trading partners. It is
                                      5



arguably strong in a liberalizing direction as well. The U.S. seems ideally

poised for aggressive trade—policy peacemaking; perhaps multilaterally, but

perhaps also bilaterally; perhaps with its traditional industrial trading part-

ners, but perhaps also with Japan and newly industrializing Asian countries

that play so important a role in U.S. trade, and that, on many matters, may be

closer In spirit to U.S. economic philosophy than Europe, Canada, or Latin

America.


                      2. U.S. TRADE POLICY, 1945_19802



Gaining Domestic Support For a Liberal International Trading Regime

    Well before the end of World War II the foreign policy leaders of the

Democratic party had concluded that the lack of an open world economy during

the 1930s was a major contributory cause of the war (Gardner (1980)).

They had also concluded that the United States must take the lead after the

end of hostilities in establishing an open international trading system in

order to make "the economic foundations of peace...as secure as the political

foundation" (from a March 26, 1945 statement to Congress by President

Roosevelt). Thus, even before the War had ended the Roosevelt Administration

had drafted a proposal for a multilateral trade organization. It had also

requested substantial new tariff—reducing powers from Congress.

    A desire on the part of political leaders for a new international regime

is quite different from actually bringing about such a change, especially

when——as in this case——there was a lack of strong direct pressure for the

change from either the country's electorate or other governments. The
                                      6



most important reason for the success of the Democratic leadership in first

gaining and then maintaining domestic support for a liberal posture was the

hegemonic trade and payments position that the United States assumed in the

immediate postwar period.3 The United States emerged from World War II with its

economic base greatly expanded, while the economic structures of both its ene-

mies and industrial allies were in ruins. Except for Great Britain's position

at the outset of the Industrial revolution, economic dominance of this extent is

unique in the history of the industrial nations. Even as late as 1952 the U.S.

share of total exports of the ten most important industrial countries was 35

percent, whereas it had been only 26 and 28 percent in 1938 and 1928, respec-

tively (Baldwin (1958)). The 1952 U.S. export share of manufactures was also

35 percent In contrast to only 21 percent in both 1938 and 1928. There was an

export surplus in every major industrial group. These abnormally favorable

export opportunities, together with the vigorous postwar economic recovery,

vitiated protectionist pressure from industries whose underlying comparative

cost position was deteriorating, and built support for liberal trade policies on

the part of those sectors whose international competitive position was strong.

    The ability of U.S. leaders to obtain domestic support for trade

liberalization was further enhanced by the emergence of the Cold War in the

late l940s. The public generally accepted the governmental view that the

Communist countries represented a serious economic and political threat to

the United States, Its allies, and the rest of the market—oriented economic

world. There was thus widespread support for the argument that the United

States should mount a vigorous program of trying to offset the Communist

threat by providing not only military aid to friendly nations but assistance

in the form of economic grants and lower U.S. tariffs.

    The fact that implementing an open international trading system did

not involve any significant new increase in the powers of the President

also was important in gaining domestic support for the regime change. Almost

all commentators had regarded as excessive the use of logrolling during enact-

ment of the Smoot—Hawley Tariff of 1930. This, coupled with the sense of crisis

created by the Depression that followed shortly thereafter, had led Congress in

1934 to give the President authority to lower (or raise) tariffs by up to 50

perceuc.

authorization in order to enable the United States to take a leadership role in

international trade liberalization did not entail any basic changes in existing

Presidential powers.

    There was still considerable opposition to trade liberalization in

the immediate postwar period, however. As in the 1930s a long list of

industries testified during the 1940s and l950s against giving the President

the power to cut duties on imports competing with domestically produced goods.

The products covered include textiles and apparel, coal, petroleum, watches,

bicycles, pottery and tiles, toys, cutlery, ball bearings, glass, cheese, lead

and zinc, copper, leather, and umbrellas. Pressures from these industries to

halt further tariff—cutting because of their belief that they would be

seriously injured were further strengthened by the opposition of many

Republicans to liberalization on doctrinaire grounds. Republican advocacy of

protection on the grounds that this policy promoted domestic economic develop—

nient had an even longer tradition than the Democratic position in favor of

liberalization, based on the belief that low   tariffs   reduced monopoly profits

and the prices of popular consumer goods.
                                      8



   From the outset of the trade agreements program, the Roosevelt

Administration assured Congress that no duty cuts would be made that

seriously injured any domestic industry. However, in 1945 the Administration

recognized the possibility that such injury might occur by agreeing to include

in all future trade agreements an escape clause permitting the modification or

withdrawal of tariff reductions if increased imports resulting from a con-

cession caused or threatened to cause serious injury to an industry.

Furthermore, under prodding from Republican members of Congress, President

Truman in 1947 issued an executive order establishing formal procedures for

escape clause actions whereby the International Trade Commission (ITC) would

advise the President whether such a modification was warranted.4

    These developments indicate that the U.S. trade—policy commitment at

the beginning of the postwar period was to a policy of liberal trade rather

than to a policy of free trade. It was recognized at the outset that protec-

tion to particular industries would be permitted if these sectors would other-

wise be seriously injured by increased imports.

    The failure of the U.S. Congress to ratify the International Trade

Organization (ITO) proposed in the Havana Conference of 1947—48, or even

to approve to General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (the commercial

policy provisions of the ITO) as an executive agreement, is another indication

of the early concerns of domestic political interests for import—sensitive

U.S. industries (Diebold (1952)). Among other concerns, Congress was fearful

that establishing a strong international organization to deal with trade

matters would lead to the destruction of many U.S. industries as a result of

increased imports. Numerous members of Congress and some of the groups they

represented were also concerned about the increase in Presidential power that
                                     9



the approval of such an organization might involve. They believed that the

division of political powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial

Oranches of government had shifted excessively In favor of the executive

branch as a result of the unusual problems created by the Depression and World

War II and were, consequently, reluctant to extend new authority to the

President, especially in an area specifically reserved for Congress under the

Constitution.



Gaining International Support for a Liberal International Trading Regime

   The implementation of the change from an inward—looking to an open inter-

national trading regime required the support of other countries as well as of

the U.S. electorate. The hegemonic model is the major explanation put forth

by political scientists to account for this support. The reasoning behind

this model is as follows.

   An open international trading (and payments) system has elements of a

public good. For example, adopting a mercantilistic viewpoint, if one country

reduces its tariffs under the most—favored—nation principle, other countries

benefit from the improved export opportunities this action creates even if

they do not make reciprocal duty cuts themselves. Consequently, there is an

incentive for any individual country to "free—ride" by hoping that others will

reduce their own trade barriers. The net result may often be failure to

secure a balanced, multilateral set of duty reductions even though they would

benefit all participants. But as Olson (1965) and other writers on collective

goods have pointed out, it is less likely that the public good will be

underproduced if one member of the concerned group is very large compared to the

others. The dominant member is so large that the cost to it of free
                                      10


rides by other members is small compared to its own gain. Furthermore, the

large member may be able to use its power to force smaller members to practice

reciprocity. Proponents of the hegemonic theory of regime—change point to the

dominant trading position of Great Britain in the nineteenth century to

account for the creation of an open world trading regime then.

    In parallel fashion, in the immediate postwar period the United States was

willing and able to bear most of the costs of establishing a liberal inter-

national economic order (Vernon (1983, pp. 8—10)). The other major industrial

countries were plagued by balance—of—payments problems and rationed their meager

suppliers of dollars in order to maximize their reconstruction efforts. The

tariff concessions they made in the early multilateral negotiations were not

very meaningful in terms of increasing U.S. exports. U.S. negotiators were

fully aware of this point. They nevertheless offered greater tariff concessions

than they received even on the basis of the usual measures of reciprocity (Meyer

(1978, p. 138)). In effect what the United States did was to redistribute to

other countries part of the economic surplus reaped from its unusually favorable

export opportunities in order to enable those countries to support the

establishment of an open trading regime.



Shifts in Domestic Support for Liberalization

    When the Republicans gained both the Presidency and control of Congress

in 1952, some commentators expected a return to traditional protectionist

policies. However, President Eisenhower and his main advisors believed that

trade liberalization was an important foreign policy instrument, and

Republican business leaders——especially those in the large corporations——also

concluded that a liberal trading order was desirable from their own economic
                                      11



viewpoint. Thus, after a standoff period in 1953 and 1954 during which

protectionist Republicans in the House blocked any further tariff—cutting, the

liberalization trend was renewed. In 1955, with the help of a Democratic

Congress, President Eisenhower succeeded in obtaining a further 15 percent duty—

cutting authority. In 1958 he was granted an additional 20 percent duty—cutting

authority.

    Just as more and more Republicans came to accept the desirability of a

lIberal trade polIcy as a general princIple, more and more Democrats began to

press for special exceptions to this principle. In the late 1940s, the

industries requesting import protection tended to be economically and politi-

cally small. By the mid—1950s, the politically powerful cotton textile, coal,

and domestic petroleum Industries, whose employees tended to vote Democratic,

were asking for protection. In 1955 the Eisenhower Administration, as part of

its efforts to obtain the support of the Democrats for its liberalization

efforts, pressured the Japanese into voluntarily restricting their exports of

cotton textiles to the United States. In 1962 President Kennedy agreed to

negotiate an international agreement permitting quantitative import restric-

tions on cotton textiles as part of his efforts to gain the support of

Southern Democrats from textile areas for the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

The coal and oil industries succeeded in obtaining a national security clause

in the 1955 trade act that permitted quantitative import restrictions If

imports of a product threatened "to impair" the national security. Voluntary

oil import quotas were introduced on these grounds in 1958 and made mandatory

in 1959.

   The most significant change in the nature of support for protectionism

occurred in the late l960s when the AFL—CIO abandoned its long—held belief
                                      12


in the desirability of a liberal trade policy and supported a general quota

bill. The shift in labor's position was related to several developments. One

was the rapid rise in import penetration ratios (and thus a rapid rise in

competitive pressures) that occurred in many manufacturing sectors in the late

1960g. Another was labor's disappointment with the operation of the Trade

Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

    As would be expected, this change in organized labor's position was

reflected in the trade—policy votes of Democratic members of Congress.

Several protectionist initiatives progressed quite far in Congress during this

period and created great uncertainty regarding the direction of U.S. trade

policy. It is doubtful, furthermore, that the Trade Act of 1974 would have

been approved had not the President made concessions to both organized labor

and particular industries subject to import pressure. The criteria for

obtaining adjustment assistance were made much easier to meet labor's objec-

tions, and the multilateral arrangement on textiles was extended to cover tex-

tile and apparel products manufactured from man—made material and wool as well

as cotton. In addition, the voluntary export restraints agreed upon in 1968

by Japanese and European steel producers were extended in the early 1970s.

    Although the pattern of Congressional voting on trade—policy measures in

the early 1970s shows that Republicans favored and Democrats opposed

liberalization, it is probably not correct to conclude that this represents

a permanent shift in party positions. A more accurate description of what

seems to have happened is that liberalization versus protectionism is no

longer a significant party issue. The vote of individual members of Congress

on trade policy is now more influenced by economic conditions in their
                                                          13


district or state and by the pressures on them from the President (if they are

both in the same party) rather than by party affiliation. Regression analysis

of the voting pattern on the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and the Trade Act of

1974 (Baldwin (1976, 1981)) indicates that party affiliation was significant in

1962 but not in 1974.

felt that the President was too willing to reduce tariffs in import

sensitive sectors and——along with the International Trade Coinmission—--too

reluctant to raise them for import—injured industries. Furthermore, they

believed that the executive branch was not sufficiently "tough" in administer-

ing U.S. laws dealing with the fairness of international trading practices.

Consequently, Congress frequently took the occasion of the program's renewal

to introduce provisions designed to force the President and the ITC to comply

more closely with these Congressional views. Much of the pressure for these

provisions came from import—sensitive domestic industries and labor groups.

However, some of the pressure seemed to stem from a belief that Congress had

given the President too much of its constitutional responsibility "to regulate

commerce with foreign nations" and to levy import duties.

    In the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Congress insisted on shifting the chair-

manship of the interagency committee established to recommend tariff cuts to the

President from the State Department (long regarded by Congress as being insuf-

ficiently sensitive to the import—injury problems of U.S. industry) to a new

agency, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The

requirement of the Trade Act of 1974 that an elaborate private advisory system
                                       14



be established has further restricted the degree of independence that the

President has in selecting items on which cuts are to be made and in deter-

mining the depth of these cuts. The creation and subsequent strengthening of

congressional delegations to trade negotiations under the 1962 and 1974 laws has

had the same effect. Since 1954, the President has been specifically directed

not to decrease duties on any article if he finds that doing so would threaten

to impair the national security. Furthermore, in granting the President

authority in 1974 to permit duty—free imports from developing countries,

Congress specifically excluded certain articles, e.g., watches and footwear,

from preferential tariff treatment.

    Congress tried to pressure the President into accepting the affirmative

recommendations of the ITC on escape—clause cases when this provision was

first introduced into law in 1951 by requiring the President to submit an

explanatory report to Congress if these recommendations were rejected. Since

this seemed to have little effect on the President, Congress included a provi-

sion in the 1958 renewal act that enabled the President's disapproval of

any affirmative ITC finding to be overridden by a two—thirds vote of both the

House and Senate. This was eased in 1962 to a majority of the authorized mem-

bership of both houses and then in 1974 to only a majority of members present

and voting.

    Congress has also included numerous provisions in post—war trade laws

to increase the proportion of affirmative import—relief decisions on the part

of the ITC. The most obvious way of trying to accomplish this has been to

change the criteria for granting increases in protection when an industry is

threatened with or is actually being seriously injured because of increased

imports. For example, the requirement that increased imports be related to
                                      15




a previously granted tariff concession was eliminated in 1974.

Less obvious ways that Congress used in trying to make the ITC more responsive

to its views included utilizing its confirmation powers to try to ensure that

Commission members were sympathetic to its views (Baldwin (1984)). In a

further effort to weaken the influence of the President over the Commission,

Congress in 1974 removed all controls of the executive branch over the

Commission's budget and eliminated the power of the President to appoint the

chairperson. This latter change was modified in 1977 but the President still

cannot appoint his two most recent appointees as chairperson.

    Similar steps were taken by Congress to try to ensure stricter enforcement

of U.S. trade laws relating to unfair foreign practices. For example, for

many years many members of Congress felt that the Treasury Department was too

lax in administering U.S. antidumping and countervailing—duty legislation.

One step designed to change this was to transfer the determination of injury

(but not the determination of dumping) from the Treasury Department to the

ITC in 1954. In 1979, Congress completely removed the authority to determine

dumping and subsidization from the Treasury and gave these powers to the

Commerce Department——an agency that it believed would carry out the intent of

Congress more closely.

    Perhaps the most significant reduction in the President's authority

over trade policy concerns.his ability to negotiate agreements with other

countries covering nontariff measures. When Congress directed the President

to seek such agreements under the Trade Act of 1974, it stipulated that any

agreements must be approved by a majority vote in both the House and

Senate——unlike tariff agreements. This provision was extended in the Trade
                                      16


Agreements Act of 1979. It gives Congress much greater control over the

nature of any agreement, and increases its control over the pattern of tariff

cuts undertaken by the President in a multilateral trade negotiation, since

tariff and non—tariff concessions made by participants are closely linked.

These constraints notwithstanding, Congress fully supported the efforts of the

President to negotiate new non—tariff codes in the Tokyo Round, and the set of

codes eventually agreed upon were approved without difficulty by the Congress.



Non—tariff Instruments of U.S. Trade Policy

    Efforts increased during the 1970's to negotiate agreements that would

mitigate the adverse effects of foreign non—tariff barriers (NTBs). U.S. produ-

cers were pressuring government officials for the stricter enforcement of

existing U.S. "fair trade" legislation such as the antidumping and counter-

vailing laws, and were seeking import protection under these laws to a greater

extent than in the past.6   Furthermore, domestic industries were demanding the

greater use of quantitative restrictions (as compared to higher import duties)

in protecting against injurious import increases.

    One factor accounting for the greater number of less—than—fair—value cases

has been the difficulty of obtaining protection by the traditional provisions

pertaining to injury caused by import competition. Despite the 1974 easing of

the criteria for determining whether import relief should be granted, only

38 cases were decided by the ITC between 1975 and 1979 and in all but 19 of

these a negative decision was reached. Furthermore, the President rejected

import protection in all but 7 of the 19 cases. The likelihood that the

routine acceptance of affirmative ITC decisions would be interpreted by

foreign governments as an abandonment of U.S. international economic leadership
                                      17



appears to have made the President willing to accept only a few of these deci-

sions. Even the Congress has been hesitant on similar grounds to weaken the

import—relief criteria much beyond what they had been in the 1950s.

    Providing protection to offset alleged unfair trade practices is much

less likely to be interpreted as representing a basic shift in policy either

by other governments or by domestic interests supporting a liberal trading

order. Thus, within reasonable bounds a President can support efforts to

achieve f air trade" through measures that protect domestic products while

still being regarded as a proponent of liberal trade policies.

    A better understanding of this point has given domestic industries an

incentive to utilize U.S. fair trade legislation more extensively in seeking

import protection. The incentive has been further increased by legislative

and administrative changes in this area. Congress, though diluting the

President's power to reduce trade barriers and to set aside ITC decisions, has

at the same time given him new authority to limit imports on fairness grounds.

The 1922 and 1930 tariff acts granted the president the authority to impose new

or additional duties on imports (or even to exclude imports) from countries that

impose unreasonable regulations on U.S. products or discriminate against U.S.

commerce. The 1962 trade act further directed the President to take all

appropriate and feasible steps to eliminate "unjustifiable" foreign import

restrictions, and to suspend or withdraw previously granted concessions where

other countries maintain trade restrictions that "substantially burden" U.S.

commerce or engage in discriminating acts. The Trade Act of 1974 restates these

provisions and also gives the president the authority to take similar actions in

response to
                                        18




          "subsidies (or other incentives having the effect of
          subsidies) on its [a foreign country's] exports ... to
          the United States or to other foreign markets which have
          the effect of substantially reducing sales of the
          competitive United States product or products in the
          United States or in foreign markets"

and

          "unjustifiable or unreasonable restrictions on access to
          supplies of food, raw materials, or manufactured or semi—
          manufactured products which burden or restrict United
          States commerce".


In amending this provision, the 1979 trade act stressed the President's

responsibility for enforcing U.S. rights under any trade agreement and

simplified the list of foreign practices against which he is directed to take

action.

      Another legislative change that encouraged the use of fair trade

legislation to gain protection was the extension of the definition of

dumping in the Trade Act of 1974. Dumping was declared to encompass not

only sales abroad at lower prices than charged at home but also sales of

substantial quantities below cost over an extended period (even if domestic

and foreign prices are the same). In 1977 the steel industry filed dumping

charges covering nearly $1 billion of steel imports from Japan, all the major

industrial countries, and India under this provision. As Finger et al. (1982)

point out, fair trade cases of this magnitude in such a key sector attract so

much political opposition (both domestic and foreign) that they cannot be

disposed of at the technical level, and consequently spill over into the politi-

cal arena. In this instance, the steel industry was successful in convincing

President Carter that their claims were justified, and the so—called trigger—

price system was worked out as an alternative to pursuing the anti—dumping
                                       19



charges to the final stage.

    A similarly political solution was reached in 1982 when the steel industry

filed charges that European steel producers were receiving extensive sub-

sidies, and therefore should be subject to countervailing duties. The

possibility of countervailing duties had such significant economic and politi-

cal implications that the governments of the parties involved did not wish the

matter to be settled on technical grounds and sought a solution at the politi-

cal level. Eventually the Europeans agreed to voluntary export restraints on

a wide range of steel products to the United States.

    Other important U.S. sectors have been protected in recent years by

nontariff barriers. They include the footwear, television, and auto industries.

Voluntary export restraints were negotiated by the President in the first two

cases after affirmative injury findings by the ITC. Although the ITC rejected

the auto industry's petition for import relief, the industry was nevertheless

successful in persuading the Administration of the need for impott controls,

and the Japanese eventually agreed to restrict their sales to the United

States.

    The increased use of nontariff trade—distorting measures has weakened the

liberal thrust of U.S. trade policy. This is true not only because NTBs

represent a move toward protectionism but because most of them have been

applied in a discriminatory manner and are negotiated outside of the CATT fra-

mework. Some of the political decisions reached at the Presidential level

have also occurred without the opportunity for all interested parties to be

heard, as would be the case if a technical route such as an import—injury

petition before the ITC was being followed, or even if a political route at

the Congressional level was being pursued.

                       3. U.S. TRADE POLICY UNDER THE
                           REAGAN ADMINISTRATION7


    President Reagan took office with an unusually well—defined set of

domestic and international policy objectives, and his vigorous efforts to

implement them have significantly affected certain aspects of U.S. trade

policy over the last three years. As often happens, however, conflicts and

unexpected interactions among policy goals, difficult—to—resist domestic and

international political pressures, and unforeseen events have combined to pro-

duce actual trade policies that only imperfectly reflect the administration's

initial objectives. On an overall assessment, trade policy under the Reagan

administration has been perhaps only somewhat more liberal than that of previous

Republican and Democratic administrations.


The Administration's Trade Policy Objectives and Their Relation to Its
Other Goals

   Although all post—World War II presidents have supported the market

system, none has been as firm   in his   belief in its economic efficacy as

President Reagan. The administration's stance on trade issues was officially

set forth by the United States Trade Representative, William Brock, before the

Senate Finance Committee in July 1981. In this "Statement on U.S. Trade

Policy Ambassador Brock maintained that liberal trade is essential to the pur-

suit of the goal of a strong U.S. economy. At the same time, however, he empha-

sized that the Reagan administration would strictly enforce U.S. laws and

international agreements relating to such unfair practices as foreign dumping

and government subsidization.
                                        21




     An important implication of the market approach is that when other nations

 "have a natural competitive advantage, U.S. industry must either find a way of

upgrading its own capabilities or shift its resources to other activities".

Primary reliance was to be placed on market forces rather than on adjustment

assistance or safeguard measures to facilitate adjustment in affected

industries. With respect to export—credit subsidies, the objective was "to

substantially reduce, if not eliminate, the subsidy element, and to conform cre-

dit rates to market rates". Along with cutting back on measures that artif i—

cially stimulate exports, the administration pledged to reduce or eliminate laws

and regulations that needlessly retard exports. Three types of policies with

export—disincentive effects were singled out: the taxation of Americans

employed abroad, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,   and export regulations and
controls.

    Several negotiating initiatives were outlined in the paper. Most signifi-

cant were those aimed at reducing government barriers and subsidies to services

that are internationally traded, and at negotiating new international rules

dealing with trade—related investment issues (export performance and local

content requirements) and government interventions that affect trade in high

technology products.

    With regard to developing countries, the stated goal was to ensure that

the more advanced developing countries undertake greater trade obligations and

that the benefits of differential trade treatment go increasingly to the

poorer members of this group. Efforts to encourage greater conformity on the

part of nonmarket economies with accepted principles of the international

trading system were also promised.

    The Reagan administration expected its macroeconomic policies to
                                       22




facilitate the implementation of its trade policies. The reverse was in fact

the case. The basic reason was the failure to stimulate strong real rates

of growth. Money remained tight; favorable supply—side effects of fiscal

policy were insignificant; interest rates rose, then fell much more sluggishly

than expected; and the dollar appreciated to near—record levels. The failure

of interest rates to fall as much as expected is usually attributed to very

high current and prospective government deficits related to high levels of

defense spending, an inability to control spending on social programs, and the

relatively lower tax revenues associated with the cut in tax rates. Interest—

rate developments put upward pressure on the dollar as did, apparently, poli-

tical and economic uncertainties in many countries, which increased the

dollar's attractiveness for safekeeping purposes.

   The real appreciation of the dollar has had a significantly adverse effect

on both U.S. export and import—competing industries. Exporters have found It

increasingly difficult to compete abroad with foreign producers, and import—

sensitive sectors have had to contend with both the sales—depressing effects

of the recession and increased import pressures as U.S. purchasers shift to

cheaper foreign products. The U.S. trade deficit has significantly worsened.

Export industries have also been hurt by the effects of the debt crisis in a

number of developing countries. As the recession spread abroad and the volume

of world trade declined, those countries that had borrowed abroad heavily in

the latter part of the 1970s found themselves in a situation where their

exports were falling at the same time that their debt burden had risen because

of high international interest rates. The restrictive monetary and fiscal

policies imposed on these countries by the International Monetary Fund as the
                                       23



price for agreeing to a rescheduling of their debt payments then had the effect

of curtailing their imports and further compounding the export problems of U.S.

industries.




Export—Promoting Policies

    The adverse effect of the overvalued dollar and the debt crisis on

U.S. exporters appear to have been important factors in causing the Reagan

administration to modify its skeptical views on export—promoting policies.

Under considerable prodding from Congress, the administration reversed

its early intentions to reduce activities of the Export—Import Bank and to

repeal legislation allowing Domestic International Sales Corporations

(DISCs). In 1983 the administration requested Congress to increase the

loan guarantee authority of the Export—Import Bank, and also to provide the

Bank with a sizable standby fund to match the export—financing activities of

other countries. Furthermore, instead of scrapping DISCs, the executive

branch has drafted new legislation that will provide the same tax benefits for

exporters, yet be consistent with GATT rules.

     The administration has delivered on most of its promises to reduce

self—imposed export disincentives. The 1981 tax act eased the U.S. tax

burden on Americans residing abroad for at least 11 out of 12 months. In the

fall of 1982 Congress passed and the President signed the Export Trading

Company Act. This important legislation permits bank holding companies and

certain types of banks to take an equity interest in export trading companies,

and also permits a partial exemption from the antitrust laws for specified

export activities that do not substantially lessen competition within the

United States.
                                       24



    Another export—promoting measure proposed by the administration is the

Business Accounting and Foreign Trade Simplification Act,   which modifies certain
provisions in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. Advocates of the

changes claim that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has brought about a

situation where American businessmen often do not even bother to compete

abroad for contracts, for fear that payments regarded as legal and customary in

foreign countries will be regarded as illegal under U.S. law. (Krause (1982,

pp. 82—84) discusses these effects in the context on ASEAN countries.) As one

example of the type of change being proposed, the new act stipulates that a

U.S. firm would be liable under the law only if it "directs or authorizes,

expressedly or by course of conduct" that an illegal payment be made by its

foreign agent instead of being liable, as under the 1977 act, simply because

it had "reason to know" such a payment was being made. The revised measure

also explicitly permits payments to officials of foreign governments that are

lawful under the local law and payments aimed at expediting or securing the

performance of routine official action. The Senate passed the bill in 1982

but opposition to it has developed in the House.


Import Relief Policy

    Most of the Reagan administration's import relief policies have been shaped

by a complex mixture of free trade ideology, practical politics, and unan-

ticipated events. On the basis of its Statement of Trade Policy, one would have

expected the administration to follow a very tough stance against import protec-

tion. However, on the surface at least, the administration's actual performance

in granting import relief does not seem to differ significantly from the varied

record of other recent administrations.
                                       25



    In 1981, for example, the administration pressured the Japanese into volun-

tarily limiting their exports of autos to the United States, even though the

International Trade Commission had earlier rejected the industry's petition for

import relief. In the same year the President reintroduced sugar quotas and

supported an extension and tightening of the Multifiber Arrangement. More

recently, he accepted the affirmative import injury determinations of the ITC in

the motorcycles and specialty steel cases. Duties were sharply raised on cer-

tain imported motorcycles and a combination of increased import duties and

quotas was used to restrict imports of specialty steel items.

    In contrast, on the side of liberal trade policy actions, the President per-

mitted the 1981 expiration of Orderly Marketing Agreements on nonrubber footwear

with Korea and Taiwan, despite an ITC recommendation that the Taiwanese

agreement be extended for another two years. Furthermore, he has actively

opposed "domestic content" legislation covering the automotive industry.

    One policy to deal with increased competition on which there is a clear dif-

ference in performance between this and other recent administrations is trade

adjustment assistance for workers. Prompted not only by a desire to reduce

government intervention in the adjustment process but by the goal of reducing

inflationary pressures by cutting government expenditures, the administration

secured new legislation in 1981 that sharply curtailed the Trade Adjustment

Assistance (TAA) program. It introduced more stringent qualifying require-

ments and reduced financial benefits. Legislation in 1982 again restored the

qualifying requirements of the 1974 Trade Act, but the Labor Department has

interpreted the criteria in a strict manner so that the program still remains

small. The administration has proposed a "voucher" system whereby workers

displaced for whatever reason would search for suitable education or training
                                       26



and use vouchers issued to them by the government to pay for employer on—the—

job training or for the costs of training at various schools.

    It can be argued that the Reagan administration's overall import relief

record is a reasonably liberal one. In speculating about what another admi-

nistration might have done under similar circumstances, it should be stressed

that today even a strong president shares policymaking powers in the trade

field with Congress, as outlined above. Congress is much more responsive

to the immediate economic problems of various industries and groups than the

executive branch. Consider, for example, the auto case. In early 1981

Congress held hearings to publicize the plight of the industry and Senator

Danforth, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Trade of the

Senate Finance Committee, introduced a bill that would have imposed quan-

titative restrictions on Japanese auto imports. He and his colleagues pre-

ferred the President to negotiate a voluntary export restraint agreement with

Japan, but apparently were prepared to push the bill through Congress (with

little opposition expected) unless such an agreement was reached. Faced with

this prospect and the fact that he had made a campaign speech arguing for a

cutback in exports by the Japanese, the President eventually put pressure on

the Japanese government for voluntary export restraints. The President might

have held to a strong liberal trade position and threatened to veto any restric-

tive bill emerging from Congress, but it would have been politically difficult

to do so in view of his own stated position and the generally recognized fact

that increased Japanese imports were an important cause of injury in this poli-

tically powerful industry.

    The failure to follow the ITC's recommendation to extend footwear quotas

against Taiwan was probably a consequence of the President's decision on autos,
                                       27


as Cohen and Neltzer (1982, p. 111) point out. The administration feared that

approval of the ITC recommendation would send an undesirable protectionist

signal to the rest of the world. Moreover, from a domestic political viewpoint

the fact that the footwear industry is much less politically powerful than the

auto, steel, or textile industries, and had already been given five years of

import protection, made it much easier to reject the recommendation.

    The proposed domestic—content legislation for the auto industry presents

still a different set of circumstances for the President. This legislation is

clearly inconsistent with the trading rules of the GATT and is likely to lead to

an outpouring of protectionist charges by other countries as well as retaliation

against U.S. exports. The U.S. would jeopardize its traditional role as the

international leader of a liberal international trading order. Domestic politi-

cal support —— even within the auto industry ——   is   also not nearly as strong as

in the Japanese voluntary—export—restraint case, especially as auto sales pick

up in response to economic recovery. Thus, the President is able to adopt a

much stronger liberal trade position without high political costs.

    Finally, the Administration's policy position during the international

negotiations in the fall of 1981 on the renewal of the Multifiber Arrangement

further illustrates the complexity of trade—policy decisions. The President had

previously expressed sympathy for the view that textile imports should only

expand at the same rate as the domestic market. He also needed the support of

members of Congress from southern textile districts to pass the budgetary

changes he proposed, and which he viewed as more important than import policy

with regard to textiles. Moreover, the European Community (EC) strongly favored

a more restrictive international agreement, and it would have been difficult to

oppose their position.

In Pursuit of "Fair Trade"

    While there is scope for disagreement concerning just how liberal the

Reagan's administration's import relief record is compared with that of other

administrations, there seems little doubt that the current administration

has pursued the goal of "fair trade more vigorously than any previous adinin—

istration. Two efforts in this regard are especially noteworthy for Asian

trade: the enforcement of existing U.S. fair trade laws, and the opening of

the Japanese market to a greater extent. (For Europe the major U.S.

initiative against unfair trade practices has been the attempt to reduce EC

agricultural subsidies.)

    The main push for stricter enforcement of U.S. laws relating to dumping,

subsidization, patent infringements, and unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discri-

minatory foreign trade actions has come from Congress over the last several

years, as outlined above. It was due to Congressional initiative that the

enforcement of the fair trade laws was transferred in 1979 from the Treasury

Department to the Commerce Department. However, the Reagan administration has

had ample incentive for its own initiative on this front.

    The initiation by the Commerce Department of a countervailing duty investi-

gation into certain steel exports by six European countries is a good example of

the administration's aggressive stance toward unfair trade practices. The case

was significant for the large volume of trade involved, for the fact that it was

the first time that the government had initiated such an investigation, and for

the careful manner in which the Commerce Department tried to measure the sub—

s idies.

    The case was settled, hever, not by imposing countervailing duties equal

to the subsidies, as provided by the law, but by an agreement with the
                                       29



subsidizing European Community countries. The agreement quantitatively limited

the majority of EC steel mill exports to the United States for a 3—year

period. It is surprising that an administration committed to "free but fair"

trade settled its major fair trade case with an arrangement that was not care-

fully designed to just offset the alleged subsidies and is regarded as the

worst form of protection by liberal traders.

    There has also been a greater use of section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974,

which deals with unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discriminatory trade prac-

tices by foreign countries. Prior to 1981, only 3 presidential determinations

supporting the petitioners had been made, whereas in 1981 and 1982 there were

5 such determinations.   Furthermore, at the urging of Congress the Reagan

administration has agreed to a strengthening of section 301's provisions.

Specifically, the administration supports an amendment that would explicitly

extend the president's authority to retaliate against unfair practices

affecting trade in services and foreign direct investment.8

    A case brought by Houdaille Industries in May 1982 under section 103 of the

Revenue Act of 1971 further illustrates the increased concern with unfair trade

practices. This law permits the President to deny investment tax credit on

imported goods if the exporting country "engages in discriminatory or other acts

(including tolerance of international cartels) or policies unjustifiably

restricting United States commerce." Houdaille requested indefinite suspension

of the investment tax credit on certain numerically controlled machines imported

from Japan, on the grounds that the Japanese government had for many years

fostered and encouraged a cartel among its domestic machine tool manufacturers,

which had given them an unfair advantage. Although the Senate passed a
                                       30



resolution urging prompt retaliation, after a 10—month investigation the admin-

istration denied the request. However, at the same time, it announced that

the U.S. and Japanese governments would hold talks on the issue and that there

may be future action on the matter.

    A second area where administration officials have vigorously pushed the

notion of fairness relates to U.S.—Japanese trade more generally. There is no

other trade topic that generates more heated discussion in Congress and within

the administration than the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. This deficit

increased from $7 billion to $18 billion between 1979 and 1982. It has become

standard doctrine in parts of the government to attribute much of the deficit to

unfair trading practices on the part of the Japanese. On the export side these

allegedly take the form of industrial targeting —— a practice whereby the

Japanese government selects certain product lines for export emphasis and then

facilitates their development by coordinating research, by helping firms secure

low—cost finance, by encouraging specialization among potential competitors, by

providing marketing assistance, etc. On the import side, it is claimed that the

unfair use of such nontariff measures as standards certification procedures,

customs procedures, preferential government purchasing policies, and discrimina-

tory distribution arrangements exclude a significant volume of U.S. goods from

the Japanese market. (The average level of industrial tariffs in Japan is only

about 3 percent, a figure lower than that for the U.S. or the EC.)

    Since the fall of 1981 top administration officials including the President

himself have pressed the Japanese to remove these unfair barriers, as well as to

enlarge agricultural quotas and reduce tariff rates still further. Some success

has been achieved along these lines but there is still widespread dissatisfaction

with Japan's response. The reciprocity bill insisted upon by Congress is
                                       31



largely a manifestation of this dissatisfaction. Recently, trade officials

have begun to focus more closely on the industrial targeting practices of

Japan. It is quite possible that the U.S. will take some form of trade policy

actions to offset the effects of these practices.

    The soundness of the case against Japan is difficult to determine. On the

one hand, U.S. firms have documented numerous instances of practices that seem to

restrict U.S. exports to Japan unfairly. More and more is also becoming known

about the export—promoting policies of the Japanese government. On the other

hand, an increase in the trade deficit for this reason would have required an

increase in unfair practices, and there seems little evidence of increased

unfairness. Writers such as Saxonhouse (1982) and even the President's own

Council of Economic Advisors (United States (1983)) have further argued that

Japan's trade pattern (a significant trade surplus for manufactured goods, more

than balanced by a significant trade deficit for primary products) is con-

sistent with the country's human and physical resource endowments. While

the Council of Economic Advisors believes that major trade liberalization by

Japan would do much to relieve the political strains between the two

countries, they state that "Japanese trade policy does not play a central role

in causing the bilateral imbalance with the United States" (p. 56).



                            4. THE KEY QUESTtON:
                        HOW MUCH OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S.
                          TRADE POLICY LEADERSHIP?9



The General Issue

    U.S. trade policy since World War II has enjoyed unique liberties and

been subject to unique limitations. It has enjoyed the early postwar liberty
                                       32



of serving international and national security goals without unduly serious

domestic consequences. Those goals remain, with universal expectations that the

U.S. will design trade policy at least in part to attain them. The expectations

have, however, recently become a unique limitation on U.S. trade policy, which

is increasingly subject to familiar domestic political pressures.

   U.S. trade policy has always served two masters, a domestic and a foreign

constituency. U.S. leadership has become more difficult in recent years as

the relative strength of the domestic constituency has grown. Some have

described this as the "domestication" of U.S. trade policy. "Domestication

causes tensions especially for a U.S. President, whose trade initiatives must

somehow continue to serve both masters. Congress has become, by contrast,

much more narrowly focussed. Ahearn and Reifman (1983) comment on "its con-

tinuing disinclination to sacrifice U.S. commercial interests for foreign—

policy objectives."

    Because of both domestic and foreign constituencies, no modern U.S. presi-

dent feels able to promote openly a general policy of import protection. The

United States is still viewed by the other major industrial nations as the

leader of the liberal international trading order. These countries still

basically support this regime and believe that if the United States adopts

general protectionism, it will rapidly spread throughout the trading world

along with beggar—thy—neighbor exchange—rate policies. It is a widely

accepted view that the result of this collapse of the existing trade and

financial order would be extensive job losses in export sectors and massive

financial losses in industries with export and foreign direct investment

interests. Because of the great political and economic power of these

sectors, together with the considerable pressures foreign constituencies can
                                           33




bring to bear, a president would run significant political risks if he openly

pursued a policy of general protectionism.

    At the same time, it is also very difficult politically for a president to

resist granting protection to specific industries that are politically signi-

ficant in voting and/or financial terms, and that also seem to have a good

case in U.S. and international import—relief or fair—trade laws. If, for

example, the ITC had rendered an affirmative decision in the recent auto case

and President Reagan had rejected this decision, it seems likely that Congress

would have vetoed his action, as it could have at that time with a simple

majority vote. Moreover, Congress probably would have blocked other legislation

desired by the President in retaliation for his decision. Even without the

congressional veto a president runs this risk when he takes actions against a

strongly held congressional view. It is not politically rational to turn down

"good" cases for protection ——   unless   a president regards resistance to import

relief for a politically powerful industry considered to be deserving of such

relief by many members of Congress to dominate his other political goals.

    Difficulties and trade—policy tensions are, of course, predictable results

of growing U.S. dependence on international markets, and of decline in U.S.

influence in them. Growing U.S. trade dependence increases the effect of the

country's trade policy on domestic economic variables. Responsiveness

(elasticity) of sectoral output, employment, and profit with respect to trade

policy rises as import and export shares rise. When trade shares were small,

even export and import embargoes had only modest impacts on domestic

industries. As trade shares have grown, so has the attractiveness of trade

policy to attain domestic goals, and to defend against "unfair" trade prac-

tices of foreign firms that are no longer just token competitors for U.S.
                                       34




giants.

    In contrast, as the rest of the world has grown relative to the US. since

World War II, its trade dependence on the U.S. has declined. Responsiveness

(elasticity) of global output, employment, and profit with respect to U.S.

trade policy has become smaller. U.S. ability to influence world economic

prosperity has therefore declined, and so has the claim of this goal to

priority in shaping U.S. trade policy. The important, but non—voting, foreign

constituents of U.S. trade policy have taken careful note of its reduced

Influence on them at the same time as voting U.S. constituents have awakened

to its growing influence on them.


U.S. Leadership Internationally: Hegemony, Oligarchy, Anarchy(?)

    If the tensions and trends described above are identified with the decline

of U.S. hegemony, the natural question is whether they undermine the inter-

national leadership of the U.S. in establishing liberal trade policy. Several

answers are possible.

    The hegemonic model of regime change not only predicts openness in world

trading arrangements when a hegemonic state is in its ascendency but a shift

toward a closed system if this nation declines in power and is not replaced

by another dominant state. Although this model is consistent with the early

part of the postwar period, there is general agreement (Krasner (1976),

Goldstein (1981), Lipson (1982)) that the model does not perform very well as an

explanation of regime change for more recent years.

    Despite a shift in power from a situation where one country dominated the

economic scene to one where there are now three major economic blocs (the

United States, the European Community, and Japan), most observers agree that
                                          35



 the trade and payments regime continues to be essentially an open and liberal

 one. As Table 1 in the introductory section shows, the tariff Cuts made in

 the 1960s and 1970s were actually much deeper than those made in the 1940s and

 1950s. Furthermore, the new nontariff codes negotiated during the Tokyo

Round, though often very general in their wording, do represent a significant

accomplishment. The GATT Ministerial meeting in November 1982 and the

leadership role that the United States played in establishing the agenda are

additional indications of the continued commitment of the major industrial

nations to a liberal international economic order.

    A consideration of the economic theory of either market behavior or of the

production of collective goods suggests why the hegemonic model fails to predict

the continuation of an open system. A single firm that dominates a market is

likely to stabilize its price at a monopolistic level while still tolerating

some price cutting by the smaller firms making up the rest of the industry.

However, oligopolistic market theory suggests that the same result is possible

if two or three large firms dominate an industry. Similarly, as Olson (1965)

pointed out, the free—rider problem associated with collective action by an

industry can be overcome if a small number of firms (as well as just one firm)

produce a significant share of the industry's output. Bargaining and enfor-

cement costs may then be sufficiently low that property rights to collective

goods can be established along with fees and penalties for cheating. Thus, the

continued support for a stable, open trading order as the distribution of power

changed from an almost monopolistic situation to an oligopolistic one is quite

consistent with market—behavior theory.

    The shift from a hegemonic position to one in which the country shares its

previous economic and political power with a small number of other nations is,
                                       36



however, likely to alter the country's own international behavior somewhat, just

as the change in the status of a firm from a monopolist to an oligopolist is

likely to change the firm's market behavior. In the U.S., the nature of the

change has been to initiate trade negotiations mainly to achieve domestic econo-

mic benefits rather than to further international political and national

security goals.

    As might be expected, the less altruistic behavior on the part of the

United States has resulted in an increased number of trade disputes. Many who

support a liberal trading order are concerned that these disputes will become so

numerous and difficult that the system will collapse, with each of the major

trading powers pursuing inward—looking trade policies. This is of course a

possibility, and is discussed further below. It is significant, however, that

most of the trading frictions do not arise because of disagreements on the prin-

ciples of an open trading system, but on matters of interpretation within

these principles. For example, the key parties in the system have always agreed

that it was proper to shield an industry from injurious increases in imports.

Consequently, when the United States protects the auto and steel industries from

import competition, or when the Europeans subsidize industries as a means of

retaining their domestic market shares, this is not regarded by most countries

as a departure from the basic liberal trading rules. Disagreements sometimes

arise, however, over whether a country is going beyond the intent of the rules

and engaging in what are in effect beggar—thy—neighbor policies. The settlement

of major disputes at a high political level and the continuing efforts to

improve the GATT dispute—settlement mechanism are a recognition by the major

trading nations of the damage to the system that could occur from such

disagreements.
                                        37



    Krasner (1976) argues in his amendment to the hegemonic model that the

abandonment of commitment to a liberal trading order is likely to occur only

when some major external crisis forces leaders to pursue a dramatic new policy

initiative. It may be that the existing power—sharing arrangement between the

United States, the European Community, and Japan reduces the likelihood of

this outcome compared to the case of a declining hegemony in the midst of many

smaller states. In this latter situation the dominant power is tempted in a

crisis to take advantage of its monopoly power over the terms of trade. When

power is shared, however, the recognition that a country's market power is

quite limited and that retailiation is likely to be swift and significant

tends to discourage such adventurism.

    It is worth considering less sanguine outlooks, however, since major cri-

ses may occur, and since developing countries in particular may not enjoy

the benefits of the countervailing trade policy power described above. A

familiar American image may help to flesh out what could happen if some

crisis prompted U.S. trade policy to become openly aggressive and national-

istic. "Frontier justice" might increasingly order trade and policy.

Under frontier justice, if any government could "get away with it," it would

"do it" Strong governments would survive prosperously; weak governments,

tenuously. The economic problem with frontier justice is unpredictability.

More organized systems of justice regularize economic exchange, establishing

boundaries for what qualify as voluntary transactions, rules governing the

exploitation of market advantage, and sanctions to guarantee the enforcement

of contracts. Frontier justice, by contrast, could destabilize economic

exchange, becoming an irritant to the market rather than its lubricant.

   U.S. hegemony, undesirable though it was in some ways, clearly checked
                                       38



the scope for policy aggression, much as the frontier sheriff or U.S. marshall

checked the scope for frontier justice. The awkward question that a crisis

might raise is what happens on the frontier when the sheriff not only grows

weaker, but begins to act aggressively, "just like everyone else"?

    Aggressive trade policies are to be feared more for their potential to

disorder resource allocation than to mis—order it. The law of the jungle

is as haphazard a way of ordering policy transactions as it is of ordering

market transactions. Even laisser—faire economists have in mind some par-

ticular legal structure of common—law conventions when they favor "free"

markets and liberal trade policy. The threat is that a crisis might cause

longstanding legal structures and conventions governing government behavior to

be abandoned. Uncertainty at best and chaos at worst could be the consequence

for international trade and investment. The danger of the worst case can be

appreciated by considering what happens to everyday commerce during civil

disorder, when legal systems crumble and vigilantism waxes strong.

    U.S. leadership in trade policy to minimize the chance of this worst—case

scenario is still probably quite strong. The U.S. would seem the logical ini-

tiator in what Blackhurst (1981, p. 369 passim) has described as a return

toward "conventions" in trade policy. Blackhurst has in mind conventions that

would at least order, but not bind, trade policy. Governments themselves should

be the constituents. Mutually agreed conventions protect governments from each

other, and also from domestic political constituents in narrow pursuit of trade

policies that serve their special interest at the expense of other constituents.

    There are three important practical challenges in any such return toward

conventions. One is to avoid over—ambitious promulgation of "rules" which,

when broken, breed the unpredictability that disorders resource allocation.
                                           39


A second is to keep the resource and time costs of negotiation in check so as to

increase chances for a cooperative outcome. A third is to incorporate deve-

loping countries better into "convention—setting" than they have been recently.

    In these lights it is worth evaluating the multilateral negotiating approach

very carefully. In view of significant differences among countries concerning

trade policies, multilateral negotiations may now be too cumbersome and costly

in terms of what can be achieved. Negotiations among a small number of

countries on selected issues of particular concern to the group may be more pro-

ductive. This would represent a return to the negotiating technique followed so

successfully in the 1930s under the Trade Agreement Act of 1934. The group is

small enough and sufficiently concerned for the negotiations to be efficient,

yet the collective benefits reaped from the most—favored—nation principle need

not be sacrificed.

    What this may suggest practically for the U.S. is aggressive bilateral

peacemaking ——   the   formation of mutually advantageous coalitions with like—

minded governments)° For example, the U.S. and Japan seem likely partners for

a bilateral trade agreement that would order trade along lines that are held

closely in common.


U.S. Leadership Domestically: Potential for the Reagan Administration

    A President's ability to reconcile the trade—policy conflicts between

domestic and foreign constituencies depends on many factors ——    his   political

strength among voters, his economic and political goals, his effectiveness

in dealing with Congress and the public, the extent to which his own party

controls Congress, etc. President Reagan thus far has not exhibited special

interest in international economic matters. Ills policy decisions in this

field have been mainly reactive. While he has been guided in these responses
                                       40



by a strong preference for the market mechanism, he has also shown a willingness

to compromise in the face of strong domestic or international political opposi-

tion to a clear—cut market solution.

    A president can make a significant difference domestically in the nature of

trade policy. This is most likely to occur when he initiates major trade—policy

actions himself, as well as responding to well—taken pressures. In this way he

is often able to transcend the narrow, short—run concerns that dominate most

political decisionmaking, and gain support among legislators and the public

based on their concerns for the long-run economic and political welfare of the

country. An initiative in this spirit has been President Reagan's recent propo-

sal to create a cabinet—level Department of International Trade and Industry.

Yet in many ways this initiative may be premature. Clarifying initiatives

toward U.S. trade strategy and policy instruments seem needful beforehand, along

with credible actions to underwrite such initiatives. We turn to these

clarifying initiatives after a brief discussion of the proposal for a new

department.

    The proposed Department of International Trade and Industry would be

created by merging the Office of the United States Trade Representative,

which is in the Executive Office of the President, and parts of the Commerce

Department. The new department would allegedly "provide a strong, unified

voice for trade and industrial matters." There are sound arguments both for and

against such a merger. With the 1979 transfer to the Commerce Department of

responsibility for administering the basic fair trade laws, and with the greater

emphasis under the Reagan administration on enforcement of these laws, signifi-

cant parts of trade policy administration are divided between USTR and the

Commerce Department. Conflicts between the two agencies weaken international
                                         41



effectiveness in trade disputes and sometimes send conflicting signals to

domestic producers. Yet such conflicts are inevitable under the present

arrangement, and would presumably be reduced with the new agency. Bringing

together the economic staff of the Commerce Department and the trade officials

of USTR would also stimulate the kind of in—depth economic studies that are so

badly needed to prepare U.S. negotiators adequately, as well as to undertake

long—range trade policy planning.

    A possible drawback of the new department is that the inter—agency aspect of

trade policy formation that has existed since the 1930s could be lost or

seriously weakened. Trade policies affect matters over which most of the major

federal departments have some control, and decisions on most issues are now

reached through Inter—agency meetings chaired by USTR and involving such agen-

cies as State, Treasury, Commerce, Labor, Agriculture, Interior, ITC, and

Defense. Some individuals fear that the current process of balancing the

diverse views of representatives from these agencies would be lost and instead

be replaced by a process in which the business—oriented views of the Commerce

Department become dominant. There is also some concern that trade policy may

end up being downgraded in importance, since it will no longer be directed from

the Executive Office of the President.

    The merger issue is not likely to be resolved soon, since there is signifi-

cant opposition to it in Congress. In the meantime, the debate over the new

department could be informed greatly by initiatives to clarify the strategy

and instruments of U.S. trade policy.


    (1) Strategy. Recent U.S. trade initiatives, especially from Congress,

reveal an anomalous division of opinion concerning the proper trade strategy
                                           42



for the United States. Some initatives attempt to export U.S. policy tradi-

tion to the rest of the world. Others attempt to import poilcy tradition

abroad to the United States. Illustrating the first are new conceptions of

"reciprocity" ——   notions   that policy abroad must provide U.S. firms with the

same market opportunities as our policies provide to their firms,... or else!

Illustrating the second are new conceptions of trade policy as active

industrial policy ——   notions   that U.S. trade policy should be marshalled as

an important tool in striving for an optimum industrial structure.

   The two strategies above are not inconsistent of course ——       trade   policy

abroad could become like "ours" at the same time as "ours" became like

others'. The result of both strategies would be policy convergence. Thus

both represent a departure from the historical U.S. approach, which is more

aptly characterized as policy tolerance ——      accept policy differences in
general, and at the margins exchange policy concessions for mutual gain. The

appeal of policy convergence over policy tolerance appears to rest in the

suspicion of unfairness discussed above. One might typify it as "If they only

stopped cheating on the system and played like we do, then the field would be

more level; if we only 'wised up' and played like they do, we could share all

their advantages." In this light, the traditional tolerance approach may

appear unappealing, "the same old thing again, just chipping away at the

margin." The reality may, however, be otherwise than the appearance.

Chipping away at the margin of policy differences may ultimately be more

fruitful than a full frontal attack on them. The strategy of U.S. trade

policy needs careful scrutiny.

   The issue of rules versus discretion in trade policy is closely related.

U.S. tradition is rules—based and ultimately subject to litigation. Tradition
                                         43



abroad is much more discretionary ——   flexible,   managerial, and administrative.

Negotiation rather than litigation is the vehicle for resolving differences.

Here there is a genuine conflict for U.S. trade policy. Movement toward an

even greater use of rules can satisfy domestic constituencies but isolate the

U.S. still further in international negotiations. A good example is changes in

countervailing—duty law and its administration, described by Shuman and Verrill

(1983). Although the rules are now clearer than ever, there is still marked

sensitivity in the executive branch to foreign objections when countervailing—

duty cases are aggressively pursued. Negotiations with industry and foreign

governments may ensue, with the result that the admittedly clear rules are by-

passed by discretionary negotiation among the participants.

    Movement away from rules toward discretion may, however, aggravate the

widespread sense that the U.S. government isn't actively pursuing American

interests, and undermine domestic support for all U.S. trade policy. It is

curious in light of this to see the strength of U.S. support for active trade

policy as industrial policy. Such active policy would almost surely necessitate

fewer rules—centered policy decisions and more discretionary, technocratic, and

unpredictable policy directives.

    Finally, U.S. initiative is much needed on the adjustment issue of

how to respond to sectoral policy abroad. Such policy in due time encourages

U.S. sectoral adjustment in an opposite direction, with attendant adjustment

costs. Should U.S. trade policy attempt to attenuate the adjustment, acce-

lerate It, or remain passive? And what if the policy abroad appeared likely

to fail? Should U.S. trade policy attempt to avoid the doubling of adjustment

costs as industrial resources move to and fro? Should active adjustment—

centered trade policy be bilateral or most—favored—nation?
                                      44



    (2) Instruments. It may be timely for the United States to initiate the

restoration of tariffs and other taxes as the chief instruments of trade policy.

The increased significance of administrative non—tax policy for exports and

imports is well—known. Yet some of the unfortunate by—products of this are not

widely appreciated.

    One result of the greater use of administrative policies is intricacy. It

becomes harder to identify foreign policies, much less their effects. It also

becomes harder to implement one's own trade objectives. Intricacy raises the

resource cost of estimating and monitoring trade policy, no matter who initiates

it. Intricacy also slows down trade policymaking. Administrative trade policy,

unlike tariffs, invades the turfs of regulatory agencies, congressional over-

sight committees, and sometimes even the judiciary.

    Intricacy increases allegations of unfairness and discrimination. This is

because administrative trade policy is inherently opaque compared to tariffs or

explicit export subsidies. Opaqueness tends to heighten suspiclous that

something discriminatory and unfair is going on below surface appearances.

Opaqueness leads naturally to the increased pursuit of unfair trade cases.

Furthermore, opaqueness invites Congress to respond to perceived Inequity with

comparably opaque initiatives. Administrative trade policy has made it

increasingly difficult for the U.S. to maintain the balance in its historical

position that trade should be "free but fair."

    A closely related result from greater use of administrative policies is

unpredictability. Unpredictability undermines the ability of the market system

to function, especially impeding those markets that allocate resources over time

for investment, education, and research. This in turn aggravates adjustment

problems.
                                         45



    For example, in recent years many initatives in U.S. trade policy have been

non—tax rules with discretionary over—rides. Orderly marketing arrangements in

footwear and television equipment can be described in this way, as can the Tokyo

Round codes on subsidization, dumping, and government procurement.

Unpredictability is an unfortunate by—product because these initiatives unwhole-

somely mingle policing with policy responsibility. The same authorities who are

charged with predictably enforcing the rules are also charged with using

their discretion to revise them sensibly. The two responsibilities are in

conflict. Tariffs and other tax—based trade policy provide a sharp contrast.

Enforcement of the rules is the clear responsibility of the Customs Service or

the Internal Revenue Service. Discretionary revision of the rules is the

clear responsibility of the Congress with the Executive's cooperation,

featuring relatively predictable procedures for dissemination of information,

expressing opinions, etc. There is no conflict since policing and policy are

vested in different groups.

    Economists who applaud the benefits of price competition but are chary of

non—price competition (advertising, etc.) might consider the trade policy ana-

log. There may be much clearer benefits to "tariff competition" ——      negotiating
concessions in the traditional way, threatening tax—based retaliation, etc. ——

than   to competition among governments in administrative protection.

    Deregulation in the U.S. accentuates these tendencies. The removal of

regulations, most of which are non—tax directives, forces a trade policy

question: should the regulations be removed for all agents, or only for

domestic agents? Taking the latter route implies special treatment for

foreign sellers or buyers and is by its discriminatory nature a trade policy.

But the Initiating authority may be none of the traditional trade policy
                                       46



centers. It may be rather the Department of Energy, the Federal Communications

Commission, or the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

U.S. initiative is needed to clarify jurisdiction over these questions.

    Implicit revenue provides, however, a possibly important counterweight for

preferring the continuation of U.S. reliance on non—tax policies. Orderly

marketing agreements may transfer to exporting countries enough market power,

related revenues, and terms—of—trade advantage to compensate them for injury

caused by reducing shipments to the U.S. Developing country exporters of

potentially differentiable goods, such as the newly industrializing countries

of East and Southeast Asia, may have especially strong preferences for these

non—tax agreements. Even U.S. policymakers might defend them as an instrument

of international compensation for what would otherwise be a clear beggar—thy—

neighbor barrier.


U.S. Leadership: Entries on an Agenda for "Aggressive Peacemaking"

    U.S. trade—policy initiative in "aggressive peacemaking" requires consensus—

building at home and abroad. Domestic and foreign constituents of U.S. trade

policy are alike in their fragmentation over the best ways of ordering inter-

national exchange. "Disequilibrium" is the word that best describes their

shifting and disparate views on trade policy.

    For example, there are valid national reasons why countries may wish to

introduce industrial policies or behave strategically in competing for

international markets. However, in the absence of well—defined international

conventions concerning just what constitutes acceptable international behavior

and setting forth workable dispute settlement mechanisms, there are also

dangers with a strategic policy approach. When each country actively
                                       47


pursues this approach and retaliates against others who do so, it is possible

that all trading nations end up with lower employment and income levels than

otherwise, as the sequence of actions may   constitute   a negative sum game.
                         11
    These potential costs   need to be described clearly to the American public

and internationally. The description needs to be rooted in current fact and

recent history. U.S. leadership seems natural in this task, given U.S. corn—

parativ'e advantage in economic education and research, and the still strong tra-

dition of independence and objectivity among U.S. analysts arid commentators.

    A cooperative international approach worked quite well for many years

after World War II. However, fundamental changes in the distribution of eco-

nomic power among countries, including the growth of newly industrializing

countries, coupled with differences among countries in the extent to which

they have pursued active and reactive trade policies, have all served to lessen

the effectiveness of the rules under which the postwar trading regime has

operated. What is needed now is aggressive peacemaking aimed at establishing a

new cooperative approach.

    Any new cooperative approach is likely to require bilateral or

multilateral agreements on several key elements of trade policy. One of the

most important of these concerns the types of government intervention, espe-

cially public subsidization, that should and should not be countered with of f—

setting actions by other governments. Present GATT rules and practices are

not sufficiently precise in this area. National laws on countervailing are

also too simplistic to deal with modern conditions. In particular, there is

insufficient recognition of the character of activist trade policies. By no

means are all such policies aimed at gaining at the expense of others. Some

can bring gains to all trading parties. Yet these are not sufficiently
                                       48

delineated in either GATT or national conventions. Nor are the procedures for

settling disputes in this area sufficiently effective. Nor are the advantages

and disadvantages of special treatment for developing—country subsidies care-

fully thought out.

    Greater agreement among the industrial and the newly industrializing

countries concerning temporary assistance to sectors faced with severe adjust—

inent problems is also needed. Countries claiming that their subsidies are

strictly for adjustment purposes sometimes find their adjustment problems made

worse by countervailing duties imposed by others. The need for a new saf e—

guards code has also been recognized for several years. Integration of a

new safeguards code with preferential treatment, if any, for developing

countries might be the next step.

    Bilateral and multilateral agreements relating to competition policy seem

necessary. When international markets are imperfect, the abnormal profits

that are available are tempting targets of government trade policies.12

However, if international understandings can be developed that dIscourage

cartel—like behavior, abuse of dominant market positions, and attempts to

monopolize, much of the incentive for such profit—shifting trade policies may be

eliminated. It is unlikely that competition policy can be dealt with adequately

without also strengthening existing agreements relating to foreign direct

investment.

    Aggressive peacemaking through cooperation may also be needed in the areas

of exchange—rate, monetary, and fiscal policies. Independent actions by some

nations in these policy areas have created serious income and employment

problems in others, especially when compounded with international debt problems.

Without cooperative efforts to mitigate these problems, agreements in such areas

as subsidization may not be meaningful or effective.

1.   If the effects of structural shifts In trade and of inflation on
     specific duties are included along with the negotiated tariff cuts,
     the average tariff on dutiable imports drops from a 1931 level of
     53 percent to about 5 percent after completion of the Toyko Round
     cuts.

2. Additional detail on matters discussed in this section can be
    found in Baldwin (1982).

3. Authors of this explanation for the postwar establishment of a liberal
    InternatIonal economIc order under U.S. leadershIp Include Klndleberger
    (1973, 1981), Gilpin (1975, 1977) and Krasner (1976). See Lipson (1982)
    for a succinct statement and analysis of the hegeinonic model.

4. See Leddy and Norwood (1963) for a detailed discussion of the escape
    clause, as well as the peril point provision. The peril—point provision
    directed the President to submit to the ITC a list of all articles being
    considered for tariff negotiations, and required the Commission to
    determine the limits to which each duty could be reduced without causing
    or threatening serious injury to import—competing domestic industries.
    This provision was a part of U.S. trade law from 1948 through 1962,
    except for a brief repeal in 1949 and 1950.

5. For a description of the protectionist pressures from the cotton
    textile as well as the oil and coal industries during the l950s and
    early l96Os, see Bauer, Pool, and Dexter (1963), Chapter 25.

6. Between 1955 and 1972 the average number of antidumping reports
    issued by the ITC averaged less than 6 per year. This rate
    increased to 13 between 1974 and 1979. Similarly, the number of
    countervailing duty investigations completed by the ITC between 1962
    and 1973 was 12, while the number rose to 37 between 1974 and the end
     of 1978.

7. Additional detail on matters discussed in this section can be
    found in Baldwin (1983).

8. This so—called "reciprocIty' bill also requires an annual report of
    foreign trade barriers and what is being done to reduce them.
    Congress actually preferred a considerably stronger version of the
    bill but accepted this compromise at the urging of the administration.

    in Baldwin (1982, 1983) and Richardson (1983a,b).

10. See Aho and Bayard (1983) and Vernon (1983, pp. 40—41 passim) for more
     detailed consideration of such proposals, including some that would
     abandon MFN treatment. The European Community has been essentially
     following this route as it expands, and in its preferential arrangements
     with non—member countries. See Camps and Diebold (1983) and Greenway
     (1984) for arguments in favor of renewed aggressive multilateral
     negotiating strategies.

     and calculating the cost, to see whether he could afford to finish
     it?... Or what king will march to battle against another king, without
     first sitting down to consider whether with ten thousand men he can
     face an enemy coming to meet him with twenty thousand? If he cannot,
     then, long before the enemy approaches, he sends envoys, and asks for
     terms." (Luke 14: 28, 31—32, New English Bible).
