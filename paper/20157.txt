We study the wealth distribution in Bewley economies with idiosyncratic capital income risk. We
show analytically that under rather general conditions on the stochastic structure of the economy, a
unique ergodic distribution of wealth displays a fat tail; more precisely, a Pareto distribution in the
right tail.

1     Introduction
Bewley economies, as e.g., in Bewley (1977, 1983) and Aiyagari (1994),1 represent one
of the fundamental workhorses of modern macroeconomics, its main tool when moving
away from the study of e¢ cient economies with a representative agent to allow e.g., for
incomplete markets.2 In these economies the evolution of aggregate variables does not
generally constitute a su¢ cient representation of equilibrium, which instead requires the
characterization of the dynamics of the distributions across heterogeneous agents.
    In Bewley economies each agent faces a stochastic process for labor earnings and
solves an in…nite horizon consumption-saving problem with incomplete markets. Typi-
cally, agents are restricted to save by investing in a risk-free bond and are not allowed
to borrow. The postulated process for labor earnings determines the dynamics of the
equilibrium distributions for consumption, savings, and wealth.3
    Bewley models have been successful in the study of several macroeconomic phenom-
ena of interest. Calibrated versions of this class of models have been used to study welfare
costs of in‡ation (Imrohoroglu, 1992), asset pricing (Mankiw, 1986 and Huggett, 1993),
unemployment bene…ts (Hansen and Imrohoroglu, 1992), …scal policy (Aiyagari, 1995
and Heathcote, 2005), and labor productivity (Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante,
2008a, 2008b; Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron, 2001; and Krueger and Perri, 2008).4
    On the other hand, Bewley models are hardly able to reproduce the observed dis-
tribution of wealth in many countries; see e.g., Aiyagari (1994) and Huggett (1993).
More speci…cally, they cannot reproduce the high inequality and the fat right tail that
empirical distributions of wealth tend to display.5 This is because at high wealth levels,
the incentives for precautionary savings taper o¤ and the tails of the wealth distribution
remain thin; see Carroll (1997) and Quadrini (1999) for a discussion of these issues.6
    1
      The Bewley economy terminology is rather generally adopted and has been introduced by Ljungqvist
and Sargent (2004).
    2
      The assumption of complete markets is generally rejected in the data; see e.g., Attanasio and Davis
(1996), Fisher and Johnson (2006) and Jappelli and Pistaferri (2006).
    3
      More recent speci…cations of the model allow for aggregate risks and an equilibrium determination
of labor earnings and interest rates; see Huggett (1993), Aiyagari (1994), Rios-Rull (1995), Krusell and
Smith (2006, 2008). and Ljungqvist and Sargent (2004), Ch. 17, for a review of results.
    4
      See Heathcoate-Storesletten-Violante (2010) for a recent survey of the quantitative implications of
Bewley models.
    5
      Large top wealth shares in the U.S. since the 60’s are documented e.g., by Wol¤ (1987, 2004) and,
more recently, by Kopczuk and Saez (2014) using estate tax return data; Piketty and Zucman (2014)
…nd large and increasing wealth-to-income ratios in the U.S. and Europe in 1970-2010 national balance
sheets data. Fat tails for the distributions of wealth are also well documented, for example by Nirei-
Souma (2004) for the U.S. and Japan from 1960 to 1999, by Clementi-Gallegati (2004) for Italy from
1977 to 2002, and by Dagsvik-Vatne (1999) for Norway in 1998. Using the richest sample of the U.S.,
the Forbes 400, during 1988-2003 Klass et al. (2007) …nd e.g., that the top end of the wealth distribution
obeys a Pareto law.
    6
      Stochastic labor earnings can in principle generate some skewness in the distribution of wealth, es-



                                                    2
    In the present paper we analytically study the wealth distribution in the context
of Bewley economies extended to allow for idiosyncratic capital income risk, which is
                                               ;
naturally interpreted as entrepreneurial risk.7 To this end we provide …rst an analysis
of the standard Income Fluctuation problem, as e.g., in Chamberlain-Wilson (2000), ex-
tended to account for capital income risk.8 We restrict ourselves to idiosyncratic labor
earnings and capital income for simplicity. As in Aiyagari (1994), the borrowing con-
straint together with stochastic incomes assures a lower bound to wealth acting as a
re‡ecting barrier.9 Furthermore, we show that the consumption function under borrow-
ing constraints is strictly concave at lower wealth levels, consistent with, e.g. Saez and
Zuchman (2014)’s evidence of substantial saving rate di¤erentials across wealth levels. In
this environment, therefore, the rich can get richer through savings, while the poor may
not save enough to escape a poverty trap. Such non-ergodicity however would imply no
social mobility between rich and poor, which seems incompatible with observed levels of
social mobility in income over time and across generations; see for example Chetty, Hen-
dren, Kline, and Saez (2014). We analytically show however that enough idiosyncratic
capital income risk induces an ergodic stationary wealth distribution which is fat tailed,
more precisely, a Pareto distribution in the right tail. We also show that it is capital
income risk, rather than labor earnings, that drives the properties of the right tail of the
pecially if the earnings process is itself skewed and persistent. Extensive evidence for the skewedness of
the income distribution has been put forth in a series of papers by Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty
(some with co-authors), starting with Saez and Piketty (2003) on the U.S. We refer to Atkinson, Saez,
and Piketty (2011) for a survey and to the excellent website of the database they have collected (with
Facundo Alvaredo), The World Top Incomes Database. However, most empirical studies of labor earn-
ings …nd some form of stationarity of the earnings process; see Guvenen (2007) and e.g., the discussion
of Primiceri and van Rens (2006) by Heathcote (2008). Persistent income shocks are often postulated
to explain the cross-sectional distribution of consumption but seem hardly enough to produce fat tailed
distributions of wealth; see e.g., Storesletten, Telmer, Yaron (2004). See also Cagetti and De Nardi
(2008) for a survey.
   7
     Capital income risk has been introduced by Angeletos and Calvet (2005) and Angeletos (2007)
and further studied by Panousi (2008) and by ourselves (Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu, 2011 and 2013).
Quadrini (1999, 2000) and Cagetti and De Nardi (2006) study entrepreneurial risk explicitly. Jones
and Kim (2014) study entrepreneurs in a growth context under risk introduced by creative destruction.
Relatedly, Krusell and Smith (1998) introduce heterogeneous discount rates to numerically produce
some skewness in the distribution of wealth. We refer to these papers and our previous papers, as
well as to Benhabib and Bisin (2006) and Benhabib and Zhu (2008), for more general evidence on the
macroeconomic relevance of capital income risk.

instrumental to provide several incremental pieces to our characterization of the solution of (various
speci…cations of) the Income Fluctuation problem; see Ljungqvist and Sargent (2004), Ch. 16, as well

Fluctuation problem.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present the basic setup of our
economy in Section 2. Section 3 contains the characterization of the income ‡uctuation
problem with idiosyncratic capital income risk. In Section 4 we show that the wealth
accumulation process has a unique stationary distribution and the stationary distribution
displays a fat right tail. In Section 5 we show that our analysis of the wealth distribution
induced by the income ‡uctuation problem can be embedded in general equilibrium.
Section 6 contains some simulation results regarding the stationary wealth distribution
and the social mobility of the wealth accumulation process.


2     The economy
Consider an in…nite horizon economy with a continuum of agents uniformly distributed
with measure 1.11 Let fct g1                                                  1
                           t=0 denote an agent consumption process and fat+1 gt=0 his/her
wealth process. In the economy, each agent faces a no-borrowing constraint at each time
t:
                                          ct at :
Let fyt g1                                                    1
         t=0 represent an agent’s earnings process and fRt+1 gt=0 his/her idiosyncratic
rate of return on wealth process.
   Each agent in the economy solves the Income Fluctuation (IF) problem which is
obtained under Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) preferences,

                                                             t=0
                                                                           1
                                 s.t. at+1 = Rt+1 (at              ct ) + yt+1
  10
     This complements the results in our previous papers (Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu, 2011 and 2013),
which focus on overlapping generation economies. An alternative approach to generate fat tails with-
out stochastic returns is to introduce a model with bequests, where the probability of death (and/or
retirement) is independent of age. In these models, the stochastic component is not stochastic returns
but the length of life. For models that embody such features, see Wold and Whittle (1957), Castaneda,
Gimenez and Rios-Rull (2003), and Benhabib and Bisin (2006). On the other hand, sidestepping the
income ‡uctuation problem by assuming a constant savings rate, Nirei (2014) shows that thick tails are
a direct consequence of the linearity of the wealth equation.

     We avoid introducing notation to index agents in the paper.

The following assumptions characterize formally the stochastic properties of the economic
environment:

Assumption 1 Rt and yt are stochastic processes, identically and independently dis-
tributed (i.i.d.) over time and across agents: yt has probability density function f (y)
on bounded support [y; y], with y> 0 and Rt has probability density function g(R) on

Pr( Rt > 1) > 0 and any …nite moment of Rt exists.

2.1     Outline
It is useful to brie‡y outline the role of our assumptions and our strategy to obtain the
main results in the paper. Assumptions 1.i) and 1.ii) guarantee that an agent with zero
wealth at some time t will not consume all his/her income at time t + 1 for high enough
realizations of earnings and rates of return; as a consequence, the lower bound of the
wealth space is a re‡ecting barrier, i.e. the wealth accumulation process is not stuck at
the lower end of the wealth space, a = 0 (see Lemma 7 in the Appendix). The stochastic
process for wealth is then ergodic.
    Assumptions 1.iii) and 1.iv) guarantee that the wealth accumulation process is sta-
tionary. In particular, Assumption 1.iii) guarantees that the aggregate economy displays
no unbounded growth in consumption and wealth.13 Assumption 1.iv) implies that

                                                ERt < 1:

This is enough to guarantee that the economy contracts, giving rise to a stationary dis-
tribution of wealth. However, since we cannot obtain explicit solutions for consumption
or savings policies, we have to explicitly show that under suitable assumptions there are
no disjoint invariant sets or cyclic sets in wealth, so that agents do not get trapped in
subsets of the support of the wealth distribution. In other words we have to show that
the stochastic process for wealth is ergodic, and that a unique stationary distribution
exists. We show this in Lemmata 6 and 8 in the Appendix. We then have to show that
  12
     While R = 1 is allowed for, a …nite R, as derived in the proof of Theorem 4, is su¢ cient for all our
results.
  13
     We can allow for exogenous growth g > 1 in earnings, as in Aiyagari and McGrattan (1998). To
this end, we need to de‡ate the variables by the growth rate and let the borrowing constraint grow
at growth rate. In our context, since we allow for no borrowing, no modi…cation of the constraint is
needed. However, Assumption 1.2.iii) would have to be modi…ed so that Pr( gRt > 1) > 0.



                                                     5
idiosyncratic capital income risk can give rise to a fat-tailed wealth distribution. Since
in our economic environment policy functions are not linear and explicit solutions are
not available even under CRRA preferences, we cannot use the results of Kesten (1973),
for example as in Benhabib, Bisin and Zhu (2011). We are nonetheless able to show that
consumption and savings policies are asymptotically linear; a result which, under appro-
priate assumptions, allow us to apply Mirek (2011)’s generalization of Kesten (1973).
We do this in Propositions 3, 4 and 5. The fat right tail of the stationary distribution
of wealth, obtained in Theorem 3, exploits crucially that Pr( Rt > 1) > 0; that is,
Assumption 1.v).


3    The income ‡uctuation problem with idiosyncratic
     capital income risk
In this section we show several technical results about the consumption function c(a)
which solves problem IF, as a build-up for its characterization of the wealth distribution
in the next section. All proofs are in the Appendix.

Theorem 1 A consumption function c(a) which satis…es the constraints of the IF prob-
lem and furthermore sati…es

i) the Euler equation

              u0 (c(a))    ERt+1 u0 (c [R(a   c(a)) + y]) with equality if c(a) < a;   (1)

     and

ii) the transversality condition
                                      lim E t u0 (ct )at = 0;                          (2)
                                      t!1

represents a solution of the IF problem.

By strict concavity of u(c), there exists a unique c(a) which solves the IF problem.
    The study of c(a) requires studying two auxiliary problems. The …rst is a version
the IF problem in which the stochastic process for earnings fyt g10 is turned o¤, that is,
yt = 0, for any t 0. The second is a …nite horizon version of the IF problem. In both
cases we naturally maintain the relevant speci…cation and assumptions imposed on our
main IF problem.

This problem can indeed be solved in closed form, following Levhari and Srinivasan
(1969). Note that for this problem the borrowing constraint is never binding because

                              cno (a) = a; for some 0 <                                    < 1:




3.2    The …nite IF problem
For any T > 0, let the …nite IF problem be:

                                                                     X
                                                                     T
                                                                                    c1t
                                                                               t
                                           max                   E                                               (…nite IF)
                                  fct gT           T 1
                                       t=0 ;fat+1 gt=0               t=0
                                                                                   1
                  s:t: at+1 = Rt+1 (at              ct ) + yt+1 ;                  for 0      t   T     1
                                      ct       at ;        for 0           t         T
                                                    a0 given.
    With some notational abuse, let ct denote consumption t periods from the end-period
T , that is, consumption at time T t.

Proposition 2 The unique solution to the …nite IF problem is a consumption function
ct (a) which is continuous and increasing in a. Furthermore, let st denote the induced
savings function,
                                   st (a) = a ct (a):
Then st (a) is also continuous and increasing in a.

3.3       Characterization of c(a)
We can now derive a relation between ct (a), cno (a) and c(a). The following Lemma is a
straightforward extension of Proposition 2.3 and Proposition 2.4 in Rabault (2002).

Lemma 1 limt!1 ct (a) exists, it is continuous and satis…es the Euler equation. Fur-
thermore,
                                 lim ct (a) cno (a):
                                          t!1

      The main result of this section follows:

Theorem 2 The unique solution to the IF problem is the consumption function c(a)
which satis…es:
                               c(a) = lim ct (a):
                                                   t!1




      Let the induced savings function s(a) be

                                           s(a) = a      c(a):

Proposition 3 The consumption and savings functions c(a) and s(a) are continuous
and increasing in a.

   Carroll and Kimball (2005) show that ct (a) is concave.14 But Lemma 2 guarantees
that c(a) = limt!1 ct (a) and thus c(a) is also a concave function of a.

Proposition 4 The consumption function c(a) is a concave function of a.

   The most important result of this section is that the optimal consumption function
c(a), in the limit for a ! 1, is linear and has the same slope as the optimal consumption
function of the income ‡uctuation problem with no earnings, .
                                                                  c(a)
Proposition 5 The consumption function c(a) satis…es lima!1        a
                                                                         = .

The proof, in the Appendix, is non-trivial.

4       The stationary distribution
In this section we study the distribution of wealth in the economy. The wealth accumu-
lation equation of the IF problem is
                               at+1 = Rt+1 (at       c(at )) + yt+1 :                      (3)
It is useful to compare it with the IF with no earnings. Using Lemma 1 we have:
                             at+1 = Rt+1 (at         c(at )) + yt+1
                                    Rt+1 (at         cno (at )) + yt+1
                                  = Rt+1 (1           )at + yt+1 :
Let                                                            1
                                   =1       =        ER1           :
Thus      < 1 by Assumption 1.iii). We have
                                   at+1     Rt+1 at + yt+1 :
      The main results in this section are the following two theorems.

Theorem 3 There exists a unique stationary distribution for at+1 which satis…es the
stochastic wealth accumulation equation (3).

The proof, in the Appendix, requires several steps. First we show that the wealth
accumulation process fat+1 g1 t=0 induced by equation (3) above is '         irreducible, i.e.,
there exists a non trivial measure ' on [y,1) such that if '(A) > 0, the probability that
the process enters the set A in …nite time is strictly positive for any initial condition (see
Chapter 4 of Meyn and Tweedie (2009)). We also show that a = y represents a re‡ecting
barrier for the process. To show that there exists a unique stationary wealth distribution
we exploit the results in Meyn and Tweedie (2009) and show that the process fat+1 g1       t=0
is ergodic.
    Finally, the in the next theorem we show that the wealth accumulation process
fat+1 g1
       t=0 has a fat tail. We use the characterization of c(a) and s(a) in Section 3.3,
and in particular the fact that s(a)
                                   a
                                      is increasing in a and s(a)a
                                                                     approaches as a goes
to in…nity; this allows us to apply some results by Mirek (2011) regarding conditions
for asymptotically Pareto stationary distributions for processes induced by non-linear
stochastic di¤erence equations.

Theorem 4 The unique stationary distribution for at+1 which satis…es the stochastic
wealth accumulation equation (3) has a fat tail; i.e., there exist 1 < < 1 and an > 0
arbitrarily small such that
                         E (M ) = 1; M =             Rt and             < :

and
                                            Pr(at+1 > a)
                                  lim inf                                 C;
                                        a!1     a
where C is a positive constant.

Proof. Since s(a)
               a
                  is increasing in a and             s(a)
                                                      a
                                                             approaches         as a goes to in…nity, we can
pick a large a such that
                                                      s(a )
                                                            < :
                                                       a
Let
                                                            s(a )
                                                      =           :
                                                             a
Thus        <         .
  Let
                                                     s(a); a          a
                                      l(a) =                                :                            (4)
                                                       a; a           a
Note that l(a)      s(a) for 8a 2 [y,1), since s(a)a
                                                      is increasing in a; furthermore, the
                                    ¯
function l(a) in (4) is Lipschitz continuous, since s(a) is Lipschitz continuous.
   Let
                                      (a) = Rt l(a) + y:
Now we apply Theorem 1.8 of Mirek (2011), to show that the stochastic process f~at+1 g1
                                                                                      t=0 ,
induced by a~t+1 = (~ at ), has a unique stationary distribution and that the tail of the
stationary distribution for a
                            ~t+1 is asymptotic to a Pareto law, i.e.
                                           Pr(~
                                              at+1 > a)
                                       lim              = C;
                                       a!1     a
where C is a positive constant.
   In order to apply Theorem 1.8 of Mirek (2011), we need to verify Assumption 1.6
and Assumption 1.7 of Mirek (2011).
   By the de…nition of ( ) we have
                                        1
                            lim             a       = M a for 8a 2 [y; 1):
                            !0                                      ¯
      Let
                                                Nt = Rt + yt
where
                                         = max js(a)                  aj:
                                                a2[y ;a ]
                                                   ¯
It is easy to verify that

                              j (a)     M aj < Nt              for 8a 2 [y; 1):
                                                                         ¯
                                                        10
Thus ( ) satis…es Assumption 1.6 (Shape of the mappings) of Mirek (2011).
   Obviously, the conditional law of log M is non arithmetic. Let h(d) = log E (M )d .
By Assumption 1.iv) we have E ( Rt ) < 1. Thus h(1) = log E (M ) log E ( R) < 0.
We now show that Assumption 1.iii) and Assumption 1.iv) imply that there exists > 1
such that E(Rt ) > 1. By Jensen’s inequality we have E(Rt )1         (ERt )1 . Also,
Assumption 1.2.iv) implies that ERt < 1. Thus
                                                          1
                                      =    E(Rt )1            :

Thus                                                  Z
                         E ( Rt )       E ( Rt )                  ( Rt ) :
                                                       f Rt >1g

By Assumption 1.v), Pr( Rt > 1) > 0. Thus there exists > 1 such that E(Rt ) > 1.
We could pick       such that ( ) E(Rt ) > 1. Thus h( ) = log E (M ) > 0. By
Assumption 1.v), any …nite moment of Rt exists. Thus h(d) is a continuous function of
d. Thus there exists > 1 such that h( ) = 0, i.e. E (M ) = 1. Also we know that
h(d) is a convex function of d. Thus there is a unique > 0, such that E (M ) = 1.
    Moreover, E [(M ) j log M j] < 1, since M has a lower bound, and, by Assumption
1.v), any …nite moment of Rt exists.
    We also know that E(Nt ) < 1 since yt has bounded support and, by Assumption
1.v), any …nite moment of Rt exists.
    Thus M and Nt satisfy Assumption 1.7 (Moments condition for the heavy tail) of
Mirek (2011).
    By Lemma 7 in the Appendix, a =y is a re‡ecting barrier of the process fat+1 g1  t=0 .
                                        ¯
Assumption 1.ii) requires that the upper bound of the support of Rt ; R is large enough.
Consider …rst the case in which Rt is unbounded, R = 1: It follows that in this case the
support of the stationary distribution for a
                                           ~t+1 is unbounded.
    Applying Theorem 1.8 of Mirek (2011), we …nd that the stationary distribution a ~t+1
has a Pareto tail. Finally, we show that the stationary wealth distribution at+1 , has a
fat tail.
              ~0 . The stochastic process fat+1 g1
    Pick a0 = a                                  t=0 is induced by

                                    at+1 = Rt+1 s(at ) + yt+1 :

                            at+1 g1
And the stochastic process f~     t=0 is induced by

                                    a
                                    ~t+1 = Rt+1 l(~
                                                  at ) + yt+1 :

   For a path of (Rt ; yt ), we have at     ~t . Thus for 8a >y, we have
                                            a
                                                              ¯
                                    Pr(at > a) Pr(~  at > a):


                                                11
This implies that
                              Pr(at+1 > a)        Pr(~
                                                     at+1 > a);
since the stochastic processes fat+1 g1        at+1 g1
                                      t=0 and f~     t=0 are ergodic. Thus

              Pr(at+1 > a)             Pr(~
                                          at+1 > a)       Pr(~

          a!1     a                a!1     a          a!1     a
Consider now the case in which the distribution of R is on a bounded support [R; R].
                                                                                 ¯
Along with Assumption 1.ii), we can now construct a su¢ cient condition on R: Evaluate
c(a)

     at a = y and compute R 1 c(y)y
                                      : If R 1 c(y)

of R; as follows: g(R; ") = (1 ")g(R) for any R 2 [R; R] and g(R;^ ") has mass ": Note
                                                     ¯
that g(:; 0) = g, so that we e¤ectively produced a continuous parametrization
                                                                     R            of the
distribution g. The parametrization is continuous in the sense that h(r)g(R; ")dR is

economy whose stationary distribution of wealth has fat tails even with a distribution
of R which is bounded above. What is really needed is that the distribution of R has
any positive density above the R such that R 1 c(y)   y

connected.


5    General equilibrium
In this section we embed the analysis of the distribution of wealth induced by the IF
problem in general equilibrium. Following Angeletos (2007) we assume that each agent
acts as entrepreneur of his own individual …rm. Each …rm has a constant returns to scale
neo-classical production function
                                        F (k; n; A)
where k; n are, respectively, capital and labor, and A is an idiosyncratic productivity
shock. Agents can only use their own savings as capital in their own …rm. In each
period t + 1, each agent observes his/her …rm’s productivity shock At+1 and decides how
much labor to hire in a competitive labor market, nt+1 . Therefore, each …rm faces the
same market wage rate wt+1 . The capital he/she invests is instead predetermined, but
the agent can decide not to engage in production, in which case nt+1 = 0 and the capital


                                             12
invested is carried over (with no return nor depreciation) to the next period. The …rm’s
pro…ts in period t + 1 are denoted t+1 :

                 t+1   = max fF (kt+1 ; nt+1 ; At+1 )               wnt+1 + (1            )kt+1 ; kt+1 g :           (5)

    Letting each agent’s earnings in period t + 1 are denoted wt+1 et+1 , where et+1 is
his/her idiosyncratic (exogenous) labor supply, we have

                                          at+1 =      t+1   + wt+1 et+1 :

Furthermore,
                                                kt+1 = at             ct :
       Given a sequence fwt g1
                             t=0 ; each agent solves the following modi…ed IF problem:

                                                                      X

De…nition 2 A stationary general equilibrium in our economy consists of a constant
wage rate w, sequences fct ; nt g1                    1
                                  t=0 ; fkt+1 ; at+1 gt=0 which constitute a solution to the Gen
Eq IF problem under wt = w for any t               0, and a distribution v(at+1 ), such that the
following conditions hold:
    (i) labour markets clear: Ent = Eet ; 15
    (ii) v is a stationary distribution of at+1 .

    We can now illustrate how such an equilibrium can be constructed, inducing a sta-
tionary distribution of wealth v(at+1 ) with the same properties, notably the fat tail, as
the one characterized in the previous section under appropriate assumptions for the sto-
                                      1
chastic processes fAt+1 g1
                         t=0 and fet gt=0 . The …rst order conditions of each agent …rm’s
labor choice requires
                               @F
                                  (kt+1 ; nt+1 ; At+1 ) = wt+1 ;
                               @n
which, under constant returns to scale implies,
                                     @F            nt+1
                                              1;        ; At+1          = wt+1 :                                     (6)
                                     @n            kt+1
  15
    The usual abuse of the Law of Large Number guarantees that the market clearing condition as
stated holds in the cross-section of agents.

                                                          13
Equation (6) can be solved to give
                  nt+1
                       = n (wt+1 ; At+1 ) ; or nt+1 = g (wt+1 ; At+1 ) kt+1 :
                  kt+1

The market clearing condition i) in De…nition 2 is then satis…ed by a constant wage rate
w such that

                             Ent+1 = E (g (w; At+1 )) Ekt+1 ;
as long as the process fAt+1 g1
                              t=0 is i.i.d. over time and in the cross-section and Ekt+1 is
constant over time.
    From the constant returns to scale assumption, once again, we can write pro…ts t+1
as:
                                        t+1 = Rt+1 kt+1

where fRt+1 g1                                    1
             t=0 is induced by the process fAt+1 gt=0 as follows:

                                    @F         nt+1
                    Rt+1 = max            1;        ; At+1   +1     ; 1 :
                                    @k         kt+1

Letting then yt+1 = wet+1 ; the dynamic equation for wealth can be written as

                               at+1 = Rt+1 (at      ct ) + yt+1 :

    We conclude that the solution to Gen Eq IF induces a stochastic process fat+1 g1   t=0
which has the same properties as the one induced by the IF problem as long as i) Ekt+1
                                                                                       1
is constant and ii) the process fRt+1 g1                       1
                                        t=0 induced by fAt+1 gt=0 and the processfyt gt=0
                  1
induced by fet gt=0 satisfy Assumption 1. In particular, in this case, fat+1 g1 t=0 has a
unique stationary distribution. The stationary distribution of fat+1 g1t=0 induces in turn
a stationary distribution of kt+1 . The aggregate capital Ekt+1 is the …rst moment of the
stationary distribution of kt+1 and is therefore constant. As a consequence, the labor
market indeed clear with a constant wage w as postulated. It is veri…ed then that at a
stationary general equilibrium, as long as ii) above is satis…ed, the stochastic process
fat+1 g1
       t=0 has the same properties as the one induced by the IF problem; it displays, in
particular, a fat tail.


6      Simulation
In this section we carry out a simulation of the Bewley economy we studied in the paper.
The objective is simply to illustrate that a reasonable (though not calibrated) parameter
set produces a stationary wealth distribution which is Pareto in the tail with an exponent


                                               14
in the same order of magnitude as the one estimated for various developed economies,
that is, about 2.16 We shall defer a careful calibration exercise to future work.17
     Consider a Bewley economy as introduced in Section 2, with the following speci…-
cations: log preferences ( = 1); a uniformly distributed earnings process over support
[1; 44]; a rate of return process Rt de…ned on [0:8; 1; 1:08; 9] with associated probabilities
[0:2; 0:4; 0:39; 0:01]; = 0:92:18
     Under this speci…cation, we solve for the consumption function which, consistently
with Propositions 4 and 5, is a concave function linear in the tail, as shown in Figure 1.




                                Figure 1: Consumption function

The stationary distribution of wealth, obtained for a million households after iterating
for 400 periods, is shown in Figure 2.19
  16
     See the references in footnote 5.
  17
     Calibrating the (idiosyncratic component of) the rate of return on wealth, in particular, appears
delicate. However, Saez and Zucman (2014)’s method produces a large idiosyncratic variance consistent
with the large documented variability of two major components of capital income, ownership of princi-
pal residence (see Case and Shiller, 1989; and Flavin and Yamashita, 2002) and private business equity
(Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2002; and Bitler, Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2005). See An-
geletos (2007), Quadrini (2000), and Benhabib and Zhu (2008) for more evidence on the macroeconomic
relevance of idiosyncratic capital income risk.
  18
     The process Rt implies an expected return of 7% and hence ER < 1 is satis…ed.
  19
     We determine that a stationary distribution once we …nd convergence of cut-o¤s for wealth quintiles
as well as top decile and percentile. Given the large returns available, convergence requires a large
number of simulated households.

The distribution of wealth by quintiles and for top shares for the U.S. economy and the
model is given below:

While the match for quintiles and top shares seems quite reasonable,20 the tail index or
Pareto tail for the U.S. economy is smaller than in the simulation (between 1:5 2:0
rather than 2:1).21 .
  20
     This comparison implicitly assumes that the wealth distribution for the U.S. is close to stationary.
This might in general not be the case if the wealth distribution is hit frequently enough by aggregate
shocks like wars, major business cycle events (e.g., a depression), changes in tax schemes, social insurance
institutions, and so on; see Saez and Piketty (2003). We leave the study of the transition of the
distribution of wealth for future work.
  21
     The tail exponent is computed using a Matlab package, pl…t, based on Clauset, Shalizi, and Newman
(2009).


                                                    16
    Our analysis of the stochastic process of wealth induced by stochastic earnings and
capital income risk has direct implications with regards to the social mobility at the
stationary distribution. From our simulations we compute the 5-year quintile transition
matrix which we compare to the corresponding transition matrix for the U.S., estimated
by Klevmarken, Lupton and Sta¤ord (2003) for 1994-1999 (see Table 9, p. 342).22 There
are several methods to more formally measure social mobility for transition matrices.23 .
We adopt the Shorrocks index, which gives the average probability over all wealth classes
of leaving the initial wealth class over the observation period.24 This index takes value
0:8375 for the simulated 5-year quintile transition matrix, while only 0:6610 for the
corresponding matrix for the U.S., indicating that our speci…cation overestimates social
mobility. A similar result is obtained when we compare the Shorrocks index of social
mobility for the transition matrix from our simulation with the corresponding one for
the U.S. estimated by Hurst and Kerwin (2003), Tables 2 and 5.25 In this case, however,
the overestimation of social mobility in the simulation is more moderate: the Shorrocks
index is :9516 and :885 respectively for the simulated matrix and the U.S. matrix.26 We
conclude that, while i.i.d. shocks can generate a fat right tail not too di¤erent from the
one observed in the data, further and careful calibrations would be required to more
closely match other aspects of to data, in particular the tail index and social mobility
jointly. To this end it seems of …rst order importance to allow for persistence in both the
earnings and in the capital income risk processes. We in fact experimented along these
lines, introducing a small degree of persistence in the returns with a transition matrix
that slightly deviates from the i.i.d. case. Persistence indeed shifts the distribution to
the right and reduces social mobility, thereby helping the model to better …t both the

Since the quintile transition matrix is obtained from the stationary distribution it is time homogeneous
and the t-years transition matrix, for any t > 1; is then simply computed as T t :

     See, e.g., Section 5 in Dardanoni (1993).                                                 X

     Hurst and Kerwin (2003)’s matrix is a sample cross-section average over 10–15 years, from 1985-89
to 1999. The simulated matrix we construct for comparison is a 12-year quintile transmission matrix.
  26
     The same qualitative result is obtained comparing our simulated quintile transition process with
the 6-year quintile matrix obtained by Kennickell and Starr-McCluer (1997), Table 6. Also, measures of
social mobility alternative to Shorrocks index, like the second largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix
(see Dardanoni (1993), yield no qualitative di¤erences in all these comparisons .

stationary distribution of wealth as well as relevant aspects of social mobility. Also, some
non-homogeneity in savings, beyond that implied by the concave consumption function
of the Bewley model, may be introduced to account for fatter tails and less social mobility
in wealth distribution.


7    Conclusions
In this paper we construct a general equilibrium model with idiosyncratic capital income
risks in a Bewley economy and analytically demonstrate that the resulting wealth distri-
bution has a fat right tail under well de…ned and natural conditions on the parameters
and stochastic structure of the economy. Simulations con…rm that, once idiosyncratic
capital income risk is taken into account, Bewley models can reproduce fundamental
stylized properties of the wealth distribution observed in the data for the U.S. and other
developed economies.

Appendix

Proof of Theorem 1. A feasible policy c(a) is said to overtake another feasible policy
c^(a) if starting from the same initial wealth a0 , the policies c(a) and c^(a) yield stochastic
consumption processes (ct ) and (^    ct ) that satisfy
                      " T                        #
                       X
                             t
                    E          (u(ct ) u(^  ct )) > 0   for all T > some T0 :
                            t=0

Also, a feasible policy is said to be optimal if it overtakes all other feasible policies.
    Proof: For an a0 , the stochastic consumption process (ct ) is induced by the policy
c(a). Let (^ct ) be an alternative stochastic consumption process, starting from the same
initial wealth a0 . By the strict concavity of u( ), we have
                      " T                     #    " T                     #
                       X                             X
                             t                            t 0
                    E          (u(ct ) u(^
                                         ct ))   E         u (ct )(ct c^t ) :
                            t=0                                           t=0

      From the budget constraint we have

                                              at+1 = Rt+1 (at         ct ) + yt+1

and

                                                          at          c^t ) + yt+1 :
      For a path of (Rt ; yt ), we have

                                        at+1 a^t+1
                                                   = at              ct     (^
                                                                             at        c^t )                                (7)
                                           Rt+1
and
                                                                      at+1 a^t+1
                                        ct       c^t = at      a
                                                               ^t                :

Therefore we have

                     T                                   X

                           u (ct )(ct         c^t ) =          u (ct ) at         a
                                                                                  ^t                       :

Proof of Proposition 1. The Euler equation of this problem is

                                                           ct     = ERt+1 ct+1 :                                                               (10)

      Guess ct = at . From the Euler equation (10) we have
                                                                                         1

which is > 0 by Assumption 1.iii).

                                                                           26
   It is easy to verify the transversality condition,
                                                     t
                                          lim E          ct at = 0:
                                         t!1

   Let V t (a) be the optimal value function of an agent who has wealth a and has t
periods to the end T . Thus we have

                V t (a) = max u(c) + EV t                   1
                                                                (R(a     c) + y)    for t > 1
                                 c a

and
                                                V 1 (a) = max u(c):
                                                               c a

   We have the Euler equation of this problem, for t > 1

         u0 (ct (a))       E[Ru0 (ct 1 (R(a              ct (a)) + y)] with equality if ct (a) < a.



Proof of Proposition 2. Continuity is a consequence of the Theorem of the Maximum
and mathematical induction. The proof that ct (a) and st (a) are increasing can be easily
adapted from the proof of Theorem 1.5 of Schechtman (1976); it makes use of the fact
that ct (a) > 0, a consequence of Inada conditions which hold for CRRA utility functions.


Proof of Theorem 2. By Lemma 1 we know that c(a) satis…es the Euler equation.
Now we verify that c(a) satis…es the transversality condition (2).
  By Lemma 1 and Theorem 2 we have

                                                    ct          at :

   Note that at        y for t         1. We have
                       ¯
                                                                1
                                   u0 (ct )at              y           for t   1:
                                                           ¯
Thus
                                          lim E t u0 (ct )at = 0:
                                          t!1



Proof of Proposition 3. By Lemma 1, c(a) is continuous. Thus s(a) is continuous
since s(a) = a c(a).
    Also, by Lemma 1, limt!1 st (a) = s(a), since limt!1 ct (a) = c(a), st (a) = a ct (a),
and s(a) = a c(a). The conclusion that c(a) and s(a) are increasing in a follows from
part (ii) of Proposition 2.

                                                           27
    Note that Proposition 3 implies that c(a) and s(a) are Lipschitz continuous. For a
                                                                                     ~,

                                                                              c(^

By Lemma 4 we know that                          > 0. Thus we …nd                   from equation (22)
                                                                           1

Thus    = .

Proof of Theorem 3. The proof requires several steps.

Lemma 6 The wealth accumulation process (at ) is                 irreducible.

Proof. First we show that the process (at ) is ' irreducible. We construct a measure '
on [y,1) such that                         Z
    ¯
                                 '(A) =        f (y)dy:
                                                    A

where f (y) is the density of labor earnings fyg : Note that the borrowing constraint
binds in …nite time with a positive probability for 8a0 2 [y,1). Suppose not. For any
                                                             ¯
…nite t 0, we have at >y and u0 (ct ) = ERt+1 u0 (ct+1 ). Following    the same procedure
                           ¯
as in the proof of Lemma 2, we obtain a contradiction. IfR the borrowing constraint binds
at period t, then at+1 = yt+1 . Thus any set A such that A f (y)dy > 0 can be reached in
…nite time with a positive probability. The process (at ) is ' irreducible.
    By Proposition 4.2.2 in Meyn and Tweedie (2009), there exists a probability measure
   on [y,1) such that the process fat+1 g1t=0 is    irreducible, since it is ' irreducible.
       ¯


Lemma 7 a = y is a re‡ecting barrier of the process (at ).
                 ¯
Proof. If at =y, then there exists y^ close to y such that Pr(at+1 2 [^    y ; y]jat =y) =
Pr(yt+1 2 [^      ¯
           y ; y]) > 0, since s(y) = 0. To show that at+2 can be greater than y with  ¯ a
                                 ¯
positive probability, it is su¢ cient to show that s(y) > 0. Suppose that s(y) = 0. Thus
s(a) = 0 for a 2 [y, y]. Thus by the Euler equation we have
                    ¯
                                   (y)      E Rt (yt )   :

This is impossible under Assumption 1.i). Thus s(y) > 0 and a =y is a re‡ecting barrier
of the process fat+1 g1t=0 .
    To show that there exists a unique stationary wealth distribution, we have to show
that the process (at ) is ergodic. Actually, we can show that it is geometrically ergodic.


Lemma 8 The process fat+1 g1
                           t=0 is geometrically ergodic.


Proof. To show that the process (at ) is geometrically ergodic, we use part (iii) of
Theorem 15.0.1 of Meyn and Tweedie (2009). We need to verify that

a the process fat+1 g1
                     t=0 is         irreducible;
                                      28
b the process fat+1 g1
                     t=0 is aperiodic;   and

    By Lemma 6, the process fat+1 gt=0 is         irreducible.
    For a ' irreducible Markov process, when there exists a v1 small set A with v1 (A) >
0,30 then the stochastic process is called strongly aperiodic; see Meyn and Tweedie (2009,
p. 114). We construct a measure v1 on [y,1) such that
                                            ¯ Z
                                     v1 (A) =      f (y)dy:
                                                     A
By Lemma 2, we know that s(a) = 0, 8a 2 [y; ]. Thus [y; ] is v1 small and v1 ([y; ]) =
R                                              ¯          ¯                           ¯

    f (y)dy > 0. The process (at ) is strongly aperiodic.

    We now show that an interval [y,B] is a petite set for 8B >y. To show this, we …rst
show that Rs(a)+y< a for a 2 (y; 1).  ¯ For s(a) = 0, this is obviously
                                                                   ¯      true. For s(a) > 0,
            ¯      ¯              ¯
suppose that Rs(a)+y a, we have
               ¯        ¯
                    u0 (c(a)) = ERt u0 (c(Rt s(a) + y))    ERt u0 (c(a)):
We obtain a contradiction since Assumption 1.iv) implies that ERt < 1. Also by
Lemma 2, there exists an interval [y; ], such that s(a) = 0, 8a 2 [y; ]. For an interval
                                      ¯
[y,B], 8a0 2 [y,B], there exists a common   t such that the borrowing¯ constraint binds at
 ¯            ¯
periodRt with a positive probability. Then for any set A [y, y], Pr(at+1 2 Ajs(at ) =
0) = A f (y)dy. Note that a t step probability transition¯ kernel is the probability
transition kernel of a speci…c sampled chain. Thus we construct a measure va on [y,1)
                                                                                     ¯
such that va has a positive measure on [y, y] and va ((y; 1)) = 0. The t step probability
                                         ¯
transition kernel of a process starting from  8a0 2 [y,B] is greater than the measure va .
An interval [y,B] is a petite set for 8B >y.          ¯
    We pick ¯a function V (a) = a + 1, 8a  ¯ 2 [y,1). Thus V (a) > 1 for a 2 [y,1).
Pick 0 < q < 1        ERt . Let = 1        ERt ¯ q > 0 and b = 1         ERt + Ey. ¯ Pick
                              b
B > y, such that B + 1        q
                                . Let C = [y,B]. Thus C is a petite set. Therefore, for
      ¯
8at 2 [y,1), we have                        ¯
        ¯
              EV (at+1 ) V (at ) = E (at+1 ) at
                                        (1      ERt ) V (at ) + 1  ERt + Ey
                                         V (at ) + bIC (at )
where IC ( ) is an indicator function.
   By Theorem 15.0.1 of Meyn and Tweedie (2009) the process (at ) is geometrically
ergodic.
