                                              ABSTRACT

Federal tax policy provides a broad array of incentives for energy investment. I review those policies
and construct estimates of marginal effective tax rates for different energy capital investments as of
2007. Effective tax rates vary widely across investment classes. I then consider investment in wind
generation capital and regress investment against a user cost of capital measure along with other controls.
I find that wind investment is strongly responsive to changes in tax policy. Based on the coefficient
estimates the elasticity of investment with respect to the user cost of capital is in the range of -1 to
-2. I also demonstrate that the federal production tax credit plays a key role in driving wind investment
over the past eighteen years.

                     Investment in Energy Infrastructure and the Tax Code

I.         Introduction

           Investment in new energy capital infrastructure is much in the news these days.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included over $60 billion in

funds for clean energy investments. If passed the American Clean Energy and Security

Act of 2009 will implement a cap and trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions –

nearly 80 percent of which are associated with energy production or consumption – and

implement a new mandate for renewable electricity with 20 percent to be provided by

renewable sources by 2020.1 New capital investments are critical to the Administration's

goals of reducing our reliance on petroleum products and in reducing greenhouse gas

emissions.

           The tax code has historically been a significant policy instrument for shaping

energy decisions in the marketplace. Much attention has been paid to the magnitude of

federal dollars supporting different energy sources. A recent study by the U.S. Energy

Information Administration (2008a), for example, estimates that roughly two-thirds of

tax-subsidies for energy production were received by producers of fossil fuels in 1999 in

contrast to one-third for producers of renewable energy. By 2007 the share going to

renewable producers had risen to nearly forty percent while the share going to fossil fuel

producers had fallen to less than fifty percent.

           While much is known about the number and dollar value of tax benefits,

surprisingly little is known about how the tax code affects investment in energy capital.

This paper seeks to fill that gap. I begin by reviewing key energy tax code provisions in

the next section. In section III I construct measures of the effective tax rate on various

                                                                                             1
forms of energy capital. The following section provides an empirical analysis of

investment in wind power taking tax considerations into account. Section V concludes.

         Before turning to these issues it may be useful to provide a bit of an overview on

U.S. energy production and our energy capital infrastructure. Figure 1 shows the

distribution of domestic energy production by fuel source for 2007. Domestic production

of energy totaled 71.5 quadrillion BTUs (or quads) in that year. Roughly one-third of the

energy we produce is coal – the United States is second only to China in world coal

production. Natural gas accounts for just over one-quarter and crude oil (including

natural gas plant liquids) just under one-fifth. Solar, geothermal and wind account for

just one percent of U.S. energy production.2

 Energy consumption totaled 101.5 quads in 2007. The difference between consumption and production is
made up of energy imports. In 2007 the United States imported (net of exports) 26.6 quads of crude and
petroleum products and 4.0 quads of natural gas.

                 Table 1 provides some numbers on the value of fixed assets related to

energy production in 2007. The infrastructure related to energy production amounted to

nearly $2.9 trillion. This amounts to twelve percent of the value of the net stock of non-

residential fixed assets in that year.3 The bulk of energy related assets are structures –

electrical generation facilities and mining exploration, shafts and wells.

II.      Review of key energy tax code provisions

         Energy is subject to taxes and at the same time the beneficiary of various tax

deductions and credits at both the federal and state level. In this section, I review the

current treatment of energy in the tax code.4

A.       Federal Tax Provisions

         To begin, income earned in the production or distribution of energy is subject to

the U.S. income tax. Most energy-related income is taxed through the corporate income

tax with a top federal marginal tax rate of 35 percent. Table 2 indicates the share of

assets taxed through the corporate income tax in various energy-related industries.5 For

the mining, utilities, and petroleum and coal manufacturing sectors, the vast bulk of

assets are subject to corporate income tax.

         I analyze energy investments in this paper assuming firms are subject to federal

and state corporate income taxes. Many energy firms are subject to the corporate

alternative minimum tax (AMT). While I do not analyze the corporate AMT in detail in

 Firms not subject to corporate tax treatment include S-corporations, individuals participating in

this paper I do note in various places where my analytic results can be affected by the

AMT.6

1.      Depreciation

        Under the current tax code, capital assets are depreciated according to the

Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) with recovery periods ranging

from 3 to 39 years. Most capital is depreciated using a declining balance method at either

200 percent (3, 5, 7, and 10 year property) or 150 percent (15 and 20 year property) with

the option to shift to straight-line depreciation at whichever point it becomes

advantageous to do so. Assuming firms switch to straight-line depreciation at the point

where straight-line provides a larger deduction than declining balance, the two key

parameters are the recovery period of the asset and the declining balance deduction rate.

Tax depreciation effectively reduces the purchase price of an asset. If z is the present

discounted value of the stream of depreciation deductions per dollar for an asset and τ

the corporate tax rate, then tax depreciation reduces the price of the asset from one to

1−τ ⋅ z .

        Electric generating capital is depreciated over different tax lives depending on the

type of plant. Recovery periods range from five years for renewable energy to twenty

years for coal. High voltage electricity transmission lines received a 15 year recovery

period in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That act also clarified the depreciation of

natural gas gathering (7 years) and reduced the recovery period of distribution pipelines

from 20 to 15 years. In addition, the law contained a provision allowing partial

corporate income tax.


                                                                                                    5
expensing for new refinery capacity placed in service before 2012. The provision allows

for 50 percent expensing with the remainder deducted as under current law.

        Oil and gas drilling receives an additional depreciation benefit from the ability to

expense dry holes. One can view dry holes as part of the cost of drilling a successful

well. This tax provision raises the effective value of the depreciation deductions for oil

rigs. Technology, however, has reduced the percentage of dry holes. In 1960, forty

percent of all wells drilled were dry holes. By 2008, that percentage had fallen to ten

percent reducing the tax advantage of dry hole expensing.7

2.      Depreciation and Fossil Fuel Production

        Depreciation of assets in the production of fossil fuels (oil and gas drilling and

coal mining) deserve additional attention. Chief among the depreciation preferences are

percentage depletion and the ability to expense intangible drilling costs. As noted in

Metcalf (2007) these preferences are less generous than they have been historically but

they continue to be significant. A bit of background will help in understanding these tax

benefits.

        Capital investments to develop oil and gas production sites fall into one of three

categories for federal tax purposes. Costs incurred in finding and acquiring the rights to

oil or gas are treated as depletable property and are written off over the life of the oil or

gas site. These include exploration costs to identify promising sites as well as the cost of

up-front (or bonus) bids to acquire sites. Once a site is identified and purchased, its oil or



7
  Exploratory wells continue to have high failure rates. In 2008, 32 percent of exploratory wells were dry
holes and 8 percent of development wells were dry holes. But only 5,600 exploratory wells were drilled
that year compared to over 50,100 development wells. Roughly 34,000 development wells were drilled in
1960 with a dry hole rate of 25 percent. However, 11,700 exploratory wells were drilled with over 80
percent of them being dry holes. Data are taken from the Energy Information Administration's website

                                                                                                        6
gas enters a firm's proven reserves. As natural resources are extracted from booked

reserves, the value of those reserves is diminished. Cost depletion allows a firm to write

off depletable costs as the reserve is drawn down. As an example imagine a field that

contains two million barrels of proven reserves of oil with exploration and purchase costs

of $10 million. Under cost depletion, the firm is allowed to write off the $10 million cost

as oil is drilled. Thus if the firm pumps 100,000 barrels of oil from the field in the first

year, it would be allowed cost depletion of $500,000 since the amount pumped equals 5

percent of the proven reserves.8

        As an alternative to cost depletion, independent oil, gas, and coal producers are

allowed to take percentage depletion.9 Rather than take a depletion deduction based on

actual costs, the firm is allowed to take a certain percentage of revenue as a deduction.

The current rate for percentage depletion is 15 percent for oil and gas and 10 percent for

coal. Percentage depletion is allowed on production up to 1,000 barrels of average daily

production of oil (or its equivalent for natural gas) for the company. In addition, the

depletion allowance cannot exceed 100 percent of taxable income from the property (50

percent for coal) and 65 percent of taxable income from all sources.10 Continuing with

the example above, assume an independent firm owns this oil reserve and sells the

100,000 barrels of oil pumped in the first year for $60 per barrel. Assuming no taxable

income limitations, the firm could take a deduction for 15 percent of the revenue from the

sale of the oil or $900,000. If the firm were to sell the entire reserve of oil at $60 per



8
  Geological and geophysical costs may be amortized over two years (seven years for the majors).
9
  Independent producers are defined as producers who do not engage in refining or retail operations.
EPACT increased the amount of oil a company could refine before it was deemed to engage in refining for
this purpose from 50,000 to 75,000 barrels per day.
10
   Amounts in excess of the 65 percent rule can be carried forward to subsequent tax years.


                                                                                                      7
barrel its cumulative depletion allowance would be $18 million, eighty percent greater

than the depletable costs of the field.

          Significant limits on percentage depletion have been added over time including a

reduction in its rate and limitation to independent producers. Despite the curtailed

availability of percentage depletion, it continues to be a significant energy tax

expenditure, costing $4.4 billion between 2009 and 2013 according to the 2009

Administration budget submission (Office of Management and Budget (2009)). Based on

production data reported in U.S. Energy Information Administration (2009b), roughly

one-half of domestic crude oil production in 2007 came from independent producers

(Table A6) potentially eligible to take percentage depletion.

          Once a property has been identified, the firm incurs significant costs to develop

the site. These costs, which might include site improvement, construction costs, wages,

drilling mud, fuel, and other expenses, are called intangible drilling costs (or IDCs).

Intangible drilling costs are all costs for which no salvage value is possible. Typically

non-capital costs associated with developing a capital asset are depreciated over the life

of the asset under the uniform capitalization rules. In the energy sector intangible drilling

costs may be expensed by independent producers. Integrated producers may expense 70

percent of IDCs and write the remainder off over a five year period.11

          The last capital expense category is the drilling equipment itself. This is written

off over a seven year period using double declining balance depreciation rules. Drilling

equipment constituted roughly ten percent of total capital costs for new projects in 2007

according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (2008b) (table T7). Depletable



11
     Intangible drilling costs are not counted as a preference under the Alternative Minimum Tax.


                                                                                                    8
costs constituted roughly one-quarter of total costs and IDCs accounted for roughly two-

thirds of costs.

3.        Production and Investment Tax Credits

          The federal tax code includes a number of production and investment tax credits

on fossil, alternative, nuclear, and renewable fuels. These are included as part of the

general business credit (GBC) and subject to AMT limitations. Carlson and Metcalf

(2008) provide evidence that energy firms are restricted in their ability to use all of their

general business credits. While the AMT plays a role, regular tax limitations play a more

significant role in limiting the use of GBCs. The important energy-related production

and investment credits include the following:

a.        Production Tax Credits for Electricity Provided from Renewable Sources

          Production tax credits are provided at a rate of 1.5¢ per kWh (indexed in 1992

dollars) of electricity generated from wind, biomass, poultry waste, solar, geothermal and

other renewable sources.12 Currently the rate is 2.1¢ per kWh. Firms may take the credit

for ten years. Refined coal is also eligible for a section 45 production credit at the current

rate of $5.877 per ton.13 The Energy Policy Act of 2005 added new hydropower and

Indian coal with the latter receiving a credit of $1.50 per ton for the first four years and

$2.00 per ton for three additional years (in real dollars).

          Production tax credits have historically been authorized by Congress for a two

year period. Considerable uncertainty has arisen a number of times whether Congress

would reauthorize the credit or not. The credit lapsed three times (2000, 2002, and 2004)

though subsequently reauthorized retroactively. Distinct declines in wind investment


12
     Open-loop biomass is eligible for a 0.75¢ in 1992 dollars per kWh.
13
     Refined coal is a synthetic fuel produced from coal with lower emissions of certain pollutants.


                                                                                                       9
occurred in each of those periods of uncertainty as documented in Wiser and Bolinger

(2008). The current credit for wind was renewed in the American Reinvestment and

Recovery Act of 2009 and is currently available for projects completed before the end of

2012.

           Concern arose in 2008 that the financial crisis was drying up considerable sources

of financing for wind projects. Anecdotal evidence suggests this is a real problem.

According to Martin, Hansen, Marciano and Katz (2009) the number of large financial

institutions providing equity to the renewable industry in return for access to tax shields

has declined from eighteen in the past two years to four or five presently. As a response

ARRA allowed wind projects to substitute a 30 percent investment tax credit for the

production tax credit or a cash grant for up to 30 percent of the cost of the project.14

b.         Other Production Tax Credits

           The 2005 energy act provided a production tax credit for electricity produced at

nuclear power plants (section 45J). Qualifying plants are eligible for a 1.8¢ per kWh

production tax credit for eight years up to an annual limit of $125 million per 1,000

megawatts of installed capacity. This limit will be binding for a nuclear power plant with

a capacity factor of 80 percent or higher. The law places an aggregate limit of 6,000

megawatts of capacity eligible for this credit.

           The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (PL 108-357) created a production

credit (section 45I) for marginal oil and gas producers of $3.00 per barrel of oil ($.50 per

mcf of natural gas) in year 2005 dollars. The full credit is available when oil (gas) prices

fall below $15 per barrel ($1.67 per mcf) and phases out when prices reach $18 per barrel



14
     Bolinger, Wiser, Cory and James (2009) assess the relative advantages of the various options.


                                                                                                     10
($2.00 per mcf).15 Marginal wells produce on average 15 or less barrels of oil (or oil

equivalent) per day.

            This same law provided for small refinery expensing of 75 percent of capital costs

associated with low sulfur diesel fuel production and a 5¢ per gallon small refiner's credit

for the remaining 25 percent of qualified capital costs for the production of low sulfur

diesel fuel. The 2005 Energy Policy Act allowed a pass through of this credit to owners

of cooperatives.

            Coke and coke gas producers are eligible for a $3 per barrel equivalent tax credit

under section 45K of the tax code. This is the last vestige of the previous section 29 non-

conventional oil production tax credit and is scheduled to expire at the end of 2009.

d.          Investment Tax Credits

            A 30 percent investment tax credit is available for solar installations as well as

fuel cells used to produce electricity. A 10 percent credit is available for qualifying

microturbine power plants. In addition to credits for renewable energy, the Energy

Policy Act of 2005 enacted credits for investments in certain clean coal facilities.

Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants are eligible for a 20 percent credit

(up to a maximum of $800 million in credits); other advanced coal-based projects are

eligible for a 15 percent credit (up to a maximum of $500 million in credits); and certified

gasification projects are also eligible for a 20 percent credit (maximum of $350 million in

credits).

            The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 contained a provision for a 15

percent credit (section 43) for expenditures on enhanced oil recovery tangible property

and intangible drilling and development costs and other related capital expenditures. The
15
     The section 29 reference price is used to determine eligibility for this credit.


                                                                                                 11
credit is phased out as the section 29 reference oil price exceeds $28 in 1990 dollars

($37.44 for 2005). At current prices, producers cannot take this credit.

e.        Section 40 Alcohol and Biodiesel Fuels Credit

          The Energy Policy Act of 1978 included an exemption from the motor fuels

excise tax for alcohol and alcohol blended fuels, generically known as gasohol.16 The

Windfall Profits Tax allowed an immediate tax credit in lieu of the exemption.17 The

credit was set at a rate to be equivalent to the tax exemption. The alcohol fuel mixture

credit is currently $.45 per gallon of ethanol in gasohol and $.60 for other alcohol based

fuels (excluding petroleum based alcohol fuels). In addition small producers may take a

credit of $.10 per gallon. The 2005 Energy Policy Act increased the small producer

production capacity limit from 30 million to 60 million gallons per year.

          The American Jobs Creation Act also added section 40A to the code to provide an

income tax credit for biodiesel fuels at a rate of $.50 per gallon of bio-diesel (other than

agri-biodiesel) and $1.00 for agri-biodiesel. Like the alcohol fuel tax credit, it is first

applied to motor fuel excise tax payments with the excess added to the general business

credit.

B.        State Tax Provisions

          Most states levy a corporate income tax with top rates that varied from two to

twelve percent in 2006. In addition thirty-five states impose severance taxes on mineral

extraction in their states. Table 3 lists the top fifteen states in severance tax collections

ranked by amount of collections in fiscal year 2008. Alaska, Texas, and Oklahoma lead

16
   Originally, the law provided a full exemption from the then $.04 per gallon tax. As the motor fuels
excise tax was raised over time, the exemption did not keep pace with the excise tax rate. See General
Accounting Office (1997) for an early chronology of events related to this tax exemption.
17
   The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 subsequently eliminated the tax exemption in favor of the tax
credit.


                                                                                                      12
the list and account for two-thirds of total U.S. severance tax collections in that year.

These three states were among the top five oil producing states in 2008 (the other two

states are Louisiana and California). Wyoming is a significant oil and gas producing

state as well as the largest coal producing state in the country. While I do not have

detailed data breaking out severance tax collections by fuel, it appears that oil and gas are

responsible for the lion's share of revenue.

        The fifteen states in Table 3 account for over 95 percent of severance tax

collections in 2008. For many of these states severance taxes account for a large fraction

of total state tax revenues.

         In my analysis below of the impact of taxes on energy investment I take the state

corporate tax into account. I use an average tax rate of 6.6 percent which when combined

with the federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent gives a total corporate tax rate of 39.3

percent.18 I assume that severance taxes reduce the price paid to owners of land on which

the taxed energy sources are found. This follows from the inelasticity of supply of

reserves and the ease of substitutability among consumers across different state supplies

of coal, oil, or natural gas.

III.     Effective Tax Rates on Energy Capital Investments

         As the previous section makes clear the treatment of energy in the tax code is

complex. In this section I construct a summary measure of the tax code's provisions.

The tax literature contains a number of summary measures of the tax code and two

measures are particularly relevant for thinking about capital investment: the Hall

Jorgenson (1967) user cost of capital and marginal effective tax rates (see King and

Fullerton (1984) for a treatment of this latter measure). The first statistic measures the

required marginal product of capital that a firm must receive in order to pay its marginal

taxes and provide a required return to investors. Assuming declining marginal product of

capital, a higher user cost of capital is associated with lower demand for capital by a firm.

The latter measure is a transformation of the user cost measure that provides the same

information in the form of a tax rate. While either measure can be useful for empirical

work, the latter is more easily interpreted and so I report marginal effective tax rate

measures in this section.



18
   The state corporate tax rate is deductible from federal corporate income taxes. Thus the aggregate rate
equals 35% + (1-35%)(6.6%) or 39.3%. The state average tax rate is taken from the Ernst and Young
corporate state tax dataset as reported in Ernst & Young (2007).


                                                                                                         14
       Specifically I construct effective tax rates on capital investments in energy

infrastructure. An effective tax rate measures the difference in the before and after-tax

return on a marginal investment relative to its before-tax return. More precisely, the

before-tax return is the return an investment must earn in order to cover its cost, pay the

required return to investors and to pay taxes on the project. The after-tax return is the

return that savers expect to receive after taxes on marginal investments.

       Following the terminology in Congressional Budget Office (2005), let ρ be the

real before-tax return on the marginal investment for a particular capital asset category

and r the real return paid to investors. The effective tax rate is defined as


                                            ρ −r
(1)                                              .
                                              ρ

Thus, if savers are prepared to accept seven percent on an investment after tax (r) and

the project must earn ten percent in order to cover depreciation, taxes, and required

                                                                  ⎛ 10 − 7 ⎞
payments to investors ( ρ ), the effective tax rate is 30 percent ⎜        ⎟.
                                                                  ⎝ 10 ⎠

       Effective tax rates focus on the marginal cost of funding investments rather than

on project cost. In particular, it focuses on the cost of a break-even investment. Because

they summarize the many provisions of the tax code that affect the returns to capital

investment, effective tax rates are frequently used to consider how the tax system affects

capital investment. This is a particularly salient issue given the capital investment needs

of energy infrastructure in the United States as noted in the introduction.

       I follow the methodology of Congressional Budget Office ( (2005, 2006)) to

construct effective tax rates for energy capital. My measures differ from those reported




                                                                                            15
in the CBO reports in two ways. First, I analyze assets at a more disaggregated level than

is done in those reports. Second, I take into account more provisions of the tax code than

do those reports. In particular the CBO studies do not account for energy-specific

production or investment tax credits or for tax rules specific to the oil and gas industry. I

begin with a brief overview of the construction of effective tax rates. Readers seeking a

fuller description should read Congressional Budget Office (2006) or any of the

references cited therein. I then discuss how I modify the standard ETR measure for

energy-specific tax provisions.

        Ignoring energy specific deductions and credits, the required before-tax return is

equal to



(2)                                 ρ=
                                         (~r + δ )(1 − τz ) − δ .
                                         144− τ44
                                           12   3
                                                ucc


Equation (2) says that the real before-tax return equals the user cost of capital (ucc) less

the economic rate of depreciation. The parameter ~
                                                 r in equation (2) is the real corporate

discount rate measured as d (i (1 − τ ) − π ) + (1 − d ) E . The discount rate is a weighted

average of the real after-tax cost of borrowing where i is the corporate borrowing rate, π

is the expected inflation rate, τ is the corporate tax rate, d is the share of investment

financed by debt, and E is the real return on equity. Assets are assumed to depreciate at

an exponential rate with the rate of decay equal to δ . The present value of tax

depreciation is given by z and depends on tax rules specific to each asset.

        Equation (2) makes clear that either the user cost of capital or the effective tax

rate measure is a summary statistic for the tax code's various provisions and their impact

on marginal investments. In the next section I report regressions using the user cost of


                                                                                               16
capital measure as it is less sensitive to small changes in the firm's discount rate. In this

section I focus on the effective tax rate measure as it is a more easily interpretable

measure.

       In some cases, I compute effective tax rates for investments that are composed of

different types of capital each of which faces its own effective tax rate. In those cases I

construct before-tax returns for each capital component and compute the weighted

before-tax return for the investment weighting by the share of the component in the total

investment cost.

       A key element in the taxation of capital assets is the tax treatment of depreciation.

Let z equal the present discounted value of the stream of depreciation deductions

assuming particular tax rules for an asset. If Dt is the amount of depreciation allowed in

year t for an asset with initial basis of 1 and a recovery period of T years, then z equals


                                           T
                                                      Dt
(3)                                    z=∑                      .
                                           t =1   (1 + ~r )t −1
The present discounted value of depreciation deductions is equal to the tax rate times z

(assuming the tax rate does not change over the life of the asset). Thus, the effective

after-tax purchase price of an asset is equal to 1 − τ ⋅ z times the cost of the asset. Below,

I will show how the effective price is affected by energy-specific tax rules.

       Table 4 reports tax depreciation rules and estimates of economic depreciation for

various energy related assets. Capital shares are reported in parentheses after each asset

type. Capital shares for nuclear power plants are taken from Table 4.2.2 of Tennessee

Valley Authority (2005). This report provides cost estimates for an advanced boiling

water reactor that would be designed and constructed under the new combined



                                                                                              17
construction permit and operating license (COL) rules implemented in the Energy Policy

Act of 1992. Oil drilling costs vary depending on the particular characteristics of

different sites. I have chosen a representative set of cost shares to construct a composite

effective tax rate for drilling. The breakdown of intangible drilling costs for integrated

firms reflects tax rules allowing expensing for 70 percent of IDC costs with the remainder

to be deducted over five years.

           The formula for the before-tax return in equation 2 needs to be modified to

account for production and investment tax credits as well as for percentage depletion for

oil and gas drilling. Investment tax credits at rate κ are a straightforward modification.

Production tax credits and percentage depletion are slightly more complicated. Let θ be

the capacity factor for a renewable electricity investment. This would equal roughly 30

percent for wind, for example. A 1 kW facility produces 8760 θ kWhs of electricity over

the year where 8760 is the number of hours in a year. If p is the overnight cost of 1 kW

of capacity, a ten year production tax credit is worth (per dollar of investment)

depending on the particular source of oil. While the price of a barrel of oil is

straightforward to measure, the appropriate measure of operating profit per barrel of oil is

not. One approach to measuring operating profit might be to take the oil price and

subtract production costs (finding and lifting costs). The domestic first purchase price

for oil was roughly $60 in 2006. According to U.S. Energy Information Administration

(2007), production costs were roughly $25 per barrel. This suggests a mark-up of 1.71.

       Adelman (1995) cautions that the standard measure of finding costs (the sum of

exploration and development expenditures divided by oil and gas reserves added (in oil

equivalents)) is a flawed measure. As Adelman notes, exploration adds knowledge while

development adds reserves. The knowledge from exploration may add to reserves at

present but may not add to reserves for many years. In addition, the conversion of gas

into oil equivalents is not stable over time as it depends on how oil and gas are used as

well as their relative prices. The EIA study acknowledges the first problem and

addresses this by averaging finding costs over three years.

       Alternatively one could simply measure operating profit from firm balance sheets.

U.S. Energy Information Administration (2007), Table 9, reports income and expenses

for major energy producers. The ratio of revenue to operating income in 2006 was 1.86.

Based on these two estimates of the mark-up ratio ( μ ), I use a ratio of 1.75 in my

calculations below. Table 5 reports the parameters I use in my effective tax rate

calculations that are not technology specific.

          Table 6 below reports my estimates of effective tax rates on new energy-related

capital investments based on the formulas described above. I provide estimates for

different forms of electric generation capital, other electricity related capital, capital used

in the drilling and refining of oil as well as in the transport of natural gas.

          The first part of Table 6 provides estimates of effective tax rates for electric

generation capital. Under current law (column 1), solar thermal and wind capital is

subsidized to the greatest extent with effective marginal subsidy rates of 245 and 164

percent respectively. Nuclear power is also heavily subsidized with a subsidy rate of

nearly 100 percent. The effective tax rates for coal and gas are substantially higher than

for nuclear or renewables. IGCC capital is subsidized while pulverized coal capital faces

a positive tax. The major difference here is the 20 percent investment tax credit for new

IGCC investments. Finally, coal (PC) and natural gas combined cycle face an effective

tax rate very close to the statutory tax rate (39.3 percent accounting for state and federal

taxes).

         The next two columns in Table 6 indicate the impact on effective tax rates of

removing the production and investment tax credits (column 2) and replacing accelerated

depreciation with economic depreciation.21 The production or investment tax credits are

the most significant source of subsidy – as evidenced by the change in the effective tax

rate when the credits are removed. The effective tax rate for wind, for example, rises

from -164 percent to -14 percent if economic depreciation replaces accelerated

depreciation while it rises to +13 percent if the production tax credit is eliminated. With

economic depreciation and no production or investment tax credits, the effective tax rate

in all cases equals the statutory tax rate of 39.3 percent.



21
    Here the effective tax rate formula uses the exponential economic depreciation rate for tax depreciation
rather than approximating it with straight-line depreciation.


                                                                                                          22
         The effective tax rate methodology can be used for other types of energy capital.

In the electric utility section, I also construct effective tax rates for transmission and

distribution. Transmission lives are allowed a fifteen year recovery period while

distribution lines are allowed a twenty year recovery period. The former face an effective

tax rate modestly lower than the statutory rate while the latter receive very little in the

form of a subsidy.

         Effective tax rates in the petroleum sector depend in large part on whether the

firms taking the credits are integrated or non-integrated (independent) firms. Independent

firms benefit from full expensing of their intangible drilling costs while the integrated

firms can only expense 70 percent of their IDCs and must write the rest off over a five

year period. In addition, the independents are allowed to take percentage depletion while

the integrated firms must use cost depletion.

         The effective tax rate on oil drilling equipment depends importantly on the ability

to take percentage rather than cost depletion. For independent firms taking percentage

depletion, the effective tax rate is -13 percent whereas firms taking cost depletion face

effective tax rates of 15 percent. The rate for integrated firms is a bit lower than the

effective tax rate on refining capital. The effective tax rate for refining capital assumes

the temporary 50 percent expensing provision for capacity additions. This reflects the

fact that most new investment in refineries has been in increasing the capacity of existing

refineries rather than in building new refineries.22 In the absence of the temporary

expensing provision, the effective tax rate on refinery capital would rise from 19 to 32

percent. The lower tax rate on gathering pipelines relative to other pipelines reflects the

22
   The number of operable refineries has been steadily declining from its recent peak of 324 in 1981 to
150 in 2008. Gross inputs to refineries, on the other hand, has increased by nearly twenty percent over this
same period. See Table 5.9 in U.S. Energy Information Administration (2009a).


                                                                                                         23
seven year recovery period for this capital versus the fifteen year recovery period for

other pipelines.

       The effective tax rate for independent firms taking percentage depletion is

sensitive to the ratio of price to operating profit per barrel. Figure 2 shows how the

effective tax rate changes as this ratio changes. Percentage depletion drives the effective

tax rate down as the oil price relative to per barrel operating profits falls. The rising cost

of extracting oil in the United States means that the effective tax rate for independent

firms able to take percentage depletion is falling holding other factors constant.

       This section has provided current estimates of effective tax rates for energy

capital investment taking into account energy-specific provisions of the tax code. What

effect do these provisions have on energy investment? In the next section I make a

preliminary estimate of the impact by considering the relationship between taxation and

investment in wind power.

IV.     Analysis of Wind Investment

        In this section I provide an initial analysis of the impact of tax policy on wind

investment. I focus on wind because it is the most rapidly growing source of renewable

electricity investment in the United States and the perceived importance of the production

tax credit in driving that growth. I carry out an econometric analysis of wind investment

to measure the impact of the tax code on that investment.

        Little empirical work has been carried out to measure the impact of government

policy on wind power investment. Kahn and Goldman (1987) measure changes in the

rate of return of renewable projects arising from changes in tax law but do not actually

estimate tax impacts on investment. Building on the work of Hassett and Metcalf

(1999), Grobman and Carey (2003) construct a Markov model to simulate intermittency

of government tax policy and find that investment is shifted across periods to take

advantage of high-incentive periods in the tax code. The results of their simulations are

consistent with the pattern of wind investment observed in the United States (see Figure 3

below). Mulder (2008) considers a cross-country panel data of wind investment in the

EU and estimates a number of investment models and finds limited empirical support for

the role of policy instruments in driving wind investment. The coefficients on his policy

variables are all imprecisely estimated, especially when he allows for country fixed

effects. He concludes, on the basis of cross-country differences in wind growth rates that

feed-in tariffs were important drivers of investment in Germany, Denmark and Spain.23

Mulder's is the only study I am aware of that empirically estimates investment as a

function of tax variables.

23
   Feed-in tariffs are mandated minimum prices utilities must pay for electricity generated by specified
renewable sources. These are typically combined with requirements that a certain amount of electricity be
generated from renewable sources.


                                                                                                       25

        Renewable sources of electricity account for nearly 11 percent of U.S. capacity.

Of this, nearly 8 percent is conventional hydroelectric power. Wind is the next most

significant renewable source accounting for 1.7 percent of total capacity in 2007. Solar

generated electricity accounts for 0.1 percent of total capacity. The relative growth rates

of renewable and nonrenewable energy have shifted over time. While nonrenewable

capacity grew at a more rapid rate than renewable capacity between 1990 and 2007, the

opposite is true if we focus on more recent investments. Over the past four years (for

which data are available) renewable capacity has grown at nearly three times the growth

rate of nonrenewable capacity. Wind is a major factor driving the rapid growth in

renewable capacity with an annualized growth rate of nearly thirty percent over the past

four years.

                 Investments in wind occurred in spurts since 1999. Two forces are significant for

helping explain wind investment. First, natural gas prices began to rise in 1999. They

peaked in January 2001 at $8.91 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) – nearly three times the

price from the previous January – before collapsing later that year to a low of $3.37.

They then began to rise again hitting of $12.16 in October 2005 before retreating a bit

and then stabilizing through 2007 at a price between $7 and $8 per mcf.25




24
    Cumulative capacity at the end of 1997 was 1,542 megawatts.
25
   These are city gate prices reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration in nominal dollars.
EIA only began reporting data on prices paid by electricity generators in 2003. The prices paid by
electricity generators are on average $.54 per mcf lower than the city gate price and generally are lower
month to month. The correlation between the two price series since EIA began reporting utility prices is
0.97.


                                                                                                            27
        The second factor affecting wind investments is Congressional treatment of the

federal production tax credit. The shaded regions in the figure above show three periods

during which the credit expired. While it was in all cases subsequently reinstated

retroactively, investors faced uncertainty over the credit's future.

        Another factor driving investment in wind is the consistency and power of the

wind at available sites. Figure 4 graphs estimates of the annual average wind power in

the United States at a height of 50 meters.26 Wind power is classified in one of seven

classes. Classes 3 through 7 are suitable for wind generated electricity with higher class

numbers more suitable than lower. The map shows considerable heterogeneity but in

general coastal waters and the Midwest have the most desirable wind power

characteristics. Not surprisingly the states with the most installed wind capacity as of

2007 were in these areas (Texas, California, Iowa, Washington, Minnesota, and Colorado

all have installed capacity in that year in excess of 1000 MW).

        I present some data and analysis of investments in wind capacity between 1990

and 2007 using data from the Energy Information Administration Form 860 filed by all

electricity generators. Table 8 provides information about wind generator investments

over the time period. Nameplate capacity of new investments on average was just under

50 megawatts (MW) and showed considerable variation. The average turbine size was

1.2 MW and the average wind generator was made up of over 40 turbines. Average

capacity was more than twice as much for projects installed in this decade compared to

the previous decade. This reflects the industry's move to substantially larger turbines.27

       I constructed user cost of capital and effective tax rate measures for each

generator taking into account differences in state corporate tax rates and otherwise using

the parameter values from Table 5. I constructed estimates of overnight cost by fitting a

quadratic regression to the cost data reported in Wiser and Bolinger (2008). Overnight

costs in year 2007 dollars decline from $2,400 per kW of installed capacity in 1990 to a

low of $1,400 per kW in 2002 before gradually rising to $1,559 in 2007. The user cost of

capital and effective tax rate measures depend importantly on investor perceptions of the

credit during the three periods in which the credit lapsed. I constructed two measures.

The first assumes the credit is in force throughout as, ex post, occurred. The second

measure zeros out the credit for any project completed during the time period in which

the credit lapsed. This reflects investors' concerns that the credit may not be reinstated.

       Table 9 provides summary information on the user cost of capital and the

effective tax rates for wind projects in different states and years.

                                                                                                   31
The mean user cost of capital assuming the production tax credit is always in force (as it

was ex post) is quite low and ranges from 3.4 to 5.7 percent. This implies highly negative

effective tax rates ranging from – 1100 to – 65 percent. The effective tax rate measures

here and below are quite sensitive to the after-tax return available to investors elsewhere

and so in regression work below I include the user cost measure as a regressor rather than

the effective tax rate.

         If investors assume no production tax credit during the period when the credit

lapses the user cost and effective tax rate measures (ucc2 and etr2) are slightly higher. I

also include estimates of the user cost and tax rate where I ignore the production tax

credit. The mean user cost rises by 3.6 percentage points and the mean effective tax rate

becomes positive.28

         I next present an analysis of the impact of the tax code on wind investment. The

basic estimating equation regresses capacity investment (Y) on the user cost of capital

(ucc) and other controls

(6)                                   Yijt = β uccit + X ijt γ + α i + ε ijt

where i indexes states, j generators, and t years. For states with no wind investment in a

given year I set Y to zero. Before presenting results I must address two issues. The first

is that unobserved heterogeneity across states is likely to affect both the desirability of

investing in a given state as well as some of the potential explanatory variables. One

factor that may drive wind investment at the state level is the presence of a state

renewable portfolio standard (RPS). An RPS program mandates that local electricity

distribution companies (LDC) provide some given percentage of their electricity from

28
   It is still well below the statutory rate because of the benefits of the five year tax write-off of wind
capital.


                                                                                                              32
renewable sources. Typically this is done by the LDC submitting renewable electricity

certificates (RECs) for the required amount of electricity. RECs are issued to renewable

electricity generators based on their kWh production. The generators then sell the

certificates to LDCs who are required to submit them to the RPS regulator. Selling the

RECs provides additional revenue for the generator that adds to the profitability of the

project.

         As of July 2009 twenty-nine states had mandatory RPS programs and an

additional five had RPS goals (non-mandatory). Most of these have been enacted in the

past five years. Figure 5 shows the dispersion across states. Most regions have RPS

programs in effect with the conspicuous absence of programs in the Southeast. This is

perhaps not surprising given the lack of wind resources in this region.

                                             Figure 5. State RPS Programs

                                                                            State renewable portfolio goal

                                                                                                       33
        In the econometric analysis I control for the presence of a state RPS program. But

this does not entirely address unobserved heterogeneity issue. I address this issue by

including fixed effects – either at the state or regional level. This is valid under the

assumption that the unobserved heterogeneity (call this green tastes) are constant across

time within states (or regions).

        The second issue is that roughly one-third of my observations on capacity (Yijt)

are positive with the rest equaling zero. Running an OLS regression is not appropriate

for these data. Under the assumption that the error term in a regression with a latent

dependent variable (Yijt*) measuring desired investment is normal, a Tobit regression is

appropriate. The observed dependent variable Yijt = max(0, Yijt*). The only drawback to

this approach is that a simple (parametric) transformation of a Tobit model to eliminate

the fixed effects does not exist. One can run a Tobit explicitly controlling for the

individual effects with dummy variables but the coefficient estimates are biased for small

numbers of time periods. Greene (2004) presents Monte Carlo results that suggest that

the parameters of interest – for us the coefficients on the user cost of capital – are

unaffected by the presence of fixed effects. He shows that the estimated standard errors

are affected by the presence of fixed effects. For that reason I will present robust

standard error estimates below. Moreover Greene notes that the bias is negligible as the

number of time periods rises. Given the large number of years in the sample (T=18), any

bias in the estimated standard errors is likely to be trivial.

        Regression results are presented in Table 10. Column 1 reports an OLS

regression of investment on the user cost of capital measure, an RPS dummy, along with

state and year fixed effects. The user cost coefficient is negative as expected though not




                                                                                           34
precisely estimated. The coefficient on the RPS dummy is positive as expected and

precisely estimated. Because of the large number of zero observations, however, we

should view this regression with some caution. The remaining regressions on investment

capacity are Tobits. Column (2) reports a Tobit regression with state and year fixed

effects. The coefficient on the user cost is now much larger in absolute value though as I

discuss later one cannot directly compare the two estimated coefficients. The p-value on

the user cost coefficient is 0.003. The RPS dummy has the expected sign but is not

statistically significant.

        Figure 6 graphs the year effects from this regression as well as the national

average price for natural gas (city gate price). Not surprisingly capacity additions track

natural gas prices reasonably closely as would be expected if wind serves as a substitute

for natural gas power plants. The correlation between the year effects and the gas price is

                           Most of the variation in the RPS variable is across states and so I report a

regression where I replace the state fixed effects with region fixed effects. This also

allows me to maintain more observations in the regressions since the Tobit fixed effects

regression requires dropping all states for which no investment occurs over the sample. I

group states into the nine census regions.29 This approach is reasonable if the unobserved

tastes for renewable investment are constant within regions. The estimated coefficient on

the user cost of capital increases in magnitude as does the coefficient on the RPS dummy.

The latter is now statistically significant.

29
   The states in each region are as follows: New England: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island; Midatlantic: New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania; South
Atlantic: West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, District of Columbia,
Maryland, Delaware; East South Central: Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi; East
North Central: Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio; West North Central: North Dakota, South
Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa; West South Central: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana;
Mountain: Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico; Pacific: California,
Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii.



                                                                                                                           36
           Finally, I report a Tobit regression where I do not include state fixed effects. The

estimated coefficient on the user cost variable increases in absolute value by roughly

sixty percent. This suggests that failing to control for correlated and unobserved

heterogeneity leads to an overestimate of the impact of tax policy on investment.

           Summing up, the coefficient on the user cost variable is precisely estimated and

robust to regression specification. As a final check I run another set of regressions in

which I control for the size of the state (columns (5) – (8) of Table 10). Holding other

factors constant, one might expect that more wind projects would be put in larger states.

Thus I run regressions in which the dependent variable is installed capacity divided by

the area of each state (in thousand square miles).

           These regressions are very similar in nature to the regressions on installed

capacity. The coefficient on the user cost of capital continues to be precisely estimated

while the RPS coefficient is only precisely estimated in the model with region dummies.

Again failing to control for unobserved state-level heterogeneity biases the tax effect in

an upward direction (in absolute value).

           In addition to the regressions reported in Table 10, I ran various other regressions

not reported here. First I ran a regression in which I include state-specific city gate prices

for natural gas and measures of wind power at sites where wind projects are sited

(average values for states in years with no investment).30 After including year effects –

which as we've seen are strongly correlated with investment activity – the coefficient on

the natural gas variable has the expected sign but is imprecisely estimated. This is

perhaps not surprising since little variation is left in the gas price data after including

state and year fixed effects. The wind power coefficient is precisely estimated but has a
30
     Ideally I would use gas prices paid by electric utilities. EIA only begins reporting these data in 2003.


                                                                                                                37
negative sign. Since I include state fixed effects in the regression the wind power

variable is picking up variation within the state in wind power. It may simply be that

conditional on average wind power in a state, variations around the average are simply

not that important in siting decisions (or are correlated with other unobserved state

specific siting variables). Including these variables has little effect on the user cost of

capital coefficient.

         Second I ran regressions in which I replaced the user cost of capital variable with

the user cost variable which ignores the production tax credit lapses. The regressions

exhibit a poorer statistical fit and the coefficients on the user cost have the wrong sign

and are implausibly large. This provides support for the view that investors were not

confident that the federal government would reinstate the production tax credit when it

lapsed and that the reinstatement would be retroactive.

         Third I ran regressions to control for the possibility that investors were

temporarily shifting investment in anticipation of a credit lapsing or being reinstated.

Specifically I dropped observations for all months just before or just after a credit lapsed

or was reinstated. For example, the production tax credit lapsed for the first time after

June 30, 1999 and was reinstated as of Dec. 19, 1999. I dropped observations for June

and July 1999 to eliminate investments that may have been moved up one month and I

dropped observations for December 1999 and January 2000 to control for investments

that may have been shifted from December 1999 to the following month. Regression

results were not affected by dropping those observations.31


31
   I experimented with longer windows but the Tobit regressions did not converge. Longer windows may
not be appropriate anyway. Moving investment forward in time is very difficult given bottlenecks in
production and delaying a project is quite costly given the capital costs that have been incurred prior to
start-up. Flexibility in project timing on short notice, therefore, is quite limited.

          Let me next turn to a discussion of interpretation of the estimated coefficients on

the user cost variable in the Tobit regressions. As I noted above Tobit coefficient

estimates cannot be directly compared to OLS estimates. We need to adjust the former to

obtain marginal impacts that are comparable to coefficients in the OLS model.32

          The adjustment to estimated coefficient can be computed in a number of ways. If

I compute the CDF at the mean values of the right hand side variables, I obtain an

estimate of the partial effect at the average (PEA). Alternatively I can compute the CDF

at the observed values of all the observations and take the average. This is the average

partial effect (APE). I report both for the regression in column 2 of Table 10. The partial

effect at the average equals -323.13 while the average partial effect equals -417.33.

These two estimates are both substantially larger than the OLS coefficient estimate on the

user cost variable in the first column. In other words, running OLS leads to a large

underestimate of the tax impact on investment.

          The average user cost of capital in the sample equals 4.57%. This rises to 7.77%

if the production tax credit is eliminated. This implies a decline in annual average

investment of 10.3 MW if the partial effect at the average is used and 13.4 MW if the

average partial effect is used. These declines represent 71 and 92 percent of average

investment over the sample suggesting the production tax credit plays a very substantial

role in wind investment.33

                                                = β j Φ⎜ ⎟ where xβ is the predicted value of the

dependent variable from the Tobit regression, σ is the estimated standard error from the regression and
 Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. See, for example, Wooldridge (2009).
33
   For this calculation, I compute the average over the entire sample as opposed to conditioning on positive
investment as in Table 8.


                                                                                                         40
       Another way to measure the impact of tax policy on investment is to measure the

elasticity of investment with respect to the user cost. Using the PEA, the elasticity at the

mean is -1.01. It equals -1.30 if the APE is used. Either way, the response is large.

       The effects are even larger if we control for the size of the state. Using the

coefficient estimates from column (6), the average partial effect is -7.18 and the partial

effect on average is -8.09. Again these are considerably larger than the OLS impact.

Raising the user cost of capital from 4.57% to 7.77% to model the elimination of the

production tax credit implies a decline in investment of 0.23 MW per 1000 square miles

based on the APE and 0.25 MW per 1000 square miles based on the PEA. Both of these

declines exceed the mean investment per 1000 square miles in the overall sample (0.16

MW per 1000 square miles). The elasticity at the mean is -2.37 using the partial effect at

the average and -2.11 using the average partial effects.

       With sufficiently strong assumptions we can make a ballpark estimate of the

impact of carbon pricing on investment in wind capacity. Consider the year effects as

graphed in Figure 6 against natural gas prices. If we make the strong assumption that the

year effects are perfectly proxying for natural gas price effects on investment, we can

compute an elasticity of capacity investment with respect to natural gas prices. Using the

doubling of gas prices between 1990 and 2004 and computing the average partial effect

for the marginal impact we obtain an elasticity of investment with respect to the natural

gas price of 1.7. A recent analysis of the Waxman-Markey bill by the U. S.

Environmental Protection Agency (2009) suggests that the price of permits in 2020 will

be $16.31 (Scenario 2 of the ADAGE run). This will raise natural gas prices by 8.5

percent relative to the reference scenario. Based on my elasticity estimate, this would




                                                                                             41
raise investment in wind capacity by 14 percent.34 The ADAGE analysis reports an

increase in wind capacity investment of 9 percent by 2020.35 My estimate is higher than

the ADAGE estimate but reasonably close given the simplifying assumptions my analysis

makes. While my estimate is admittedly very rough, it suggests that wind investment

should be quite responsive to carbon pricing.

         The regression estimates in this section show a strong response of wind

investment to changes in tax policy. They also suggest that production tax credits

strongly influence wind investment. These findings support the received wisdom that

production tax credits are critically important for the penetration of wind generated

electricity in the United States. It also suggests that we will continue to see considerable

support for this credit as we approach the end of 2012 and the credit's expiration.

         It should be noted, however, that the econometric results here depend critically on

the assumptions of the Tobit model in a data set with a large fraction of censored

observations. It would be valuable to subject the wind capacity data to more

sophisticated econometric techniques to see if the results found here are robust. This is

especially the case given the lack of other empirical work measuring the impact of

renewable investment behavior to energy tax and climate policy.

V.       Conclusion

         The federal tax code has historically played a major role in shaping U.S. energy

policy. Tax-based subsidies account for nearly two-thirds of all federal financial support

for energy markets (U.S. Energy Information Administration (2008a)) in 2007. As

34
    Given the estimated standard error on the 2004 year effect and conditional on mean wind capacity, the
standard error of the elasticity estimate is 0.6. For an 8.5 percent increase in the price of natural gas this
suggests a one standard deviation bracket of this estimated increase in wind capacity between 9.4 and 20.0
percent.
35
   They actually report estimates for wind and solar. But the bulk of this capacity is likely to be wind.


                                                                                                            42
detailed in this paper the tax provisions are complex and constantly in flux. Currently,

for example, wind developers may receive a production tax credit or investment tax credit

or cash rebate comparable to the investment tax credit. The wind credits, however,

expire at the end of 2012 in the absence of further government action. At the same time,

Congress is currently considering enacting climate change legislation which will

dramatically affect energy markets.

       While much as been written on the various tax subsidies to energy, less is known

about their impact on investment and production. This paper contributes to that literature

by considering the impact of taxes on wind investment. I find that investment in new

capacity (measured in megawatts) is strongly influenced by tax policy. The estimated

elasticity of capacity investment with respect to the user cost of capital exceeds one.

Moreover the data suggest that much of the current investment in wind can be explained

by the production tax credit for wind.

       An important question for Congress and the Administration going forward is

whether it makes sense to maintain many of the tax-based subsidies if comprehensive

climate change legislation is enacted. Elsewhere I have noted a number of problems with

a subsidy-based approach to energy policy (see Metcalf (2009a)). An important question

for future research is whether carbon pricing through a cap and trade bill or carbon fee

can generate comparable levels of investment as the current tax-based subsidies. While

economic principles suggest it should (if designed at comparable levels), it will be

important to test this empirically.
