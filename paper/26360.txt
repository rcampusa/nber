                                         ABSTRACT

We examine the effects of the State Innovation Models (SIM) on population-level health status.
The SIM initiative provided $250 million to six states in 2013 for delivery system reforms. We
use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for the years 2010 -- 2016 to
compare health of the populations in 6 SIM states to 15 states that were not involved in any
aspects of SIM. We examine changes in health using an event study design. We develop a Latent
Class Profile model that takes multiple measures of latent health into a common, latent health
status to study the effect of the intervention. Such models can yield informative estimates where
separate estimation of measures do not. We find that individuals in states that implemented SIM
saw significant improvements in health across a number policy-relevant subpopulations.

1     Introduction
Much media and academic attention has been placed on the provisions of the Af-
fordable Care Act (ACA) aimed at expanding health insurance coverage. However, a
major component of the law is aimed at providing innovative healthcare delivery and
financing mechanisms to improve patient care, population health, and reduce health-
care costs. Under these auspices, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation
(CMMI), a division of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), was
established to test interventions in payment and service delivery models.
    One of these innovations is the State Innovation Models (SIM) initiative, which
provides grants to states to design and test alternative healthcare and payment sys-
tems. SIM is a large, diffuse, delivery system reform intervention. It provided $250
million to six states in 2013 for providers to shift toward value-based payment models
and invest in infrastructure and training for providers to transform primary care and
integrate behavioral health. No specific healthcare sectors were specified, nor were
specific approaches to transformation outlined a priori. States were asked to submit
plans for large-scale changes in healthcare provision and financing. States are ideally
suited to design and test such alternative, large-scale mechanisms because they have
regulatory authority to convene both public and private stakeholders.
    In 2012, CMMI invited states to submit SIM proposals for the first round of
model design or model testing awards. Model testing awards were intended for states
with fully developed proposals for state-wide health system transformation. CMMI
provided funding for states to implement their innovation plans based on proposals
that described each state's vision for health system transformation and strategies
the state intended to use to implement and test its model. On April 1, 2013, six
states ­ Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, and Vermont -- were
awarded a total of $250 million to implement and test their innovation plans over a
period of 3.5 years. These states were chosen because they built upon existing CMS
approaches such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), Medicaid health homes,

                                          1
and/or bundled or episode-based payment models. All six states included Medicare,
Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and commercial payers in
their innovation plans. Most innovation plans emphasized improving care for high-
risk, high-cost populations. See Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (2019)
for details of the initiative, for information on subsequent rounds of the initiative and
a compendium of relevant materials.
   In this paper, we examine the effects of the first round of the SIM initiative on
health outcomes in the six states that implemented their innovation plans as compared
to 15 states (Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, South
Dakota, and Wyoming). The 15 control states were not involved in the first round of
model design initiatives, nor designated for the second round of model testing awards.
   We take a population focus in our study (Hughes et al., 2015; Auerbach et al.,
2013). If the numerous healthcare delivery infrastructure changes undertaken by
states that participated in SIM were meaningful, the initiative should have resulted
in population-level effects. We use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS) for the years 2010 - 2012 and 2014 - 2016 to examine the effects of
SIM. We exclude data from 2013 because that was the year in which states learned
of their awards and worked with CMMI to obtain the funding necessary to begin
implementation. We use an event study approach (alternatively known as a general-
ized interrupted time series approach) to study the effect of the SIM initiative. This
statistical design is very similar to a difference-in-difference model but the general-
ized interrupted time series approach is agnostic about trends in the pre-program or
baseline period. We choose to be agnostic because we cannot confidently argue for
common trends prior to 2013.
   In our application of the generalized interrupted time series model, we treat 2012
as the base year and estimate differential trend coefficients for each of the other years.
Given the numerous changes to the healthcare landscape induced by the ACA, we


                                            2
prefer not to assume, a priori that the health trends in these six treated states were
the same as those in the control states. The ACA, and the healthcare landscape more
generally, induced many changes in healthcare delivery and financing, in the public
and private sectors, across states. These changes may or may not have differentially
affected the states in our study. It is unlikely that other state level innovations had
the scope and scale of SIM, nevertheless we err on the side of caution. Our modeling
strategy allows us to judge, ex post, whether there was a significant shift in the trend
after implementation relative to the trend before it.
   Health status is a notoriously difficult construct to measure in part because it is
multidimensional and latent. Surveys such as the BRFSS typically have a number of
measures that plausibly capture components of health status. Instead of estimating
models for individual measures, we develop a Latent Class Profile (LCP) model that
uses three measures of health status simultaneously, assuming that the regression
model is for an underlying common latent measure of health status (Chung et al.,
2011; Oberski, 2016). The measures of health include an ordinal measure of health
status, which we assumes follows an ordered logistic distribution, a count of days
affected by physical health problems, and a count of days affected by mental health
problems, which we assume follow Poisson distributions. These outcomes are jointly
modeled as being driven by a common discrete latent factor, health. We then assume
that the set of observed covariates, including the treatment design covariates and a
set of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, affect the latent factor directly,
as in Chung et al. (2011), rather than individual measures of outcome.
   The ability of the latent class profile model to isolate the common factor in the
measures of health status yields substantial gains in statistical power. In situations
where only small effects can be plausibly expected, modeling multiple measures of
a common underlying outcome separately can yield inconsistent (not in a statistical
sense) estimates across equations. The results of our empirical analysis are consistent
with these features ­ we find consistent improvements in health due to SIM in the


                                           3
LCP framework.
   We are not aware of any peer-reviewed literature evaluating this large initiative.
A contractor for CMMI has been evaluating the effect of the implementation of these
models in these six states, drilling down to specific subpopulations and examining the
effects in each state separately (RTI International, 2016, 2017, 2018). Findings in their
reports suggest that the SIM initiatives in these states have produced considerable
movement towards value-based purchasing models of payment in Medicaid and com-
mercially insured populations. Clinicians in these states have credited SIM-related
investments in health information exchanges and quality measurement as key deter-
minants of changes in care delivery intended to improve care coordination. There is
consistent evidence of better care coordination in primary care and physician services
and some improvements in screening measures and medication adherence outcomes.
These improvements did not lead to fewer ED visits or hospital admissions, except in
Vermont and Arkansas among Medicaid beneficiaries.
   Although the effects of SIM on health are unknown, research on other CMMI
initiatives is suggestive of the virtues of such designs. For instance, in a group of
CMMI initiatives known as Episode-based Payment Initiatives, CMS holds health-
care providers accountable for the services they provide to Medicare beneficiaries
during an episode of care. Dummit et al. (2016) show that when hospitals were held
accountable for total payments and quality of care during an episode of total joint re-
placement, average Medicare payments decreased by $1166, while the quality of care
was maintained. In an other approach, known as Accountable Care Organizations
(ACOs), CMMI provided incentives for healthcare providers, including physicians and
hospitals, to create networks to provide a coordinated care to Medicare beneficiaries.
McWilliams (2016) shows that ACOs that joined the program between 2012 and 2014
generated $287 million net savings for Medicare.
   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe
the State Innovation Models in more detail. In section 3, we describe the latent class


                                           4
profile model formally. The data and samples are described in section 4 and results
are described in section 5. We discuss our findings and conclude in section 6.


2     Background
The State Innovation Models (SIM) initiative, promulgated by the Center for Medi-
care and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), a division of the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS), provides states with funding, learning tools and expert
technical assistance to modernize their multi-payer healthcare payment systems and
to improve the delivery of healthcare. "The distinctive purpose of the SIM initia-
tive is to test whether new models with potential to improve care and lower costs
in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP will produce better results when implemented in
the context of a state-sponsored plan that involves multiple payers, broader state
innovation, and larger health system transformation to improve population health"
(Van Vleet and Paradise, 2014).
    The CMMI sought out the first round of state innovation proposals in the summer
of 2012, and on the basis of these proposals presented states with one of three awards:
a model design award, a model pre-test award, or a model test award. Model design
and pre-test awards provided support for states to develop and design their own
state innovation plans. Model design awards were given to sixteen states: Califor-
nia, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, New
Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah. Three
states, Colorado, New York, and Washington, received pre-test awards. Arizona,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky,
Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico,
New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia,
Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin took part in round two of the SIM initia-
tive as either model test or model design states. No pre-test awards were awarded
during round two of the initiative.


                                          5
   The model test awards allowed states to "implement and test strategies" outlined
in their proposals. The six states that received model test awards in Round 1 were
Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, and Vermont. The awards were
announced on February 21, 2013 and the performance period for these awardees began
on April 1, 2013. Our paper focuses on the impact that these state innovation plans
had on the health of their populations.
   As previously mentioned, SIM interventions designed to implement delivery sys-
tem reforms varied across each of the six test states. The states focused their inno-
vation efforts on Medicaid, CHIP, and commercial payers. They also implemented
or had plans to implement interventions that targeted Medicare. Oregon also in-
cluded its state employee healthcare system in its innovation plan. However, since
each model test awardee developed its innovation plan independently, differences as
well as commonalities can be found in the healthcare delivery system and payment
reform strategies they employed. Each of the test states included and built upon
state specific strategies that predated SIM, in addition to implementing new strate-
gies in their innovation plans. There is no easy way to classify the test states based
upon their innovation plans because the six test states did not implement sufficiently
similar strategies, and the pre-SIM landscape was different for each of the test states.
   The model test awardees used a two-pronged approach with regards to healthcare
delivery reform. All the states, following SIM guidelines, emphasized improving pri-
mary care and integrating primary care with additional healthcare services. Patient-
centered medical homes (PCMH) are primary care facilities that focus on preventative
care and chronic condition management. PCMH were central to the states' aim to im-
prove primary care and all six test states implemented strategies to improve existing
PCMH or create new ones. Additionally, Arkansas and Maine used SIM resources to
fund new patient-centered health homes. These health homes focused on coordinating
and improving physical and behavioral health for medically complex, high-risk, high
cost Medicaid populations. Maine also instituted behavioral health homes that pro-


                                           6
vide mental healthcare in addition to primary care. With the exception of Arkansas,
the test states focused reforms within ACOs; these organizations are focused on pro-
viding coordinated care to patients. Arkansas, Maine, Minnesota, and Oregon also
devised new work force models that incorporated team based care and nontraditional
healthcare workers. Patients may be treated by a team of healthcare professionals
or obtain information and resources from community health workers or peer wellness
specialists.
    The six SIM states did not limit their healthcare delivery system reform efforts to
primary care. They also worked to connect primary care services to other health ser-
vices with the goal of allowing patients to experience better overall care. These states
varied in their scope and scale of integration of one or more of the following types
of services with primary care: speciality care, oral healthcare, behavioral healthcare,
long term care, and social services.
    In addition to improving healthcare delivery, the states used a variety of strategies
to reduce healthcare costs. As a result, the test states implemented a variety of
alternative payment strategies. The states used a combination of three or more of
the following payment models: per-member-per-month payments, bundled payments,
bonus payments, shared savings, shared savings and risk, prospective payment, and
partial/global capitation. These payment models were meant to link the payment
for services to the efficacy and quality of care patients receive, not the number of
procedures received.


3     Econometric model
We analyze three measures of health status jointly using a Latent Class Profile (LCP)
model (Lazarsfeld and Henry, 1968; Chung et al., 2011). The measures are described
in detail in section 4 below. The LCP model assumes that the measures are co-
determined by a common discrete latent factor. We assume that the set of observed
covariates, including the treatment design covariates and a set of demographic and


                                            7
socioeconomic characteristics affect the latent factor directly.
   The conceptual structure of the LCP model was originally developed in Lazars-
feld and Henry (1968). It is closely related to the latent class model, which is the
nomenclature used when the measurements are binary (Goodman, 1974). It is also
closely related to the Grade of Membership Model (Manton et al., 1992; Portrait
et al., 1999) for multiple binary measurements. Erosheva (2005) and Oberski (2016)
provide overviews of these models. Erosheva (2005) derives a unifying finite mixture
model framework for these models.
   To be more specific, we use three measurements: a count of days affected by
physical health problems, pi , a count of days affected by mental health problems,
mi , and self-reported health status on a five-point multinomial (ordinal) scale, si .
Suppose that the population can be divided into C classes or subpopulations on the
basis of their underlying, latent health status. For an individual in class c  1, 2, ..., C ,
let the counts of days affected by physical and mental health problems each follow a
Poisson distribution so that
                                                 pi
                                                 c  exp(-c )
                                     f (pi ) =                                           (1)
                                                      pi !
and
                                                 µm
                                                  c exp(-µc )
                                                    i
                                     f (mi ) =                ,                          (2)
                                                      mi !
where c and µc are class-specific unknown parameters that determine the Poisson
distributions. We assume that the ordinal measure of health status, that takes values
j = 1, 2, ..., 5, follows an ordered logistic distribution so, for an individual in class c,
                                           1               1
                     g (si (j )) =                 -                                     (3)
                                     1 + exp(-j,c ) 1 + exp(-j -1,c )
where j,c are class-specific threshold parameters with 0,c defined as - and 5,c as
+. It is important to note that these class-specific distributions are not parameter-
ized with covariates. By keeping these vectors of values fixed (in expectation) within
each class, the underlying health class has an unconditional interpretation. Also see
Chung et al. (2011) for further discussion.

                                                  8
   Let c denote the probabilities of membership in each class of health status. The
classes are non-trivial so that 0 < c < 1. In addition, they are mutually exclusive
                                     C
and exhaustive so that               c=1    c = 1. Then, the probability density function for a
C -component finite mixture (Deb and Trivedi, 1997; McLachlan and Peel, 2004), is
denoted by
                                            C
                  f (pi , mi , si ) =           c f (pi ; c )f (mi ; µc )g (si ; 0c , 1c , ..., 5c ).      (4)
                                          c=1

Let zi denote a vector of observed covariates including the design vector. We pa-
rameterize the class probabilities with covariates using a multinomial logit functional
form, i.e.,
                                                       1
                          c (zi ; c ) =                         for c = 1, 2, ..., C                       (5)
                                                1 + exp(-zi c )
so that
                                    C
              f (pi , mi , si ) =         c (zi ; c )f (pi ; c )f (mi ; µc )g (si ; 0c , 1c , ..., 5c ).   (6)
                                    c=1

   Denote the time periods of data in the study as t = T0 , ..., 0, ...T where T0 denotes
the first year of the study, 0 denotes the period before the treatment begins and T
denotes the final period of data available for analysis. Let I (t) denote the indicator
for time t. In addition, let Ait denote the treatment status of observation i at time
t; Ait = 1 if the observation belongs to the treatment group and Ait = 0 if it belongs
to the control group. Note that treatment assignment is designated by the state of
residence (Sit ) of the individual. We specify zi c using an interrupted time series or
event study design:
                                        T
                   zi c = c +               tc Ait I (t) + xi c + sc + tc + c Sit (t)                      (7)
                                     t=T0

where sc and tc denote state and time fixed effects in class c respectively. State-
specific time trends are introduced via Sit (t), where  denotes a polynomial in t.
We also allow for linear state-specific time trends. The vector xi includes a number
of covariates described in section 4 and month (of survey) fixed effects.

                                                             9
     For our empirical analysis, we assume that health status can be categorized into
two classes. We estimate the parameters of the 2-class LCP model specified by equa-
tions 6 and 7 using maximum likelihood. We conduct inference based on standard
errors adjusted for clustering at the state level. Post estimation, we estimate the
sample average time effects, tc on the class probability, at time t in class c, as
                                         1
    tc =                   T
           1 + exp(-[c +   t=T0   tc I (t) + xi c + sc + tc + c Sit (t)])
                                                            1
                                  -                                              . (8)
                                      1 + exp(-[c + xi c + sc + tc + c Sit (t)])
This measure follows the logic of treatment effects in nonlinear models described in
Athey and Imbens (2006) and Puhani (2012).


4      Data
As previously mentioned, we use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS) to examine the effects of the SIM initiative on population health
outcomes in the six, round one model test states. The BRFSS is a nationwide tele-
phone survey that collects data about US residents' self-perceived health status, risky
health behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventative healthcare ser-
vices. Sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
supported by a number of federal and state government agencies, the BRFSS cur-
rently collects data in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three US territories
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019).
     We use data from the 2010 ­ 2012 and 2014 ­ 2016 BRFSS surveys to examine the
effects of the SIM initiative. Data from 2013 is excluded from our analysis because
that was the year in which the states learned of their awards and worked with CMMI
to obtain the funding necessary to begin implementation. We conduct our analysis
using the sample of individuals ages 45 and older.
     Our sample consists of 832,081 individuals ages 45 or older with 45.8% of the
individuals being elderly (ages 65 or older). The population is primarily non-Hispanic

                                             10
white (89.1%), female (60.6%), married (55.4%), and 60% have more education than
a high school diploma. We define a low socioeconomic status group as individuals
who have a household income less than $35,000 per year and education level of no
more than a high school diploma. Such individuals comprise 28% of the sample.
   We use three measures of health status, elicited in the survey using the following
language:

  1. Would you say that in general your health is (1) excellent; (2) very good; (3)
     good; (4) fair; (5) poor

  2. Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and
     injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not
     good?

  3. Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and
     problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your
     mental health not good?

   Overall, 78.4% of the study population feel good or better about their general
health status, with on average 4.9 and 3.1 days per month with "not good" physical
and mental health, respectively.
   Table 1 shows summary statistics for the outcomes. The number of days in "not
good" physical health is somewhat lower in treated states both before and after the
State Innovation Models initiative. For both groups, the mean number of days also
declines slightly after SIM as compared to the period prior. The differences in mean
"not good" mental health days, across treatment and control states and before and
after SIM, are small. Self-rated health status is slightly better in the treated states
relative to control states before and after SIM with a negligible mean decline in the
rating after SIM.
   The distribution of age, gender, race and ethnicity, and marital status are very
similar across treated and control states and stable across the pre- and post-SIM

                                          11
years for our main sample (table 2). Individuals in treated states have higher levels
of education, are less likely to be black and more likely to live in rural areas. The
percentage of survey respondents contacted by cell phone is similar across treated
and control groups and stable over time.
   We undertake a number of additional analyses using the following subsamples of
our data:

  1. Individuals ages 65 and older;

  2. Individuals 45 and older of low socioeconomic status (earning less than $35,000
     per year and with a high school diploma or less);

  3. Individuals 45 - 64 of low socioeconomic status;

  4. Individuals 45 and older of a minority race or ethnicity;

  5. Individuals 45 and older living in rural areas;

  6. Individuals 65 and older living in rural areas.

   The first subsample targets Medicare eligible individuals. They typically have
higher healthcare needs but are well insured by Medicare. The second subsample
attempts to target the Medicaid eligible population. Unfortunately, BRFSS does
not ask about health insurance coverage, except for a couple of years. We used the
information on Medicaid coverage in those years to validate our proxy variables ­ low
income and low education ­ as predictors of Medicaid coverage. The third sample
uses the same low socioeconomic status proxies for Medicaid coverage for the under-
65 population. As table 3 shows, this sample is substantially smaller than the main
sample and the smallest of all subsamples.
   The remaining subsamples focus on sub-populations of interest to policy-makers
but are not explicitly part of the design elements in SIM. In subsample 4, we limit our
attention to individuals of minority race or ethnicity. In the final two cases, we limit


                                           12
our attention to rural individuals, with the final sample focusing on just the rural
elderly. For each of these subsamples, we report the sample means of each outcome
along with associated sample sizes for control and treated groups for the pre- and
post-SIM periods in table 3. Features of the measures of health status observed in
our main sample persist across subsamples.


5     Results
Our statistical design is agnostic about trends in the pre-program or baseline period.
In other words, we conduct an event study for which we set the effect of the differential
trend to zero for 2012 and estimate effects for 2010 and 2011 in the pre-program period
and 2014, 2015, and 2016 during the implementation of SIM.
    A selected set of parameter estimates of the latent class profile model from the
full sample of individuals ages 45 and older are shown in table 4. To be precise, these
are the parameters associated with equation 7. The coefficients on the interactions
of treatment assignment and pre-treatment years 2010 and 2011 are not statistically
significant. The coefficients on the interactions of treatment assignment and the
post-treatment years 2014-2016 are all statistically significant and positive. Thus the
probability of being in latent class 1 increases among the treated population as a
result of the treatment. Below we show that latent class 1 refers to better health.
As expected, married, those with higher education and higher income are more likely
to be in class 1. Women are significantly less likely to be in class 1. Black and
Hispanic individuals and individuals over 65 years old are more likely to be in class
1. These findings may appear counterintuitive. However, they are consistent with
studies that find subjective health status being reference dependent. Groot (2000)
shows that adaptation behaviour leads to the scale of reference of the subjective
health measure changing with age. Lindeboom and van Doorslaer (2004) find clear
evidence of shifting reference points by age and gender, but not by income, education
or language. Among effects of covariates not shown, it is worth noting that some state


                                           13
and year fixed effects are statistically significant. Coefficients on some state-specific
time trends are also statistically significant. In addition, a few month fixed effects
are significant.
   In order to interpret the effect sizes of treatment and to interpret health status
in the two classes, we calculate marginal effects from the model and display those in
figure 1. The top figure of the panel shows the marginal effects and associated 95%
confidence intervals of the year indicators on the probability of being in latent class
1. These effects are estimated using equation 8 which is derived from equations 5 - 7.
Note that 2013 observations were not considered as that was the year in which SIM
was implemented in the treated states. The estimated effects for 2010 and 2011 are
small and statistically insignificant. The effects for 2014-2016 are positive and highly
significant. The estimated effect sizes of about 2 percentage points can be interpreted
as change from a base class probability of 75%.
   The bottom-left panel of the figure shows the estimated mean numbers of days
in "not good" physical and mental health days. These are estimated from equations
1 and 2 respectively. Individuals in class 1 are estimated to have 0.62 "not good"
physical health days while individuals in class 2 have 17.59 "not good" physical health
days. Individuals in class 1 have 0.43 "not good" mental health days while individuals
in class 2 have 11.16 "not good" mental health days. The bottom-right figure in the
panel shows the estimated proportion in each category of self-reported health by
latent class. These are estimated from equation 3. The parameter estimates imply
that 19% of individuals in class 1 report excellent health while only 4% in class 2
report excellent health. On the other end of the scale, 9% of individuals in class 1
report being in fair health while 32% in class 2 report being in fair health. Less than
1% of individuals in class 1 report being in poor health. This is stark contrast to
24% of individuals in class 2. Moving forward, we refer to individuals in class 1 as
"healthy" individuals while those in class 2 are "unhealthy".
   Taking the results of the LCP model together, it shows that, for the sample


                                           14
of individuals ages 45 and older, SIM increased the likelihood of being healthy by a
statistically significant 2 percentage points. More precisely, the estimates suggest that
treated and control states had similar levels of health status prior to SIM and that the
innovations in healthcare delivery initiated via SIM led to significant improvement in
population health in the states that implemented it.
   Figure 2 shows the estimates of the latent class models for the other six samples.
The first panel (2a) displays the estimated effects for the subsample of individuals
65 years and older. The figure on the left side of the panel shows the marginal year
effects on the probability of being in class 1. It shows that SIM had a statistically
significant effect on the health status of older (Medicare eligible) individuals in the
treated states. The probability of being in class 1 (the better health status class)
increased by 3 percentage points. The figure in the center of the panel shows that
individuals in class 1 have substantially fewer days in "not good" physical and mental
health. The figure at the right shows that individuals in class 1 are much more likely
to be in fair or poor health and much less likely to be in excellent or very good health.
   When the sample is restricted to low socioeconomic status individuals (as defined
by low income and low education) (panel 2b), the positive effects of SIM on health
continue to be present. The yearly effects are close to zero prior to SIM and signif-
icantly positive post SIM, although the confidence intervals are larger than in the
prior samples in large part because the sample size is 28% of the full sample. In the
estimates shown in panel 2c, the sample was restricted to low socioeconomic status
individuals ages 45-64 in our attempt to better target individuals who might be Medi-
caid eligible. The latent classes estimated have qualitatively similar characteristics as
for the other subsamples: individuals in class 1 are in better health than individuals
in class 2. The baseline rate of membership in class 1 is 0.60, which is lower than
the rates for the samples that include all income levels but similar to that for the
sample of individuals of all ages but of low socioeconomic status. Individuals of low
socioeconomic status are more likely to be unhealthy. The estimates show positive


                                           15
effects in 2014 and 2016. The effect in 2014 is just shy of being statistically significant
at conventional levels but the 2016 estimate is. The effect in 2015 is close to zero.
Note that the confidence intervals are large corresponding with the relatively small
sample (less than 12% of the original sample).
   The effects shown in panel 2d are based on the sample of minority individuals.
Minority individuals comprise 13% of the sample in control states and 6% of the
sample in treated states. The estimates are, once again, less precise but suggestive of
improved health post-SIM.
   When we restrict the sample to individuals living in rural areas (panel 2e), we find
that SIM has a statistically significant effects on improvement of health status, with
the effects plausibly increasing over the period of treatment from 2014-2016. Finally,
in panel 2f, we display the effects of SIM for the sample of older individuals who live
in rural areas. We find statistically significant and positive effects of SIM. Compared
to all rural individuals, the effects for the elderly sample are somewhat larger.
   The evidence that there are no residual pre-trend differences between treated and
control states in our specification is consistent across samples. Results of the formal
tests of the joint hypothesis that corresponds to differential pre-trends are reported
in table 5. The smallest p-value of the tests across the 7 samples is 0.178. These can
also be observed informally in the figures.
   In order to establish the virtues of the latent class model for the purposes of eval-
uating the effects of SIM relative to simpler, single equation models, we estimate a
Poisson regression for the count of "not good" physical health days, another Poisson
regression for the count of "not good" mental health days and an ordered logit regres-
sion for the ordinal measure of self-reported health status. Covariates are specified as
in the LCP model using the interrupted time series design. The results of this analysis
are reported in table 6. The first panel of results refers to the sample of individuals
ages 45 and older. In the Poisson regression for "not good" physical health days, SIM
has a significant health-improvement effect in 2014 and 2016. The effect of SIM is


                                            16
negative but not statistically significant in 2015. The effects on mental health are all
negative but never statistically significant at conventional levels. The effects of SIM
on self-reported health status (parameter estimates from an ordered logit regression)
show positive significant effects implying worse self-reported health. But these find-
ings contradict those from the Poisson regressions. In the second panel, which focuses
on the sample of individuals 65 and older, the estimates from the Poisson regression
for physical health days and the estimates from the ordered logit regression for self-
reported health status all point in the same direction and are statistically significant.
In this case, SIM shows improving health for two of the three measures. But there is
no evidence of improvement on the mental health measure.
    The results continue to be inconsistent, within and across samples, in the remain-
ing panels. We view these as evidence of the lack of reliability of the regressions taken
one measure at a time. Complementarily, we view these as evidence of the value of a
latent class model that treats the three measures as noisy indicators of an underlying
health status construct. Our econometric model is able to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio and thus produces more reliable estimates of the effect of SIM on health status.


6     Conclusion
We have examined the effects of the State Innovation Models initiative implemented
by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation on health outcomes in the six
states that implemented their innovation plans as compared to 15 states that were not
involved at all. We used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
for the years 2010 ­ 2012 and 2014 ­ 2016 to examine the effects of treatment. We
used an event study design using a Latent Class Profile model for multiple measures
of health status to study the effect of SIM. We chose to be agnostic about the pre-
program trends in treatment and control states because of the changing landscape
of healthcare financing and delivery induced, in part, by the Affordable Care Act.
Although it is unlikely that other state level innovations had the scope and scale of


                                           17
SIM, we chose not to pre-judge the effects of other innovations.
   The results of our analysis are remarkably consistent. Individuals in states that
implemented SIM saw significant improvements in health status in most of the eight
subpopulations we considered. Importantly, we found no evidence of differential pre-
intervention trends. The effects of SIM appear to be stronger for the sample of elderly,
Medicare eligible individuals as compared to the sample of individuals aged 45 and
older. The effects of SIM, for the elderly, are of similar magnitudes for the rural
population as it is for the overall elderly population suggesting that the investments
are impacting rural healthcare providers as well as urban and suburban ones. The
effects of SIM on low socioeconomic status, 45-64 year old individuals are somewhat
inconsistent in terms of statistical significance. Nevertheless, taking the substantially
smaller sample size into account, it appears that SIM initiatives via Medicaid channels
also improved the health of low socioeconomic status individuals.
   We find that our use of the latent class profile model is justified. When each of
the three health outcomes is modeled separately, the results are sporadically signifi-
cant, inconsistent across measures and across samples. The ability of the latent class
profile model to isolate the common factor in the measures of health status yields
substantial gains in statistical power for two reasons. First, in the single equation
models, covariates affect each outcome independently. In models where small effects
are expected, such models can yield inconsistent estimates across equations. The
LCP model forces consistency of covariate effects across measures. Second, there are
gains in statistical power because all outcomes are modeled jointly.
   In many analyses using finite mixture models, researchers search for the best
fitting mixture models before interpreting results. We explored results in a 3-class
LCP model but did not search for the best fitting LCP model more generally. We
chose to report results from the 2-class LCP model because it created a clean and
intuitive distinction between healthy and unhealthy states and because covariates
could be interpreted monotonically and easily as either making better health more or


                                           18
less likely. The 3-class model displayed monotonic health states but the interpretation
of covariate effects (now from a multinomial logit specification with 2 coefficients for
each covariate) became cumbersome and did not appear to produce any additional
insight.
   In conclusion, we find robust and substantial improvements in health status among
the populations in states that implemented their SIM initiatives. The effects appear
to be working through Medicare and Medicaid channels, although we cannot rule out
other channels. In future work, we plan to examine the effects of SIM in the states
that implemented programs in the second round.
   This study has a number of limitations, nevertheless. First, although we have
deliberately taken a population perspective, it is important to understand healthcare
channels through which these innovations might have affected the population. The
BRFSS, unfortunately, has no good measures of healthcare utilization. Second, the
states participating in SIM were explicit about the involvement of Medicaid. We
were unable to stratify by Medicaid insurance status (choosing to stratify by a proxy
defined by low socioeconomic status instead) because the question of insurance type
is asked only in a couple of BRFSS years. Finally, although it would be of some
importance to be identify specific features of the states' innovations that made the
most difference, with only 6 treated states and no clear low-dimensional distinction
between the treatment states, we chose not to explore along those dimensions.
   Additional caveats are also in order. First, other CMMI interventions existed in
the treated states (and some control states) prior to SIM. Our evidence suggests that
there were no population level differential effects prior to 2014. Second, the fact that
our "Medicaid" results are weak can be attributed to the fact that we cannot directly
identify Medicaid enrollees. The sample of low SES individuals likely contains a
fraction of healthy individuals not enrolled in Medicaid (even if some of them may be
eligible). Such individuals would decrease the effect size on changes in health status.
Finally, although SIM initiatives were not targeted towards Medicare beneficiaries,


                                          19
we find a robust effect for the elderly sample. These effects are plausibly driven by
broad infrastructure and training changes funded via SIM combined with the fact that
Medicare beneficiaries are frequent users of healthcare services, thus most exposed to
systemic changes.

Note: Sample of observations from 2010-2012 (pre-SIM) and 2014-2016 (post-SIM) BRFSS. Low SES
is defined as individuals who have income<35,000 and education level no more than a high school
diploma. Models for the counts of "not good" physical health days and "not good" mental health
days are Poisson regressions. The model for the ordinal measure of self-reported health status is
an ordered logit regression. Demographic and socioeconomic status characteristics of the individual
included as covariates include gender, age, education, race and ethnicity, income group, rural/urban
status, and whether the survey was conducted by cell phone. All models included state and year
indicators, a state-specific linear year trend and month of survey indicators. Estimates of the
differential time trend coefficients are reported. Cluster-robust standard errors are in parentheses.
***, ** and * denote statistical significance at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

Note: Sample of observations from 2010-2012 (pre-SIM) and 2014-2016 (post-SIM) BRFSS. Latent
class profile model is estimated where the measures of latent health status are a count of "not good"
physical health days, a count of "not good" mental health days are Poisson regressions and an ordinal
measure of self-reported health status. Demographic and socioeconomic status characteristics of the
individual included as covariates include gender, age, education, race and ethnicity, income group,
rural/urban status, and whether the survey was conducted by cell phone. All models included state
and year indicators, a state-specific linear year trend and month of survey indicators. Estimates of
the differential time trend marginal effects are shown in the figure. Cluster-robust standard errors

Note: Sample of observations from 2010-2012 (pre-SIM) and 2014-2016 (post-SIM) BRFSS. Low
SES is defined as individuals who have income<35,000 and education level no more than a high
school diploma. Latent class profile model is estimated where the measures of latent health status
are a count of "not good" physical health days, a count of "not good" mental health days are Poisson
regressions and an ordinal measure of self-reported health status. Demographic and socioeconomic
status characteristics of the individual included as covariates include gender, age, education, race
and ethnicity, income group, rural/urban status, and whether the survey was conducted by cell
phone. All models included state and year indicators, a state-specific linear year trend and month of
survey indicators. Estimates of the differential time trend marginal effects are shown in the figure.
Cluster-robust standard errors are used to display 95% confidence intervals.
