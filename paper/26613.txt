This paper establishes the existence of deterministic cycles in infinite-horizon open economy
models with a flow collateral constraint. It shows that for plausible parameter configurations, the
economy has a unique equilibrium exhibiting deterministic cycles in which periods of debt
growth are followed by periods of debt deleveraging. In particular, three-period cycles exist,
which implies by the Li-Yorke Theorem the presence of cycles of any periodicity and chaos. The
paper also shows that deterministic cycles are absent in the Ramsey optimal allocation providing
a justification for macroprudential policies even in the absence of uncertainty.

1     Introduction
Financial frictions have been shown to amplify the business cycle. This paper argues that
they can also be its engine. It studies a model of an open economy with a flow collat-
eral constraint, whereby external debt is limited by the value of tradable and nontradable
income. This environment has been extensively used to shed light on important issues in
open economy macroeconomics such as inefficient credit booms, overborrowing, and sudden
stops. However, the related literature has limited attention to economies driven by exoge-
nous stochastic disturbances. The contribution of the present paper is to show that the mere
presence of the financial friction can engender cyclical fluctuations. To highlight this result
we abstract from any source of uncertainty and characterize perfect foresight equilibria.
Furthermore, we focus on parameterization for which the equilibrium is unique.
    The first result of the paper is a full analytical characterization of the debt policy function
in infinite-horizon environments in which agents are impatient ( (1 + r) < 1) and lines of
credit are tied to flow variables. These two features are defining elements of the literature
to which this paper contributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to
achieve this task. Although numerical characterizations in stochastic environments do exist.
The policy function is continuous but nonmonotonic. Importantly, we show that the maxi-
mum of the debt policy function exceeds the largest level of debt that is sustainable in the
long run--i.e., the largest constant level of debt that satisfies the collateral constraint and
guarantees positive consumption. This characteristic of the debt policy function gives rise
to deterministic equilibrium dynamics in which the economy oscillates around the highest
sustainable level of debt and suffers from recurring inefficient credit booms followed by debt
deleveraging.
    The second contribution of the paper is to show that for conditions that obtain under
plausible calibrations, the aforementioned oscillatory dynamics are periodic, which means
that the economy perpetually fluctuates around the steady state without ever converging
to it. The economy exhibits cycles of periodicity three. By the Li-Yorke (1975) theorem
this implies the existence of cycles of any periodicity and chaos. The deterministic cycles
identified in this paper share a number of features of business cycles observed in emerging
market economies. In particular, during the expansionary phase of the cycle, external credit
grows, domestic absorption expands, the real exchange rate appreciates, and the current
account deteriorates. At some point, the financial constraint binds, the credit boom comes
to a stop, there is widespread debt deleveraging, the real exchange rate depreciates, and the
current account experiences a reversal.
    The emergence of endogenous deterministic cycles has to do with two key features of


                                                 1
the class of models to which this paper belongs. One is that agents are impatient in the
sense that their subjective discount rate exceeds that of the market ( (1 + r) < 1). This
feature drives agents to front load consumption. Absent the financial friction, household debt
would rise monotonically and approach the natural debt limit. The second key feature is the
well known fact that when collateral depends on equilibrium prices, the collateral constraint
creates a pecuniary externality. By this externality, agents fail to internalize the full costs of
temporarily borrowing beyond the maximum level of debt that is sustainable in the long run.
In particular, they fail to see both, that their individual borrowing, in the aggregate, fuels
the credit boom by raising the value of collateral through real exchange rate appreciation
and that their deleveraging by depreciating the real exchange rate exacerbates the credit
crunch. Debt deleveraging has a cleansing effect, as debt levels must fall significantly below
the level that is sustainable in the long run. At this point, impatient consumers feeling
financially stronger embark on another credit boom and the story repeats itself.
   The third result of the paper is to show that deterministic debt cycles are inefficient in
the sense that they imply greater fluctuations in consumption than is socially optimal. We
characterize analytically the debt policy function of the Ramsey planner. This characteriza-
tion is novel as only numerical versions for stochastic economies are presented in the related
literature. As in known, the Ramsey planner behaves like an individual who becomes more
patient in periods in which the collateral constraint is slack in the current period but bind-
ing in the next. Thus she puts more weight on the future costs of deleveraging than private
households do. We present conditions under which it is optimal for a benevolent government
to eliminate deterministic cycles altogether. Finally, we characterize the associated optimal
capital control policy and show that the planner puts capital control taxes into place when
next-period debt in the laissez-faire economy exceeds the level of debt that is sustainable
in the long run. This result is a refinement of an existing one in stochastic versions of the
present economy, namely, that the social planner imposes capital controls when the collateral
constraint is expected to bind in the following period under the optimal allocation.
   This paper is related to a large and growing literature on financial constraints in open
economy models. The type of flow collateral constraint we study was introduced in open
economy models by Mendoza (2002) to understand sudden stops caused by fundamental
shocks. The pecuniary externality that emerges in this framework and the consequent room
for macroprudential policy is studied in Korinek (2007), Bianchi (2011), Benigno et al. (2013,
2016), Schmitt-Groh´
                   e and Uribe (2017), D´
                                        avila and Korinek (2018), and Jeanne and Korinek
(2019), among others. In Schmitt-Groh´
                                     e and Uribe (2019), we show that the model studied
in this paper can display multiple equilibria, which lead to self-fulfilling financial crises. By
contrast, the current paper focuses on parameter regions for which the equilibrium is unique


                                                2
so that such crises do not exist. The paper is also related to a closed-economy literature
showing that financial frictions can give rise to endogenous instability in infinite-horizon
economies. For example, Benhabib, Miao, and Wang (2016) show the existence of chaotic
equilibrium dynamics when the financial friction takes the form of limited enforcement in the
banking sector. Woodford (1989) shows that periodic equilibria and chaos can occur when
the financial friction takes the form of market segmentation whereby workers are hand-to-
mouth consumers and firms finance investment from retained earnings. Beaudry, Galizia,
and Portier (2019) characterize periodic equilibria in a New Keynesian model with consumer
default risk and bank monitoring costs.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Sec-
tion 3 shows that in equilibrium the financial constraint must bind in an infinite number
of periods. Section 4 characterizes the steady state of the economy and the maximum sus-
tainable level of debt. Section 5 provides an analytical characterization of the debt policy
function. Section 6 derives conditions under which deterministic cycles exist. Section 7
characterizes the Ramsey allocation and establishes conditions under which it is optimal to
eliminate deterministic cycles. Finally, section 8 concludes.


2     The Model
This section presents a model of an open economy with tradable and nontradable goods in
which debt is limited by a fraction of the value of tradable and nontradable income. This
collateral constraint introduces a pecuniary externality because the price of nontradables,
which affects the value of the nontradable component of income, is taken as exogenous by
individual agents, but is endogenously determined in equilibrium. The present formulation
is a workhorse model in the sudden stop literature. To isolate the role of financial frictions in
generating endogenous business cycles, the model abstracts from any source of uncertainty.
   Consider an open economy populated by a large number of identical households with
preferences of the form
                                           
                                                 tU (ct ),                                   (1)
                                          t=0

where ct denotes consumption in period t, U (·) denotes an increasing and concave period
utility function, and   (0, 1) denotes the subjective discount factor. The period utility
function takes the CRRA form
                                           c1- - 1
                                   U (c) =          ,
                                             1-
with  > 0. Consumption is assumed to be a composite of tradable and nontradable goods,


                                                 3
taking the CES form

                                            1-1/                 1-1/ 1/(1-1/ )
                    ct = A(cT    N      T
                            t , ct )  act          + (1 - a)cN
                                                             t                    ,          (2)

with  > 0, a  (0, 1), and where cT                                                   N
                                 t denotes consumption of tradables in period t and ct
denotes consumption of nontradables in period t. Households are assumed to have access
to a one-period internationally-traded bond denominated in terms of tradable goods, which
pays the interest rate r > 0. The household's sequential budget constraint is given by

                                                                 dt+1
                             cT       N         T      N
                              t + pt ct + dt = y + pt y +             ,                      (3)
                                                                 1+r

where pt denotes the relative price of nontradables in terms of tradables (or the real exchange
rate), dt denotes the amount of debt assumed in period t - 1 and due in period t, and
y T , y N > 0 denote the endowments of tradables and nontradables, respectively. Households
are subject to the standard no-Ponzi-game constraint limt (1 + r)-t dt  0.
   The collateral constraint takes the form

                                     dt+1  (y T + pt y N ),                                  (4)

where  > 0 is a parameter. The pecuniary externality arises because of the presence of
the relative price of nontradables, pt , on the right-hand side of the collateral constraint (4).
Each individual household takes pt as exogenously determined, even though, collectively, the
absorption of goods by households is a determinant of this relative price.
   The following assumption makes the collateral constraint economically relevant by ruling
out an equilibrium in which it never binds:

Assumption 1. The parameters  and r satisfy

                                               1+r
                                          <        .                                         (5)
                                                r

   As will become clear shortly, this assumption says that the collateral constraint is violated
at the natural debt limit--when debt is so high that the entire endowment of tradables must
be devoted to pay interest and tradable consumption is nil.
   A key assumption in the related literature, which we also maintain here, is that households
discount future period utilities at a rate higher than the market discount rate:

Assumption 2.  (1 + r) < 1.

   Households choose sequences cT       N
                                t > 0, ct > 0, ct > 0, and dt+1 to maximize (1) subject to


                                               4

d0 . The first-order conditions of this problem are (2)-(4),

bining this condition with the household's sequential budget constraint, equation (3), we
obtain the economy's resource constraint

   An equilibrium is then a set of sequences {cT

3     The Recurrent Nature of a Binding Collateral Con-
      straint
A property of the present economy that is important for establishing the existence of deter-
ministic cycles is that an equilibrium in which the collateral constraint never binds does not
exist. To see this, suppose, contrary to the claim, that the collateral constraint never binds
in equilibrium, that is, (4) always holds with a strict inequality. By (10) it then must be
the case that µt = 0 for all t  0. In this case, the Euler equation (7) and the assumption
that  (1 + r) < 1 imply that t converges to . This in turn implies that cTt converges to
0, which follows from equation (13) and the assumed functional forms for U (·) and A(·, ·).
The resource constraint (12), then implies that in the limit debt evolves according to the
expression dt+1 = (1 + r)dt - (1 + r)y T . Since r > 0, we have that dt must converge to the
steady state of this expression,
                                              T
                                       d¯  y (1 + r) ,
                                                 r
(the natural debt limit), for otherwise dt will converge to infinity in absolute value at the
rate r, violating the transversality condition (11). The fact that cT
                                                                    t converges to 0 implies by
equation (14) that the relative price of nontradables must converge to 0, limt pt = 0 (that
is, tradables become infinitely expensive). Finally, with pt  0 and dt+1  y T (1+ r)/r, in the
limit the collateral constraint (4) becomes y T (1 + r)/r  y T , which violates Assumption 1.
We have therefore established that an equilibrium in which the collateral constraint never
binds is impossible. We summarize this result in the following proposition:

Proposition 1 (The Recurrent Nature of a Binding Collateral Constraint). If r > 0,  (1 +
r) < 1, and  < (1 + r)/r, then in equilibrium the collateral constraint binds in an infinite
number of periods.

    Put differently, this proposition says that for any t  0 there exists a T > t in which the
collateral constraint binds in equilibrium.


4     The Steady State
The steady state is defined as an equilibrium in which all variables are forever constant.
Proposition 1 shows that an equilibrium in which the collateral constraint is always slack
does not exist. An immediate implication of this result is the following corollary:

Corollary 1. If a steady state exists, it must feature a binding collateral constraint.


                                              6
   It is convenient to express the right-hand side of the collateral constraint, equation (4),
as a function of dt+1 and dt . To this end use the resource constraint, equation (12), to
eliminate cT
           t from equation (14), and then use the resulting expression to eliminate pt from
the collateral constraint. This yields
                                                                                               
                                                                          dt+1          1/
                                                       1-a        yT +    1+r
                                                                                 - dt
            (y T + pt y N ) = F (dt+1, dt )   y T +                                          yN  ,   (16)

with F1 > 0 and F2 = -(1 + r)F1 < 0. The collateral constraint (4) can then be written as

                                         dt+1  F (dt+1 , dt ).

                                                                                ~ such that
From Corollary 1, we have that if a steady state exists, there must be a scalar d
the collateral constraint holds with equality when dt = dt+1 = d ~. Formally, suppose that
dt = dt+1 = d, then the steady-state collateral constraint becomes
                                                                                  
                                                                    rd    1/

   Figure 1 plots the left- and right-hand sides of the steady-state collateral constraint,
equation (17). The left-hand side is the 45-degree line. The right-hand side, F (d, d), is
unambiguously downward sloping. The steady-state level of debt, d ~, is the value of d at
which the left- and right-hand sides intersect, that is, where the steady state collateral
constraint is binding. By Assumption 1, the collateral constraint is violated at the natural
debt limit, d = d¯  y T (1 + r)/r. Also, it is clear that the collateral constraint is slack when
d = 0. This means that d   ~ exists, is a unique positive scalar smaller than the natural debt
           ~< d
limit (0 < d  ¯), and is implicitly given by

                                            ~ = F (d,
                                            d      ~d ~).                                            (18)

        ~ is below the natural debt limit, the associated steady state value of cT is strictly
Because d                                                                        t
positive.
    To complete the proof of the existence of a steady state, it remains to show that when dt =
~ for all t, the Euler equation (7), the nonnegativity constraint (9), and the transversality
d
condition (11) all hold. The latter condition is trivially satisfied for any constant value of
debt. Evaluating (7) at d~ we obtain 1 =  (1+r) , which by Assumption 2 implies that µt is
                                        1-(1+r )µt
positive and equal to µ
                      ~  1/(1 + r) -  > 0, so that (9) holds. Intuitively, this expression

reflecting the fact that more impatient households would be willing to pay a higher price for
the right to increase their debt by one unit. We have therefore shown that all the equilibrium
conditions are satisfied when dt = d ~ for all t, that is, we have demonstrated the existence of
a steady state. We summarize this result in the following proposition:

Proposition 2 (Existence of the Steady State). If Assumptions 1 and 2 hold, then a steady
state exists and is unique. Furthermore, the steady state features a binding collateral con-
                                                ~ = F (d,
straint and a level of debt implicitly given by d      ~d ~).



5     Characterization of the Debt Policy Function
In this section we characterize the debt policy function, which we denote by

                                             dt+1 = D(dt ).

To this end we reduce the set of equilibrium conditions as follows. Using the resource
constraint (12), to eliminate cT
                               t from (13), we can express t as the following function of dt+1
and dt :

                                             dt+1                            dt+1
           t = (dt+1 , dt )  U   A yT +           - dt , y N    A1 y T +          - dt , y N   ,
                                             1+r                             1+r

with 1 < 0 and 2 = -(1 + r)1 > 0.
    An equilibrium is then a pair of sequences {dt+1 , µt }t=0 satisfying


                                                (1 + r)
                            (dt+1 , dt ) =                 (dt+2 , dt+1 ),                         (19)
                                             1 - (1 + r)µt

                                   µt [F (dt+1, dt ) - dt+1 ] = 0,                                 (21)

                                                µt  0,                                             (22)

can then be obtained from (12), t from (13), and pt from (14).
   To avoid the type of multiplicity of equilibria identified in Schmitt-Groh´e and Uribe
(2019), we restrict attention to parameter configurations for which the slope of the right-
hand side of the collateral constraint with respect to dt+1 evaluated at the steady state is
less than one,
                 ~d
Assumption 3. F1(d, ~) < 1.

   The interpretation of this condition is that in the vicinity of the steady state an increase
in dt+1 tightens the collateral constraint.


5.1    Cobb-Douglas Consumption Aggregator
Before considering the case of a CES consumption aggregator, as a stepping stone, we study
the special case of a Cobb-Douglas aggregator, which results under a unit intratemporal
elasticity of consumption substitution,

                                               = 1.

Under this parameterization, the equilibrium value of collateral, F (dt+1 , dt ), becomes a linear
function of debt,
                                             1-a           dt+1
                      F (dt+1, dt ) = y T +         yT +         - dt                         (25)
                                              a            1+r
and the requirement that collateral increases less than one-for-one with dt+1 , Assumption 3,
becomes
                                          1-a
                                              < 1.
                                        1+r a
   Solving equation (20) holding with equality, we get that when the collateral constraint
binds, the debt policy function takes the form

                                          +  1-a
                                                 a

                                                                a
                       dt+1 = G(dt )          1-a  y   -       1-a dt .
                                        1 - 1+r a
                                                         1 - 1+r a


By Assumption 3, G(·) is downward sloping.
   The main finding of this section is that the policy function, D(·), looks like the function
depicted in figure 2. In particular, it is everywhere continuous and crosses the 45-degree line
once and from above. Importantly, the slope of the policy function changes sign at a level
                               ~. For levels of debt higher than db , the collateral constraint
of debt db satisfying 0 < db < d
is binding and the policy function is the linear decreasing function G(dt ). For values of debt
lower than db , the collateral constraint is slack, and the policy function is upward sloping.

Interestingly, for debt levels in the range [db , d
collateral constraint is binding. Thus, within this range, a binding collateral constraint is
not associated with deleveraging. We summarize the properties of the policy function in the
following proposition:

Proposition 3 (Properties of the Policy Function When  = 1). If  = 1 and Assumptions 1
to 3 hold, then the policy function, dt+1 = D(dt ), is continuous and crosses the 45-degree line
once and with negative slope at d  ~. There exists a level of debt db < d
                                                                        ~ satisfying D(db ) > db
above which the collateral constraint binds and the policy function is downward sloping and
below which the collateral constraint is slack and the policy function is upward sloping.

Proof. See Appendix A.

   The assumptions of Proposition 3 are satisfied for reasonable parameterizations, such as
the one shown in Table 1 with  = 1, which, except for this parameter, is the one adopted
in Bianchi (2011).

next-period debt, d , for four levels of current period debt, d, namely, d    ~, dU , d , and d . The

the right-hand side of the long-run collateral constraint F (d , d ).

5.2       CES Consumption Aggregator
Under certain conditions to be specified here, Proposition 3 also applies when the intratem-
poral elasticity of substitution between tradables and nontradables is less than one,

                                                  0 <  < 1.

The key difference with the Cobb-Douglas case ( = 1) is that when   (0, 1), the right-
hand side of the collateral constraint, F (dt+1, dt ), ceases to be linear in dt+1 and becomes
strictly convex. As a result, the equation dt+1 = F (dt+1 , dt ) may admit two solutions for
dt+1 given a dt . In other words, G(dt ) may not be single valued. This feature of the model
can potentially give rise to multiple equilibria of the type analyzed in Schmitt-Groh´
                                                                                     e and
Uribe (2019), which are not the focus of the present analysis. However, if one imposes the
selection criterion of allowing only the lower value of dt+1 for which the collateral constraint
binds,1 then G(dt ) is again single valued and decreasing. The shape of the debt policy
function depends not only on the function G(·), but also on the composed function G(G(·)),
which specifies the evolution of debt when the collateral constraint binds in two consecutive
periods. Appendices B.1 and B.2 formally characterize the functions G(·) and G(G(·)). Here,
we describe them in a graphical fashion.
   Figure 3 plots the right-hand side of the collateral constraint, F (d , d), as a function of
next-period debt, d , for three levels of current-period debt, d, which define the domains
of the functions G(·) and G(G(·)): dU , d , and d . As a reference, it also plots the right-
                                                                           ~. The left-hand
hand side of the collateral constraint for the steady-state level of debt, d
side of the collateral constraint, d , is the 45-degree line, shown with a broken line. The
figure reproduces from figure 1 the right-hand side of the steady-state collateral constraint,
F (d , d ). The level of debt dU is the upper bound of debt for which an equilibrium exists. As
shown in the figure when d = dU , the collateral constraint binds with a slope exactly equal
to zero. The slope of the right-hand side of the collateral constraint, F1(d , d), vanishes when
consumption of tradables is zero, cT = 0. Any level of debt greater than dU is unsustainable.
Proposition B1 in Appendix B establishes this result formally. The debt level d is the level
of debt such that if the collateral constraint binds, it can place the economy at dU next
period, dU = F (dU , d ). In this case, G(G(d )) would be associated with zero consumption
of tradables. So this function would not be defined for debt levels less than or equal to d .
Finally, d is the smallest level of debt for which the collateral constraint can bind. At this
level of debt, the right-hand side of the collateral constraint meets the left-hand side only
once and at a point of tangency, denoted d , where d = F (d , d ). For levels of current

      This selection criterion is implicitly imposed in much of the sudden stop literature.

debt below d , the collateral constraint is slack for any choice of next-period debt, d . So the
function G(·) is not defined for debt levels lower than d .
   The following proposition states that under certain regularity conditions on the function
F (·, ·), the debt policy function for the economy with a CES consumption aggregator has the
same characteristics as that associated with the economy with a Cobb Douglas consumption
aggregator (see Figure 2):

Proposition 4 (Properties of the Policy Function with a CES Aggregator). If 0 <  < 1,
and Assumptions 1 to 3 and B1 (given in Appendix B) hold, then under the equilibrium
selection criterion of allowing only the lower value of debt for which the collateral constraint
is binding, the policy function, dt+1 = D(dt ), is continuous and crosses the 45-degree line
once and with negative slope at d~. There exists a level of debt db < d
                                                                      ~ satisfying D(db ) > db
above which the collateral constraint binds and the policy function is downward sloping and
below which the collateral constraint is slack and the policy function is upward sloping.

Proof. See Appendix B.

    The assumptions of Proposition 4 are satisfied for the calibration shown in Table 1 with
 = 0.83, the value assumed in Bianchi (2011).


6     Deterministic Debt Cycles
The present economy can exhibit bounded equilibrium dynamics that do not converge to
the steady state. Because the parameterizations we focus on yield a single-valued policy
function, the equilibrium is unique. This means that the equilibrium dynamics in this class
of open economy models are inherently cyclical even in the absence of (fundamental or
nonfundamental) uncertainty.

Notes. Values of  for which F1 (d,  ~d ~)  (1/(2 + r ), 1) are associated with an unstable steady state.
The bullet indicates the value of F1 (d,  ~d
                                           ~) at  = 0.83, the baseline value. All other parameters of
the function F (·, ·) are set at their baseline values (see table 1).


The fact that F1 is positive together with Assumption 3 guarantees that G (d    ~) is negative.
                                                                      ~d
This means that the steady state is locally stable if and only if F1 (d, ~) < 1/(2 + r). This
condition says that local stability of the steady state requires that for each unit increase in
debt the value of collateral increase by less than one half. We summarize this result in the
following proposition:

Proposition 5 (Local Stability of the Steady State). Suppose that Assumptions 1 to 3 hold.
                                                            ~d
Then, the steady state is locally stable if and only if F1 (d, ~) < 1/(2 + r).

    If the stability condition of Proposition 5 is not met, then a small deviation of d from
its steady-state value d~ will trigger dynamics leading away from and never converging back
to d~. Figure 4 shows that this is indeed the case for parameterizations commonly used in
the sudden stop literature. It plots F1(d,~d~) as a function of the intratemporal elasticity of
substitution,  . All other parameters of the model take the values shown in Table 1. For
                               ~d
values of  larger than 0.7, F1(d, ~) lies in the interval (1/(2 + r), 1) and therefore the steady
state is unstable. This is the case, in particular, for  = 0.83, the baseline value. Figure 4
also shows that there do not exist values of   (0, 1] such that the steady state is stable
when all parameters other than  take their respective baseline values.

6.2    Limit Cycles
A natural question is how debt behaves globally when the steady state is unstable. As it turns
out, the model possesses attracting forces that prevent debt from exploding. Specifically,
if the steady state is unstable, then the equilibrium exhibits bounded oscillating dynamics,
which never converge to the steady state. To see this, note that, given an arbitrary initial
debt level d0 : (a) if the steady state is unstable, the economy will not converge to it; and,
from Propositions 3 and 4 (with graphical representation in Figure 2); (b) when dt < d ~, then
                        ~, then there is a finite J such that dt+J  db ; (d) if dt  (db , d
dt+1 > dt ; (c) if dt < d                                                                 ~), then
       ~; and finally (e) if dt > d
dt+1 > d                           ~, then dt+1 < d ~. Thus, the economy fluctuates perpetually
around the steady state d  ~ without ever converging to it or exploding. These type of dynamics
arise because the steady state is locally repellent but globally attracting. Therefore, the
equilibrium consists of an infinite sequence of episodes in which debt expansions (credit
booms) are followed by debt contractions (macroeconomic deleveraging). We then have the
following proposition:
                                                        ~d
Proposition 6 (Endogenous Debt Cycles). Suppose that F1(d, ~)  (1/(2 + r), 1) and that
 = 1 and the conditions of Proposition 3 are satisfied or that   (0, 1) and the conditions
of Proposition 4 are satisfied. Then, the equilibrium exhibits bounded oscillating dynamics
                                                             ~ without ever converging to it.
in which debt perpetually fluctuates around its steady state d


6.3    Two-Period Cycles
Figures 5 and 6 plot the equilibrium path of debt for an arbitrary initial condition in two
calibrated economies. In figure 5 all parameters take the baseline values shown in Table 1
with  = 1 (Cobb-Douglas aggregator). In the economy depicted in Figure 6, all parameters
are set at the values shown in Table 1 with  = 0.83 (CES aggregator).
   Under both parameter configurations debt converges to a two-period cycle. In the limit
cycle periods of slack collateral constraints coincide with periods of rapid debt growth (credit
booms) and periods of binding collateral constraints coincide with debt deleveraging. During
a credit boom, consumption of tradables expands, equation (12), and the real exchange rate
appreciates, equation (14). The opposite happens when the economy deleverages, namely,
domestic absorption falls and the real exchange rate depreciates.
   Let's explore more formally the existence and stability of two-period cycles. Consider
a two-period cycle in which the collateral constraint binds every other period, which, for
example, is the case for the two-period cycles shown in figures 5 and 6. Let dc and du
be the levels of debt in periods in which the economy is constrained and unconstrained,
respectively. In a period in which the constraint is slack, the Lagrange multiplier on the

collateral constraint is nil (µ = 0), so that the equilibrium Euler equation (19) takes the
form
                                     (du , dc ) =  (1 + r)(dc , du ).

When the economy is constrained, the next-period debt satisfies

                                                dc = G(du ).

The above two equations uniquely determine du and dc . If in addition the collateral constraint
is satisfied in the period in which the economy is unconstrained, du  F (du , dc ), and if con-
sumption is positive in both states, y T + dt+1 /(1+ r) - dt > 0 for (dt+1 , dt ) = (dc , du ), (du , dc ),
then a two-period cycle exists, with periodic points du and dc . When the aggregator function
is Cobb-Douglass ( = 1), both of the above equations are linear, which allows for a closed-
form solution of the cycle. When the aggregator function is of the CES form (  (0, 1)),
the two-period cycle can be computed using numerical methods.
   Consider now the stability of the two-period cycle. Does the economy converge to the
cycle (dc , du ) for arbitrary initial debt levels in the vicinity of dc or du ? Suppose that the
economy is sufficiently close to the limit cycle, so that it continues to be the case that it
is constrained every other period. Let dt be a period in which the collateral constraint is
slack. Then, the period-t Euler equation holds with µt = 0, and the period t + 1 collateral
constraint is binding, dt+2 = G(dt+1 ). So we have that the Euler equation in period t can be
written as
                          (G-1 (dt+2 ), dt ) =  (1 + r)(dt+2 , G-1 (dt+2 )),                          (26)

where G-1 (·) is the inverse function of G(·), so that dt+1 = G-1 (dt+2 ). Equation (26) is a
first-order difference equation defining the law of motion of debt chosen in periods in which
the collateral constraint is binding, which can be written as

                                               dt+2 = C2 (dt ),

where the subscript indicates the periodicity of the cycle. The steady state of this equation
is dc . The two-period cycle is locally stable (attracting) if |C2(dc )| < 1, provided C2(·)
is differentiable in the vicinity of dc . In this case, full differentiation of (26) evaluated at
dt = dt+2 = dc yields

                                                  (1 + r)G (du )
                       C2 (dc ) =                     c   u                        < 0,

where du = G-1 (dc ). The fact that C2 is negative means that if the two-period cycle is
attracting, the convergence to it is oscillatory, as can be observed in figures 5 and 6.
    The stability of the two-period cycle, however, cannot be determined by simple inspection
of this expression. Although a closed-form solution for C2(dc ) can be obtained when  = 1
(Cobb-Douglas aggregator), it is an involved function of the structural parameters of the
model. One must therefore resort to a numerical evaluation of C2 (dc ). We note that this is
an exact numerical evaluation. When  < 1 (CES aggregator), C2 (dc ) can be approximated
numerically to any degree of accuracy. Setting  = 1 and all other parameters at their
baseline values given in Table 1 yields C2 (dc ) = -0.56, confirming that the two-period cycle
shown in figure 5 is stable. Similarly, setting all parameters at their baseline values and
 = 0.83 yields C2(dc ) = -0.74, which says that the two-period cycle shown in figure 6 is
also attracting. We conclude that the economy exhibits an attracting two-period cycle for
parameterizations commonly used in the sudden stop literature.

We have already established that when G (d
                   ~ without converging to it (Proposition 6). Here, we show that there
perpetually around d
exist parameterizations for which the equilibrium dynamics exhibit three-period cycles. This
type of periodic equilibria comes in only two forms: one featuring two consecutive periods
with a slack collateral constraint followed by a period with a binding constraint, and the
other featuring a period with a slack collateral constraint followed by a period with a binding
constraint in which nonetheless credit expands, followed by another period with a binding
constraint, in which the economy is forced to deleverage.
   Three-period cycles in which the collateral constraint is always binding are impossible.
To see this, suppose that such a cycle exists. Let the periodic debt levels be denoted dc , dcc ,
and dccc . Suppose, without loss of generality, that dc  (db , d~), and that it is followed by
                  ~ = G(d
dcc . Then, since d      ~) and G (·) < 0, we have that dcc = G(dc ) > d ~, dccc = G(dcc ) < d~,
                    ~, which is a contradiction. Similarly, three-period cycles in which the
and dc = G(dccc ) > d
economy is always unconstrained are impossible by Proposition 1.
   Consider the first type of three-period cycle, namely, the one in which the economy is
unconstrained in two periods and constrained in the third.2 Let du be the level of debt
chosen when the economy is financially unconstrained in the current and the next period,
      2
          The characterization of the second type of period-3 cycles goes along similar lines, and we therefore omit
it.

and let duu be the level of debt chosen when the economy is unconstrained in the current
period but constrained in the next. And let dc be the level of debt chosen in periods in
which the economy is financially constrained. When the chosen level of debt is du or duu ,
the multiplier µ is nil, and the Euler equations take the form, respectively,

                                     (du , dc ) =  (1 + r)(duu , du ),

and
                                    (duu , du ) =  (1 + r)(dc , duu ).

When the collateral constraint is binding, next-period debt satisfies

                                                dc = G(duu ).                                             (27)

The above expressions form a system of three equations in three unknowns, which can be
solved for du , duu , and dc . If the collateral constraint is not violated at either of the two
periodic points in which the economy is unconstrained, du  F (du , dc ) and duu  F (duu , du ),
and if consumption of tradables is positive at the three periodic points, y T + dt+1 /(1+ r) - dt >
0 for (dt+1 , dt ) = (duu , du ), (du , dc ), (dc , duu ), then the triplet (dc , du , duu ) represents a three-
period cycle.
    Three-period cycles of this type can be found for parameterizations close to the baseline
one. To facilitate computations, we focus on the Cobb-Douglas case ( = 1) as it admits a
closed-form solution. Three-period cycles do not exist when all parameters take the values
shown in table 1 with  = 1. But plausible calibrations do exhibit this type of deterministic
fluctuations. As an example, consider the parameter configuration a = 0.23,  = 0.88,
 = 0.32, r = 0.091, and  = 1.7. Figure 7 displays the path of debt along the three-period
cycle associated with this parameterization. The elevated segments of the time path are
the periods in which the economy is unconstrained, dt+1 = du , duu . The troughs correspond
to periods in which the collateral constraint binds and the economy deleverages, dt+1 = dc .
The fact that the economy has a three-period cycle implies, as we will discuss shortly, that
it must also have a two-period cycle, which is shown in figure 7 with a broken line. For
the particular parameterization considered, the amplitude of the three-period cycle is larger
than that of the two-period cycle.
    The three-period cycle displayed in Figure 7 is stable, while, by construction, the two-
period cycle and the steady state (the one-period cycle) are unstable (recall that we are
focusing attention on parameter values for which this is the case). The stability of the three-
period cycle can be verified by simulation, as shown in Figure 8, or analytically following

the same steps as in the stability analysis of the two-period cycle. For the latter approach,
write the equilibrium law of motion of debt near the three-period cycle as

                              (dt+1 , dt ) =  (1 + r)(G-1 (dt+3 ), dt+1 )                             (28)

and
                       (G-1 (dt+3 ), dt+1 ) =  (1 + r)(dt+3 , G-1 (dt+3 )).                           (29)

Combining these two expressions to eliminate dt+1 yields an implicit function describing the
evolution of debt in periods in which the collateral constraint binds

                                              dt+3 = C3 (dt ).

The steady state of this difference equation is dc , that is, dc = C3 (dc ). Local stability of
the three-period cycle requires that |C3 (dc )| < 1, provided that C3 (·) is differentiable at dc .
If this is the case, then fully differentiating (28) and (29) and evaluating the derivatives at
dt = dc , dt+1 = du , dt+2 = duu , and dt+3 = dc , we have

The inequality follows from the fact that             (1+r )G (duu )
                                                                       < 1 and implies that, if the three-
period cycle is attracting, then the convergence toward it is oscillatory. Evaluating the above
expression at the periodic values of debt (dc , du , and duu ), we obtain that C3 (dc ) = -0.53,
confirming the attracting nature of the cycle.


6.5     Cycles of Any Periodicity and Chaos
In a seminal contribution, Li and Yorke (1975) show that if a univariate difference equation
has a cycle of periodicity three, then it has cycles of any periodicity and chaos. Chaotic
dynamics are dynamics in which debt does not converge asymptotically to a cycle of any
periodicity (including a unit periodicity, the steady state). Since as shown above, three-
period cycles exist for plausible parameterizations, we have the following proposition:

Proposition 7. If the conditions of proposition 3 hold, then there exist plausible parameter-
izations for which the economy displays cycles of any periodicity and chaos.

                                                       22
Proof. See Appendix C.

    The theorem of Li and Yorke, however, does not indicate the measure of the set of initial
debt levels that give rise to chaotic dynamics. Indeed, such set may be of measure zero. For
the economy studied in this paper, we could not detect, using numerical methods, parameters
for which the equilibrium dynamics converge to cycles with periodicity higher than three.
However, as shown in figure 8, the transitional dynamics converging to a three-period cycle
can look quite complex for long periods of time. Specifically, in the figure, a clear convergence
pattern is discernible only after more than 3,000 years, even though the economy starts from
a point near the cycle.


7     Optimal Policy
Would a benevolent government wish to eliminate the deterministic cycles that inevitably
occur under laissez-faire? To address this question, consider the constrained optimal allo-
cation, defined as the solution to the problem of a benevolent social planner who faces the
collateral constraint and internalizes that in equilibrium the relative price of nontradables--
and thereby the value of collateral--depends on aggregate absorption and that the market
for nontradables must clear. Formally, the optimization problem of the Ramsey planner is
to choose sequences {cT         
                      t , dt+1 }t=0 to maximize

The planner's Euler equation is identical to that of the individual household. However, her
marginal utility of wealth, R
                            t , is different, as she internalizes that a unit increase in con-
sumption of tradables has a positive shadow value when the collateral constraint is binding

price of nontradables, H (cT

   It can readily be established that Propositions 1 and 2 hold. That is, in the Ramsey
optimal equilibrium the collateral constraint binds in an infinite number of periods. And

this implies that in the steady state the collateral constraint binds and debt is given by d
Thus, the steady state is the same in the Ramsey and unregulated equilibria. We collect
this result in the following proposition:

Proposition 8 (Steady State of the Ramsey Economy). If Assumptions 1 to 3 hold, then
in the Ramsey equilibrium the collateral constraint binds in an infinite number of periods.
A steady state exists and is unique. Further, the steady state features a binding collateral

   The Ramsey planner finds it optimal to eliminate the deterministic cycles that exist
under laissez-faire. Figure 9 plots the debt policy function, dt+1 = Dr (dt ), associated with
the constrained optimal allocation for the baseline calibration shown in table 1 with  = 1
(Cobb-Douglas aggregator). For comparison, it reproduces from figure 5 the debt policy
function under laissez-faire. Under the Ramsey optimal policy, for levels of debt below the
steady state (dt < d~), debt converges to the steady state monotonically and in finite time.
Along the transition the collateral constraint is slack. Once debt exceeds the threshold db1

    The absence of cycles under the Ramsey policy is not limited to the baseline calibration.
The planner is also able to eliminate cycles, for example, for the calibration considered in
section 6.4 , which delivers a three-period cycle under laissez-faire. The following proposition
provides conditions under which cycles are impossible in the Ramsey equilibrium.

By contrast, as we established in section 6, in the laissez-faire equilibrium, the economy
converges to a cycle in which periodically agents choose levels of debt exceeding d~, which
subsequently force them into deleveraging. When the economy is still unconstrained but
                                                                              ~ and therefore
close to a binding collateral constraint, the planner avoids borrowing beyond d
a future deleveraging crisis by becoming effectively more patient than agents in the laissez-
faire economy. To see this, consider the Euler equation of the planner in a period in which
the collateral constraint is slack (µR                                          R
                                     t = 0) but binds in the following period (µt+1 > 0):

where tR                                                                      ~). In the laissez-faire

the effective discount factor of the planner makes her put greater value on the costs of a
future deleveraging while leaving the benefits of current spending unchanged. Therefore, she
resolves the tradeoff between curbing spending today and deleveraging tomorrow in favor of
the former. By contrast, private agents faced with the same tradeoff but a lower discount
factor ( < tR  +1 ) choose not to curb spending today and to deleverage in the future.

7.1    Optimal Capital Control Policy
We have established that left to its own devices the economy displays a unique equilibrium
characterized by deterministic debt cycles, and that a benevolent government finds such
cycles undesirable. In this subsection, we ask how the fiscal policy that supports the desired
equilibrium looks like. As is well known, in environments like the one studied here, the
Ramsey optimal allocation can be supported by a capital control tax (see, for example,
Korinek, 2010; Bianchi, 2011; Benigno et al. 2013 and 2016; Bianchi and Mendoza, 2018;
D´
 avila and Korinek, 2018; Jeanne and Korinek, 2019; and the survey by Rebucci and Ma,
2019). Specifically, suppose the government imposes capital controls that take the form of
a proportional tax on debt at the rate t . In this case the household's budget constraint
becomes

where Tt denotes lump-sum transfers, which the government uses to rebate any revenues
from the capital control tax. The equilibrium Euler equation becomes

                  [(1 - t ) - (1 + r)µt ] (dt+1 , dt ) =  (1 + r)(dt+2 , dt+1 ).             (39)

             ~, the Ramsey optimal capital control tax results from evaluating this expression
For any dt < d
at µt = 0, dt+1 = Dr (dt ) and dt+2 = Dr2 (dt ), and solving for t . Therefore having obtained
the Ramsey optimal debt policy, solving for the optimal tax rate is straightforward.
   Figure 10 plots the Ramsey optimal tax rate, t , for the baseline calibration with  = 1.
For dt  db1 the tax rate is zero and the Ramsey planner's collateral constraint is slack in
periods t and t + 1. For this reason the planner lets capital flow unfettered. The planner
begins to impose capital controls when the collateral constraint is slack in period t but
                                          ~). The closer dt is to d
binding in t + 1, that is, for dt  (db1 , d                       ~, the higher the tax rate
will be. For the baseline parameterization, the tax rate reaches 5.4 percent at its peak,
which means that the effective annual interest rate charged to domestic households, given
by (1 + r)/(1 - t ) - 1, reaches 9.9 percent.
   As stressed in the related literature, the purpose of the optimal capital control tax is
to make households internalize that their collective absorption, by appreciating the real ex-
change rate, elevates the value of collateral. The novel insight of the present analysis is that
government intervention is called for even in the absence of fundamental uncertainty. The

reason is that the equilibrium in the laissez-faire economy features inefficient oscillations
                                              ~. These oscillations can be periodic (if deter-
around the highest sustainable level of debt, d
ministic cycles exist) or dampening. But they always imply inefficient credit booms followed
by costly Fisherian deflations.


8     Conclusion
In much of the open economy literature, financial constraints play the role of amplifying the
effects of exogenous shocks. Credit cycles are driven by exogenous fundamental or nonfun-
damental disturbances. In this paper, the financial constraint itself is the source of aggregate
fluctuations. The paper establishes the existence of deterministic debt cycle in a canonical
open economy model with a flow collateral constraint. Two features of the model make de-
terministic cycles possible: impatient households and a pecuniary externality. For plausible
parameter configurations, the model has a unique equilibrium exhibiting deterministic cycles
in which periods of debt growth are followed by periods of debt deleveraging. In particular,
three-period cycles are shown to exist, which implies by the Li-Yorke Theorem the presence
of cycles of any periodicity and chaos.
    Intuitively, when debt is relatively low, the collateral constraint is slack, and impatient
households embark on elevated consumption fueled by capital inflows. During this phase of
the cycle, the trade balance deteriorates and the real exchange rate appreciates. In turn,
the real exchange rate appreciation, by raising the value of the nontraded component of
collateral, expands borrowing capacity. Eventually, debt exceeds the level that is sustainable
in the long run, the collateral constraint binds, and a period of credit contraction ensues.
Consumption falls, the current account reverses sign, and the real exchange rate depreciates,
which exacerbates the contraction by lowering the value of the nontraded component of
collateral. Once debt deleveraging has run its course, individual agents find themselves in
better financial conditions and foreign lenders observing an improvement in fundamentals
resume capital inflows. At this point the debt cycle starts all over again.
    The deterministic credit cycles just described are inefficient because agents fail to fully
internalize the welfare cost of expanding credit beyond its long-run sustainable level. In
particular, agents do not take into account that their own cut in absorption has a negative
effect on the value of collateral via a fall in market prices. A benevolent social planner who
internalizes the pecuniary externality resolves the tradeoff between less debt expansion during
the boom and larger debt deleveraging during the contraction in favor of the former. Under
certain conditions, it is optimal for the planner to eliminate deterministic cycles altogether.
This result provides a rationale for capital control policy even in the absence of uncertainty.

This appendix contains the proofs of Propositions 3, 4, and 7.


A     Proof of Proposition 3
We construct the proof through a series of lemmas and propositions. When convenient, we
use the notation d for the current stock of debt, d for next period debt, and d for debt in
the period after the next.
    Using the result that at the steady state the collateral constraint is binding (Proposi-

Lemma A1. If d < (>)d

Proof. When the collateral constraint binds, we have that d = G(d). The result then follows
immediately from the fact that G < 0 and that, by definition, d~ = G(d
                                                                     ~).

                  ~ and the collateral constraint is slack, then dt+1 > dt .
Lemma A2. If dt < d

Proof. Suppose, on the contrary, that dt+1  dt . The fact that the collateral constraint
must bind in finite time (proposition 1) and that G(x) > x for any x < d  ~ (lemma A1)
means that debt must increase at some finite time. Thus, at some finite time when the
collateral constraint is slack, the path of debt must be of the form d  d < d . This implies
that (d , d) >  (1 + r)(d , d ) (recall that 1 < 0 and 2 > 0), which violates the Euler
equation (19), since µ = 0 when the collateral constraint is slack.

                                                             ~. Thus, the policy function

Proof. Suppose, on the contrary, that the collateral constraint is slack. Recall that for any
d>d ~, G(d) < d
              ~. Thus if the collateral constraint is slack, then d < G(d) < d

lemma A1 and lemma A2, d > d . By the Euler equation (19) it must be that µ > 0, which
is a contradiction.

Let d be the level of debt in the period prior to the one in which the collateral constraint
binds for the first time. Thus, we have that d = G(d ). Also, d > db , d < G(d) < G(db ),
and d = G(d ) > G(db ) = G(G(db )). Thus, we have that

        (d , d) -  (1 + r)(d , d ) > (G(db ), db ) -  (1 + r)(G(G(db )), G(db ))
                                      = 0,

which contradicts the assumption that the collateral constraint is slack. In the above ex-
pression, the inequality follows from the fact that 1 < 0 and 2 > 0, and the equality from
the definition of db given in proposition A2.

Proposition A4. The collateral constraint does not bind for any dt < db .

Proof. Suppose, contrary to the claim, that d < db and that the collateral constraint binds.
Since G < 0, we have that d = G(d) > G(db ) > db . The fact that d > db implies,
by propositions A1 and A3 that the collateral constraint binds in the next period, so that
d = G(d ) < G(db ) = G(G(db )). We can then write

         (d , d) -  (1 + r)(d , d ) < (G(db ), db ) -  (1 + r)(G(G(db )), G(db ))
                                         = 0,

which implies that the multiplier µ must be negative. In the above expression, the inequality
follows from the fact that 1 < 0 and 2 > 0, and the equality from the definition of db
given in proposition A2.

Proposition A5 (Continuity and Slope of the Policy Function). The debt policy function,
dt+1 = D(dt ), is continuous, strictly increasing for dt < db , and strictly decreasing for dt > db .

Proof. Suppose that dt > db . Then, by Propositions A1 and A3 we have that D(dt ) = G(dt ),
which is continuous and strictly decreasing under the maintained assumption that F1 < 1
when the collateral constraint binds.
   Suppose now that dt = d  ^t < db . By proposition 1, the collateral constraint must bind at
some finite horizon. Let the first period in which it binds be t + J ^, where J^ depends on d
                                                                                            ^t
in a way to be explained shortly. Then, it must be the case that dt+J
                                                                    ^+1 = G(dt+J ^). For all

0jJ      ^ - 1, the Euler equation (19) holds with µt+j = 0. Therefore, the policy function
is implicitly given by the solution to

   Holding J       ^ fixed, the solution is continuous and differentiable at d    ^t because the sys-
tem (A1) is composed of the continuous and differentiable functions (·, ·) and G(·). More-

increase in dt+J^. The last equation of system (A1) and the facts that 1 < 0, 2 > 0 and

   The first period in which the collateral constraint binds, t + J^, is determined by the
requirement that d^ ^  db (to ensure that the economy is unconstrained in t + J  ^ - 1) and

   Suppose that d  ^t is such that d^ ^ < db and d    ^ ^ > db . In this case, by continuity, J

function D(dt ) is continuous, differentiable, and strictly increasing at d
    Consider now a debt level d^t < db such that d
                                                 ^ ^ = db . This is a special case in which

                                                                     ^, it does not constrain
although the collateral constraint holds with equality in period t + J
the household's choices (^µ ^ = 0). In this situation, a small decline in d    ^t results in a
                              t+J
change in the period in which the collateral constraint holds with equality for the first time.
However, as we will see, in this case a change in the period in which the collateral constraint
holds with equality for the first time does no create a discontinuity in the policy function.
(Though it might create a discontinuity in its derivative.) Since by definition the economy
is unconstrained in t + J  ^ - 1, we have that d ^ ^ < db . Consider first a small perturbation
                                                  t+J -1
dt > d^t . Then, if the perturbation is sufficiently small, d ^ < db and d ^ > db . Therefore,
                                                              t+J -1            t+J
J^ is unchanged and the policy function is right-continuous. To establish left continuity,
                                   ^t . Then, d ^ < db , which means, by Proposition A4,
consider a small perturbation dt < d                   t+J
                                                                         ^. Therefore, the
that the collateral constraint does not hold with equality in period t + J
first period in which the collateral constraint holds with equality for the perturbed value of
dt must be greater than t + J  ^. We next show that this period is t + J  ^ + 1. Let's examine
                                 ^ evaluated at the unperturbed allocation, that is, the one

The second equality follows from the fact that d  ^ ^ = db and the definition of db in proposi-

                                                                                             ^<d

and d ^ > db , ensuring that period t + J   ^ + 1 this is the first period in which the collateral
      t+J +1
constraint holds with equality under the perturbed value of dt . The policy function for the
perturbed allocation is given by the set of continuous functions given by the Euler equations
                     ^ all with µt+j = 0 for j = 0 to J
for periods t to t + J                                 ^. We have therefore established that
                                                                                   ^t .
the policy function is both right- and left-continuous at this particular value of d

                                     ^t = db . Then the policy function is d
    Finally, consider the debt level d                                     ^t+1 = G(d

be a small perturbation larger than db . Then the policy function is dt+1 = G(dt ). Since G(·) is
a continuous function, right continuity obtains. For the particular value of debt we are consid-
                                                        ^t+1 , d
ering, the policy function is also implicitly given by (d      ^t ) -  (1+ r)(G(d
                                                                                ^t+1 ), d

Let dt be a sufficiently small perturbation less than db . Then we conjecture that the pol-
icy function is the solution for dt+1 of (dt+1 , dt ) -  (1 + r)(G(dt+1 ), dt+1 ) = 0. To
ensure that this conjecture is correct, the solution must satisfy dt+1  db . But this is
guaranteed by the continuity of (·, ·) and G(·) and the fact that in the above equation
limdt db dt+1 = db > db .


B      Proof of Proposition 4
B.1     Characterization of the function G(·)
Definition B1. Let dU and dU , respectively, be the debt levels d and d that satisfy

                                          d = F (d , d)

and
                                          F1(d , d) = 0.

From (16), we have that
                                                      yT
                                       dU = y T + 
                                                     1+r
and
                                           dU = y T .

   Recalling that the slope of the RHS of the CC vanishes when cT is zero, we have that dU
and dU are the levels of current- and next-period debt at which the CC binds and cT = 0.
In this case, the only economically sensible of the two values of d at which the CC binds is
the larger one, at which the slope of the RHS of the CC is larger than 1.

Lemma B2. dU > d


                                                33
Proof. By proposition 2, F (d,  ~d~) = d~. By Assumption 3, F1 (d,
                                                                ~d ~) < 1. Then by convexity of

F (·, ·) in its first argument, we have that F (x, d                    ~. Since, by Lemma B1
dU < d    ~ , we have that F (dU , d ~) > dU = F (dU , dU ), where the equality follows from
Definition B1. Finally, because F2 < 0, it must be that d   ~ < dU .

Proposition B1. In any equilibrium, d < dU .

Proof. The proof proceeds in four lemmas.

Lemma B3. If d  dU , then d = d.
                                                                       ~ (Lemma B2),
Proof. Suppose to the contrary that d  dU and that d = d. Because dU > d
and because F (x, x) is decreasing in x, we have that d = d  dU > d    ~ = F (d,
                                                                              ~d ~) >
F (dU , dU )  F (d, d) = F (d , d), so that the collateral constraint is violated.

Lemma B4. If d = dU , then d  dU .

Proof. Let d = y T < dU . The inequality follows from Lemmas B1 and B2. By Defini-
tion B1, F (y T , dU ) = y T , that is, the collateral constraint is satisfied. However, at d = dU
and d = y T , we have, from Definition B1, that cT = 0. Thus d = y T cannot be an
equilibrium. Similarly, because cT = y T + d /(1 + r) - dU , d < y T implies cT < 0 and thus
d < y T cannot be an equilibrium either. Finally, show that no d  (y T , dU ) can be an
equilibrium. For d = y T we have d = F (d , dU ) and for d = dU we have d > F (d , dU )
(Lemma B3). Because F (d , dU ) is an increasing and convex function of d , it follows that
d > F (d , dU ) for all d  (y T , dU ).

Lemma B5. If d > dU , then d  d.

Proof. Suppose first that d  y T , then cT = y T + d /(1 + r) - d  y T + y T /(1 + r) - d =
dU - d < 0, where the equality follows from Definition B1. But negative consumption
is impossible. Now suppose that d  (y T , dU ]. Then d > F (d , dU ) > F (d , d), so the
collateral constraint is violated. The first inequality follows from Lemmas B3 and B4
and the second from the fact that F2 < 0. Finally suppose d  (dU , d], then d > dU >
F (dU , dU ) > F (d, d)  F (d , d), so the collateral constraint is violated. The second inequality
follows from lemma B3, the third from the fact that F (x, x) is a decreasing function of x
and d > dU , and the last one from the fact that F1 > 0 and d  d .

Lemma B6. If d > dU , then d > d.

                                                                               ^d ^) = F (d , d),

d

   This completes the proof of Proposition B1.

Definition B2. Let d and d be defined as the solution for d and d , respectively, of the
system
                                          d = F (d , d)

and
                                          F1(d , d) = 1.
              ~ < d .
Lemma B7. d < d

Proof. We first establish that d < d ~. Since F (d , d ) is increasing and convex in d , and since
by definition F1 (d , d ) = 1, and F (d , d ) = d , we have that F (x, d ) > x for all x = d .
              ~ d ) > d
Therefore F (d,        ~ unless d~ = d . But because F (d , d ) = d , d     ~ = d would require
that d = d  ~. But this cannot be the case because F1(d,      ~d~) < 1, whereas F1(d , d ) = 1.
Therefore it must be that F (d, ~ d ) > d~ = F (d,
                                                ~d  ~). Because F2 < 0, it follows, that d < d  ~.
We now show that d > d     ~. Because F2 < 0, F (x, d ) > F (x, d ~)  x for any x  d ~, where the
last inequality follows from the facts that F (x, d~) is increasing and convex in x, F (d,
                                                                                         ~d~) = d
                                                                                                ~,
and F1(d,~d~) < 1. It then follows that the x such that F (x, d ) = x must satisfy x > d   ~.

Definition B3. The function d = G(d) is defined as the solution to

                                          d = F (d , d),

                                          F1(d , d) < 1,

and
                                                 d
                                   cT = y T +       - d > 0.
                                                1+r
   The function G(·) is not defined for d  d or d  dU . To see this, recall that: (a)
if d < d , then the condition d = F (d , d) is violated for all d ; (b) if d = d , then the
condition d = F (d , d) implies that F1(d , d) = 1, which violates the condition F1(d , d) < 1;
and (c) if d  dU , then the condition d = F (d , d) implies that cT  0. For d  (d , dU ),
d = G(d) is the smaller of the two solutions for d of the equation d = F (d , d). Furthermore,

                                                35
                                                                 ~ = G(d
G (·) = -(1+ r)F1 (G(d), d)/(1 - F1 (G(d), d)) < 0. And finally, d     ~), which follows from
                            ~ = F (d,
the fact that by definition d      ~d ~), from the assumption that F1(d,
                                                                       ~d ~) < 1, and c
                                                                                      ~T > 0.
We therefore have the following lemma:

Proposition B2. For d  (d , dU ), G(d) is a continuous and decreasing function and satis-
     ~ = G(d
fies d     ~). For d  d or d  dU , the function G(·) is not defined. The scalars dU and
d are introduced in Definitions B1 and B2.

   This completes the characterization of the function G(·).


B.2    Characterization of the function G(G(·))
The following three lemmas give the smallest value of d for which G(G(d)) is well defined
(that is, the collateral constraint can bind in two consecutive periods), when d is below its
steady-state level d~.

                                                                   ~).
Lemma B8. If d < dU , then G(G(d)) is well defined for all d  (d , d

                       ~, then by proposition B2, d = G(d) exists and d > d
Proof. Suppose d < d < d                                                  ~. Because
d > d and because G (·) < 0, it must be that G(d) < G(d ) = d < dU . We have therefore
shown that d < G(d) < dU , so that G(d ) exists by proposition B2.

   Now consider the case d > dU .

Definition B4. Let d be the level of current debt d satisfying dU = F (dU , d), where dU is
introduced in Definition B1. From (16), we have that

                                                                
                                      dU   dU - y T a
                          d = yT +       -                         .
                                     1+r   y N 1-1/ 1 - a

                                   ~.
Lemma B9. If d > dU , then d < d < d

Proof. We first establish that d < d . Because F (·, ·) is increasing and convex in its first
argument, we have from Definition B2 that F (x, d ) > x for all x < d . Because dU < d ,
we have that F (dU , d ) > dU = F (dU , d ), where the equality follows from Definition B4.
Because F2 < 0, it follows that d < d . We now establish that d~ > d . Consider x  (d,~ d ).
From lemma B7, this interval is non-empty. Then for any x  (d,       ~ d ), F (x, d
                                                                                  ~) < x <
                                                                  ~d
F (x, d ). The first equality follows from the assumption that F1(d, ~) < 1 and the second
from the fact that F1(d , d ) = 1. Because d    ~ < dU < d , F (dU , d~) < dU = F (dU , d ).
Finally, since F2 < 0, we have that d ~> d .


                                             36
                                 ~, then G(G(d)) exists.
Lemma B10. If d > dU and d < d < d

Proof. Suppose d < d < d~, then, by lemma B9, d  (d , d
                                                      ~). By proposition B2, d = G(d)
               ~ and because d > d , G(d) < G(d ) = dU . We have therefore shown that
exists and d > d
d < G(d) < dU , so that G(G(d)) exists by proposition B2.

   This completes the characterization of the function G(G(·)).


B.3    Existence of the debt threshold db
Assumption B1. If d < dU , then

                     lim [(G(x), x) -  (1 + r)(G(G(x)), G(x))] < 0.
                    x    d


                                                                     ~ < db , db < d
Proposition B3. There exist scalars db , db , and db satisfying db < d             ~, and


                                (db , db ) =  (1 + r)(db , db )

                                          db = G(db )

and
                                          db = G(db ).

Proof. Let
                        H (x)  (G(x), x) -  (1 + r)(G(G(x)), G(x)).
      ~ = G(d
Since d     ~) = G(G(d
                     ~)) and  (1 + r) < 1, we have that

                                                 ~) > 0.
                                              H (d

Since 1 < 0, 2 > 0, and G < 0, we have that

                                              H (x) > 0.

Suppose first that d > dU . Then, recalling that y T + G(G(d ))/(1 + r) - G(d ) = 0 (so that
cT = 0) and that d < d~, we have that


                                      lim H (x) = -.
                                      x   d


Since d < d  ~, by continuity, the above three expressions imply that there exists a value of
x<d  ~, such that H (x) = 0.

                                                 37
     Suppose now that d < dU . Then, by assumption B1, we have that

                                          lim H (x) < 0.
                                         x   d


          ~, we have that in this case too there exists a value of x < d
Since d < d                                                            ~, such that H (x) =
0.

     The proof of Proposition 4 is then identical to that of Proposition 3 (Cobb-Douglas
aggregator), with Proposition B3 taking the place of Proposition A2.


C       Proof of Proposition 7
We begin by reproducing the statement of the Li and Yorke (1975) theorem commonly known
as `period three implies chaos:'

Theorem 1 (Li and Yorke (1975)). Let J be an interval and let D : J  J be continuous.
Assume there is a point d  J for which the points d = D(d), d = D2 (d), and d = D3 (d),
satisfy
                                       d d<d <d .

Then, for every k = 1, 2, . . . there is a periodic point in J having period k . Furthermore, there
is an uncountable set S  J (containing no periodic points), which satisfies the following
conditions:

     1. For every p, q  S with p = q , lim supn |Dn (p) - Dn (q )| > 0 and lim inf n |Dn (p) -
        Dn (q )| = 0.

     2. For every p  S and periodic point q  J , lim supn |Dn (p) - Dn (q )| > 0.

     Li and Yorke remark that if there is a periodic point with period 3, then the hypothesis
d  d < d < d is satisfied. Section 6.4 shows the existence of plausible calibrations for
which the model economy has a three-period debt cycle. Further, Proposition 3 establishes
that the policy function D is continuous. It remains to show that there is an interval J such
that D : J  J . The following lemma establishes this result.

Lemma C1. The policy function d = D(d) maps the interval [db , db ] into itself.

Proof. Proposition 3 shows that D(d) is continuous, increasing for d < db , and decreasing
for d > db . Thus, D(d)  D(db ) = db . Suppose now that d  [db , db ). By Proposition 3, in
this range D(d) > d, which implies that D(d) > db . Finally, if d  (db , db ], we have, by the

                                                 38
same proposition, that D(d) = G(d). Since G(·) is decreasing, we have that D(d) = G(d) 
G(db ) = db .


D      Proof of Proposition 9
The proof proceeds in three lemmas.

                                        ~d
Lemma D1. Suppose  (1+ r) < 1,  = 1, F1(d, ~) =         (1-a)              ~d
                                                              < 1, and F1(d,  ~) > 1/[1+  (1+
                                                        a(1+r )
                                                                                           ~ for
r)]. Then the debt policy function in the Ramsey equilibrium, Dr (·), satisfies Dr (dt ) = d
               ~), with db1 implicitly given by (d,
any dt  [db1 , d                                 ~ db1 ) =  (1 + r)(d,
                                                                     ~d~).

                                                      ~ with the property that if dt  [db1, d
Proof. We wish to characterize a debt threshold db1 < d                                      ~),
then the Ramsey economy reaches the steady state d   ~ in one period, that is, Dr (dt ) = d
                                                                                          ~ for
               ~). For this conjecture to be correct, the complete set of Ramsey equilibrium
all dt  [db1 , d
conditions, equations (32)-(37), must be satisfied for all periods greater than or equal to t.
Suppose that dt  [db1 , d~). Then, by the conjecture, dt+j = d
                                                             ~ for all j > 0.
    Consider first equation (36). We have already shown that in the steady state consumption
is positive. Thus, we only need to ascertain whether consumption in period t is positive.
Note that cT     T   ~                 T   ~           ~
            t = y + d/(1 + r ) - dt > y + d/(1 + r ) - d > 0. Consider next the collateral
constraint (33). We already established that in the steady state of the Ramsey economy
the collateral constraint holds with equality (Proposition 8). So we only need to check that
it is satisfied in period t. Note that dt+1 = d~ = G(d~) < G(dt ). The first equality follows
from the conjecture and the inequality from the fact that G (·) < 0 and dt < d   ~. Consider
now the transversality condition (37). It is satisfied under the conjectured path because
dt+j is constant for all j > 0. Consider next the complementary slackness condition (35).
Because the collateral constraint is slack in period t, µR
                                                         t = 0, so the slackness condition is
satisfied in period t. In period t + j for j > 0, the collateral constraint holds with equality,
~ = F (d,
d        ~d ~), therefore (35) also holds. It remains to show that under the conjecture the
Euler equations (32) and the non-negativity condition (34) are satisfied. We have already
shown that µR
            t = 0. Then the Euler equation in period t takes the form


                                                      (d,~d ~)
                             ~ dt ) =  (1 + r)
                            (d,                                    .                        (D1)

We omit the arguments of F1 because when  = 1, F1 is a constant. Because 2 > 0, µR
                                                                                 t+1 is
strictly increasing in dt . Let db1 be the smallest level of debt for which µR
                                                                             t+1 is non-negative.
                                                     ~                    ~ ~
We then have that d is implicitly given by (d, d ) =  (1 + r)(d, d). Clearly, db1 < d

and µR = 0 when dt = db1 . As dt  d       ~, the Euler equation (D1) implies that µR satisfies
      t+1                                                                            t+1

                    t+j +1 as a function of µt+j . It is convenient to introduce the variable
transformation st+j  1 - (1 + r)F1 µR t+j . Then, the Euler equation in period t + j , for j  1,
can be written as
                                             (1 + r)F1 st+j
                                st+j +1 =                     (st+j ),                         (D2)
                                            F1 - 1 + st+j
with  (·) < 0. Note that  (st+j ) has a discontinuity at st+j = 1 - F1 and converges to infinity
(minus infinity) as st+j approaches 1 - F1 from the right (left). The nonnegativity condition
on µRt+j , equation (34), restricts st+j  1. The initial condition st+1 ranges continuously from
 (1 + r) when dt  d     ~ to 1 when dt = db1 . It follows that a necessary condition for st+2  1
for any dt  [db1, d ~) is
                                           (1 + r) > 1 - F1.                                   (D3)

The difference equation (D2) has two steady states, st+j = 0 and st+j = 1 - F1[1 -  (1+ r)] >
1 - F1. The first steady state lies outside the range of initial conditions for st+1 , [ (1 + r), 1],
and the second steady state lies inside. This fact together with  (·) < 0, implies that the
maximum possible value of st+j +1 , for all j  1, is

                                                                     2(1 + r)2 F1
                    max{ ( (1 + r)),  2(1)} =  ( (1 + r)) =                         .
                                                                  F1 - 1 +  (1 + r)
                                                                                2    2
The first equality follows from the fact that  (1) =  (1 + r). Thus F     (1+r ) F1
                                                                       1 -1+ (1+r )
                                                                                    must be less
               R
than unity if µt+j +1 is to be nonnegative for all j  1. This will be the case if

                                                      1
                                         F1 >                 .
                                                 1 +  (1 + r)

This restriction is more stringent than the one given in (D3).

   We have defined db1 as
                                       ~ db1 ) -  (d,
                                      (d,          ~d ~) = 0.

We now generalize this definition.

Definition D1. Let dbi , for i  2, be given by

                                 (dbi-1 , dbi ) -  (dbi-2 , dbi-1 ) = 0,


                                                    40
          ~.
with db0  d

    Clearly, dbi < dbi-1 for any i  1.

                                        ~d
Lemma D2. Suppose  (1+ r) < 1,  = 1, F1(d, ~) =                   (1-a)                 ~d
                                                                            < 1, and F1(d, ~) > 1/[1+  (1+
                                                                  a(1+r )
r)]. Then, for any dt < db1 , there exists an integer i  1 such that the Ramsey equilibrium
                                                               ~ d,
path of debt is of the form (dt , dt+1 , dt+2 , . . . , dt+i , d, ~ . . . ), with dt < dt+1 < dt+2 < · · · <
       ~.
dt+i < d

Proof. Suppose that dt  [dbi+1 , dbi ) for i  1. Conjecture that debt converges to d               ~ in i + 1
                                                                                   ~ d,
periods, and that its equilibrium path, denoted (dt , dt+1 , dt+2 , . . . , dt+i , d, ~ . . . ), is given by
the solution of
                                                       ~ dt+i ) = 0,
                                      (dt+i , dt ) -  (d,                                                  (D4)

if i = 1, and

                                                        ~ dt+i ) = 0
                                   (dt+i , dt+i-1 ) -  (d,
                                                                 .
                                                                 .
                                                                 .                                         (D5)
                                    (dt+1 , dt ) -  (dt+2 , dt+1 ) = 0

if i  2. Clearly, dt+k  [db(i-k+1) , db(i-k) ), for all k = 1, . . . , i, so the conjectured convergence
to d ~ is monotonic. The collateral constraint (33) is satisfied with strict inequality along
the proposed equilibrium path since dt < dt+1 < dt+2 < · · · < dt+i < d                 ~ and G(x) > d ~
            ~. Because the collateral constraint holds with inequality, satisfaction of the
for any x < d
slackness condition (35) requires that µR    R              R
                                        t , µt+1 , . . . , µt+i = 0. This implies that (34) holds.
The systems (D4) and (D5) together with the fact that µR         t+k = 0 for k = 1, ..., i guarantee
that the Euler equation (32) is satisfied. Along the conjectured solution, consumption is
positive so that (36) is satisfied. To see this note that cT            T
                                                               t+k = y + dt+k+1 /(1 + r ) - dt+k >
                                      ~ > 0 for all k = 1, . . . , i. Finally, debt is bounded above
y T - rdt+k /(1 + r) > y T - r/(1 + r)d
   ~, so that the transversality condition (37) holds. This establishes that the conjectured
by d
solution is indeed the Ramsey equilibrium path.

Lemma D3. Suppose  (1+ r) < 1,  = 1, F1(d,                   ~d  ~) = (1-a) < 1, and F1(d,  ~d~) > 1/[1+  (1+
                                                                        a(1+r )
r)]. Then, for any dt > d   ~, there exists an integer i  0 such that the Ramsey equilibrium path
                                                          ~ d,
of debt is of the form (dt , dt+1 , dt+2 , . . . , dt+i , d, ~ . . . ), with dt > dt+1 < dt+2 < · · · < dt+i < d
                                                                                                               ~.

Proof. The proof consists in conjecturing that the collateral constraint binds in period t, so
                               ~ = G(d
that dt+1 = G(dt ). Since dt > d      ~) and G (·) < 0, we have that dt+1 < d ~. So we know
from Proposition 9 that starting in t + 1 the economy converges monotonically and in finite

                                                       41
        ~. In particular, we have that dt+2 > dt+1 . So, from lemmas D1 and D2 we have
time to d
that the collateral constraint is slack in period t + 1, so that µR
                                                                  t+1 = 0. The Euler condition
in period t is then given by

                     (dt+1 , dt )
                                    (1 - (1 + r)µR
                                                 t ) =  (1 + r )(dt+2 , dt+1 ),
                  1 - (1 + r)F1 µRt


which implies that µR
                    t > 0 because dt , dt+2 > dt+1 implies that (dt+1 , dt ) > (dt+2 , dt+1 ).
This completes the proof.
