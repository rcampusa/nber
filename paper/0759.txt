                  Anticipated and Unanticipated Oil Price
                     Increases and the Current Account




                                  ABSTRACT


      This paper examines the
                                 current-accot response to anticipated
 future increases in real oil
                                 prices as well as to Unexpected increases
 which may be temporary or permanent in nature. The
                                                       analysis is
 conducted using an intertemporal
                                  two-period model of a small open
 economy which produces both traded
                                    and nontraded goods and imports its
 oil.

      The paper identifies the
                                 channels through which various types of
oil price increases affect
                             the current account. The inclusion of
nontraded   investment and consumer goods permits oil price increases
                                                                      to
generate intertemporal and Static Substitution effects in production

 I.    Introduction

       Much research effort has been devoted to investigating the macro-

 economic effects of an oil price "shock" on oil-importing nations.

 Since a price "shock" connotates an unanticipated disturbance, but more

 recent oil price hikes have been either partially or wholly expected,

 it is important to study the economy's response to anticipated

 disturbances as well. That is one purpose of this paper. It examines

 the current—account response to anticipated future increases in real oil

prices as well as to unexpected increases which may be temporary or

permanent in nature.

      The paper also stresses the important role of nontraded goods in

determining the current—account response to oil price increases. When

the economy produces nontraded investment goods and consumer goods, oil

price disturbances generate intertemporal and static substitution

effects in production and consumption which alter net international

saving. Moreover, the relative oil- value-added ratio in the traded and

nontraded sectors plays a crucial role in shaping these substitution

effects. This latter finding supports the oft-repeated observation

that structural characteristics of individual oil-importing countries

matter in any analysis of current—account adjustment to foreign price

disturbances.

      Previous studies of oil price disturbances and current-account

adjustment in the small open economy (e.g. Findlay-

Rodriguez (1977), Buiter (1978), Bruno—Sachs (1978), Katseli—Marion

(1980), Obstfeld (1980), and Sachs (1981)) have considered only unexpected

disturbances. They usually conclude that permanent unexpected oil price
                                 2




increases worsen the current—account of the net oil importer with limited

substitution in production.

    However, most of these studies fail to consider the intertemporal

nature of current-accnt (net saving) behavior. The two recent exceptions

are the excellent papers by Obstfeld (1980) and Sachs (1981). Their

analyses indicate that permanent unexpected oil price increases can actually

improve the current account. But neither study considers the effects

of anticipated future oil price increases or the role of nontraded goods

in current-account adjustment. That is the task of this paper. Using

an intertemporal framework, it seeks to identify the channels through

which various types of oil price increases (i.e. expected or unexpected,

temporary, permanent, or future) affect the current account of an

economy producing both nontraded and traded goods.

     The analysis is conducted using an intertemporal two-period model

of a small open economy facing given world prices and a given world rate

of interest. The model itself is based on intertemporal maximizing

behavior and saving is consistent with this behavior. The"dual"

approach, characterized by the use of expenditure and revenue functions

rather than utility and production functions, is adopted. As pointed

out by Dixit and Norman (1980) arid Dixit (1980), models employing

duality are formally equivalent to traditional ones, but have some

practical advantages, among them notational simplicity.

     The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The basic model is

set out in Section 2.   In Section 3, the response of the current account

to a change in world oil prices and world interest rates is derived,

and the distinction between expected and unexpected disturbances is
                                  3




finally   drawn. In Section 4, the results are extended to the case where

there are nontraded investment and consumer goods. Section 5 provides

some concluding remarks.

2.   The Model

      Consider a small open economy in an intertemporal framework.1 There

are two dates, 1 and 2, and two goods, one final good and one intermediate

good. The country can trade on the world market at given spot prices at

each date, and it also has access to a world credit market with a given

world interest rate.2 Let the date 1 final good be the numeraire. Then

1 denotes the real spot price at date 1 of final goods at date 1, and

     1/(l+r)    represents   the real discount rate, where r is the real interest

rate.3     Let q1 be the relative spot price at date i of intermediate goods
(in terms of final goods) at date i.
      With respect to welfare and demand, assume the country can be
represented by a well—behaved utility function U(c1, c2),       where   c1, c2
are nonnegative and represent consumption at date 1        and 2, respectively.
Households seek to maximize utility subject to the constraint that present-
value expenditures not exceed present—value income. The dual is to
minimize the expenditure necessary to attain a target utility level at
given    prices. The corresponding expenditure function is



      E(l, S,     u) E
      mm        c1 +   c2    subject to U(c1, c2) >   u.
         1  2
        c,c
      The small economy produces final goods (x) using capital (k), labor

 (9), and   oil   (z). For simplicity, assume initially that the supplies of

capital and labor are fixed and that all oil is imported. The assumption

of a fixed labor supply will be dropped in Section 3 and the assumption

of a fixed capital stock will be relaxed in Section 4. Firms maximize
                                          5




the present value of total profit. Specifically, for given world prices

of final goods and oil and for given quantities of labor and capital, the

firms' problem is to choose a technologically feasible x to maximize the

present value of output. The corresponding maximized value of output is

a function of these fixed prices and factors inputs. It is called the

revenue, or national product, function. For the two—period case, we can

write    the revenue functions as:


        R1(1,   q1,     l) + SR2(l, q2, 2 k2) =

                  1  11    2   22
       max       (x -qz)+(x  -qz)
        1
       z,z 2

where        denotes real income (value—added) at date 1 and 5R2 denotes the
real present value of income at date 2.
       The equilibrium of the country can be represented by the intertemporal
budget constraint


      E(l, ,      u) = R1(l,   q1) + 6R2(l, q2)                              (2.1)


Equation     (2.1) states that the present value of expenditure equals the

present value of domestic value—added.

       There are many well known properties of expenditure and revenue

functions [see Dixit and Norman (1980) or Varian (1978)]. For instance,

the derivative of the expenditure function with respect to the price of

a good is the Hicksian compensated demand for that good. The derivative

of   the revenue function with respect to the price of a good is the
                                                 6




optimally   chosen supply of the good. It follows that optimal consumption,

production of final goods and imports of oil are given by



     c1 =                     u)
            E1(l,    S,



     c2 =
            E2(l, ,           u)


     x1 =    1


                                                                          (2.2)
     x2 =    2



    -z1 =    1
            R2


    —z2 =    2
            R2


where superscripts represent dates and subscripts refer to partials.

     The real current—account surplus at date 1 is



     b1 = (x1    -   c
                      1
                          )    - q 11
                                    z =   1 -
                                          R
                                                E1
                                                                          (2.3)




which is the excess of income at date 1 over spending at date       In   the

absence of domestic investment or government deficits, the current account

surplus at date 1 is equal to real saving at date 1 and represents the

accumulation of net foreign assets. Equation (2.1) ensures that trade

in present—value terms is balanced over the two dates, though not

necessarily at each date.

 3.     Solving the Model

        To find the effect on the date 1 current account of a change in world

 oil prices or interest rates, we totally differentiate (2.3). Because

 welfare effects are needed in the calculation of current—account effects,

 it is helpful to proceed by first differentiating (2.1).   This differentia-
 tion yields:



      Edu =                +            +
                A11dq'         A12dq2       X13d                          (3.1)

where

      A11 =       <0


      A12 =           <0

                2 -
      X13 = R         E2
                           =   b2


In the above expression, Eu denotes the partial BE/u, the inverse of the

marginal utility of total (present-value) income, which is positive. The

expression Edu is the income equivalent at given prices of a change in

welfare. Hence (R/E)dq1 is the (negative) effect on welfare of an

increase in world oil prices at date 1, (5R/E)dq2 is the (negative)

effect on welfare of an increase in oil prices at date 2, and (b2/E)dS

is the effect on welfare of an increase in the real discount factor. The

latter effect is positive if the small country runs a trade surplus

(deficit) in date 2 (1).

      In order to calculate the effect of a change in world oil prices and

the real discount rate on the current account, we totally differentiate

(2.3), making use of (3.1). This gives
                                                             8




        db1 =                    +               +                                              (3.2)
                     A21dq           A22dq2          A23dS

where c1 is the real marginal propensity to spend at date 1 out of real

present value income.3 The term E12 is a substitution effect, with

E12 =       c1/S        >   0.
        An increase in oil prices has two effects on the current account:

a direct effect on value added (Rdq), which worsens the current account,

and an income-consumption effect [-c1(Rdq1 +                                   which improves
                                                                    SRdq2)],
the current account. Oil price increases do not generate substitution

effects in either consumption or production since consumer prices are

unaffected by oil price increases and there are as yet no intertemporal

elements in production.

        Let us now look at the change in the current account in the following

three cases:

        (1) A temporary increase in oil prices, which is defined as

                     dcl'   >   0, dq2 = 0.
        (2) A permanent increase in oil prices, which is defined as

                     dq1, dq2 >        0.
         (3) An anticipated future oil price increase, which refers to the case
                                2
                     dq1 = 0, dq > 0.
All three types of oil price increases are expected increases.                         At the
                                     9




 start   of date 1, OPEC announces oil prices for dates 1 and 2.    Agents can
 fully adjust their behavior in dates 1 and 2 in response to this

 announcement. Later, we shall distinguish between expected and unexpected

 price increases.

      As can be seen in (3.2), a temporary oil price increase
                                                                 unambiguously
 reduces   the current—accot surplus; it   has a direct negative effect on

 value added and a smaller positive income effect on demand.

      A permanent oil price increase has a larger impact on aggregate

 demand and hence an ambiguous effect on the current account. As in the

case of a temporary increase, it has a direct negative effect and a smaller

positive income effect in date 1. But it also produces a positive income

effect in date 2. If the two income effects should dominate, then the

current account will improve.

     An anticipated oil price increase improves the date 1 current account

since it lowers welfare, inducing a drop in domestic consumption in the

first period.

     Up to this point, agents have been treated as having perfect foresight;

they can fully adjust in dates 1 and 2 to any oil price increase that

occurs in the present or the future.

     Suppose we want to introduce a distinction between unexpected and

expected oil price increases. One way to do this is to impose some

constraint on the ability of agents to adjust their behavior in date 1 in

response to an announced oil price increase. In particular, suppose that

firms have limited production substitution possibilities in date 1. Any

change in date 1 oil prices — whether temporary or permanent -     is   now

unexpected in the sense that firms would have tried to alter their factor
                                        10




mix had they known of the forthcoming price disturbance.

     As an example, assume that firms face a fixed coefficient technology

in date 1. In order to have current output variable, let us also relax

the assumption that there is full employment of a fixed supply of labor

in date 1. Let         represent employment in date 1.

     The economy's date 1 revenue function is now



      1     1
     R (1, q ,   i1)
                       —= max x1 - 11
                                  q z
                        l, l
subject to

     x1 =    min(f(2), k), l) f > 0, f <       0, c = 1.



Maximization of date 1 value-added requires that x1 =      f(9))   =   z1.   Hence



     R1(l, q', l) = (1      -




     Let      denote the derivative            A standard property of the

revenue function is that this derivative represents the real demand price

for labor.

     Suppose that the real supply price of labor in date 1 can be represented

by the function w'(l, 2)). Then a labor-market equilibrium is given by



     w1(l, l) =    R(l,   q1, i1)                                                (3.3)




For simplicity, we ignore any intertemporal elements in labor supply, so

that the real wage demanded in date 1 depends only on the price of final

goods and employment at that date.

        Comparing (3.6) with (3.2), we see that the new term in A21 represents

the employment effect. We conclude that a fixed coefficient
                                                                                 technology in
date 1,      combined with       some   real-wage rigidity,   modifies the analysis to the
extent       that negative employment effects are now associated with an
Unexpected increase in today's oil price. Unexpected oil price increases
thus have a stronger negative effect on the
                                            current account surplus than
do expected oil price increases. Note that
                                           whether expected or unexpected,
                                  12




a temporary increase in oil prices reduces the current-account surplus and

a permanent increase in oil prices has an ambiguous effect on the current

account. Anticipated future oil price increases always improve today's

current account.

     Let us now examine how the current—account response might differ when

a nontraded good is introduced.

  4.       Nontraded Goods

           Suppose that the small economy produces
                                                   nontraded goods (n) as well
 as traded goods (x). The nontraded goods can be consumed by domestic

 households or costlessly transformed into investment goods (I).

 Since there are only two periods,
                                        investment occurs only in period 1.
 Both traded and nontraded goods
                                      are produced with oil, labor and sector-
 specific capital. Labor is mobile between sectors and all oil is imported.

           In order to distinguish between
                                             expected and unexpected oil price

 disturLances, we again invoke the assumption that in date 1 all firms

 face a fixed coefficient technology. We also assume that in date 1

 firms face an economy—wide wage indexed to final goods prices. Thus

 overall employment will vary in response to oil price disturbances.        In
date   2, firms can fully adjust their factor mix and labor is fixed in
total supply and fully employed. The economy's revenue functions, which
represent national product over the two periods, can be written as:

 The four equations contain

      The determinants of the investment and employment
                                                        functions can be
derived from (4.1) and from information about labor
                                                    Supply.
     For example, the investment
                                 that maximizes Output yields the marginal
condition




     SR(l, q2, 2 2                       + Ii) =



which says that firms should invest
                                                     up to the point where the value of
the marginal product of capital in date 2 production
                                                     equals the cost of
capital. it follows that investment demand can be represented
                                                              by:

It is a function of the cost of capital, j1, the prices of date 2 final

goods, 5 and 2, and the date 2 price of oil.                           Since 5   l/(1 +   r),   the

investment function captures the familiar relationship between the

real interest rate and investment demand. Changes in the date 1 price

of oil affect investment demand indirectly through j1 and                            by influencing

the supply of investment goods.7 The properties of the investment function

can be obtained from information about the production technology. Given

a convex production technology in date 2, it can be shown that an increase
                                                                           demand while an
in the price of capital goods decreases investment

increase in date 2 final prices raises the marginal product of capital

and hence investment demand. An increase in date 2 oil prices lowers

investment demand if capital and oil are complements in date 2 production

and increases investment demand if the two factors are substitutes.

     The employment function, S, can be derived from the labor-market

equilibrium condition:


                                  1 —l          1         .1      1

 An increase in                 raises employment in the nontraded goods sector and

 lowers it in the traded goods sector, so there is an ambiguous impact on

 economy-wide employment in date 1. An increase in q1 lowers the net

 marginal product of labor in both sectors and hence reduces overall

 employment in the current period.
                                                                      of the model, we are now ready
      Having discussed some of the properties

 to analyze the effects of oil price increases on the current account when
                                                                 and nontraded consumer and/or

  investment           goods.

         First, totally differentiate (4.l)—(4.4).
                                                                                         Equation (4.1) can be
 solved separately to obtain the welfare effects of oil price increases.

 Equations (4.2) and (4.3) must be solved
                                                                                simultaneously to obtain
 equilibri values for the price of nontraded goods in dates 1 and 2.

 The solutions to (4.l)—(4.3)
                                                        can then be used in (4.4) to obtain the

 current—accot effects of oil price increases.

                                                                     consider first
     In order to see clearly how these channels operate,

the case where the only nontraded goods produced are investment goods,
                                                        This simplified case can be

                                                which are a modification of equations
represented by equations (4.7)—(4.9),

 (4.l)-(4.4):



     E(l, , u) + j111 = R1(1, q1, j1, 1 k1) +                 R2(1, q2, 2 l + Ii)     (4.7)



                                                                                      (4.8)
      I =

                       —                                                              (4.9)
      b1 =      — E1       j111


 The investment and employment functions are now given by:



      11(j1, , q2);        I < 0, I >      OF
                                                I   <
                                                        0


      l(l '       q; l      j
                                >   Of 1l < 0
                                       q
                                                       19




 Note that in this special case j2 does not enter the investment demand

 function because there is no date 2 production of nontraded goods. Note,

 too, that              >    0.       With wages indexed only to final goods, an increase

 in the price of the nontraded investment good increases employment

 because it raises the net marginal product of labor in the nontraded

 goods sector while leaving the supply price of labor unchanged.

         Equations (4.7)-(4.9) can be solved for changes in u, j, and b 1
                                                                                 1


 When the economy's only nontraded goods are investment goods, exogenous

 increases in world oil prices or the world interest rate have the

 following effects on nontraded goods prices and the current account:

       A temporafy increase in oil prices affects the supply of investment

goods but not the demand. The disturbance can either raise or lower

nontraded goods prices, depending on the relative oil intensity of

production in the two sectors of the economy. Technically, the response

of j1 depends on the sign and size of R2 in A31. The term represents

the supply response in the nontraded goods sector to an increase in date

1 oil prices for a given economy—wide level of employment. If a

temporary increase in date 1 oil prices reduces the supply of nontraded

investment goods (R2 < 0), then j1 will rise. The resulting drop in

investment demand helps improve the current account (A24 >   0).   Note that

the current account is also helped by the small drop in household

absorption induced by the oil shock. But since temporary oil price increases

also have a direct negative effect on GNP (R < 0 in A21), their net impact

on the current account is ambiguous. Only if temporary oil price increases

reduce the relative price of nontraded goods will the current account

clearly deteriorate. Recall that in the absence of nontraded goods,

temporary oil shocks always led to a current-account deterioration.

       Temporary oil price increases are more likely to increase the supply

of nontraded goods and reduce their price the lower the oil—value—added

ratio (the greater the c*) in the nontraded goods sector relative to the

traded goods sector.9 That is because under such circumstances an

increase   in oil prices will induce a movement of labor from traded to
nontraded goods. Temporary oil price increases which are unexpected
also generate additional employment effects in both sectors when there
is   real-wage resistance.

       Permanent oil price increases alter both the demand and the supply

of nontraded investment goods and have an ambiguous effect on their
                                      21




 price. As in the previous case, the supply of investment goods will

 rise or fall depending on the relative oil intensity of capital goods

 production. A permanent increase in       oil prices   will also reduce

          the demand for investment goods if oil and capital are
 (increase)

 complements (substitutes) in date 2 production.
      Permanent   oil price increases have an ambiguous effect on the

 current account as well. For given prices of nontraded
                                                                  goods, they
 reduce GNP and employment (R +            < 0 in A21), which worsens the

 current account. They lead to a cut in absorption, which improves the


                                     2 q y
 current account; the expressions (R1 + RQ1) (—c1) in A

                                                                  y     2
in A22 indicate that consumer expenditures fall and the term -j1I'2inA                     shows
                                                                           q          22
that investment demand drops if capital and oil are complements in date

2 production. But prices of nontraded goods do not remain fixed. As

we have seen, permanent oil price increases can either raise or lower

nontraded goods prices. If j' should increase, we see from A24 that

employment is stimulated and investment demand is further reduced.              The

spur to output and the fall in absorption help improve the current

account. If       should fall, there is instead an additional negative

effect on the current account.

     An anticipated future increase in oil prices reduces (increases)

the demand for investment goods if capital and oil are complements

(substitutes) in date 2 production, but has no effect on their current

supply. Consequently, the expected future disturbance reduces (increases)

today's relative price of nontraded goods.

    When oil and capital are complements in date 2 production, an

anticipated future increase in oil prices improves the date 1 current

account. It can be shown that when 112 < 0, the expression [X22dq2+A2432dq2j
                                 22




in (4.11) is unambiguously positive.   The anticipated future increase in

oil prices reduces permanent income, leading households to cut their expend-

itures in both periods. The expected increase also lowers the relative

price of capital goods, j1, with a resulting drop in employment.     This

additional welfare loss also induces households to reduce their spending.

Finally, since the drop in j1   triggers   a contraction of employment in

the nontraded goods sector, there is a concomitant drop in the demand for

oil imports, given the fixed coefficient technology in place in date 1.

All of these responses contribute to an improved current account.

     Recall that anticipated future oil price increases always led to an

improved current account when the economy produced just traded goods.

The introduction of nontraded investment goods, however, permits oil

price increases to influence the current account through additional

channels. As we have seen, anticipated future oil price increases

unambiguously improve the current account if capital and oil are

complements in date 2 production.

      The inclusion of nontraded goods highlights the importance of the

oil—value—added ratio in the nontraded goods sector relative to the

traded goods sector in determining the current-account response to current

oil price increases. The relative oil intensity of production will also

be an important determinant of the current-account response to anticipated

 future oil price increases once we introduce nontraded consumer goods

 and hence nontraded goods production in both periods.


 4.2 The role of nontraded consumer goods

      Consider next the case where the small economy's only nontraded good

 is a consumer good. Then the general model represented by equations

 (4.1)-(4.4) can be modified as follows:

Its properties         are identical to the employment function of the general model.

There is no investment function.

        One can        see     that the expression (4.18) is identical to the current-

                                                  except that investment
 effects   are now absent. The term C         in (4.16) and (4.17) represents
 the   date i marginal propensity to consume nontraded goods out of total

 present—value income.

       Happily, the cumbersome expressions (4.16)-(4.18) have a ready

 economic interpretation.

       From examination of (4.18), it is clear that a temporary increase in

 oil prices has an ambiguous effect on the current account. The term
                                                                                  '2l
 indicates that temporary increases have a direct negative effect on

 production, a negative employment effect and         a smaller   positive income-
 consumption effect.

       Temporary oil price increases also influence the current account by

 altering the price of nontraded goods in dates 1 and 2.           Inspection of
X31 in (4.16) and          in (4.17) shows that temporary oil price increases

can either raise or lower nontraded goods prices in dates 1 and 2. The

expression      +          in   X31 represents the supply effect in the date 1

nontraded goods market in response to an increase in date 1 oil prices.

If the oil—value-added ratio in the nontraded goods sector is large

(if c is small) relative to that in the traded goods sector, an increase

in today's oil price will reduce the supply of nontraded goods for a

given level of employment in the economy, and R2 <          0.    Combined with

the negative employment effect (R9 <          0),   the supply of date 1 nontraded

goods will fall. If the oil intensity of production in nontraded
                                                                           goods

     Temporary oil price increases also affect the current account through

      As with temporary shocks, a permanent     increase   in oil prices has an

             effect on the current account. In addition to the negative

 production and employment effects and the positive income-consumption

 effect, there are static and intertemporal consumption_substitution

  effect   on the current account. In addition to the positive income—

  consumption effect, A22,    in   (4.l8), expected future increases in oil
  prices may raise or lower nontraded
                                          goods prices in dates 1 and 2, making
  the last two terms in (4.18) of either sign.

        Again, the response of nontraded goods
                                                  prices depends crucially on
  the relative oil intensity of nontraded
                                               goods production. The term
       in both A32 and
                         A42 represents the supply effect in the nontraded
 goods market in date 2 following an increase in date 2 oil prices. The

 smaller the oil intensity of production in the nontraded goods sector

 relative to the traded goods sector, the
                                               more likely that R2 will be
 positive. Indeed, if the nontraded good uses no oil inputs in date 2

 production, and given that labor is fixed in supply and fully employed

 in date 2, an expected future oil
                                       price increase will only induce a
 movement of labor from traded to nontraded goods.          will be positive.

Consequently A32 in (4.16) is negative, A42 in (4,17) is likely to be

negative, and we can say that expected future oil price increases will

lower the relative price of nontraded goods in dates 1 and 2.

       We know that a fall in j1 tends to worsen the current account while

a fall in      tends to improve it. Consequently, we cannot ascertain the
net impact on the current account of anticipated future oil price
increases without knowledge of specific parameter values, including
the   relative oil intensity of production in the traded and nontraded
sectors.

      Comparing the results in Section 4.2with those in Section 3, we
see that the current—accouit response to various types of oil price
increases are much less clear cut once we introduce nontraded goods and

 5.    Conclusions

       A small—country model has been used to examine the current—account

 response to temporary oil price increases, permanent oil price increases,

 and future anticipated oil price increases. The analysis has been

 conducted Using a two—period model with maximizing agents. This framework

 allows us to work with aggregates which are consistent with micro

 behavior and permits us to capture explicitly the intertemporal nature

 of net international saving. It also offers a useful way of distinguishing

between unexpected and expected price changes and permits the calculation

of welfare effects. Moreover, the model is analytically tractable.

      The model of Section 3 demonstrates that a temporary oil price

shock worsens the current account, a permanent oil price shock can

improve or worsen the current account, and a purely anticipated oil price

increase improves the current account. All oil price increases reduce

welfare for the small economy that is a net importer of oil.

      When the analysis is extended to include a nontraded investment and

consumption good, we introduce substitution effects in production and

consumption which are static and intertemporal in nature. These

sUbstitution effects modify the current—account response to oil price

increases in important ways. The relative oil—value—added ratio in

the traded and nontraded sectors also becomes a crucial determinant of

the current—account response.

      Since the small—country model is a simple one and amenable to easy

economic interpretation, it is a convenient place to start when trying

to determine the differential response to various types of oil price

increases. However, the small—country model is limiting in some
                                30




respects. For instance, its partial—equilibrium nature ignores the

feedback effects of higher oil prices on traded goods prices and   world
interest rates that have been stressed in the two-country model of

Sachs (1980) and the three—country model of Marion-Svensson (1981).

The model described here should be seen as offering a useful way to

analyze the effects of expected versus unexpected disturbances on

important macro variables, but should be viewed as a first step in

developing a more complete general equilibrium analysis.

intertemporal analysis of the                           effect.


     71n Sachs (1981), investment is determined solely by the exogenously-
given world interest rate (our , where    F 1/(1 +    r)),
                                                        and by date 2
oil prices. Consecjuently, temporary oil price disturbances have no
effect on investment. Further, domestic variables cannot influence
investment. In our model, by contrast, temporary oil price increases
indirectly alter the demand for investment goods by changing their price.
In addition, exogenous or policy-induced domestic disturbances, though
not explicitly modeled, can alter the relative price of nontraded goods
and thereby influence investment behavior. Moreover,
                                                      forein disturbances
influence investment demand not only directly, through , qr and q , but
indirectly, through j' and j2.

      When there are two final goods in date 1

                                                and two final goods in date

terms of date 1 traded goods (cSj2), and (4)
                                             the present—value price of
date 2 nontraded goods in terms of date 1 nontraded goods (j2/jJ)•

     l2     is significantly negative, then A24 might be negative. In  this
case, a fail in j' improves the current accot; the fall in j1 increases
economy-wide employment, and this positive production effect dominates the
absorption effect.
