Can Simple Informational Nudges Increase Employee Participation in a 401(k) Plan?

                                            ABSTRACT

We report results from a field experiment in which a randomized subset of newly hired workers at
a large financial institution received a flyer containing information about the employer’s 401(k) plan
and the value of contributions compounding over a career. Younger workers who received the flyer
were significantly more likely to begin contributing to the plan relative to their peers in the control
group. Many workers do not participate in their employers’ supplemental retirement savings programs,
even though these programs offer substantial tax advantages and immediate returns due to matching
contributions. From a survey of new hires we find that many workers choose not to contribute to the
plan because they have other financial priorities. However, some non-participants lack the financial
literacy to appreciate the benefit. These findings indicate that simple informational interventions can
nudge workers to participate in retirement saving plans and enhance individual well-being and retirement
income security.

1. Introduction

       The importance of saving for retirement is widely acknowledged, yet employers often

find workers fail to enroll in the optional retirement saving plans they offer. If employees

choose not to participate in their employer’s 401(k) plan because they have other financial

priorities or for other reasons perceive that greater retirement saving is not in their own best

interest at the present time, it may be difficult to increase participation and increasing retirement

saving might actually lower lifetime utility for some employees. However, if the relatively low

rate of participation for employees is attributable to inertia or lack of knowledge, a low cost

intervention may be an effective tool to increase participation and improve employee well-being.

To explore these issues empirically, we partnered with a large financial institution, hereafter

referred to as LFI.

       Our discussion begins with background information on employer-provided retirement

savings plans and employees’ choice of whether to participate. We then describe LFI, its

retirement benefits, and the characteristics of its employees. Using detailed administrative data,

we describe the patterns of participation in the company’s 401(k) plan. To better understand the

choices that workers are making, we investigate reasons for non-participation through a unique

survey of all newly hired workers at LFI over a six month period. Respondents report a variety

of reasons for non- and limited participation in the 401(k) plan, including paying off credit card

debt and not having enough room in one’s budget to save money for retirement. Using a set of

financial knowledge questions, we find many survey respondents that are not currently

participating in the 401(k) plan are unaware of the full range of benefits associated with saving

through a tax qualified retirement saving plan. The survey indicates an important role for
                                                                                                 4


financial literacy and knowledge regarding retirement savings in the decision to contribute to

such plans.

       For our main analysis, we report results from a field experiment. We designed a low-cost

intervention whereby LFI distributed a flyer to a randomly selected subset of 401(k) plan non-

participants who were hired in 2008 through 2010. The flyers contained a message encouraging

employees to take advantage of the employer match using the common catchphrase, “Don’t

Leave Money on the Table.” In addition, the flyers highlighted the long term value of small but

continuous contributions to the savings plan that were matched by the employer. We find young

employees who received the nudge had a statistically significantly larger increase in participation

rates compared to workers of a similar age that did not receive the flyer. However, for workers

over age 45, the percent initiating participation among the treatment group was statistically

significantly lower than the control. These findings highlight the potential effectiveness of

informational “nudges” for non-participants. They also suggest that the materials employers

distribute to newly hired workers should be tailored to the particular needs and concerns of

specific groups.

2. Influencing Employees’ Choices to Participate in a 401(k) Plan

       Although many large corporations still provide their employees with defined benefit

pension plans, these types of plans are becoming less common as firms move towards voluntary

defined contribution plans. As of 2007, 63% of all workers had a defined contribution 401(k)

plan as their only form of employer sponsored retirement savings (Munnell et al. 2009). The

benefits of participation in an employer sponsored 401(k) plan include the employer match,

investment growth, and the tax advantages of retirement saving. Despite the advantages of

contributing to the supplemental retirement saving plan, many newly hired workers decline to

participate in company-provided 401(k) plans. Lack of participation may stem from inadequate
                                                                                                           5


information about the characteristics of the plan or inadequate financial literacy to understand the

value of the plan. On the other hand, employees might have other financial considerations that

lead them not to participate, such as the need to pay off other debts or saving for other priorities

such as a house or their children’s education. In addition, an employee might decline to

participate because they perceive that they are already accumulating sufficient assets for

retirement through prior employment, their company’s defined benefit plan, a spouse’s

employer-sponsored retirement savings plan, and/or expected Social Security benefits.

Factors Affecting the Choice to Participate in a 401(k) Plan

          There are several factors that might influence a worker’s decision to participate in an

employer-sponsored 401(k) plan. First, workers need to know and understand both the tax

advantage of contributing to a 401(k) and the size of any employer match in order to correctly

assess the tradeoff of lower consumption today in return for higher consumption in retirement. If

the employee does not fully appreciate these benefits, then he or she may place less value on

contributions to the 401(k) plan simply because his or her calculation of the future return to these

contributions is too low. In this case, providing information about the benefit of retirement

savings might lead to higher participation rates. On the other hand, if an individual is saving

according to a “rule of thumb” strategy that overvalues retirement savings, then providing

additional information may cause the individual to revise downward the value of saving.1 Of

course, beyond participation, one must also consider the intensive margin of the level of

determine savings behavior.

savings.2 While financial literacy plays a strong role in retirement saving, the levels of financial

literacy in the population vary across demographic groups.3

          Besides knowledge and understanding of the benefits of participating in a 401(k) plan,

financially literate individuals might be more likely to make the effort to enroll in a plan.

Signing up for a 401(k) plan is costly in the sense that it requires the individual to allocate

sufficient time to decide on a retirement plan, complete the appropriate allocation forms, and

work with the company human resources (HR) office and the plan provider. Workers may suffer

from inertia and choose not to actively enroll in the plan simply to avoid the cognitive burden of

figuring out how to enroll or calculating the benefits. In addition, the sheer volume of

information employees receive during orientation may lead to information overload which can

prevent individuals from taking positive actions necessary to enroll in retirement saving plans.

Hanoch et al. (2011) and Schram and Sonnemans (2011) find in an experimental setting that

although having more options increases the probability that a good match exists, increasing the

number of options available in general often results in individuals making suboptimal choices.

2
    To determine the optimal level of saving, Scholz, Seshardi, and Khitatrakun (2006) present a life cycle
model for households to determine the optimal level of wealth accumulation. They account for
uncertainties in longevity, earnings, and medical expenses, as well as taxation and government transfers.
They then compare the calculated optimal targets with actual wealth accumulation and find, surprisingly,
that over 80% of households in their sample have accumulated sufficient wealth to reach their optimal
level of saving. However, their primary data was collected during 1992-1993, a period of strong stock
market performance which can affect wealth accumulation.
3
    Gale, Harris, and Levine (2012) note that a large proportion of American adults with lower income, low
levels of education, and on either end of the age spectrum (the very young and the very old) lack a basic
understanding of financial concepts. Using the Planning and Financial Literacy Module of the 2004 wave
of the Health and Retirement Survey, Lusardi and Mitchell (2011) find that financial literacy varies by
race and gender.
                                                                                                     7


Similarly, Besedeš et al. (2012a, b) find that increasing the number of options available leads to

greater reliance on heuristics among participants in an experiment. Sethi-Iyengar, Huberman,

and Jiang (2004) find that employers with fewer plan options, and hence a simplified investment

choice, saw higher 401(k) participation rates. Even though employees receive information about

their 401(k) plan during orientation, there may be some benefit from resending that same

information several months later when the worker may have more time to process and act on it.

If inertia and information overload are inhibiting employee participation, then sending a simple

flyer several months after orientation might both provide information and a “nudge” to

encourage the employee to undergo the initiation process.

       A second factor that determines the relative value of saving for retirement is employer

matching contributions. Most prior research finds that workers are sensitive to match rates and

higher employer matching contributions are associated with higher participation rates among

employees (Papke 1995; Papke and Poterba 1995). In contrast, Mitchell, Utkus, and Yang

(2007) compare benefits across firms and find that the existence of a match provides only a small

incentive to participate. However, it may be that workers in firms that offer a match but also

have a tenure requirement to be eligible for the match delay participation to coincide with when

they become eligible for the employer match. Such a finding would imply that workers would

have contributed to the plan sooner if the match was effective at the time of hire.

       Of course, many other factors outside of an employer’s control contribute to an

individual’s decision to participate in a 401(k) plan. Previous literature modeling the choice to

participate in a defined contribution plan has found that participation rates are greater among

higher earners, older workers, workers with longer tenures, workers with higher levels of

education, men, and white (when compared to black and Hispanic) workers (see, e.g., Bassett,
                                                                                                        8


Fleming, and Rodriguez 1998; Munnell, Sunden, and Taylor 2002; Madrian and Shea 2001).

The level of participation also varies depending on employee and company characteristics.

Many of the factors that influence participation are also correlated with higher contribution

amounts (Holden and VanDerhei 2001).

       While it is difficult to isolate the direct causal links, several factors that affect the relative

weighting of current consumption to the future value of a benefit in retirement are associated

with these demographic characteristics. First, the magnitude of the tax advantage is dependent

on the worker’s annual salary. Thus, we may see those with higher salaries contributing at

higher levels both because they have more disposable income and because they see a higher

benefit to savings through tax advantaged retirement savings plans. Similarly, an individual has

a personal discount rate which is used to value future consumption relative to today’s

consumption. Personal discount rates may also affect investments that individuals make in

human capital and may change as individuals get closer in age to retirement. The market returns

to savings will also determine the value of contributing to a plan.

       It is common in this literature to find lower participation rates for women (see, e.g.,

Carroll et al. 2009). It might be that women earn less, so see less benefit from participating. It

might also be that women are less informed about the benefits. If the latter is true, then we

would expect women to initiate participation at higher rates if more information is provided.

However, if women are less likely to incorporate new information into their evaluation of the

benefit of participating, then an intervention might be less effective for women than men.

       There are several reasons why we might expect participation rates to vary by age.

Employees have other opportunities to save that will compete for any dollars that the worker

might consider saving. These opportunities include saving for other factors besides retirement
                                                                                                   9


(home, car, etc) and also debt reduction through paying down credit card debt and paying off

student loans. Thus, the existence of these debts would be expected to lower the probability of

newly hired workers enrolling in the 401(k) plan. These factors are likely to be correlated with

age and salary. Further, the age of the individual is an indicator of how far away retirement is

for the worker. Older workers might have a clearer picture of the future or more recognition of

the current lack of sufficient resources to fund an adequate retirement. If younger workers are

less informed because retirement is a far-off and abstract concern, then these individuals will not

participate at higher levels even though their actual benefit might be larger due to compounding

and tax advantages. Providing information to younger workers might produce a larger change in

the probability of participating relative to older workers, if younger workers are indeed less

informed about the benefits of participating and the power of having many years of

compounding returns.

       Recent research suggests that the behavior of peers might also influence an individual’s

choice to participate in a company 401(k) plan. Duflo and Saez (2002) find that the choice to

enroll in an employer sponsored retirement savings account is affected by the enrollment status

of other employees within the same department. Beshears et al. (2011) evaluate the effect of

social norms marketing (providing information about peer behavior) on retirement plan

enrollment. The intervention in their study is designed to facilitate employee action by allowing

the employee to either sign up or increase their contribution rate to the amount required to

receive the full employer match by checking a box and returning it by a specified date. A subset

of the sample received a version of the flyer which included a statement regarding peer saving

rates. They find that for unionized employees, the likelihood of enrollment was negatively

correlated with the magnitude of communicated peer information. Peer participation was
                                                                                                     10


provided by age range, and some age ranges had higher levels of plan participation than others.

Among those individuals who received the intervention, those in subgroups with higher peer

participation rates were less likely to initiate participation relative to those in subgroups with

lower peer participation rates. Although our study also explores peer effects and how they relate

to plan participation, we focus on the effect of an informational intervention which highlights the

importance of saving over time and the value of the employer match.

Plan Design versus Employer-Provided Financial Education

       Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2004) describe several features of plan designs that

encourage participation including employer match rates, the menu of funds, options for taking

loans from the plan, the presence of a defined benefit plan, and automatic enrollment. Several

studies of individual employers have found automatic enrollment to be successful at increasing

participation rates in 401(k) plans (e.g., Madrian and Shea 2001; Munnell, et al. 2009; Choi et al.

2004). As discussed in O’Neill (2007), although these types of plans are effective in increasing

participation, they are costly for employers and may lead to individuals being defaulted into

plans that are not optimal for their personal circumstances (see also Brown, Farrell, and

Weisbenner 2011). Carroll et al. (2009) describe how “active decisions” can be an appealing

alternative to defaults if the population of employees is sufficiently financially literate.

       Employers interested in increasing participation in a 401(k) plan might consider

providing an informational nudge to their employees to address concerns of lack of knowledge

and inertia. Employers that do not want to implement an automatic enrollment policy, but do

want to encourage higher participation rates, might find that providing targeted and timely

information to workers is an effective alternative. Low cost informational interventions have

been found to be successful in other contexts. For example, Liebman and Luttmer (2011)
                                                                                                    11


conducted a field experiment that provided information about social security provisions and

found significant effects on female labor force participation. In a randomized experiment

conducted at a large university, Duflo and Saez (2003) found people who were exposed to

employees that received more information about their 401(k) plan were more likely to

participate.

         Choi et al. (2012) explore the effect of anchoring, goal setting, and savings-threshold

salience on the savings behavior. Using a field experiment, the authors found that recipients did

respond to cues in email messages on the value of 401(k) plan participation and higher

contribution rates. Their study differs from ours in that they focus on increasing contribution

rates among participating employees (the employer implemented an automatic enrollment policy

in 2007), while our primary focus is on increasing plan participation by sending an informational

nudge.    Karlan et al. (2010) provide theoretical support for the effectiveness of reminders and

demonstrate in a series of field experiments that savings in consumer bank accounts can be

increased through timely reminders. Goda, Manchester, and Sojourner (2012) perform a large

scale field experiment to test for bias in the way individuals think about compounding. Using a

low cost intervention, they inform recipients about how current saving translates into future

retirement income using a variety of different frameworks. They find that the information was

effective in increasing contribution levels. Their results highlight the effects of behavioral

influences in the decision making process.

3. The Large Financial Institution Descriptive Statistics

         The large financial institution (LFI) with whom we partnered is a publically traded

banking, insurance, and investments company and is among the top 10 largest financial service

corporations in the United States. LFI has over 30,000 active workers located in 13 states. At

LFI, all newly hired employees participate in a company orientation program. The orientation
                                                                                                          12


occurs during the first two weeks of employment and includes discussion of the defined benefit

and 401(k) plans. LFI provides employees with access to Pro Nvest, a company that has

partnered with LFI to provide retirement planning services and education. The 401(k)

participant guide, discussed during the orientation, provides the employee with information

about investing. The guide includes formulas for calculating how much is needed for retirement,

explanations of the importance of considering inflation when planning for retirement, and

illustrations of compounding power. There is an extensive discussion of the tax advantages of

the company sponsored retirement plan and examples demonstrating the advantage of pre-tax

retirement savings. The information distributed in our “nudge” is adapted from these materials,

so should be familiar to all employees. Employees are also encouraged to participate in the

401(k) plans during annual reviews.4

          LFI offers a traditional final average pay defined benefit plan to its full-time employees.

In addition, employees are offered the option of participating in the company’s 401(k) plan.

Employees can make contributions to the plan starting the first day of the calendar month

following employment. To be eligible for the matching contributions, the employee must be at

least 21 years of age and must complete 1000 hours of service within the 12 months following

his or her hire date.5 LFI offers a 100% match on the first 6% of compensation contributed to the

plan.6 LFI allows employees to contribute to up to 50%of their pay to the plan. Employees may

    Annual reviews for officers occur in February; for non-officers all reviews occur at the employee’s one
year anniversary.
5
    Nearly all (99.5%) the workers hired in 2008 and 98.2% of workers hired in 2009 were match-eligible as
of February 2011.
6
    The match on the first 4% is referred to as the basic match contribution while the remaining 2% is called
the supplemental match. The supplemental match is subject to vesting requirements which state that it
                                                                                                             13


enroll in the plan by using LFI’s PlanTrac Web site or may enroll over the phone. Changes can

be made on a daily basis and contribution rates can be changed at any time. Participants may

invest in the plan’s core funds or in a self-directed brokerage account (available through TD

Ameritrade). The plan allows for both loans and hardship withdraws.

          LFI provided us with detailed, de-identified administrative data on all employees hired

between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. For this analysis, we restrict our attention to

those who were still actively employed on June 20, 2011. The data include annual

compensation, gender, date of birth, date of hire, match eligibility status, date of first

contribution to the 401(k) plan, and contribution amount (as a percent of salary).7 Table 1

provides summary statistics of the 7218 employees hired by LFI between 2008 and 2010. The

table reports the proportion of employees participating in the plan as of February 28, 2011, the

average contribution rate among participants, and the proportion of participants contributing at

least 6 percent of salary (i.e., enough to receive the full employer match if eligible).8 The first


may be forfeited if the employee engages in misconduct including embezzlement, theft, or larceny or
engages in direct competition with the firm, unless the employee has three years of continuous
employment with the firm or has reached age 65.
7
    Because signing and year-end bonuses make measuring the annual compensation for recent hires
somewhat complicated, we make adjustments to the annual compensation reported in the data. We define
salary as the total 2010 compensation reported in February of 2011 for those hired in 2008 and 2009. For
those hired in 2010, we adjust the year-to-date compensation reported in June 2011 to be an annual salary.
8
    Note that we have 144 observations with a valid date of first contribution but a missing value for the
percent contributing. It is likely that these workers began participating but either suspended their
contributions or took a loan from their account. For the purposes of our analysis, we have chosen to
define “participating” as those that have ever contributed to the plan since these individuals have an
account and an account balance. Although these workers are classified as participating, they are excluded
from calculations using contribution rates.
                                                                                                            14


row of Table 1 reports that 49% of all workers hired between 2008 and 2010 were participating

in the 401(k) plan as of February 2011. The average contribution rate among participants was

6.6% of annual salary, while 68.2% of participants were contributing at least 6% of annual

salary.

          Next, we consider how participation differs by match eligibility status.9 We see that

workers that are eligible for the matching contributions are 25.4 percentage points more likely to

be participating than their match-ineligible peers (59.6% versus 34.2%). Interestingly, among

participants, those that are eligible for the match have similar average contribution rates to those

that are not yet match eligible. As expected, average participation rates are higher among men,

older workers, and those earning the highest salaries. Note that the majority of low salary

workers are part-time employees (such as bank tellers), but are still eligible to participate in the

401(k) plan. Overall, we observe that plan participation and average contribution rates move in

the same direction; those groups with higher participation rates also have higher average

contributions conditional on participating. This indicates that not only are men, older workers,

and higher earning workers participating more, but they are also saving a higher fraction of their

salaries.

          Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of contribution rates for 49% of new hires enrolled in

the 401(k) plan as of February 28, 2011. Among these workers, 45.2% were contributing exactly

6% of their annual salary (i.e., the minimum amount needed to receive the full employer match).




9
    Additionally, because participation in the 401(k) plan is supposed to be discussed by managers during
annual reviews, the group that is match eligible may also have a higher participation rate due to this
reminder from their managers.
                                                                                                       15


We also observe that over 23% of those enrolled in the 401(k) plan were contributing amounts

above the 6% level.

       Next, we estimate a multivariate regression of the choice to participate in the 401(k) plan

for the 7218 workers hired between 2008 and 2010. The estimated average marginal effects

from a logit model are presented in column 1 of Table 2. Since all of the individuals in our study

are employed by LFI, they all face the same plan characteristics and the terms of the employer

match do not vary across workers. However, time since being hired should influence the

decision to enroll for three reasons. First, as the employer match goes from 0 to 100% at the

moment the tenure requirement is fulfilled we expect to see a rise in participation at that time.

Second, we expect that longer tenures are associated with higher participation rates because

workers have the opportunity to sign up at any time. Finally, workers with longer tenures have

demonstrated that they have a higher match quality with the firm.

       In Table 2, we find that, controlling for match eligibility and basic demographic

characteristics, workers with longer tenures are more likely to participate. In addition, match

eligibility is associated with a significantly higher participation rate. The average marginal effect

presented in Table 2 indicates that individuals who are eligible for the match are 12.2 percentage

points more likely to participate relative to those that are not yet match eligible, controlling for

tenure. This is consistent with the raw differences presented in Table 1. Female employees of

LFI are significantly less likely to be participating in the 401(k) plan, but the difference is small

in magnitude. Higher salary is associated with an increase in the participation rate. Finally, we

observe that individuals aged 18-24 and 35-44 have statistically significantly lower participation

rates than those ages 25-34.
                                                                                                           16


          Column 2, Table 2 presents estimates from an OLS regression on the percent of salary

contributed by employees hired between 2008 and 2010, limited to plan participants only. Here

we see no statistically significant difference in the contribution rate conditional on participation

by tenure or match eligibility. Among participants, women contribute significantly less to the

saving plan than men, while workers age 45 and above contribute approximately 2% more of

salary relative to workers age 25 to 34. And, finally, employees with greater annual incomes

contribute a larger percentage of their salary to the 401(k) plan.10

          In the final column of Table 2, we consider a binary indicator for whether the individual

is contributing 6% or more of salary (i.e., taking full advantage of the employer matching

contributions, if eligible). Estimated average marginal effects from a logit model are reported.

In general the patterns are very similar to those found looking at contribution rates. One notable

exception is that match eligibility is associated with a statistically significant 6.3 percentage

point higher probability of contributing at least 6% of salary, which is consistent with

predictions.

4. Attitudes and Knowledge of Newly Hired Workers

           In order to better understand why workers are making key retirement saving choices, we

developed a short survey. LFI distributed the surveys between March 2011 and August 2011 to

all employees hired between December 2010 and May 2011 approximately 60 to 90 days after


10
     Here we find that income and contribution percentage are positively correlated. Holden and VanDerhei
(2001) find in their analysis of the 1999 contribution behavior of 1.7 million 401(k) participants that
salary and deferral percentage are positively correlated up to an annual earning amount of $80,000 after
which point the correlation become negative. They note that many of the plans included in their analysis
allow for a maximum contribution of $10,000, which may be driving this result. LFI, on the other hand,
allows employees to contribute up to 50% of salary so we do not expect to see a similar trend here.
                                                                                                   17


hire. This lag was chosen to ensure that all survey recipients would have had sufficient time to

enroll in the 401(k) plan prior to responding. We focus on newly hired workers so that we can

observe the employee’s evaluation of the information received during orientation without

introducing recall bias among workers with longer tenures.

       The surveys were available online to employees at the first of every month, and the link

to the survey remained open for the duration of that month. New links were sent each month,

for a total of six months. Surveys were sent to 1947 new hires, and 356 individuals completed

and returned the surveys for a response rate of 18.3%. Note that the surveys cover workers hired

between December 2010 and May 2011. We do not have administrative data on workers hired in

2011, and we are not able to link surveys to the administrative records for the December 2010

new hires. Appendix 1 discusses how representative the survey respondents are compared to the

administrative data from the 2008-2010 new hires. Survey respondents are much more likely to

be participating in the 401(k) plan, are slightly older, earn more, and are more likely to be male

relative to the full group of 2008-2010 new hires.

       The first objective of the survey was to learn more about employee attitudes regarding the

information they were provided concerning the 401(k) plan. We present responses disaggregated

both by age group and by participation status in the 401(k) plan. Note that all of the survey

respondents were eligible to participate in the plan, but none had earned sufficient tenure to

qualify for employer matching contributions as of the survey date. Table 3 presents responses to

select questions regarding the employee’s perception of the value of information he or she

received and on the sources of information the employee relied upon when making his or her

participation decision. Although the most common rating of the information LFI provided was

that it was “very comprehensive,” participants gave higher ratings than non-participants.
                                                                                                     18


Approximately one-third of younger workers who were already participating in the plan reported

that they would have benefitted from more information. Interestingly, the older workers were

over twice as likely relative to younger workers to not have read the information that their

employer provided about the 401(k) plan. Further, in response to a question about how the

information influenced their participation decision, we find that over half of all workers said the

information did not influence their participation decision. Nearly 80% of older workers not yet

participating in the plan stated that the information they received did not influence their

participation decision, compared to about 60% of younger non-participating workers.

       The bottom row of Table 3 shows large differences by age group in the sources of

information that respondents report as influencing their decision to participate. Younger workers

are far more reliant on family, relatives, colleagues, friends, and the internet than are older

workers. The employer resources, including the plan website and benefit office, were reported to

be useful sources of information by both age groups and both participants and non-participants.

The reliance on employer resources highlights the potential impact of the human

resource/benefits department on employee retirement saving behavior and decision making.

Interestingly, participants reported being influenced by a financial advisor, newspapers, books,

and magazines more frequently than non-participants. Taken together, the responses reported in

Table 3 indicate that younger workers may be more responsive than older workers to receiving

additional information from their employer. We find younger workers are more likely to seek

out information from their employer and that that information influences their participation

decision.

       The second goal of the survey was to learn more about the financial constraints that

affected the participation and contribution rates of new hires. If new hires are not participating
                                                                                                   19


because they have other financial obligations, such as paying down high interest loans, then an

employer intervention aimed at increasing participation may not be effective. To understand the

reasons for limited or non-participation, we included parallel questions for participants and non-

participants. For those that were currently participating in the 401(k) plan, the question asked

what factors limit the amount the respondent is currently contributing. For non-participants, the

question asks what factors are inhibiting the choice to contribute. Both questions listed a series

of possible reasons where the respondent could select all that applied. Responses to these

questions are reported in Table 4, listed separately for the two age groups.

       The employer match emerges as a key factor in the decision to participate in the 401(k)

plan and the level of contributions among participants. Recall that none of the survey

participants were currently eligible for the matching contributions, which begin after 12 months

of employment. Among those who were not yet contributing to the 401(k) plan, over 50%

indicate that they plan to start contributing when they meet the eligibility conditions for the

employer match. The second most common response is that “my salary covers my monthly

living expenses with no extra room for retirement savings.” This reason is more common for the

younger workers than older workers. Also more common for younger workers is the need to pay

off debt including credit card debt, student loans, mortgages, or other debts. Furthermore,

younger workers are also significantly more likely to be saving for a large purchase such as a car

or home. Older workers participating in the plan are significantly more likely than younger

workers to report that taking into account Social Security, pensions, and spouse’s retirement, “I

expect that I will have sufficient retirement income with the amount I am currently contributing.”

       The responses reported in Table 4 suggest that not all employees would benefit from

being automatically enrolled in a 401(k) plan. Rather, for some employees their non-
                                                                                                   20


participation results from an evaluation of their own financial portfolio. However, one should be

cautious in drawing too broad a conclusion from these results since the survey response rate was

less than 20% and the sample of respondents is not necessarily representative of the full

population of newly hired workers.

       Next, we explore how important financial literacy is to the choice to participate in the

plan. The survey included five questions designed to measure the basic financial literacy of the

newly hired employees. The questions, shown in Appendix 2, focus on the individual’s

knowledge concerning the importance of compounding interest rates, the effect of inflation on

real income, the importance of investment diversification, tax advantages associated with

investing in the 401(k) plan, and the value of the employer match. The instructions state that if

the respondent does not know the correct answer, he or she should provide his or her best guess.

We limit the sample to those that left no more than two questions blank. If the respondent left

the question blank or selected “don’t know” it is recorded as an incorrect response. Table 5

shows the proportion of new hires by enrollment status who answered these questions correctly.

       First, in aggregate, the knowledge score is highest for participants relative to non-

participants and for older relative to younger workers. The largest differences between

participants and non-participants are in knowledge of inflation, investment diversification, and

the 401(k) tax advantage. The inflation and investment questions are measuring general

financial literacy, while the 401(k) tax advantage question specifically addresses the value of

participating in the plan. In general, the tax advantages of 401(k) plan participation are not well

understood by any group, with fewer than half of all respondents able to correctly identify the net

effect of a 401(k) contribution on after-tax take home pay (see Appendix 2, Question 4).

Because participants have higher financial literacy than non-participants, efforts to improve
                                                                                                            21


financial knowledge could lead to an increase in 401(k) plan participation for both older and

younger workers.

          The results of our survey indicate that an employer intervention aimed at both educating

and encouraging employee participation in the 401(k) plan could be effective. Workers,

particularly those under age 45, report looking to their employer for information about saving for

retirement. Although many workers report having too little extra money to save for retirement

after paying down debts and saving for a large purchase, many also do not exhibit a full

appreciation for the tax advantage of contributing to a 401(k) plan. These results indicate that

providing information could increase worker well-being if the employee does not fully recognize

the long-term benefits of participating in the 401(k) plan. However, if workers are fully

informed and financially literate, then providing additional information could still affect

participation through “nudging” them to sign up.

5. Nudging Non-participants: A Randomized, Controlled Experiment

          We designed a field experiment to test whether additional employer-provided financial

education could be effective in increasing 401(k) plan participation. All employees hired during

2008 through 2010 who were not participating in the plan as of February 28, 2011 were

randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Appendix 3 describes the randomization and

presents means verifying the success of the randomization.11 The treatment group received a

11
     The treatment group was broken into two subgroups. The first was given a version of the flyer that had
an additional statement on the savings behavior of all employees in the company to test for peer effects.
Ultimately, no difference was found between the two treatment groups. It is possible that there was a
second type of “peer effect” where recipients of the flyers shared information with peers in the control
group. Because of the study design and institutional context, it is unlikely that this was a major
confounding factor. New hires are mixed with longer tenured workers, those not participating in the
401(k) plan are mixed with those who were contributing, and the workers are spread across many cities.
                                                                                                            22


flyer that included a brief example of investment growth over time and instructions on how to

sign up for the company’s 401(k) retirement savings plan. The control group did not receive any

additional information, but both groups still received packets at orientation and follow-up

encouragements during annual reviews. A copy of the flyer is included in Appendix 4. The

information contained in the flyer is adapted from information that was already presented to all

workers in their benefits package. The intervention highlights the benefits of saving, and, in

particular, the value of compounding and potential for investment growth over time. The flyer

was not altered for any specific group and illustrated the wealth accumulation that would occur

with 40 years of savings.12 The flyer itself was adapted from material that LFI already provides

to newly hired workers during orientation, with some small modifications including the addition

of an emphasis on employer matching contributions.13 The orientation materials are not targeted

to certain age groups or planning horizons and also include a 40 year investment horizon.

           The intervention was designed to isolate the effect of information on retirement saving

behavior as measured by the proportion of workers who are active participants in the 401(k)

plan. Nearly 4000 workers participated in the experiment, allowing for the exploration of

heterogeneity in responses by demographic characteristics. The recipients were unaware that

Still, if there was sharing of information between the treatment and control groups this would simply
cause our treatment group to look more like the control and bias our estimates of the effect of the flyer
towards zero. Full results broken down by treatment group status are included in Appendix 3.
12
     Although tax advantages are also important, they were not addressed in the intervention in the interest
of simplicity.
13
     The examples showing the savings from reduced consumption on certain items and the impact of
investing these funds in the 401(k) plan were taken from the retirement plan’s handbook. For
consistency, the flyer made the same assumptions concerning the investment period and rate of return as
used by the plan provider in the information given to newly hired employees.
                                                                                                            23


their behavior was being observed, and because the researchers observe the outcome of interest

in administrative data, there is no reporting bias. Therefore, any difference in the rate of

initiating participation in the 401(k) plan that is observed between the treatment and control

group can be attributed to the receipt of the low-cost flyer.14

           The flyers were distributed to employees at LFI in mid-April 2011. Most of the flyers

were distributed by email, but employees that did not have regular access to a computer at work

were sent a black and white print-out of the flyer through interoffice mail. Appendix Table 3.1

illustrates that the delivery method was not randomized, although in Appendix Table 3.2 we see

that the impacts were similar. We measure participation initiation as of June 20, 2011, which

allowed employees approximately two months to respond to the information they received.

Employees who terminated employment during the study period were excluded from the

analysis.15

           Table 6 presents statistics on the percent participating as of June 20, 2011. Because the

sample includes only those that were not participating as of February 28, 2011, the percent

participating in June is an indication of the percent of workers that initiated participation during

our study period. Although the average participation rate of employees in the treatment group is

1.0 percentage points (17%) higher than the control group, the difference is not statistically

significant. However, when the sample is disaggregated by demographic characteristics, we see

that the intervention did significantly affect the retirement saving behavior of some groups of

14
     We chose to focus only on the choice to participate and not on the level of contribution. In results
available upon request, the intervention had no effect on the level of contribution among those that
initiated participation.
15
     Four hundred and seventy two employees were terminated during the study period. Termination was
not correlated with receipt of intervention material, results available upon request.
                                                                                                          24


employees. First we consider whether, on average, the intervention was more effective for those

that were eligible for the match prior to the start of the study in February 2011 (eligible before),

those that became eligible for the match between February and June 2011 (newly eligible), and

those that were not yet eligible as of June 2011 (not yet eligible). There is no statistically

significant effect, on average, when the sample is divided by match eligibility status or gender.

When we disaggregate the sample by salary, we find that the intervention was associated with a

large and statistically significant increase in the percent signing up for the plan for those earning

between $30,000 and $59,999. However, this effect is being driven by differences in age that are

correlated with salary levels.16

          The largest effect of the intervention can be seen when comparing employees in different

age groups. Results indicate that younger employees, those 18 – 24 years old, were 4.5

percentage points more likely to join the 401(k) plan if receiving an intervention relative to the

control. For this group, those receiving the intervention were over twice as likely to initiate

participation in the plan relative to the control group. A similarly large and statistically

significant difference was observed for workers ages 35-44. On the other hand, for the age group

45 years and older, those receiving the intervention were a statistically significant 4.4 percentage

points less likely to initiate participation relative to the control group. As the intervention

highlighted the importance of saving early by demonstrating investment growth over time, it is

possible that this older group of workers were actually discouraged from participating in their

employer 401(k) plan.




16
     In results not shown, when we control for age in a regression framework we find this difference is due
to age rather than income-level.
                                                                                                      25


        Table 7 presents the estimated average marginal effects from a logit regression on the

individuals’ choice to initiate participation over the study period. Each column includes

regression estimates on the age group as indicated in the column heading. The regressions

include controls for tenure, match eligibility, gender, salary, and age categories (in the full

sample). Here we see again that the intervention significantly increased participation for workers

ages 18-44, while it significantly decreased the likelihood to initiate participation among those

workers ages 45 and older.

        In Table 7, the regression specification includes controls for those that were match-

eligible before the study period and those that became match-eligible between February and June

2011 (the omitted group is not yet eligible for the match in June 2011). The estimates indicate

that becoming match eligible increases the probability of initiating participation over the study

period by approximately 9 percentage points. This is a large effect (representing almost a 150%

increase over the mean on average) and is similar across the age groups, although it is largest in

both magnitude and percent for the youngest workers. However, in contrast to the results present

in Table 2, we find no difference in the probability of initiating participation for those that were

already match-eligible before the study period and no difference by tenure. Similarly, we find no

statistically significant differences in the probability to initiate participation by salary or gender.

        Next, in Table 8 we explore heterogeneity in the effect of the intervention by match

eligibility, gender, and salary. Here we report estimates from separate regressions on subsets of

the population. If there are particular groups that are more responsive to the intervention, then

those may be targeted in the future to increase participation rates. Because the effects of the

intervention are so different between the older and younger age groups, we present all analysis

for the two groups separately. The first row of Table 8 repeats the estimates presented in column
                                                                                                      26


5 of Table 7 for reference. When disaggregating by match eligibility status among the younger

workers, we see the only group with a statistically significant effect of the intervention is those

not yet match eligible. However, the estimate is nearly identical for the group that became

match-eligible over the sample period. This finding indicates that those that are most recently

hired are likely to be responsive to an intervention. When disaggregated by gender, the positive

effect of the intervention for younger workers is concentrated among men, whose participation

rate was increased by 4.2 percentage points over the control group. Among younger worker, the

intervention was more effective in increasing participation for those that were earning less than

$60,000 annually relative to those earning more.

       The bottom half of Table 8 indicates that for those ages 45 and above, the negative effect

on participation due to intervention is stronger for higher salaried workers, males, and those not

yet match-eligible. Similar to the findings for younger workers, those that are newly match

eligible or not yet match eligible were most influenced by the receipt of the flyer, although for

older workers it was a discouragement rather than encouragement. When consider the

interaction of salary and age, we observe that among employees aged 18-44, 8.3% earn $60,000

or more per year compared to 21.1% of those 45 and older. Among the subset of older workers,

the average marginal effect of the treatment is statistically significant only for the higher earning

group. And, conversely, among the younger group, there is a positive effect only for the lower

earners. The implications of the results presented in Tables 7 and 8 are discussed in section 6.

6. Discussion and Conclusions

       Although these results do show that a low cost intervention can be effective in increasing

401(k) participation among some groups, the effectiveness of the informational nudge varied by

employee characteristics. Women were far less responsive to the intervention than men, and

only the most recently hired workers behaved significantly differently than the control group.
                                                                                                     27


We find that among workers ages 18-44 that were initially not participating in the 401(k) plan,

those that were sent a flyer were 2.5 percentage points (roughly 40% of the mean of 6.6%) more

likely to initiate participation in the 401(k) plan relative to the control group. However for the

workers ages 45 and older, receiving the intervention actually led to a lower initiation rate.

       Our intervention was designed based on materials already distributed to workers at

orientation. The flyer emphasized the value of compounding using a standard 40 year time

horizon. Older workers in our sample may have been put off by the framing of this information,

an unintended consequence of the design of our flyer. Older workers in the control group had a

sign-up rate that was over twice as large as younger workers in the control group, suggesting that

older workers already had an appreciation of the value of participating and that the framing of

the flyer may have been discouraging to those in the treatment group. Prior literature has

highlighted an important role for anchoring and framing in retirement savings (e.g., Choi et al.

2012). Future work should further explore whether materials currently distributed to employees

could be improved by better highlighting the benefits to the particular demographic group of

interest. At a minimum, our results suggest that information distributed to workers might be

more effective if it is tailored to the circumstances of the individual. Perhaps current differences

in participation rates by broad demographic category are partially a reflection of framing and the

design of employer-provided educational materials.

       As the design of the study allowed only two months between the intervention date and

the outcome evaluation, it is possible that some groups respond more slowly and a follow-up

study allowing for more time to enroll would find different patterns or larger effects. For

example, it may be that that receipt of the nudge causes workers in the treatment group to move

up their planned date of participation, but this group would have participated at some later date
                                                                                                     28


in the absence of the intervention. If this were the case, the nudge could be viewed as a tool to

influence the timing of plan sign up, but not long term participation rates. It is also important to

note that the sample used included only individuals who had not already enrolled in the plan,

perhaps due to inertia or a lack of understanding of the employer match and compounding.

Viewed in this light, the increases in participation from the nudge are even more impressive. In

addition, we should emphasize that the nudge was extremely low cost. It was developed using

information already provided by the plan provider and sent through company e-mail or

interoffice mail. Thus, even modest increases in participation rates are impressive from a cost-

benefit perspective.

        There are several potential reasons why workers might fail to participate in an employer-

sponsored 401(k) plan. On one hand, employees might not fully appreciate the value of

participation or might suffer from inertia. On the other hand, it might be that employees are

choosing not to participate in order to spend money on paying down debt or to save for a large

purchase. In order to understand the importance of these factors, we present results from a short

survey of newly hired workers. Results confirm the importance of the employer match in

participation and contribution decisions. We find an important role of financial education in

retirement savings, since not all benefits of participating in an employer sponsored 401(k) plan

are well understood.

        Employers seeking to raise participation rates in a 401(k) plan may choose to modify plan

design through manipulation of such features as employer matching contributions, defaults and

automatic enrollment, or eligibility and vesting periods. However, if workers either suffer from

inertia or fail to fully appreciate the value of participating, a simple informational nudge might

be an attractive alternative.

Notes: See Table 6 for a description of the sample. Each row presents results from a separate
regression of initiating participation on a dummy variable for receiving the intervention. The
regression specification is identical to that in Table 7, columns (5) and (6). Under match
eligibility, “eligible before” indicates all workers who achieved the requirements for match
eligibility by February 2011, before the intervention began. “Newly eligible” includes all
workers who became match-eligible during the study period (between February 2011 and June
2011). All other workers were not yet eligible for the employer match. Coefficients presented
are average marginal effects from a logit model, with standard errors in parentheses, * p < 0.10,
** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Notes: This figure illustrates the distribution of contribution rates as of February 28, 2011 among workers
hired at LFI between 2008 and 2010. Forty-nine percent of newly hired workers were participating in the
401(k) plan.

Appendix 1. Representativeness of Survey Respondents
Appendix Table 1.1 demonstrates that the survey is not necessarily representative of all newly

hired workers. Respondents are significantly more likely to be participating in the 401(k) plan,

are more likely to be male, are slightly older, and tend to have higher salaries. Note that the

employees given the survey are not the same as those represented in the administrative data with

the exception of the workers hired in December 2010. Therefore, a direct comparison is not

possible.

Appendix 2. Knowledge Questions

Below is a list of the knowledge questions and potential answers, with the correct answer in bold.

The first three questions were developed by Lusardi and Mitchell (2011).


Interest Rate: If you have savings in the amount of $100 in the bank and the interest rate is 2%,
how much will you have in your savings account after 5 years?
Answers: (a) More than $102 (b) $102 (c) Less than $102 (d) Do not know

Inflation: If the current interest rate on your bank deposit is 1% per year and the inflation rate is
2% per year, how much do you think you will be able to buy with your money a year from now?
Answers: (a) A larger amount than you can buy now (b) Exactly the same as you can buy now
(c) A smaller amount than you can buy now (d) Do not know

Investment: Do you think the following statement is true or false? “Buying a single company
stock usually provides a safer return than a diversified portfolio.”
Answers: (a) True (b) False (c) Do not know

Tax Advantage: Assume you are in the 25 percent tax bracket (you pay $0.25 in tax for each
dollar earned) and you contribute $100 pretax to the 401(k) plan. Your take home pay (what is in
your pay check after all taxes and other payments are taken out) will:
Answers: (a) Decline by $100 (b) Decline by $75 (c) Decline by $50 (d) Remain the same (e)
Do not know

401(k) Employer Match: Assume that your employer matches your contribution one dollar for
each dollar you contribute to the 401(k) plan. If you contribute $100 to the 401(k) plan, your
account balance in the plan, including your contribution, will:
Answers: (a) Increase by $50 (b) Increase by $100 (c) Increase by $200 (d) Remain the same
(e) Do not know
                                                                                                     8


Appendix 3: Randomization in Intervention Group Assignments

   Employees that were hired during 2008- 2010 that were not participating in the 401(k) plan

as of February 28, 2011 were randomly assigned to three groups:

   (1) Intervention Version 1 (flyer including peer participation statement)

   (2) Intervention Version 2 (basic flyer, no peer information)

   (3) Control (group 3).

To verify that the randomization was done properly, the group means for age, gender, year of

hire, and salary are evaluated to ensure that each group is representative of the entire sample of

non-participants. Due to limited access to computers at work, a small subset of workers in the

“intervention” samples were sent the flyer via interoffice mail instead of via email. The delivery

method was not randomized, since it was only those without regular access to computers for

work that received the hard copy version.

       Appendix Table 3.1 shows the means are nearly identical across the randomized

treatment and control groups, as intended by study design. We also see that those terminated

during the sample period were more likely to be lower paid employees and those that were more

recently hired. Appendix Table 3.2 demonstrates that there was little difference between the

effects of the two versions of the flyer. Therefore, we do not find any evidence of a differential

“peer effect” from providing information about peer behavior.

   Notes: Specification and sample is identical to that presented in Table 7, except here we
   distinguish between the types of flyer or the delivery method. In columns (1) - (3) we include
   two variables indicating the type of intervention sent. In columns (4) - (6) we include two
   variables indicating the delivery method of the intervention. The ‘match-eligible before’ group
   consists of workers that were eligible for the match as of February 2011, while ‘newly match-
   eligible’ refers to the group that became eligible for the match over the study period (the base
   category is ‘not yet eligible’ for the match). Age refers to age at April 2011, the date of
   intervention. Age refers to age at April 2011, the date of intervention. Standard errors are in
   parentheses, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
