Since the onset of the global financial crisis, China and the U.S. have reduced their current-account
imbalances as a share of GDP to less than half their pre-crisis levels. For China, the reduction in its
current-account surplus post-crisis suggests a structural change. Panel regressions for a sample of almost
100 countries over 1983-2013 confirm that the relationship between current-account balances and
economic variables changed in important ways after the financial crisis. China’s rebalancing has been
accompanied by a decline in its reserves-to-GDP ratio and greater outward FDI that, in turn, has mitigated
reserve hoarding.

1.     INTRODUCTION

In 2007-2009 the United States faced a severe financial crisis that resulted in the worst downturn

in output and employment since the Great Depression. Economists and policy makers have

concentrated on understanding the fundamental causes of this crisis and how to end it. In

addition, the dramatic collapse in world trade that was both triggered by the crisis and helped

spread it has led to new work on the linkages between financial distress and global trade flows.

A topic that has received less attention is how East-West global imbalances—particularly those

of China and the United States-- have changed in the aftermath of the financial crisis. That is the

focus of this paper.

       In the run-up to the financial crisis, the world economy was characterized by enormous

current-account imbalances (Figure 1). China’s surplus alone was 0.7% of world GDP in 2008

while the United States had a deficit of more than 1% of world GDP that year. The current-

account balances of the world’s surplus countries (e.g., China, Germany, Japan, oil exporters)

exceeded 2.5% of global GDP in 2008; the current-account balances of the world’s deficit

countries (e.g., the United States, non-Asian emerging markets, the Euro area excluding

Germany) also were about 2.5% of global GDP.

       Prior to the financial crisis, some suggested large imbalances could be sustained for the

foreseeable future. Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and Garber (2003, 2005), for example, argued an

Asian periphery, primarily China, could pursue a development strategy of export-led growth

supported by undervalued exchange rates and capital controls for many years. Large current-

account surpluses and official capital outflows in the form of accumulated reserve asset claims

on the United States would characterize the Asian periphery for perhaps a decade or more.

Moreover, the strategy was a “win” for the center (e.g., the United States) as well, since virtually

unlimited demand for its financial assets would allow it to run large current-account deficits,

living beyond its means for years.


               At some point, the Asian periphery would grow sufficiently to graduate to the center. It

would then undertake financial liberalization and adopt greater exchange-rate flexibility. But

when that happened, another set of developing countries would step forward to become the new

periphery, pursuing the same export-led growth strategy against the center as had China and the

Asian periphery, and before them, post-war Europe and Japan. As a result, global imbalances,

with the periphery running large current-account surpluses and the center large current-account

deficits, would be a regular feature of the international monetary system for years to come.

              In later work, Dooley et al (2004) provided an asset-market interpretation of the win-win

view of global imbalances. The interpretation went as follows. U.S. deficits supplied

international collateral to poorer countries on the periphery eager to undertake capital formation;

the collateral freed them from a reliance on inefficient domestic financial markets. FDI flows

into China provided supporting evidence for this claim.1

              The modern mercantilist view, embraced by Aizenman and Lee (2007, 2008) and others,

provided a less sanguine interpretation for the persistent global imbalances that emerged in the

2000s. While Aizenman and Lee confirmed the hoarding of international reserves that

accompanied current-account surpluses was dominated by a precautionary motive prior to 2000,

a finding consistent with Aizenman and Marion’s (2003, 2004) earlier interpretations, there

appeared to be a regime change afterwards. 2 China’s international reserves that had been

trendless during the second half of the 1990s, hovering around 15% of GDP, grew after 2000 at

an annual rate of about 4%, reaching almost 45% of GDP by 2007 (Figure 2).

 Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (2008), Ju and Wei (2010) and others explored this
interpretation in models with FDI and global imbalances.

    While the mercantilist motive for hoarding international reserves played a significant statistical
role in accounting for the behavior in international reserves/GDP during the period 1980-2000,
the precautionary motive was more important economically.
                                                               2


              Aizenman and Lee (2008) pointed to monetary mercantilism as the main reason for the

regime change. Like earlier mercantilist efforts to expand export markets and accumulate gold

described by Adam Smith (1776), after the year 2000 countries such as China started pushing

exports to promote growth, racking up current-account surpluses and growing stockpiles of

international reserves. The numbers were impressive. On the eve of the financial crisis, China’s

real GDP growth had reached 14% (Figure 3), its current-account surplus had grown to 10% of

GDP (Figure 4), and its international reserves had reached almost 45% of GDP prior to the crisis,

peaking at about 50% in 2010 (Figure 2). However, unlike Dooley et al’s (2003, 2004, 2005)

win-win view of global imbalances buffered by international reserve hoarding, Aizenman and

Lee (2008) warned that modern mercantilism could lead to unintended adverse consequences

such as competitive hoarding.

              The view that large East-West global imbalances could be sustained for a long period was

not shared by everyone. Eichengreen (2007) and Feldstein (2008), for example, argued the

Asian periphery was not monolithic; some member of the periphery might abandon fixed

exchange rates against the dollar sooner than later, either willingly or in response to speculative

pressures, thereby reducing East-West global imbalances. Obstfeld and Rogoff (2005) also saw

large imbalances as unsustainable and worried whether they would unwind gradually or abruptly.

              Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan and Volosovych (2011) observed that global imbalances where

poorer countries financed richer ones were driven mainly by government decisions and official

capital flows, since private funds tended to move in the opposite direction, attracted by higher

growth rates in poorer countries. They raised concerns about the global efficiency and

sustainability of these trends.3

    Feenstra and Hong (2010) raised questions about the efficacy and sustainability of export-led
growth in China as the way to increase future employment. They calculated that export growth
over the period 2000-2005 could explain the entire increase in China’s employment over that
                                                               3


              Aizenman and Sun (2010) also raised doubts that large global imbalances could be

sustainable. They argued that with China growing at twice the rate of the United States, the U.S.

current-account deficits needed to absorb China’s surpluses in coming years -- in the absence of

other big countries willing to run large deficits -- would be unrealistically high and hence self-

limiting in the not too distant future.4

              Then the financial crisis hit. In the U.S., the private sector was forced to deleverage and

reduced its demand for imports. Other crisis-hit developed countries also cut back on imports.

As China experienced weaker export demand, it took seriously the IMF’s call for more reliance

on domestic spending to sustain growth. It began promoting greater domestic consumption and

investment with the help of a domestic credit boom. It also pursued fiscal stimulus and allowed

its real exchange rate to appreciate. It attempted to diversify its holdings of dollar-denominated

reserve assets by creating a sovereign wealth fund and encouraging outward foreign direct

investment.

              The data are revealing. Since the onset of the financial crisis, East-West global

imbalances have fallen dramatically. The current-account balances of the world’s big surplus

economies that totaled 2.5% of world GDP in 2008 have been below 2% since 2009; the current-

account deficits of the biggest deficit countries have shown a similar decline (Figure 1).

              China and the United States have also seen their imbalances shrink (Figure 6). China’s

current-account surplus fell from 10.1% of GDP in 2007 to 5.1% in 2009 and to 2.3% in 2012


period, but comparable employment gains could have been achieved by growing domestic
demand.


 Aizenman and Jinjarak (2009) captured empirically the asymmetric effect of the U.S. as the
"demander of last resort." For the period 1981-2006, a 1% increase in the lagged US current-
account deficit was associated with a 0.5% increase in the current-account surpluses of surplus
countries. They projected a sizable drop in China’s current-account surpluses after 2006,
possibly falling to 1% of China’s GDP by 2013 in a "worst-case scenario" where all conditioning
variables deteriorated by one standard deviation.

                                                                                        4


(Figure 4). As a share of global GDP, China’s surplus fell from 0.7% in 2008 to 0.27% in 2012

(Figure 1). The drop in 2009 alone was the largest ever recorded in the last thirty years (Table

1b). According to the IMF, China’s current-account surplus is expected to be 0.32% of world

GDP at the end of 2013.

       Before the financial crisis, the U.S. current-account deficit was about 6% of U.S. GDP in

both 2005 and 2006 and 5% in 2007. After the onset of the financial crisis it fell to 2.7% in 2009

and 2.8% in 2012. As a share of global GDP, the U.S. current-account deficit also fell

dramatically. The IMF expects it to be at a sixteen-year low of 0.64% by the end of 2013.

       Standard macroeconomic models can easily account for the reduction in global

imbalances in the immediate aftermath of a financial crisis. Financial frictions and household

deleveraging reduce import demand as well as aggregate demand in crisis-hit countries, reducing

their current-account deficits. The decline or reversal in international financial inflows during a

financial crisis also depreciates their real exchange rates, further reducing their deficits. If weak

demand impacts many countries, there are few to take up the slack. Countries with large current-

account surpluses, such as China, will see demand collapse for their exports and will experience

declining current-account surpluses. Policies that stimulate domestic demand to make up for the

export shortfall can reduce current-account surpluses even more.

       In this paper, we look at the data and move directly to an empirical investigation. We

explore panel regressions as a way to highlight important correlations between current-account

balances and economic variables both before and after the financial crisis. Although data are

only available for six years since the onset of the financial crisis, the regression estimates provide

some suggestive evidence on whether the crisis will have a long-lasting impact on moderating

current-account imbalances, particularly those of China and the United States.

              The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and our

estimation procedure. Section 3 presents baseline results and checks their robustness to

alternative specifications. Section 4 focuses on China. It compares the actual decline in China’s

current-account surpluses post-2006 with predicted values based on the panel regression’s pre-

crisis sample coefficients and on its post-crisis sample coefficients. The results indicate a

structural change post-crisis. The decline in China’s reserve stockpile post-crisis is also shown

to be driven somewhat by a new wave of outward foreign direct investment (FDI) into developed

economies as China seeks higher-yielding real foreign assets. This new trend is supported by an

easing of capital controls on outward flows.5 China has joined other emerging markets in

relaxing outflow controls, motivated by the desire to dampen rising stock prices, the appreciation

in the exchange rate, real exchange-rate volatility, and the large accumulation of international

reserves. [See Aizenman and Pasricha (2013)]. We speculate that China’s smaller current-

account surpluses and more moderate reserve accumulation may become a longer-term norm as

lower global growth forces China to rely more on domestic demand to expand it economy and as

the high cost of holding international reserves pushes China to place even more emphasis on

outward FDI. Section 5 concludes.



2. DATA AND ESTIMATION


We assembled panel data on current-account balances and other economic variables for a group

of developed and developing countries over the period 1980-2012. Data definitions, data sources

and country coverage are described in the Appendix. Most data are from the Economist

Intelligence Unit (EIU). The EIU data are obtained from individual country sources, the

  WSJ, December 19, 2013 reported, “Beijing will ease the approval process for all but the
largest Chinese investments in overseas companies and projects, a major relaxation of regulatory
oversight that analysts say is aimed at encouraging Chinese firms to expand abroad.”

                                                               6


International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics and the World Bank’s World

Development Indicators. We supplement these data with data from the External Wealth of

Nations and other sources.

              We restrict the sample to countries with annual observations in each of two sub-periods,

one before the financial crisis and the other after its onset. The sample is further restricted by

data availability. Our final sample contains 95 countries; 30 of these countries are OECD

members.

              The estimation draws on the empirical framework in Chinn and Prasad (2003) and
Gruber and Kamin (2007). The estimating equation is:


            CAYi,t = DCAYi,t-1 + BXi,t-1 + Ci + JDEMANDUSA,t-1 + eit ; Ci = {c1,…,c94}            (1)


where CAYit is the current-account balance as a percentage of GDP of country i at time t, Xit-1 is a

vector of lagged economic variables, Ci = {c1,….c94} is a vector of country fixed effects, and

DEMANDUSA,t-1 is the lagged U.S. current-account balance as a share of GDP. The economic

factors included in X are economic performance, captured by the growth rate of real GDP and

real GDP per capita; structure, represented by openness to trade and the share of natural

resources exports in GDP; external wealth, measured by international reserves as a share of

GDP; debt, measured by the stock of public debt as a share of GDP; and the real exchange rate.6

              Since the current account is the result of saving and investment decisions, the empirical

specification in (1) uses standard variables that are correlated with these decisions along with

structural and policy measures. The specification also includes the U.S. demand variable

(measured by the U.S. current-account deficit as a percent of GDP) used in Aizenman and

Jinjarak (2009) to capture the notion that the U.S. acted as a “demander of last resort” for the

  We also consider the role of liquidity, captured by bank lending to the public and private
sectors as a share of GDP, in one version of our estimation. Including the liquidity variable
reduces the number of countries in the sample from 95 to 83.
                                                               7

exports of China and other countries, enabling them to run big current-account surpluses over

part of the sample period.

       The Appendix provides a table of summary statistics for the variables used in the

estimation.




3. BASELINE RESULTS AND ROBUSTNESS CHECKS


Before proceeding with the formal estimation, we first test for possible non-stationarity. For

each variable, we perform panel data unit-root tests using a Fisher-type (Choi, 2001) procedure,

including one lag in the test. The test is not limited to a balanced sample and has a null

hypothesis that all the panels contain a unit root. Based on the test results, non-stationary

variables are then first-differenced.

       Table 2a presents baseline results over the sample period 1983-2012 and two sub-periods

1983-2006 and 2007-2012. The panel regressions explain over one-half of the variation in the

current account. The goodness of fit is better for the 1983-2006 sub-period ( R 2     0.69 ) than for

the 2007-2012 sub-period ( R 2    0.55 ), suggesting a change after the onset of the financial crisis.

The Table 2a results indicate that most of the economic variables are significantly correlated

with the current account in the whole sample and across the two sub-periods. The signs on the

correlations are as expected. The correlations can be characterized as follows:

x      The correlation between the current-account surplus and an increase in international

reserves is always positive and significant.

x      The correlation between the current-account surplus and an increase in U.S. demand is

positive and significant for the full sample period and pre-crisis period. The correlation is



                                               8


insignificant post-crisis. The latter result suggests a possible structural change in the role of the

U.S. as the demander of last resort following the financial crisis.

x       The correlation between the current-account surplus and real GDP growth is always

negative and significant; the same is true of the correlation between the current-account surplus

and the increase in public debt.

x       The correlation between the current-account surplus and trade is positive and significant

for the full sample period and pre-crisis period but negative and significant post-crisis.

x       The correlation between the current-account surplus and appreciation of the real

exchange rate is negative and significant for the full sample period but insignificant in each of

the two sub-periods.

        The correlation results for trade and the real exchange rate are consistent with the

complementary relationship between the surplus countries and the U.S. prior to the financial

crisis and its reversal after the crisis. Prior to the crisis, the relatively high rates of employment

and low rates of unemployment in the U.S. as well as the presumption that The Great

Moderation was the new normal put to rest most concerns about increasing global imbalances.

Moreover, large and growing U.S. current-account deficits translated into large and growing

world demand for U.S. assets that helped keep U.S. interest rates low and allowed the U.S. to

access global savings when its own saving rate was low. These trends were complemented by

the growing exports and current-account surpluses of China and other emerging markets as they

pursued export-led growth strategies.

        The financial crisis forced countries to confront a changed global picture, with much

slower growth in the OECD countries and reduced demand for the exports of emerging markets

that had previously relied on export-led growth strategies. In the post-crisis environment,

depreciating currencies and hoarding international reserves are not enough to sustain robust


                                                9

export-led growth. The estimates in Table 2a confirm that a structural change has taken place

post-crisis. An F-test rejects the null of no structural change between the pre-crisis period (1983-

2006) and the post-crisis period (2007-2012).

          To explore further possible differences between the pre- and post-crisis periods, we re-

estimate the regression over the entire sample period, now including a dummy variable equal to

one for the post-crisis years 2007-2012 plus interactive terms. The results are reported in Table

2b. The F-test confirms that the null of no structural change between the pre-crisis and post-

crisis periods can be rejected with high confidence.

          Several results in Table 2b are noteworthy. The positive correlation between the current-

account surplus and international reserves prior to the crisis is significantly more positive in the

post-crisis period. This pattern is consistent with greater competitive hoarding in times of global

recessionary pressures. The negative correlations of the current-account surplus with real GDP

growth and the increase in public debt are significantly more negative after the crisis. This result

is consistent with greater fiscal retrenchment in the surplus countries in the aftermath of the

crisis.

          The correlation between the current-account surplus and U.S. demand in the pre-crisis

period (Upre-crisis  is positive and highly significant. The positive correlation is much

weaker in the post-crisis period (Upost-crisis Upre-crisisUinteraction   although an

F-test reveals it is still significant (F=8.52, Prob>F=0.0036). After the onset of the financial

crisis, the United States no longer plays such an important role as ‘demander of last resort” for

the exports of other countries. Its private and public sectors have had to undergo substantial

adjustments, making them less able to absorb the world’s exports. The U.S. private sector has

had to deleverage in response to the negative wealth effects of declining real estate and portfolio

valuations. The more limited access of households to the credit market has raised private savings.

                                                10


The U.S. public sector has contracted in response to the end of the federal fiscal stimulus, the

drop of public investment and spending, and the negative stimulus stemming from declining tax

revenues and mounting debts in the fifty U.S. states. These private and public sector adjustments

post-crisis have required the U.S. to retreat from its role as “demander of last resort” for the

world’s exports. 

       Table 3a reports results for the current accounts of surplus and non-surplus countries in

the pre- and post-crisis periods. A surplus country is defined as one having a current-account

surplus greater than 1.5 percent of GDP in a given year and having experienced an increasing

surplus in the prior two years. The current accounts of surplus countries are significantly

correlated with fewer economic variables than the full sample of countries, and even these

significant correlations do not generally carry over to the post-crisis period. Prior to the financial

crisis, the current accounts of surplus countries are positively and significantly associated with

the increase in international reserves, trade, and the increase in the US current-account deficit.

       After the financial crisis, the first two correlations are insignificant and the correlation

with U.S. demand reverses sign; it is now negative and significant. An F- test rejects the null of

no structural break for surplus countries after the onset of the financial crisis.

       An F- test also rejects the null of no structural break across the two periods for non-

surplus countries. A number of correlations that are highly significant prior to the crisis lose

their significance in the post-crisis period. The role of the U.S. as a “demander of last resort,”

for example, loses its significance after 2006.

the two country groupings, we estimate separate regressions for the surplus and non-surplus

countries, using the full sample period and including the time dummy and its interactions. The

results are reported in Table 3b. F-tests reject the null of no structural break post-crisis for both

the surplus and non-surplus countries.

              The role of the U.S. as a demander of last resort is not an important factor either before or

after the crisis for non-surplus countries. For the surplus countries, it is a significant factor in

each period.7 Interestingly, the U.S. role as demander of last resort is significantly different after

the onset of the crisis for surplus countries.

              The correlation between the current-account surplus and increase in international reserves

is positive and significant for both surplus and non-surplus countries prior to the crisis. After the

crisis, there is no significant change in the correlation for non-surplus countries. For the

countries in surplus, however, the correlation is significantly dampened after the crisis, although

an F-test shows that it remains positive and significant.8




4. CHINA’S CURRENT-ACCOUNT AND INTERNATIONAL RESERVES


Figure 8 illustrates China’s current-account surplus over the period 1999-2012. It also depicts

two forecasts of China’s current account for the post-2006 period. The pre-crisis forecast is

based on the estimated regression coefficients of the pre-crisis regression in Table 2a, while the

post-crisis forecast is based on coefficients from the 2007-2012 period regression in Table 2a.

               The pre-crisis forecast predicts a declining current account/GDP surplus for China after

2008. This prediction is in line with the realized decrease in China’s current-account surplus,

An F-test reveals that the correlation in the post-crisis period is significant; F=9.80,

 In one version we added the growth of domestic credit as a share of GDP as a regressor and
interacted it with the time dummy. Including the domestic credit variable reduces the country
sample from 95 to 83. The correlation of the current-account surplus and the growth of domestic
credit is positive and significant in the pre-crisis period only for the non-surplus countries and
the correlation in the post-crisis period is not significantly different from the one in the pre-crisis
period.
                                                               12


but it under-predicts the magnitude of the decline in each of the post-crisis years. The post-

crisis forecast predicts a sharp drop in China’s current account as early as 2007 and over-predicts

the decline in China’s current-account surplus in both 2007 and 2008. That said, from 2009

onwards, the post-crisis forecast and China’s actual current account match up quite nicely. The

forecast predicts a 1 percent higher surplus in 2011 than was realized, possibly because it does

not account for the fiscal package adopted by China’s government to stimulate the economy.

        Finally, we examine the changes in China’s international reserves over the last thirty-

three years (Figure 5 and 7). We quantify the sources of these changes. This exercise allows us

to trace the changing impact of inward and outward FDI on international reserves, as well as the

influence of the trade balance, domestic credit, and real exchange-rate appreciation. As there is

no reason for the relationship between reserves and these factors to be stable over time, we

examine separately the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods.

        Table 4 reports the results of regressing the change in China’s international

reserves/GDP on trade/GDP, the flows of inward and outward FDI/GDP, the increase in

domestic credit/GDP, and real exchange-rate appreciation. Columns I-V report estimated

coefficients and their standard errors when each of the source variables enters the estimation

individually. The results indicate reserve increases are positively and significantly correlated

with the trade balance, inward and outward FDI flows, the increase in domestic credit and the

appreciation of the real exchange rate. Estimates in Columns VI and VII show these correlations

differ when the economic variables are considered jointly or when the time periods differ.

       We summarize the sources of changes in China’s international reserves in Figure 9. This

figure plots the economic significance of a one-standard-deviation increase in the source variable

on the change in China’s international reserves as a percent of its GDP. The calculation is based

on the regression reported in Table 4, Column VII. The figure reveals the role of China’s trade


                                              13


balance on its international reserves has been remarkably symmetric in the pre- and post-crisis

periods, highlighting the common impact of the financial crisis on China’s current account and

international reserves. Domestic credit also plays much the same role as a source of change in

the pre- and post-crisis periods. The same cannot be said for FDI. Outward FDI played no

significant role prior to the crisis but it has become an important source of change in China’s

international reserves after the crisis.

        To put these results in a broader perspective, it is worth nothing that in 2012, domestic

investment in China reached almost 50 percent of GDP and domestic credit grew to about 200

percent of GDP. In addition, China’s saving rate is probably well above the ‘Golden Rule’ rate.

These considerations suggest a need to rebalance the economy. China’s remarkable fiscal and

monetary stimuli in the early stages of the financial crisis prevented a hard landing during the

period 2008-10. However, such policies do not substitute for a needed restructuring of the

economy, a restructuring that reverses policies depressing Chinese consumption and preventing

faster real appreciation. This rebalancing may entail lower current-account surpluses, faster

growth of the non-traded sector, and reduced hoarding of reserves. Channeling international

reserves into foreign equity and outward FDI may be part of this transformation.

5. CONCLUSION


Panel regressions show that standard variables adopted by the literature, measures capturing

economic performance, economic structure, external wealth, debt, and the exchange rate, are

helpful in “explaining” the current-account behavior of almost 100 countries over the period

1983-2012. The role of the United States in sustaining current-account surpluses elsewhere by

running its own sizeable deficits has obviously diminished after the onset of the financial crisis.

The role of the financial crisis in reducing global imbalances is also evident. Moreover, there is

some evidence that the financial crisis -- and the impact it has had on both economic indicators

and policy actions -- has brought about a structural change in the relationship between current

accounts and these economic factors.

        The rebalancing of current accounts in both China and the United States post-crisis will

likely change the pattern of international reserve hoarding. While the precautionary motive for

hoarding international reserves is consistent with China holding a sizeable international reserve

stockpile, it does not support the optimally of holding reserves in the form of low-yielding U.S.

government debt at levels of 40 to 50 percent of GDP (Jeanne, 2007). Arguably, Dooley et al.

(2003) provided a too optimistic assessment about the sustainability and global desirability, of an

export-led growth strategy propagated by large current-account surpluses and international

reserves hoarding. While this strategy may work well for small emerging markets at the stage of

early takeoffs, its viability is limited for large and fast-growing economies when OECD

countries are experiencing modest growth.

        The export-led growth strategy initially worked for China, leading to a remarkable

growth spell in the 2000s. The numbers were impressive: the U.S. GDP exceeded Chinese GDP

(current US$) by a factor of 17 in 1990, by 8.5 in 2000, and by only 2 in 2012. (World Bank, World

Development Indicators). China’s growing current-account surplus in the early 2000s, at time of full


                                                15


employment in the U.S. and when the size of the U.S. economy exceeded China’s by a hefty margin,

encountered limited opposition and even favorable support from mainstream economists. However, the

costs of this strategy, both to China and to China’s competitors, have become clearer over time.

Intriguingly, the success of Chinese export-led growth strategy probably propagated the

headwinds leading to its possible demise, as there is limited tolerance for its continuation at a

time of falling employment rates and growth rates in the OECD and at a time when China’s GDP

has grown to about half the size of the U.S. economy (in current US$).

              Hoarding reserves may delay the real appreciation associated with successful export-led

growth, but the inevitable appreciation of China’s currency will depress even further the real

return on dollar-denominated assets held as international reserves. A more balanced strategy

calls for diversifying out of liquid U.S. government bonds and into less liquid but (ex-ante)

higher-yielding real foreign assets. That diversification can take place through greater outward

FDI that, in turn, mitigates reserve hoarding. Indeed, as Figure 7 illustrates, this diversification

has already begun.9

Table 1a: Distribution of Sudden-Stops in Current Accounts (% GDP).

This table reports the distribution of current account reduction (% GDP) for countries that
experienced increasing current-account surpluses in the prior three or more years, i.e.
incidence of current-account reversals. ‘Average size (%)’ is the mean reduction in
current accounts (%GDP) of reversal countries. The calculation excludes countries with
population of less than 10 million.

Table 1b: Distribution of Sudden-Stops in Current Accounts (% World GDP).

This table reports the distribution of current account reduction (% World GDP) for
countries that experienced increasing current-account surpluses in the prior three or more
years, i.e. incidence of current-account reversals. ‘Average size (%)’ is the mean
reduction in current accounts (%GDP) of reversal countries. The calculation excludes
countries with population of less than 10 million.
