                                              ABSTRACT

This paper aims at investigating the relationship between employment and GDP in the United States.
We disentangle trend and cyclical employment components by estimating a non-linear Okun’s law
based on a smooth transition error-correction model that simultaneously accounts for long-term relationships
between growth and employment and short-run instability over the business cycle. Our findings based
on out-of-sample conditional forecasts show that, since the exit of the 2008-09 recession, US employment
is on average around 1% below the level implied by the long run output-employment relationship,
meaning that about 1.2 million of the trend employment loss cannot be attributed to the identified cyclical
factors.

1. Introduction

One of the central puzzles following the financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession has been the
sluggish growth in employment during the recovery which began in June 2009, according to the NBER
business cycle dating committee. It is somewhat surprising that analysts have worried about how
employment growth has recently outpaced GDP, according to Okun’s law (Okun, 1962), while others
have bemoaned the slow pace of employment growth. Underpinning these discussions is a view that
there is instability in this relationship between changes in employment and GDP growth.1 From
2008Q4 onward, employment growth was below that predicted by a simple regression of
employment growth on GDP growth over the 1987Q1‐2007Q4 period (Chinn, 2012). This outcome
continued on into the recovery period, although the most recent observations have been above the
regression line. There does seem to be a consistent pattern wherein contractions are associated with
employment growth below that implied by the relationship that obtains over both upswings and
downswings.

Our analysis is related to the issue of whether structural unemployment has risen in the wake of the
Great Recession. This issue is of major importance for policy‐makers, and biased estimation of
natural levels of employment and unemployment can lead to inadequate economic policies. For
example, in terms of monetary policy‐making, over‐estimated unemployment gaps can imply an
underestimation of optimal monetary policy rates through standard Taylor equations. Within this
context, disentangling structural and cyclical employment components is a key question.

In this paper, we estimate a model based on Okun’s law, so that we can specify a decomposition of
employment between trend and cyclical factors, wherein one could potentially interpret the trend
factors as structural in nature. This caveat is necessary because statistically defined trend factors
could be structural in origin, but might also conceivably incorporate factors that are not long term in
nature, such as enhanced unemployment insurance benefits.2

One key problem that arises when dealing with the Okun’s law is that several specifications co‐exist
in the empirical literature3, rendering comparisons difficult. The relationship between output and
employment can be estimated in differences, in gaps or in levels. Here, we implement a non‐linear
Okun’s law for the US that simultaneously accounts for long‐term relationships between output and
employment as well as instability over the business cycle.

Relying on a non‐linear error‐correction specification over the 1950‐2012 period, our main findings
can be summarized as follows. First, if one does not account for the long‐term relationship between
GDP and employment within the Okun’s framework (i.e. if one focuses only on the relationship in
differences), then we obtain unrealistic results by overestimating employment by a substantial

  For instance, CBO (2012) estimates both a long term natural rate of unemployment, and one accounting for
short run factors. The former is driven by demographics and skill attributes, while the latter is determined in
part by extended unemployment insurance benefits. For the sake of completeness, it should also be noticed
that regarding hysteresis effects, part of trend employment will depend on long‐lasting cyclical effects.

amount. Second, a standard error‐correction model is able to reproduce the general evolution of
employment, but underpredicts the decline in employment during the recession, and therefore
overpredicts employment during the recovery. Third, accounting for the US business cycle by using
an innovative non‐linear smooth transition error‐correction model enables a better reproduction of
stylized facts, especially by taking the business cycle into account without integrating any exogenous
information. Fourth, according to our estimated model, we show however that employment is still
on average 1.05% below its potential level after the recession, meaning that the level of employment
is 1.17 million lower than would have been predicted on the basis of the historical co‐movement of
employment and GDP.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the recent literature. Section 3
describes the econometric framework, and Section 4 presents and discusses the results. The last
section concludes the article.



2. A brief review of the recent literature

On the one hand, some papers have concluded that the cyclical component cannot account for the
entire change in employment. In this respect, Stock and Watson (2012) argue that the slow recovery
is mainly explained by a decline in the trend growth of the labor force.

Several explanations have been proposed regarding the effect of factors affecting structural
employment. Estevão and Tsounta (2011) estimate that about 1.75 percentage point of the increase
in unemployment between 2006 and 2010 is due to negative interactions of mismatches between
demand and supply on the labor market with weak housing conditions. In a multi‐country
framework, Chen, Kannan, Loungani and Trehan (2011) show that sectoral shocks specific to the
Great Recession—namely in the construction sector and to a lesser extent in finance—have
contributed to increase the long‐duration unemployment rate. Various other explanations include
the extension of unemployment benefits and high uncertainty about future economic outlook;
however these explanations seem to have less explanatory power (see e.g. Daly et al., 2011).

On the other hand, others argue that there is no evidence of structural impediments on the labor
market, given that modest recoveries are commonplace after balance sheets crisis. According to this
view, the lack of aggregate demand is the main driver of the current high unemployment rate and
consequently the job market will come back to its pre‐recession equilibrium when economic
conditions will improve. Lazear and Spletzer (2012) conclude that “neither industrial nor
demographic shifts nor a mismatch of skills with job vacancies is behind the increased rates of
unemployment”. They recognize that job market mismatches increased during the recession, but
they argue that those mismatches diminished at the same pace just after the recession exit.

In a recent work, Ball, Leigh and Loungani (2013) defend this point of view and argue that there is no
jobless recovery in the US, but only a sluggish economic growth that weights on the labor market. To
support their analysis, they estimate the Okun’s law for a sample of 20 advanced countries and show
that there is a strong and stable relationship between output and employment. Based on empirical
findings, Rothstein (2012) dismisses any structural factors to explain the low labor market activity.



                                                   3
Also Farber (2012) estimates mobility rates and does not find any evidence that low geographic
mobility, due to a deteriorated housing market, explains the weak labor market.

Given this lack of consensus regarding the decomposition of employment between structural and
cyclical factors in the wake of the Great Recession, we propose an econometric model based on the
Okun’s law which enables us to decompose movements in employment into trend and cyclical
components. Indeed, to evaluate the relationship between output and employment, the empirical
Okun’s law turns out to be a valuable tool as pointed out by Ball, Leigh and Loungani (2013) among
others. Knotek (2007) also suggests evidence that Okun’s relationship between changes in the
unemployment rate and output growth can be a useful forecasting tool, in spite of considerable
instability over time and over the business cycle (see also Owyang and Sekhposyan, 2012, on this
point). However, this instability in the relationship is not confirmed by Ball, Leigh and Loungani
(2013), who also reject evidence of non‐linearity based on sub‐samples investigations.



3. An econometric approach to estimating Okun’s law

Arthur Okun documented the evidence for his eponymous law, the empirical relationship between
the unemployment rate and output growth, in 1962. Since then, several versions of Okun’s law have
been developed. Some are expressed in levels, some in deviations from natural levels (gaps), and
some in growth rates. For example, the original Okun’s law was expressed in differences such as:

                                   ∆                  ∆      ,                                     (1)

where ∆LGDP is the change in the logarithm of real GDP and ∆UNR is the change in the
unemployment rate. The parameter β is sometimes referred to the Okun’s coefficient and is
expected to be negative, reflecting thus the negative correlation between changes in unemployment
and output growth. The ratio –α/β is an estimate of the rate of output growth necessary to stabilize
the unemployment rate.

Alternatively, the gap version of the Okun’s law linearly relates the unemployment rate with the
output gap, as defined by the difference between the observed GDP and its potential value, such as:
                                                                    ∗
                                                                        ,                          (2)

where LGDP* is the potential of log‐GDP, which has to be estimated by a given econometric method,
and (LGDP ‐ LGDP*) is the output gap. The parameter δ can be seen as the unemployment rate
consistent with full employment. Alternatively, the natural unemployment rate U* can be estimated
exogenously before entering into equation (2). In that case, the left‐hand side of equation (2)
becomes (UNR – UNR*), referred to as the unemployment gap, and δ is set to zero. This gap
specification is generally easier to estimate than the differences specification as variables involved
are smoother. But the main drawback is that potential GDP and natural unemployment rate are
unobserved values and have to be previously estimated using econometric methods, such as filtering




                                                  4
techniques (Hodrick‐Prescott or band‐pass filters). As there is no consensus on the way to estimate
such quantities,4 measurement error exacerbates the imprecision in estimating the relationship.

Departures from those original versions of Okun’s law given by equations (1) and (2) are motivated
by two observations. First, those equations do not include any long‐term effect between the two
variables as the low‐frequency information is eliminated by the differentiation operation or by
subtracting potential log‐GDP. Yet, it is generally observed in econometrics that accounting for long‐
term effects can lead to fruitful results. In this respect, we decide to focus on the long‐term
relationship between employment and output in the framework of error‐correction models, as both
log‐GDP and log‐employment series are obviously integrated. We show in the following section how
this choice is validated by the results. Using employment data instead of unemployment data also
presents the great advantage of neglecting the participation rate that can lead to spurious
measurement effect. Indeed, it has been shown (Stock and Watson, 2012) that the participation rate
decreased from 66% in 2007 to less than 64% in 2012, implying thus a lower unemployment rate for
a given level of unemployment in the years 2011‐12.

Second, some authors have detected evidence of instability in Okun’s law over time. Using standard
rolling regressions, and allowing the estimation of the relationship over many different samples,
Knotek (2007) underlines a great variation overtime of the estimated parameters of the Okun’s law.
In particular, he shows that the Okun’s law is sensitive to the state of the business cycle. Other
authors have also investigated the non‐linear dynamics of the Okun’s law, including Lee (2000), Viren
(2001) and Harris and Silverstone (2001). According to Harris and Silverstone (2001), four factors may
explain the presence of non‐linearity in the Okun’s relationship: capacity constraints, signal
extraction, costly adjustment and downward nominal wage rigidity. In addition, McCarthy, Potter
and Ng (2012) underline that the Okun’s law has not been a consistently reliable tool to forecast the
amplitude of decline in the unemployment rate during the last three recessions.

In this paper, our aim is to account simultaneously for those two stylized facts described above,
namely long‐term and instability effects. In this respect, we consider a non‐linear, smooth transition
error correction model (STECM) whose parameters are allowed to evolve through time. More
specifically, we retain the following non‐linear specification with two regimes:



    ∆                  ∆                  ∆               ∆
                   ∆                  ∆               ∆
                                                              , ,     ,                                    (3)



where LEMP denotes private non‐farm payroll employment in logarithm, LGDP the logarithm of GDP,
t is a Gaussian white noise process, G denotes the transition function, γ is the slope parameter that
determines the smoothness of the transition from one regime to the other, c is the threshold
parameter, and Z denotes the transition variable.

4
 In particular, Lee (2000) has shown that the estimated Okun’s relationship is sensitive to the method used for
extracting the cyclical component.


                                                      5
This non‐linear ECM takes the long‐term relationship into account, as well as two regimes for the
short‐term relationship—the long run relationship remaining invariant to the regime. The economy
can evolve in two states, but the transition between those two regimes is smooth: the two regimes
are associated with large and small values of the transition variable relative to the threshold value,
the switches from one regime to the other being governed by the transition variable Z (here, lagged
GDP growth). The smooth transition function, bounded between 0 and 1, takes a logistic form given
by:5

                                           , ,        1                                                     (4)



It is noteworthy that when the function G(.) is equal to zero, it turns out that the non‐linear STECM
equation collapses to a standard linear ECM.

Further, inspection of equation (3) highlights the fact that we impose the strong assumption that the
long‐run relationship between employment and GDP is constant over the 1950‐2012 period (the
employment predicted by this long run relationship is the trend employment which we refer to). We
attempt to relax this assumption in robustness tests.



4. Results for the US economy

In this section we implement the previous non‐linear ECM given by equations (3) and (4) until the
beginning of the Great Recession, then we use the estimated model in an out‐of‐sample conditional
forecasting approach in order to assess losses in US trend employment.



4.1 In‐sample analysis

We estimate the model given by equations (3) and (4) over the period 1950Q1 – 2007Q4 for US data
of log‐GDP and log‐employment as presented in Figure 1.6 This graph clearly highlights a long‐term
co‐movement between both variables as well as evidence of non‐stationarity, suggesting thus a
cointegrated system. Formally, the implementation of Johansen’s cointegration test leads to
conclude to the existence of a cointegrating relationship between LEMP and LGDP.7




5
    See Teräsvirta and Anderson (1992).
6
 As previously mentioned, we do not estimate the equations over our entire sample, as we reserve the
2008Q1‐2012Q3 period for out‐of‐sample forecasts.
7
  We adopt a specification with one lag of first differences for the Johansen’s test. The non‐stationarity of
employment and GDP series is also confirmed by the usual unit root tests (results are available upon request to
the authors).

data used to estimate the models are seasonally adjusted, expressed in billions of chained 2005 dollars. Employment series

figures.




First, we estimate the long‐term linear relationship through ordinary least‐squares over the period
1950Q1 – 2007Q4.8 The residuals from the long‐term equation are obtained from the following
estimated relationship:

                   5.8501      0.6155              ,

and are presented in Figure 2.


8
  As a robustness check, we have also estimated the cointegrating relationship using the Dynamic OLS (DOLS)
procedure, leading to very similar results. In addition, to address the issue of stability of our long‐run
relationship—a question that may be important as regards to the IT productivity shock initiated in the mid‐
1990s—we have applied various usual break tests. Our results were not convincing, a finding that is not
surprising given that such tests are not suitable when dealing with productivity shocks. Indeed, as pointed out
by Benati (2007) and Turner and Boulhol (2008) among others, those shocks are generally gradual. We have
thus followed an alternative way by introducing the total factor productivity in the long‐run relationship. Our
results (available upon request to the authors) are very similar to those presented here.


                                                            7
Once the estimation of this long‐term relationship is realized, we integrate the lagged residuals into
our main non‐linear equation (3). To account for the business cycle in the short‐term relationship, we
select as transition variable the average GDP growth over 2 quarters, lagged by 2 quarters, i.e.:9

                                          0.5      ∆              ∆

                                                   GDP

The estimation of the non‐linear specification follows the methodology proposed by Teräsvirta
(1994). We start by testing for the null hypothesis of linearity using the test introduced by Luukkonen
et al. (1988). Once the null of linearity has been rejected, we select the specification of the transition
function using the test sequence presented in Teräsvirta (1994).10 We then estimate the non‐linear
ECM, leading to the results presented in Table 1.11




9
  Note that we have also tried other transition variables, such as changes in the employment rate and other
lags for GDP growth rate. Using the average GDP growth over 2 quarters leads to the strongest rejection of the
null of linearity, justifying our choice from an econometric viewpoint.
10
     We refer for example to van Dijk, Teräsvirta and Franses (2002) for details on smooth transition models.
11
  Note that the estimated model has successfully passed the usual misspecification tests: test of no residual
autocorrelation (Teräsvirta, 1998), LM‐test for no‐remaining non‐linearity (Eitrheim and Teräsvirta, 1996) and
ARCH‐LM test.

                              Regime 2 coefficient to the corresponding Regime 1 coefficient.


The estimated value ̂ of the threshold c is close to zero, delimiting thus periods of expansion and
periods of recession, as shown by the transition function displayed in Figure 3. The transition
function clearly highlights the existence of two regimes in the short‐term relationship between
employment and output, which are strongly related to the business cycle phases, though slightly
lagged. There is one regular regime that occurs most of the time, with an unconditional probability of
89%, while the second regime is more exceptional and appears only 11% of the time (i.e. when the
transition function exceeds the natural threshold of 0.50).

It is striking to observe that the second regime always begin at the end of recessions, generally one
quarter before the end. The average duration of this recession regime is slightly greater than 3
quarters. In fact during this specific period of time, the persistence of the growth rate of employment
tends to increase, as the first‐order autoregressive estimate jumps to 0.589 from 0.215 in the regular
regime. In addition, the contemporaneous elasticity dips from 0.644 to 0.308 and the lagged

                                                             9
elasticity dies out. Thus, in this second regime, the dependence of employment growth on output
growth is reduced. One explanation may be due to the fact that GDP growth tends to strongly
bounce‐back after recessions before returning to a “normal” expansion regime. Evidence of such
behavior is documented in the papers of Bec, Bouabdallah and Ferrara (2011) and Morley and Piger
(2012). Yet, during this bounce‐back period, employment growth does not follow at the same pace,
leading to a reduction in the dependence on output growth and an increase in its persistence.

It is notable that the point estimate for the coefficient on the lagged error term is equal to ‐ 0.0123 (=
0.0070 ‐ 0.0193) in the second regime. In other words, the extent of disequilibria has minor impact
on the pace of net job growth when GDP growth is negative.

In order to compare those latter results stemming from our model, we need to consider benchmark
models. To this end, we also estimate over the same period (i) a standard ECM given by equation (3)
with function G(.) being equal to zero and (ii) an Okun’s law expressed in differences as given by
equation (1). Series in log‐differences over one quarter are presented in Figure 4.

As regards the specification of the linear ECM, we impose for short‐term dynamics a similar structure
to the one given in equation (3). Results of parameter estimation are given in Table 2.

It is noteworthy that those estimates are rather close to the sum of the corresponding parameters in
Regime 1 and Regime 2 (Table 1). The lagged log‐difference GDP is not significant at usual levels.


The estimated equation in differences is given by:

∆          0.0003      0.5400     ∆          .

The estimated parameter associated with GDP is significant at the 5% level, but residuals appear to
be serially correlated according to usual whitening tests. In order to improve the goodness‐of‐fit, we
include short‐term dynamics into the regression model. The estimated model is the following:

 ∆            0.0012     0.3846       ∆             0.5729       ∆              .

All estimated parameters are significant at the 5% level, and we do not reject the null of no‐
autocorrelation within residuals.



4.2 Conditional forecasts

We now compare the previous models on the basis of conditional dynamic forecasts of the variable
LEMP over the period 2008Q1 – 2012Q3. This means that we forecast employment based on the
knowledge of the ex post path for LGDP. Those conditional forecasts are dynamic in the sense that,
for each step, we use the previously forecasted employment value instead of the observed value.

First we compare the three linear models, namely the model in differences, the model in differences
with dynamics and the ECM. Conditional forecasts are presented in Figure 5.

Both models in differences largely miss the drop in employment during the Great Recession. In
particular, conditional forecasts stemming from the Okun’s law in differences exceed the pre‐
recession values of employment by end of 2010. Those results are clearly at variance with reality and
point to a failure in the employment version of Okun’s law. If we integrate dynamics in the equation
in differences, conditional forecasts are shifted downwards due to the presence of lagged differences
of employment. We observe that at the end of 2012, conditional forecasts are close to observed
values of employment, meaning that, at this date, the level of employment would be consistent with



                                                        11
its historical equilibrium. Yet, this hardly makes this model convincing as an explanation for
employment dynamics during the Great Recession.

When taking the long‐term relationship into account, conditional forecasts partly reproduce the dip
in employment due to the large decrease in GDP level during this specific period of time. However,
there is still a wide gap between observed values of employment and conditional forecasts stemming
from the ECM. In addition, this gap tends to persist after the end of recession.

Note: Conditional forecasts stemming from the model in differences (red), the model in differences with dynamics (dotted

Let us now turn to the comparison of the ECM and the non‐linear ECM based on those conditional
forecasts. Figure 6 presents the observed employment (dark line), as well conditional forecasts from
a standard (linear) ECM (blue line) and from the non‐linear ECM (green line).

Both ECMs are able to reproduce the main movements in employment during and after the
recession. However, there is a persistent gap between the observed employment (dark line) and the
conditional forecasts from both models (blue and green lines), meaning that the employment is
currently well below what it should be according to the models. When comparing both ECMs, taking
the non‐linear business cycle into account through the non‐linear ECM (green line) leads to an
important reduction in the gap. The contribution of the non‐linear cycle to the employment is quite
high (the average difference between the blue and the green lines is around 2.6 % in 2010) but tends
to diminish (the green line slightly tends to the blue line), the average difference being only of 1.6%
during the first three quarters of 2012.

Note: Conditional forecasts stemming from the linear ECM (blue) and the non‐linear ECM (green). Observed values are

Our findings lead us to conclude that there has been indeed an effect of the Great Recession on the
long‐term private employment. Specifically, on average, since the exit of the recession (2009Q2), we
find that employment is 1.05 % below predicted levels (according to the non‐linear ECM), meaning
that about 1.17 million of jobs have been lost due to non‐cyclical reasons. This interpretation is in
line with the recent literature on this topic, as pointed out for example by Chen, Kannan, Loungani
and Trehan (2011) or Stock and Watson (2012).



4.3 Robustness checks

As robustness checks, we compute confidence intervals for conditional forecasts and evaluate the
sensitivity of our results to alternative measures of employment.

              Confidence intervals

               To assess the quality of conditional forecasts, we compute confidence intervals based on a
               re‐sampling bootstrap approach. As previously mentioned, residuals ̂ stemming from
               equation (3) over the sample 1950‐2007 are proved to be non‐correlated for low lags. In
               addition, they are not far from being normally distributed, according to the Jarque‐Bera test
               of Normality at the 1% level12. Thus, we choose to implement a bootstrap resampling
               approach based on those residuals in order to estimate confidence bounds around
               conditional forecasts ∆         over the period from 2008Q1 to 2012Q3. As new residuals
               based on the difference between observed and conditional forecasts become available, we

12
     The null of Normality is accepted at the 1% level but rejected at the 5% level (p‐value of 0.013).


                                                          13
         integrate them in the re‐sampling approach. The number of bootstrap replications is fixed at
         B=1000. Figure 7 displays the 95% confidence interval.

Note: Conditional forecasts stemming from the non‐linear ECM (green) with corresponding bootstrapped 95% confidence
interval. Observed values are presented in the dark line.




         This confidence interval is quite narrow, due to the low standard deviation of residuals
         (equal to 0.0029), and illustrates the reliability of our forecasts.13 Starting from the exit of
         recession, the realized employment stays clearly below the lower bound of the confidence
         interval until the end of the sample.

        Robustness to the employment series

         We now assess the sensitivity of our findings to the choice of the employment series. To this
         end, we focus on total non‐farm payroll employment (LEMPTOT) instead of only private non‐
         farm payroll employment. First, we estimate the long‐term linear relationship over the
         period 1950Q1 – 2007Q4, leading to the following residual series:

                                        u        LEMPTOT                 5.9296           0.6273            LGDP .


13
  Note that we have assumed that parameters in equation (3) are known. Obviously, as in any other empirical
applications, parameters need to be estimated, which leads to an additional uncertainty in predicted values. To
our knowledge, there is no available clear procedure when dealing with a STECM, in spite of papers dealing
with other types of non‐linear models (see for example Li, 2011, or Bec, Bouabdallah and Ferrara, 2013, in the
case of univariate threshold models).


                                                                              14
         As shown, the long‐run elasticity is very close to the one estimated with private employment
         (0.6155). We then estimate a linear ECM over the same period, as well as the STECM given
         by equation (3).14 Parameter estimates of both models are given in Table 3; they are
         consistent with those obtained when dealing with private employment. The speed of
         adjustment to the long‐term target is lower here and even non‐significant, reflecting a less
         cyclical pattern. The transition function also describes very precisely the business cycles,
         though the probabilities do not reach one in this framework. This likely reflects the fact that
         the public employment is counter‐cyclical during these specific periods (see Figure 8).

                              Regime 2 coefficient to the corresponding Regime 1 coefficient.


14
  Note that the STECM is estimated without any lagged GDP given that the null of linearity was more strongly
rejected when not including lagged GDP. As for the estimation with private employment, the lagged GDP is also
non‐significant in the linear specification.


                                                            15
           Based on those estimates, we compute dynamic conditional forecasts for both linear and
           non‐linear ECMs. Results are presented in Figure 9. Confirming our intuition, it is interesting
           to note that total employment is much less sensitive to the business cycle. This result is
           expected because total employment also includes government employment which tends to
           be less pro‐cyclical. Average losses of employment since the exit of the recession amount to
           3.9% with the ECM and 1.8% with the STECM. Based on this latter model, this corresponds
           respectively to an average loss of 2.4 millions of jobs. If we assume that our estimation of the
           private employment loss at around 1 million is correct, thus it means that the long‐run loss of
           government jobs is likely to be close to 1.4 million on average since the exit of the recession.

5. Conclusion

Addressing the issue of whether structural unemployment has risen in the wake of the Great
Recession is of crucial importance for policy makers. Within this context, this paper aims at
investigating the links between employment and GDP in the United States. From a statistical
perspective, we disentangle trend and cyclical components in US employment based on an
innovative non‐linear error correction model that accounts for both a (constant) long‐term
relationships between output and employment and short‐run non‐linearities in dynamics over the
business cycle. Based on this estimated non‐linear Okun’s law, a conditional forecasting approach
shows that the level of US private sector employment is on average around 1% below the level
implied by the long run output‐employment relationship, meaning that around 1.2 million of the
trend employment loss cannot be attributed to the identified cyclical factors.15 To the extent that
trend employment depends on structural factors, eliminating this shortfall will depend upon the

     The misprediction incorporates both estimated trend factors and prediction error due to model uncertainty.

implementation of measures that improve the workings of the labor market, as well as other
government policies that raise the natural rate of unemployment.
