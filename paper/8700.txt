                                               ABSTRACT


        The debate over including asset prices in the construction of an inflation statistic has attracted
renewed attention in recent years. Virtually all of this (and earlier) work on incorporating asset prices into
an aggregate price statistic has been motivated by a presumed, but unidentified transmission mechanism
through which asset prices are leading indicators of inflation at the retail level. In this paper, we take an
alternative, longer-term perspective on the issue and argue that the exclusion of asset prices introduces
an “excluded goods bias” in the computation of the inflation statistic that is of interest to the monetary
authority.
        We implement this idea using a relatively modern statistical technique, a dynamic factor index.
This statistical algorithm allows us to see through the excessively “noisy” asset price data that have
frustrated earlier researchers who have attempted to integrate these prices into an aggregate measure. We
find that the failure to include asset prices in the aggregate price statistic has introduced a downward bias
in the U.S. Consumer Price Index on the order of magnitude of roughly ¼ percentage point annually. Of
the three broad assets categories considered here -- equities, bonds, and houses -- we find that the failure
to include housing prices resulted in the largest potential measurement error. This conclusion is also
supported by a cursory look at some cross-country evidence.

1. INTRODUCTION

           The debate on the appropriateness of considering asset price movements in the

conduct of monetary policy has attracted much attention in recent years. Some have

suggested that the failure of the Bank of Japan to consider the price behavior of their

asset markets in the 1980s played a contributing role to the economic malaise suffered in

that country during the past ten years.1 More recently in the U.S., rapidly rising prices of

equities and other assets in the late 1990s have heightened concern within the Federal

Reserve System that, despite the relatively modest growth in conventional retail price

measures, inflation prospects had intensified.

           Much of the earlier work that has attempted to introduce asset prices into an

aggregate price index has been motivated by a presumed but unspecified transmission

mechanism through which asset prices are leading indicators of a future inflation at the

retail level. However, we find the theoretical and empirical support for this approach

lacking. In this paper, we consider an alternative, longer-term perspective on the

inclusion of assets in an aggregate price statistic.

           Our approach combines a relatively old theoretical concept with a modern

statistical technique. We consider the case of asset prices, or more precisely the current

nominal cost of a claim to a future unit of consumption, as a case of “excluded goods

bias”. Such biases are well known in the literature on price statistic construction and can

arise whenever the price index fails to account for a systematic relative price change that

is of relevance to the economic agent. In so doing, we redefine the object of the central

bank from a current cost of living index, to a price index appropriate for the deflation of

nominal permanent income.

       We implement this insight with a weighting technique that identifies a common

trend among varied component price data, a dynamic factor approach. This statistical

algorithm allows us to see through the excessively “noisy” data that has frustrated earlier

researchers who have attempted to introduce assets into a price aggregate, including those

weighted solely on expenditure criteria.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin in section two with

a review of the most influential literature on the inclusion of asset prices in aggregate

price measurement. In section three, we provide a simple model of excluded goods bias

and show how the standard atemporal microeconomic derivation of a cost-of-living index

can be extended to an intertemporal setting. Section four presents a series of alternative

aggregation techniques for constructing inflation measures from a combination of prices

of current consumption goods and the prices of assets, including housing, equities and

bonds. We then proceed to a presentation of the dynamic factor approach that is the focal

point of our empirical investigations. In section five, we apply this approach to US data,

and then extend the analysis to a set of international data for eleven other countries.

Section six concludes.

II. ASSET PRICES AND INFLATION MEASUREMENT: A REVIEW

       Early work on the inclusion of asset prices in measures of inflation can be traced

to Irving Fisher (1911). Fisher’s intent appears to have been a desire to find a broad

transactions price metric to guide the monetary authority in establishing the price of gold.

That is, he was considering an index number that best reflected the price level as implied


                                              2
by the equation of exchange. But Fisher was always very clear that different problems

necessitated different indexes (broadly differentiated by the comparative places or

comparative times under investigation.) The appropriateness of any index number can

only be evaluated in the context to which it is to be applied.

        The idea that asset prices should receive some consideration in the construction of

aggregate price movements remained a largely dormant issue until Armen Alchian and

Benjamin Klein, published their paper “On A Correct Measurement of Inflation" in 1973.

In this work, Alchian and Klein argued that monetary policy should be concerned with

broader measures of prices than those constructed from the income and product accounts

deflators or standard expenditure-weighted indices.

        What is the Alchian and Klein argument, and how should we approach the

problem of asset prices and inflation? The following comparison provides an intuitive

explanation of their view, as we interpret it. In the abstract theoretical economies of

graduate microeconomics classes—the economy of Arrow and Debreu—we conceive of

a world in which there is a full set of state-contingent claims -- that is, assets that

represent commitments to deliver and purchase goods and services at all future dates

under all possible circumstances. We can think of these claims as securities, and before

anything starts in our hypothetical world, there is trading that determines all of their

prices. Since all possible futures are considered, everything is settled once and for all in

the initial period. Let us further propose that all transactions occur in money, and so

there are nominal prices (it is a bit complicated to introduce money formally under these




                                               3
sorts of circumstances, but we will not dwell on what is basically a technical problem of

economic theory.)2

        Before time begins, we have trading that establishes the current money prices for

the entire set of all possible goods and services to be delivered today and at all dates in

the future. Without changing anything, imagine the same world, but with more money in

it, and compare the two worlds. In the second world nominal prices will be higher, and so

a given amount of money will purchase less of everything -- fewer claims to goods and

services at all dates and in all states of the world. A comparison of prices in these two

worlds would be a measure of the inflation implicit in increasing the quantity of money.

        Bringing this all back to Alchian and Klein, they propose that we focus on

measuring the purchasing power of money generally, rather than on prices of current

consumption specifically. Instead of looking at the cost of a particular (carefully

designed) basket of goods and services meant to measure current consumption, as is

typically done by most consumer price indices, they suggest focusing on the current cost

of expected life-time consumption.

        There are various uses for such an index, like the deflation of nominal

compensation, which presumably requires us to measure not only the price of current

expenditures but also prices on current claims to expenditures in a future date (a utility-

based saving concept). Further, as we will discuss in section four, the exclusion of prices

for current claims on future expenditure may distort the interpretation of a current

expenditure price index by a monetary authority that hopes to avoid imbalances between



2
  The simplest way to put in money is to assume that money is distributed by a government that then
requires money payments on some future date. For example, there could be taxes that must be paid in
government-supplied money.

the growth rate of the money stock and the trend growth in expected output—monetary

inflation.

        Over the past decade or so, the Alchian and Klein's argument has been critically

examined by academic and central bank economists. A theoretical basis for the claim that

asset prices can be used to help measure inflation has been provided by Robert Pollack

(1989), while Shibuya (1992), Wynne (1994), Shiratsuka (1999), Flemming (1999) and

Goodhart and Hofmann (2000) have done empirical work.

        This work has been of two types. In the first, researchers have sought to

operationalize Pollack's concept of an intertemporal cost-of-living index (ICOLI), and

measure the changes in the cost of claims, at current prices, to a consumption basket that

yields a fixed level of lifetime utility. The second strand of the literature examines

whether the current price of assets can help predict future movements in the more

conventional indices.

III. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF EXCLUDED GOODS BIAS

        For clarity in exposition, it is useful to begin with the following simple one-period

static model with two goods. Assume that utility is Cobb-Douglas, and so

                                       U # C1! C 2(1"! ) .                    (1)

The budget constraint is

                                       P1C1 $ P2 C 2 # W .                    (2)

Utility maximization implies that

                                       P1 * ! ' C 2
                                         #(       %    .                      (3)
                                       P2 ) 1 " ! & C1

We can show that the constant-utility price index is also Cobb-Douglas, and so




                                               5
                                        P # P1! P2(1"! )                                         (4)

These are equilibrium prices when C1 and C 2 are equilibrium quantities.

       Assume that C1 and C 2 are produced from labor inputs, and that

                                        C2
                                           # +.                                                  (5)
                                        C1

We are interested in studying the consequences of + to + , . It is simple to show that

following the change in + , the new prices are related to the old prices as

                                       * P1, ' + , * P2, '
                                       (( %% # (( %% .                                           (6)
                                        ) P1 & + ) P2 &

Now we wish to measure the change in the aggregate price index, which will be

                                                                              !             (1"! )
                                        P , ( P1,)! ( P2, ) (1"! ) * P1, '        * P2, '
                                           #                      # (( %%         (( %%              (7)
                                        P       P1! P2(1"! )         ) P1 &        ) P2 &

Using (6) we obtain,

                                                              (1"! )
                                        P , * P1, '* + '
                                           # ( %( %                    .                         (8)
                                        P () P1 %&() + , %&

       Looking at this equation we see that if we are trying to measure the change in the

properly constructed constant-utility aggregate price index, and instead we measure only

                                                                                                     (1"! )
                                                                          *+'
the change in P1 , then we will have a price index biased by a factor of (( %%                                . This is
                                                                          ) +,&

the excluded goods bias.

       We could include a change in nominal income, W as well. This would be an

increase to

                                       W , # -W .                                                (9)

Such a change is neutral, in the sense that both prices rise by a factor of - .

                                                6
       To see how this works, we introduce this common price change into the problem.

Assume that prices after the influx of money and the relative price change are

                                            P1* # -P1,                                                    (10)

                                            P2* # -P2,                                                    (11)

This formulation allows us to immediately disentangle the relative price change from the

one that comes from the increase in nominal wages. It is important to keep in mind that

the aggregate price index will not change by - as + . + , . But without a relative price

change, then we expect to measure inflation as - .

       We now wish to examine the price index

                                     !             (1"! )                !                 (1"! )
                       P * * P1* '       * P2* '               * -P, '       * -P2, '
                          #( %           (( %%              # (( 1 %%        ((     %%                    (12)
                       P () P1 %&         ) P2 &               ) P1 &         ) P2 &

Which gives us

                                                                              (1"! )

but ignoring the second good gives us - .

       Our conclusion is that the difficulty arises from a change in                                   , which creates a
                                                                                                    C1

relative price change and a substitution effect. This will be more important both the

between the two goods, ! .

         Of course, the intertemporal problem is exactly the same. To formulate it, we

would simply assume that people live two periods, working and consuming when young

and only consuming when old. The young work and are paid a nominal wage, W for

their one unit of inelastically supplied labor. They take their money and purchase both

goods for current consumption and claims on goods for future consumption. That is, they

expend all of their monetary income when they are young. 3

         A change in the price of future consumption relative (P2) to the price of current

consumption (P1) is caused by a change in output in one period relative to that in the

other. This is + , the ratio of C2 to C1. We note that in the context of this very simple

intertermporal model, this price ratio P2/ P1 is the real interest rate, and that changes in the

real interest rate come from technological changes that change the growth rate of output

ρ.

         In addition to changes in relative prices, we can also introduce a form of “pure”

inflation that arises from increasing the monetary wage W that is paid to workers when

they are young. In this very simple formulation, we can think of increases in nominal

wages as analogous to increases in the money stock. Aggregate inflation enters through

the parameter γ.

         Looking back at equation (13) we can see the proper change in the (utility-based)

price index depends on several things. First, there is the change the current price of

  The Cobb-Douglas utility function is analogous to a log-linear utility function with a discount factor
equal to (1-α)/α. It is easier algebraically to retain the Cobb-Douglas form, and so we continue with it.

current consumption. But the index also depends on the change in the current price of

next period’s consumption. In this simple formulation, the dependence on the prices of

claims to future goods and services shows up as a change in the growth rate of

consumption. Ignoring the second term, the ratio of ρ to ρ’ creates a bias in the measure

of inflation.

        How big a problem do we face if we ignore current claims on future

consumption? First, notice that there is a bias only when the growth rate of consumption

changes. This is what creates the relative price movement that precipitates the excluded

goods bias. But even so, the problem could conceivably be large.       If we think of this

two-period model as covering a lifetime, then the time periods must be rather long. For

this example, we take a period to be 35 years. If consumption grows at 2% per year,

approximately the growth rate of per capital U.S. GDP, then + is a number like

+ # 1.02 35 # 2 . Consider a case in which this rises by one-half on one percentage point to

+ ' # 1.02535 # 2.37 .

        Next, we need an estimate of ! , the importance of the first period consumption in

utility. Assuming an annual discount factor of 0.98 and two 35-year periods, the

approximate weight on consumption in the first 35-year period is approximately one-

third. This means that our measure of inflation, at the time of the permanent change in

economic growth, is off by a factor of 0.893, and so inflation is overestimated by 10.7%.

Granted that this is for a 35 year period, but the potential error seems very large.

IV-1. INTEGRATING ASSET PRICES INTO A PRICE INDEX: EXPENDITURE
WEIGHT APPROACHES

         The identification of a potentially large excluded goods bias in a price index

suggests an obvious solution—include the omitted prices in the aggregate price

calculation. Unfortunately, data on the price of contingent claims to future consumption

do not usually exist. This has prevented the exact implementation of the original Alchian

and Klein proposal. In more recent work, both Pollack and Shibuya demonstrate how,

under straightforward circumstances, an intertemporal cost of living index (ICOLI) can

be constructed by using the current prices of existing assets (which are claims on future

consumption) in place of the theoretically appropriate Arrow-Debreu contingent claims

prices that are not extant in the real world.

         As Shibuya notes, the construction of an ICOLI will necessarily put the bulk of

the weight in the price index on future consumption, and thus on asset prices. The reason

for this is very straightforward. The intertemporal index is constructed from the present

value of the sum of future consumption. Ignoring changes in consumption over time, and

assuming that the rate of time discount is about 3%, current consumption is only one part

in about 33, and so the weight on asset prices (claims to future consumption) will be

97%, while that on current consumption prices will be 3%.4

         In Shiratsuka's application to the case of Japan, the weight of 97% on asset prices

implies that there was both much higher inflation in Japan in the 1980s, and much

worse deflation in the 1990s, than shown in the standard measures of consumer prices—

implicitly suggesting that monetary policy was initially too expansionary, and later




4
 The rule-of-thumb for such a calculation is that the weight on the index of current consumption prices will
be approximately equal to the rate of time discount.

                                                    10
too contractionary. But the high weight accorded asset prices, and the implicit policy

prescription, results in the recommendation that policymakers target asset prices.

        But there are shortcomings to this interpretation of Alchian and Klein. Bond

markets facilitate the transformation of current money into future money, and so if

monetary policy stabilizes the price of current consumption over time, it makes

intertemporal exchange of goods predictable as well. A policy that controls the time path

of the terms of trade between current money and current consumption, together with

nominal bonds that allow the transformation of current into future money, stabilizes the

price of lifetime consumption, and so no further information is needed.

        Indeed, there is a fundamental confusion that pervades much of the discussion of

the inclusion asset prices in measures of inflation that concerns that idea that asset price

movements somehow give information about future inflation. The claim is that an asset

price will increase in anticipation of future goods price increases. If this occurs while

current goods prices are stable, then a central bank that only targets current consumption

flow prices will fail to respond adequately to stabilize future goods prices.

        This is the argument that has led both Shiratsuka and Goodhart and Hofmann

focus attention on the ability of current prices of assets, including residential property and

share prices, to forecast movements in conventionally measured consumer price inflation

several years ahead.

        While there is empirical evidence to suggest that increases in asset prices may

help foretell a future inflation at the retail level (albeit marginally), the theoretical

mechanism for such a finding must be an indirect one whereby increases in aggregate

demand outstrip those of aggregate supply. It is not the case that increases in equity




                                               11
prices themselves are a sign that market participants have increased their forecast of

future consumer price inflation.

         To see why this is so, carefully consider the determinants of asset prices. In the

absence of bubbles, the price of assets is the present discounted value of the stream of

goods or services that come from owning it—the dividend or earnings flow. If we

measure the future value of the dividend in current dollars, then we would discount the

stream using the real rate of interest. If prices were measured in future dollars, then we

would need to use the nominal rate of interest. But in either case, changes in the path of

future inflation leave the level of the asset price unaffected, and so fluctuations in asset

prices must come from other sources. Surely, increases in the current price of an asset can

affect inflation through the wealth effect on consumption, but this macroeconomic

mechanism has nothing to do with asset prices being signals of future inflation.5

         Alternatively, our interpretation of Alchian and Klein is based on a related article

by Tullock (1979) who describes the case of an excluded goods bias in the event of a

hypothetical “diamond rush” where the cost of living appears to be exceptionally high

when judged by the rapid rise in the price of current consumables. And in fact, if we are

considering the question, “what are the costs associated with current consumption

compared to the pre-rush era?,” then this narrowly defined market basket of price ratios

may be the appropriate statistic.

         However, if we are concerned with the question, “What is the real wage of

diamond-mine laborers?,” this market basket may be especially misleading. Indeed,

judged only by the current cost of living, the real wage of labor may easily appear to be


5
  Flemming’s (1999) suggestion that the central bank's inflation target be based, in part, on the fluctuation
in the nominal price of an index bond follows directly from such reasoning.

                                                      12
falling dramatically as the demand for current consumables surges due to their higher

demand. The missing price, in this example, is the exceptionally low priced un-mined

diamond assets which, once included in the appropriately constructed price index, reveal

the rapidly rising real wage of labor that gave rise to the diamond rush to begin with.


IV-2. INTEGRATING ASSET PRICES INTO A PRICE INDEX: A SIGNAL-
EXTRACTION APPROACH

        Returning to the issue of how we might employ asset prices in the measurement

of current inflation and the purchasing power of money, consider the simplest possible

case of what we will call pure inflation. Pure inflation is the case in which there

are no relative price changes -- it is as if we were to wake up one morning and

suddenly all nominal quantities have been multiplied by some factor. If all prices

change proportionally, then measurement of inflation is trivial, as we can look at

any individual price and it is a perfect indicator of what happened to all prices.

That is to say, we could compute the amount of inflation by looking at the price of

houses, equities, restaurant meals, or chewing gum. It simply would not matter.6

        In fact, measuring the change in the purchasing power of money would simply

require that we measure the change in a single price. Unfortunately, real life is not quite

so simple, and inflation tends to come with relative price changes as well. These changes

in the nominal price of one product relative to another are caused either by changes in

technology or in tastes, and they are entirely real. In measuring inflation, the goal is to get

rid of these by finding a set of prices in which they cancel out.




6
  The possible existence of nominal bonds complicates this example somewhat, and so we will ignore them
for the time being.

                                                  13
       We can appeal to earlier work of Bryan and Cecchetti (1993) for a simple

framework to understand the problem. Using their simple intuition, we can think of the

inflation in the price of all goods, services and assets today as having

a common and idiosyncratic component. In symbols:

                                        / it # / t $ xit                      (15)

where i indexes the set of goods, services or assets, and t is time. We can think of an

inflation index as a weighting together of these individual inflation measures. If we

have a set of weights, this would be:

                                        P!t # 0 wit / it                       (16)
                                                   i



where the weights are the wit and can change over time, but have the property that

at any given time they sum to one. That is

                                        0w
                                         i
                                              it       # 11t                   (17)


Using this fact, we can now rewrite the price index

                                        P!t # / t $ 0 wit xit                  (18)
                                                          i


       Since our goal is the measurement of the common trend in all prices, we are

trying to find a set of goods, services and assets where the (weighted) relative changes

cancel out. These relative changes will cancel out, however, only in the case where there

exists a complete set of prices. In the case of the excluded goods bias discussed earlier,

such that relative price adjustments produce a non-zero sum, this measurement error will

be imbedded in the common inflation signal ( / t ) in equation (18). For the purposes of

this investigation, this relative price change is created by the intertemporal substitution

between current and future consumption induced by a change in the real interest rate.


                                                   14
During periods when the real interest rate has declined, real current prices of current

consumption fall relative to real current claims on future consumption, causing any

aggregate price measure (regardless of weighting technology) based only on current

consumption prices to be too high.

        Bryan and Cecchetti (1993) refer to the index / t as a dynamic factor index (DFI).

It is derived from the joint statistical properties of a price series, rather than from

consumer theory. As such, it is a very different implementation of the intertemporal cost-

of-living index discussed by Alchain and Klein, and formalized Pollack and implemented

by Shibuya. Instead, it is a direct measure of the purchasing power of money based on the

intuition provided by Goodhart (1999).

        But once we formulate the problem in this way, we can see that the issue of

weighting any given nominal price is an empirical one, having to do with their

informativeness about the common trend. If, for example, we knew that the price

of a particular variety of shoes never experienced any relative price changes, then we

could save government statistical agencies quite a bit of money.

        Alternatively, if there were only two goods in the economy, and they experienced

substantial relative price shocks, and then focusing attention on one price alone, rather

than a properly constructed average, could be misleading. Starting with a set of prices

that includes asset prices, we can ask whether their inclusion adds any information to our

estimate of the common trend?

IV-3. INTERGRATING ASSET PRICES INTO A PRICE INDEX: A DYNAMIC
FACTOR INDEX APPROACH


        The decision as to whether asset prices should be included when measuring

inflation depends, therefore, on how informative they are about measuring the common

                                               15
price growth trend. From the simple framework outlined in the previous section, we can

see that this is reflected in the weight given to various asset prices in the construction of

the common index. Building upon this framework, we write the model as


                                          .     .        .
                                         pit # / t $ x it                        (19)

                                                .
                                        4 ( L) / t # 3 $ 2 t                     (20)

                                                 .
                                        6 i ( L) x it # 5it                      (21)

        .    .           .
where pit , / t , and x it are the first differences of the logs of the observed variables, the

common unobserved component representing inflation and the idiosyncratic relative price

movement in the ith series, respectively. ψ(L) and θi(L) are vectors of lag polynomials

and ξt and ηt are i.i.d. random variables. Throughout, it is assumed that both the

                     .
common element, / t , and the idiosyncratic components, xit can be modeled as AR(2)

processes.

        The main identifying assumption of the model is that the common component and

the idiosyncratic components are mutually uncorrelated at all leads and lags. This is

achieved by assuming that θ(L) is diagonal and that all the error terms in the model are

mutually uncorrelated. This is consistent with the notion that the common component

captures all the comovement in the observed series, leaving xit to reflect only

                                                     .
idiosyncratic movements. To set the scale of / t , the variance of ξt is normalized to one.

        The parameters of the model are then estimated via maximum likelihood using the

Kalman filter. As a by-product, the Kalman filter recursively constructs MMSE



                                                16
                                             .
estimates of the unobserved components / t and xit given observations of pit. The

common index can be written as a linear component of current and past values of the

observed series

                                         ^            ^   .
                                        / t # 0 w i ( L) pit                    (22)
                                                 i



        It is these weights that are implicitly used to construct the common component

that are of primary interest in this context, as it is on the basis of these weights the

question of whether asset prices should be included when measuring inflation can be

assessed. In a perfect world, this model should yield the weights as described in equation

7 of the theoretical model, ! and 1 " ! .

        In an alternative approach to this “signal-extraction” problem, Wynne (2000)

describes the implementation of a simple variance-weighted price index where

                                                 1
                                                72
                                        wi # N i
                                                   1
                                             0
                                             i #1 7 i
                                                     2
                                                                                (23)


for all of the series in the data where 7 i2 is the variance of the rate of change in the price
of good i.

        A simple variance-weighting scheme of this type is a good indicator of the likely

importance of a particular series in the construction of more complex (and difficult to

compute) dynamic factor indices. To see why, note that the variance of the “common”

element in any scheme, similar to that describe in equation (23) above, will have the

property that the estimated inflation index will have variance equal to or less than the

variance of the least volatile component used. As a result, the variance-weights derived


                                                 17
from (23) will give an indication of the likely importance of each series in constructing

measures of inflation.

V.1 RESULTS: THE CASE OF THE UNITED STATES

        To evaluate the importance of asset prices in the construction of a DFI measure of

inflation for the US, monthly data on house, stock and bond prices were examined in

conjunction with CPI component series at varying levels of aggregation. The first

approach looked at the traditional measure of “core” inflation – CPI excluding food and

energy. Individual series for food and energy were also included along with the three

asset price series. The implicit weights for the constituent series were extracted by

computing the response of the common component to unit impulses in each of the series.

Weights were also calculated based on the variances of the observed series for

comparative purposes (as described by equation 23.) This static version of the model

attributes a weight to a series based solely on the inverse of its variance, ignoring the time

series properties of the data.

        The weights that resulted from these experiments are reported in table 1. First,

we note the relative weights assigned to the three CPI components as derived by the DFI

model without asset prices (column 2) relative to the expenditure weights given these

components in the actual CPI (column 1.) Energy prices were assigned a

disproportionately small weight (4.4%) compared to its expenditure weight (7%). This

seems to support the common finding that energy prices are excluded from most

commonly accepted measures of “core” retail price inflation. On the other hand, food

prices appear to have a reasonably strong common inflation signal, suggesting that their

exclusion from a price index may not be entirely justified.


                                             18
       Turning to the influence of asset prices, we computed the common DFI index first

with all three asset-price series included, then we proceeded to drop alternative series in

order to gauge the impact on the weights attributed to the remaining series. Focusing

first on column 3 where all three asset-price series are included, it is evident that housing

is the asset price series that conveys the most information about the common trend in

prices. Indeed, at this level of aggregation, the housing price index would appear to have

a disproportionately large weight attached to it (20.5%), according to the statistical model

we apply.

       When evaluating the weights, remember that the strength of the common price

signal in any particular component should be judged against the case where its signal-to-

noise quality is identical to the average price component, 1/n, where n is the number of

component prices included in the statistic’s calculation. In the case of table 1, column 1,

this is approximately 17%. The signal to noise ratio for equities and bonds was

considerably less than this benchmark, with DFI weights of 4.5% and 2.4%, respectively.

As a general observation then, these asset price components (like energy prices) are

exceptionally “noisy” in the sense that their idiosyncratic behavior reduces their

usefulness in the estimation of a common inflation trend.

       Indeed, the highly variable nature of certain asset prices has generally undone any

practical implementation of a broader price index that includes asset prices. This quality

in the data is suggested by the very small weights attached to equity and bond prices

resulting from the variance weighting approach (0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.) But

despite the relatively high variance of the housing price series (resulting in a variance




                                             19
weight of only 0.3%), the common inflation signal contained in this asset appears to be

exceptionally strong.

         In our approach, this finding is not particularly surprising. Every asset is

composed of a large number of particular characteristics. Equity prices, for example,

represents claims to an increasing quantity of future consumption, tantamount to a

substantial quality bias in the price measure. Although a similar complaint can be made

for the housing data (which do not hold constant the characteristics or amenities of the

housing stock, or make adjustments for changes in tax treatment), housing is more

analogous to a real consol, the appropriate asset price in our theoretical treatment.

         We disaggregated further the CPI on the basis of its nine major component

groupings, recomputed the DFI’s for every possible combination of assets and examined

the resulting component weights (table 2).7 At this level of disaggregation, the weight

attached to housing prices falls sharply (to 3%), although taken together with the housing

services index in the CPI, the total housing component of the index commands a weight

of about 14 percent. These weights stay roughly the same when the other asset price

series are omitted. In contrast, zero-coupon bond prices are relatively uninformative,

attracting small weights in all three cases. The weights attributed to stock prices are

consistently higher than those for bonds but are nonetheless somewhat small in all cases.

         Nevertheless, each of these assets is assigned a substantially larger weight in our

statistical model than suggested by the variance weights. Cumulatively, the variance


7
 The CPI data used are based, where possible, on the methodologically consistent research series (CPI-U-
RS) published by the BLS and are seasonally adjusted where appropriate. The inclusion of nine
components at the group level breakdown reflects the need to accommodate changes to the group structure
by the BLS in 1997. The data series range from December 1977 to December 1999. Two of the relative
price series at the 9-series level of disaggregation have roots close to 1, indicating that the standard errors
around the DFI may be very large.

                                                      20
weights suggest giving this combination of assets less than ¼ percentage point weight in

the price index, compared with about a 4½ percent weight in the DFI. Again, this

highlights the importance of considering the time-series properties of the data in

allocating weights.8

        Finally, the DFI weights attributed to the components of the CPI and the

expenditure-based weights actually used in the construction of the CPI stand in sharp

contrast. Price series with disproportionately large service (or wage) components, such

as medical care, recreation, and education, receive much higher weight in the DFI than in

the CPI, highlighting the difference between the traditional cost-of-living approach to

inflation measurement and this more statistically-based measure. (Experiments using a

more finely disaggregated CPI are reported in Appendix table 4, although these

experiments do not materially alter our interpretation of the results.)

        How much do the inflation measures using asset prices differ from conventional

headline and “core” CPI indices of inflation? We answer this question by examining the

time-series themselves. In table 3, we report the annualized growth trends in the various

inflation estimates (using the nine-component CPI data) over periods of varying length,

full sample (January 1978 to December 1999), the most recent ten years, and the most

recent five years.

        The long-term growth differential between the inflation measures is somewhat

small. When all three assets are included in the DFI, the annualized 22-year growth trend

is 4.6 percent—0.4 percentage points above the CPI, and 0.2 percentage points above the


8
 We note the fact that the variance weight on house prices increases when longer horizons than one-month
differences are looked at, and may reflect some of the same influences. The larger weight attributed in
house prices in Cecchetti et al (2000) at least partly reflects the use in that paper of quarterly data.

                                                  21
CPI excluding food and energy and the median CPI. These suggest that a bias does

indeed exist from failing to include asset prices in the price data, although the order of

magnitude is about ¼ percentage point annually.

         Over shorter horizons, such as ten-year and five-year periods, the differences

were a bit higher. Between 1989 and 1999, we find that the exclusion of asset prices

reduced the measurement of inflation by about 0.3 to 0.4 percent annually (3.32 percent

for the DFI including all three asset categories, vs. 2.89 percent for the DFI without

assets, and 2.82 for the CPI excluding food and energy.) For the most recent five-year

period, the inflation differentials were slightly higher still, although only in the instances

where equity prices were included in the index.

         That these measures of inflation can yield different inflation trends can be seen in

the year-to-year growth trends reproduced in figures 1-4. The most striking difference is

seen in figure 1, between the commonly reported CPI (research series, CPI-rs) and the

other indexes, such as the CPI excluding food and energy (CPIXFE), the median CPI,

and the DFI without assets (DFI-none).9 Note that the CPI rose substantially above the

other inflation indexes during the late 1970s, but was well below the other measured

inflation trends during the 1980s. This is due to the singular impact on the inflation

estimate coming from energy prices. In all three of the alternative inflation measures, the

statistic is designed to limit the influence of such idiosyncratic occurrences.10

         In figure 2, we show the inflation patterns of the benchmark CPIXFE and the DFI

computed using all three asset categories (DFI-hsb). In the early 1980s, the “core” retail

inflation statistic reveals substantially greater inflation than the asset-based DFI. Since

1987, however, the DFI with assets has tended to run somewhat higher than the CPI

excluding food and energy. This impression changes only marginally when different

asset combinations are used in the construction of the DFI (figures 3 and 4.)

        Finally, consider the impression one gets of the growth in real nominal

compensation in the U.S. by deflating nominal compensation with each of these price

statistics (8-quarter growth trend shown.) In the base case (shown in figure 5), the real

compensation per hour series computed by deflating with the CPI shows much less real

growth as a consequence of higher energy prices. Including asset prices (figure 6) yields

the result that real compensation growth in the U.S. since 1985 has been somewhat less

than that reported using the more conventional retail price data. Again, these patterns are

only marginally influenced by varying the combinations of asset prices included in the

computation of the DFI (figures 7 and 8.)

V.2: THE RESULTS: A CROSS-COUNTRY COMPARISON

        To further assess the role of asset prices in measuring inflation, both DFI and

variance-based weights were calculated using a data set for twelve countries complied by

Goodhart and Hofmann (2000). Quarterly data beginning in December 1977 on

aggregate CPI, house prices and stock prices for each country were examined11. The

DFI weights are illustrated in figure 9 while figure 10 shows the weights calculated using

the static variance-based approach.




11
  The data series for most countries were quarterly observations from December 1977 to December 1997.
Data for Canada and Finland start in March 1980 and that for France starts in June 1980. Japanese data are
semi-annual and span June 1957 to December 1997.

                                                   23
       Several things are worth noting from these charts. First, the DFI approach

attributed significant weights to house prices in every country and, with one exception,

the weight on house prices exceeded that on stock prices. In fact, in several cases, the

weight attributed to house prices is larger that that attributed to the CPI. This may

indicate a need to disaggregate the CPI series to capture more of the statistical properties

of the constituent series. As in the US case, the weights for asset prices using the DFI

method were much higher than those based on the variance approach. As mentioned

above, the variance weights on asset prices for the US are higher here with the quarterly

data than they were when monthly data were used.

       Observations by nation also reveal some interesting patterns. In Japan, both

house and equity prices received nearly identical shares—the informational content in

assets is about the same as the current consumption price index. The inflation “signal” in

these markets is roughly comparable. In Canada, Ireland, and the Netherlands, housing

prices provide a dominant share of the common factor weight—an exceptionally strong

signal—while in France, the U.K., and most Scandinavian countries, the inflation signal

coming from asset prices, including housing, is somewhat small.

       Further, the trend growth differentials of the dynamic factor index and the CPI

also suggest rather large differences by nation. The largest inflation trend differential

(1980-1997) was found for the U.K. (5.2% CPI versus 8.4% for the DFI.) The smallest

differential is in the Netherlands (0.4% annually.) However, in general, the international

data appears to support the findings of the US analysis that there may be a potentially

large role for house prices in the inflation measures of interest to the central bank. Every




                                             24
one of the DFI indexes showed a higher trend inflation than the more narrowly defined

retail CPIs.

VI. CONCLUSION

        We have presented an integrated framework for including asset prices in

constructing current inflation and our results suggest that asset prices can affect the

measurement of aggregate price movements. This is particularly true of housing prices,

which appear to play a significant role in the measurement of the inflation trend both in

the U.S. and abroad. As a consequence, the Dynamic Factor Index measures that include

asset prices indicate that inflation has been somewhat higher than other measures would

suggest in recent times.

        A key question, then, is to ask how policy would have been different had it been

based on these measures. Any attempt to estimate this would need to take account of the

fact that history changes each time new data are added to this model and so only real-time

information should be used. Overall, however, other simpler measures of “core”

inflation such as the ex-food and energy approach seem to mirror the movements in the

DFI somewhat closely and as such, the inclusion of assets may not have produced

dramatically different real-time policy responses. Indeed, much of the focus on asset

prices appears to be on the unusual and somewhat dramatic run-up in certain asset prices

in recent years. In our approach, which minimizes any idiosyncratic movement in

component price data, we are led to the conclusion that such asset price movements

contained relatively little information of a common inflation that is useful for month-to-

month, or perhaps even year-to-year monetary policy choices.




                                             25
       Nevertheless, failure to include asset prices appears to induce a bias in the

estimate of the inflation trend that may have an impact on our understanding of the

broader movements in real economic variables, such as labor compensation. Such

information is very likely to be important in a world where the monetary authority hopes

to eliminate the movements in the aggregate price level that may enter into the

decisionmaking of households.

       As a final caveat, we also note that the results reported in this work indicate that

the weights attributed to the various component series seem to be somewhat sensitive to

the level of disaggregation. On the premise that the greater the level of diaggregation, the

more information we get, a further breakdown of some key groups such as housing may

be helpful. In light of this, it may be useful to decompose the international CPI series

where possible to see the magnitude of this aggregation effect.
