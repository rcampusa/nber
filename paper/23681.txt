                                         ABSTRACT

Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth Island and unincorporated territory of the United States, was
placed under a fiscal Oversight Board by the U.S. Congress in 2016. Unable to pay $72 billion it
owes to bond holders, Puerto Rico’s Government and the Oversight Board filed for court
proceedings under Title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability
Act, similar to Chapter 9 of the US Bankruptcy code. The origins of the crisis in Puerto Rico have
been attributed in part to the phase out of the IRS Section 936 tax exemption program for U.S.
corporations from 1995 to 2005 and its elimination in January 2006. Using industry panel data,
compiled from the IRS Statistics of Income for U.S. Possessions Corporations, the U.S.
Economic Census for Outlying Areas, and the mainland U.S. Economic Census, we analyze the
effects of the phase out and elimination of Section 936 on the number of establishments, value
added, employment, and wages in Puerto Rico’s manufacturing. Our results show the elimination
of Section 936 had the effect of decreasing average manufacturing wages by 16.7%, and
decreasing the number of manufacturing establishments by 18.7% to 28.0%

Puerto Rico and Section 936 of the IRS

       Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth Island and unincorporated territory of the United States,

was placed under a Financial and Oversight Board by the U.S. Congress in 2016. Unable to pay

for its 72 billion-dollar debt, the Puerto Rican Government and the Oversight Board, filed for

court proceedings under Title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight Management and Economic

Stability Act (PROMESA) in May 2017, similar to Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code

(Andrew Scurria, and Heather Gillers, WSJ May 4, 2017). The origins of the crisis in Puerto

Rico have been attributed in part to the phase out of the IRS Section 936 tax exemption program

for U.S. corporations from 1995 to 2005 and its elimination in January 2006. (Krueger, Teja and

Wolfe, 2015). Despite this claim, there has been no econometric analysis of the impact of the

phase out and elimination of Section 936 tax exemption program on economic conditions in

Puerto Rico.

       Using industry level panel data, compiled from Internal Revenue Service Statistics of

Income for US Possessions Corporations, US Economic Census for Outlying Areas, and the

mainland US Economic Census we analyze the effects of the phase out of Section 936 on the

number of establishments, value added (sales or shipments), employment, and wages in Puerto

Rico’s manufacturing industries using data from 1982 to 2012. Difference in difference

regression results show the elimination of the tax exemption program was associated with a

16.7% reduction in average manufacturing wages in Puerto Rico, when using the US as a control

group. Additional regressions show eliminating the tax program may be responsible for an

18.7% to 28% decline in the number of manufacturing establishments, when using the states of

Indiana, North Carolina and Oregon as the control group. These results suggest the elimination

of Section 936 had a negative impact on economic conditions in Puerto Rico.



                                                1
Section 936 of the IRS Tax Code

        In 1921, Federal income tax laws provided an incentive for U.S. corporations to conduct

business in a U.S. possession territory such as Puerto Rico. The original legislation provided an

exemption from taxation for all income derived from sources outside the United States if the

corporation had derived 80 percent or more of its gross income from U.S. Possessions, and 50

percent or more of its gross income from the active conduct of trade or business in the U.S.

Possession (Holik, 2009).1

        The Tax Reform Act of 1976 changed the taxation of U.S. corporations operating in U.S.

possessions, creating a new Section 936 of the Internal Revenue code. The new legislation

allowed only a credit against taxes paid on income derived from the active conduct of trade or

business in a U.S. possession and qualified possessions source investment income. The goal of

this legislation was to encourage employment-producing investments in U.S. possessions by U.S.

corporations (Holik, 2009).

        The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and the Tax Reform Act of 1986

further restricted tax benefits available under Section 936 by changing the tax treatment of

income derived from intangible assets and passive investments. The 1982 Act provided that a

possessions corporation’s income from intangible assets, such as patents and copyrights, would

be taxable to the U.S. shareholders (usually the U.S. parent corporation) of the possessions

corporation. A possessions corporation could avoid this general rule if it demonstrated that it had

a significant business presence in the possession by meeting a direct labor or value-added test

with respect to a specific product or service produced. The percentage of gross income that a



1Unlike the foreign tax credit, the possessions tax credit could reduce and, in some cases, eliminate the
U.S. tax liability on qualified possessions income whether or not the possessions tax that income.


                                                     2
possessions corporation must earn from trade or business in U.S. possessions was originally set

to 65 percent but increased to 75 percent in 1986 (Holik, 2009).

         Tax exemption given to U.S. corporation in U.S. territories was phased out between 1995

and 2005. Transition rules allowed existing possessions corporation to claim credits, with

certain restrictions, through taxable years beginning before January 1, 2006. The Act eliminated

the credit for qualified possessions source investment income received or accrued after June 31,

1996. However, existing investors could continue to claim reduced credit amounts for active

income using a percentage or economic activity limitation. The Small Business Job Protection

Act of 1996 eliminated the Section 936 tax credit for tax years after December 31, 1995 (Holik,

2009).

         Even though tax exemption through Section 936 applied to all U.S. possessions

territories, U.S. possessions corporations with operations in Puerto Rico accounted for virtually

all of the possessions tax credits.2 In 2005, 98.8% of the 0.9 billion dollars in tax credits claimed

were from US possessions corporations located in Puerto Rico. Moreover, of the 102

possessions corporations claiming credit, 94 were located in Puerto Rico. These corporations

also accounted for nearly all of the assets, receipts, and net income of corporations claiming the

credit. Most of the tax credit was given to manufacturing firms accounting for 69% of

possessions tax credit in 2005 (Holik, 2009).




2U.S. possessions include Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Literature on Taxation, Firm Location and US Corporations

         The literature on Taxation and FDI is extensive. Theoretical models of the impact of

taxes on the location of FDI consider whether firms engage in horizontal FDI, which has the goal

of establishing production abroad to serve local labor markets, or vertical FDI, which involves

locating different stages of production in different countries depending on relative factor

endowments (Fuest et al, 2005, Helpman, 1984, 1985, Horstmann and Markusen, 1992). Some

empirical studies use these theoretical models to estimate tax semi elasticities of FDI (Devereux

and Lockwood, 2006, Devereux et al, 2015) while others use gravity models (Bellakk et al,

2009).

         Feld and Heckemeyer (2011) conducted a meta study of FDI and taxation. They reviewed

704 primary estimates of the tax semi elasticities of FDI and found the precision weighted

average elasticity is -2.55, and when publication selection was taken into count the elasticity

decreases to between -2.28 and -1.19. This suggests firm location is very sensitive to tax levels

and thus the elimination of tax exemption for U.S. corporations in Puerto Rico may have had

large impact on the decision of firms to continue operating in the territory or leaving the island

for other less costly locations.

         In a tax study, Hexner and Jenkins (1995) found that the job creating benefits of section

936 in Puerto Rico were not large enough to justify the U.S. loss in tax revenue. Possessions

Corporations received full credit against U.S. taxes owed on the net income earned in a U.S.

possession, regardless of whether the income was generated by the use of tangible property and

labor, or intangible property transferred to the Possession’s Corporation. They argued section

936 did not produce enough employment because it benefited capital-intensive firms such as

pharmaceuticals and did not benefit labor-intensive industries such as apparel manufacturers.



                                                  4
Section 936 was a costly tax benefit to a few corporations with limited benefits to possessions

economies and their exports. Moreover, they argued the Section 936 tax code could not be fixed

and thus had to be abolished (Hexner and Jenkins, 1995).

        Previous research by Grubert and Slemrod (1998) investigated the Section 936

Possessions Corporations tax exemption program. They analyzed 419 Possessions Corporations

firms in 1987 and found the operating capital and payroll of Puerto Rican affiliates would be

more than two thirds lower in the absence of income shifting. They predicted that the

elimination of tax exemption for Puerto Rico, would result in many firms leaving or reducing the

size of their operations in the island.



Data

        We constructed two different data sets to study the impact of the elimination of Section

936 tax exemption for U.S. corporations on value added, number of manufacturing

establishments, average wages and employment in Puerto Rico. The first data set is based on the

Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income for U.S. Possessions Corporations. We constructed

a panel of 23 2-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) industries of US Possessions

Corporations for the years 1993 to 2005 (see Appendix A for description of industries). These

data include the last 12 years of tax exemption for U.S. corporations in Puerto Rico, including

the ten-year phase out period that started in 1995. The panel includes data on number of tax

returns filled by U.S. possessions corporations, value of tax credits, total expenditures on salaries

and wages, net depreciating assets, net intangible assets, and business receipts.

        The second data set is based on the U.S. Economic Census for Outlying Areas, and the

mainland U.S. Economic Census. We constructed a panel of industries originally at the 2-digit



                                                 5
SIC level from 1982 to 1992 and at the 3-digit North American Industrial Classification System

(NAICS) level from 1997 to 2012 with some consolidation resulting in 14 industries. The panel

includes data in five year intervals for years between 1982 and 2012 (See Appendix B for

Description of Industries).3 These data were collected in five year intervals because the

Economic Census is conducted every five years. Variables included in these data include value

added (sales in the case of U.S. state data), number of manufacturing establishments,

employment and payroll expenses.

       We also constructed a data set based on a report by the Junta de Planificación of Puerto

Rico “Impacto de las Firmas Manufactureras 936 sobre la Economía de Puerto Rico,” which

includes information on firms within industries receiving tax exemption through Section 936 and

firms within industries not receiving tax exemption in 1987. These data are used for descriptive

purposes.



Methodology

       We estimated a fixed effects model to analyze the impact of the elimination of the

Section 936 tax exemption program for U.S. corporations in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a

territory of the United States and has no votes in the U.S. Congress. The phase out of Section

936 was a policy change imposed on Puerto Rico by the U.S. Congress, driven by the desire to

increase U.S. tax collection. For this reason, the policy is exogenous to economic conditions in

the island and it is a natural experiment on the impact of removing tax exemptions on the

location of US multinational corporations.


3 We created a concordance to reconcile 2-digit SIC and 3-digit NAICS industries. The U.S. Census
classified data on and prior to 1997 by SIC and after 1997 by NAICS. The concordance is available in
Appendix A. Mapping of 2-digit SIC into 3-digit NAICS required reducing the number of industries to
14.
                                                  6
       First, we document the relationship between the value of tax credits given to U.S.

corporations in Puerto Rico, and the number of U.S. firms filing for tax credits. We also estimate

the relationship between the value of tax credits given to U.S. Possessions Corporation in Puerto

Rico and their expenditures on worker compensation. Our data on U.S. Possessions Corporations

is biannual, starting in 1993 and ending in 2005.

       We use a fixed effects model described by the following equation:

𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑈𝑆𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚𝑠𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝐿𝑇𝑎𝑥𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐿𝐷𝑒𝑝𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐿𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑛𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑡 +

𝛽4 𝐿𝐵𝑢𝑠𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑝𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑡 + ∑𝑖 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑖 + ∑𝑡 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 (1)

Where USFirms is the number of U.S. possessions corporations filing for tax exemption in

industry i and year t. TaxCredit is the value of tax credits awarded to U.S. possessions

corporations by the IRS. DepAssets, IntanAssets and BusReceipts represent respectively the

value of depreciable assets, intangible assets and business receipts for U.S. possessions

corporations. Ind is a group of industry dummy variables and Year is a group of year dummy

variables. We estimate a similar regression using Total Worker Compensation as the dependent

variable. All variables are in logs and all regressions are estimated using industry cluster

standard errors.

       We estimate a second regression equation to analyze the impact of the elimination of tax

exemption for U.S. corporations in Puerto Rico using a difference in difference estimation

method. The first difference is before (1982 to 1992), during the ten-year phase out period (from

1995 to 2005) and after the elimination of Section 936 (after 2005). The second difference

measures the difference in the industry level trends for the same periods for Puerto Rico and a

control group.




                                                 7
       It is difficult to find a perfect control group for Puerto Rico’s manufacturing industries

since Puerto Rico has significantly lower wages than all states in the U.S., its location is far from

the mainland, and because it is an island and requires maritime and air transportation for all

goods. For this reason, we estimate regressions using 3 alternative control groups. The first

control group is the entire United States, which including all 50 states. The second and third

control groups are made of states. One group of states includes Indiana, North Carolina and

Oregon. Another group of states includes Indiana, North Carolina, Oregon and New Jersey. The

reason Indiana and North Carolina were selected is that they have the largest manufacturing

share of state GDP in the U.S. Oregon was selected because, like Puerto Rico, it has a large

proportion of workers in food and beverages. New Jersey was selected because it has a large

share of employment in chemical and allied products, mostly pharmaceuticals. Comparisons of

manufacturing industries in Puerto Rico, Indiana, North Carolina, New Jersey and Oregon are

shown in Appendix C.

       We estimate the following difference in difference equation:

𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑠ℎ𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑗𝑡 ) = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑇𝑎𝑥𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑃ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑇𝑎𝑥𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑡 +

+𝛽3 𝑑𝑃𝑅𝑗 + 𝛽4 𝑑𝑃𝑅𝑗 ∗ 𝑇𝑎𝑥𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑃ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽5 𝑑𝑃𝑅𝑗 ∗ 𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑇𝑎𝑥𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑡 + ∑𝑖 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑖 +

∑𝑡 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 (2)

where Establishments is the number of manufacturing establishments in location j (PR or Control

Group) industry i and time t. TaxCreditPhaseOut is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the year is

during the ten-year phase out period of Section 936 (1995 to 2005) and 0 otherwise.

AfterTaxCredit is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the year is after the elimination of the

Section 936 tax exemption program (after 2005). The interaction terms between the PhaseOut

and AfterTaxCredit variables and the Puerto Rico dummy variable capture the differences


                                                  8
between Puerto Rico and the control group during the phase out and elimination of the tax

exemption program. These coefficients are the difference in difference estimators and thus

capture the impact of the phase out and elimination of the Section 936 tax exemption program in

Puerto Rico.

        We estimate similar difference in difference regression equations using value added

(sales or shipments)), employment and average wages as the dependent variable.4 All dependent

variables are in logs. All variables are measured in 5-year intervals. All regressions are

estimated using industry location cluster standard errors to account for correlation within

industries within a location. When the U.S. is the control group, we use industry-PR and

Industry-US specific standard errors. When the control group is a group of states, we use

industry-PR and Industry-Statei standard errors, where i is a specific state.



Description and Trends for Section 936 Corporations

        Figure 1 shows tax credits given to U.S. corporations operating in U.S. territories from

1983 to 2005. Tax credits awarded to U.S. possessions corporations increased from 1983 to

1993, and declined continuously from 1995 to 2005. The decline in tax credits can be attributed

to the ten-year phase out of Section 936 tax exemption program starting in 1995 and its

elimination on January 2006. In contrast, the number of US Corporations applying for Section

936 tax credits declined from 1983 to 2005. This suggests some of the trends in the number of

U.S. possessions corporations is unrelated to the tax exemption program.



4 The mainland U.S. Economic Census provides information on value added at the national level but only
sales and value of shipments at the state level. The U.S. Economic Census for Outlying Areas includes
both value added, and sales or shipments. For this reason, we use value added as the dependent variable
when the control group is the United States, and sales or shipments when the control group is a group of
states.
                                                   9
       Figure 2 shows manufacturing figures for Puerto Rico from 1982 to 2012 using data from

the U.S. Economic Census for Outlying Areas. This graph shows a different trend for

manufacturing establishments than the one shown in Figure 1. The number of manufacturing

establishments in Puerto Rico gradually declined from 1982 to 1997, increased from 1997 to

2002, and sharply declined after 20002. In contrast to the establishment statistics, employment

in manufacturing continuously increased from 1982 to 1997 and experienced a sharp declined

after 1997. The decline in employment coincides with the ten-year phase out and elimination of

the Section 936 tax credit. These statistics suggests that some of the decline in manufacturing in

Puerto Rico maybe due to the ten-year phase out and ultimate elimination of Section 936.

       Table 1 shows industry level statistics for U.S. possessions corporations operating under

Section 936 from the IRS Statistics of Income for US Possessions Corporation for 1993. These

statistics show four industries received most of the tax credits: food and kindred products

(12.6%), chemical and allied products (49.9%), electrical and electronic equipment (22.5%), and

instruments and related products (9.5%). The Chemical and Allied products industry stands out

as the largest industry group accounting for close to 50% of the Section 936 tax credits and

approximately 24% of all tax returns of the program. Most industries in the Chemical and Allied

products were in pharmaceuticals.

       Table 2 shows the importance of U.S. possessions corporations in Puerto Rico’s

manufacturing industry using a report from the Junta de Planificación of Puerto Rico with

statistics on firms filing under section 936 and firms not filing under section 936 for the year

1987. These data show U.S. possessions corporations filing under Section 936 accounted for

82.8% of manufacturing production in the island. Moreover, firms filing under section 936

accounted for over 90% of production in tobacco products, textile mills, chemical and allied



                                                 10
products, petroleum and coal products, leather and leather products, industrial machinery,

electronic and other equipment, and instruments and other products. Overall, these statistics

show Section 936 firms accounted for most manufacturing conducted in Puerto Rico in 1987.



Results

        Tables 3 shows estimates of the relationship between the number of U.S. corporations

filing for tax credits under Section 936 and the value of tax credits granted by the IRS using data

from Statistics of Income for US Possessions Corporations from 1983 to 2005. The dependent

variable is the number of U.S. corporations filing for Section 936 tax credits and the independent

variable is the value of tax credits given to US Corporations under Section 936. Regressions

show that as the value of U.S. corporations tax credits increased within an industry, the number

of US Corporations filing for tax credits increased. The coefficient on value of tax credits is

significant at the 5 percent level.

        It is difficult to establish a causality. An increase in the value of tax exemption given to

U.S. corporations can attract additional U.S. corporations to do business in Puerto Rico and file

under Section 936. At the same time, an increase in the number of U.S. corporations filing under

Section 936 can increase the value of tax credits. The purpose of these regressions is to show that

increasing Section 936 tax credits from 1983 to 1994 is associated with an increase in the

number of U.S. corporations filing for tax credits and the decline in tax credits offered to U.S.

corporations during the ten-year phase out of Section 936, from 1995 to 2005, was associated

with a decline in the number of U.S. corporations filing for tax credits.

        Regressions in Table 3 also show there is no clear relationship between the value of tax

credits received by U.S. corporations and their expenditures on salaries and wages. Regressions



                                                 11
of expenditures on salaries and wages (dependent variable) on tax credits and financial

characteristics of firms show the coefficients on value of tax credits is statistically insignificant

and thus we cannot reject the possibility it is equal to zero. This validates some of the criticism

of the Section 936 tax exemption program since firms that received larger tax credits did not

have higher expenditures on workers. The only variable significantly related to expenditures on

salaries and wages is business receipts, the coefficient is positive and statistically significant at

the 5% level.

       Table 4 shows the difference in difference estimates of the impact of Section 936 on the

number of manufacturing establishments, value added (sales or shipments)), employment and

average wages of workers in manufacturing industries using the U.S. (all 50 states) as the control

group. The difference in difference coefficients are captured by the interaction terms between

the Puerto Rico dummy variable and the dummy variable for the ten-year phase out period of

Section 936, and between the Puerto Rico dummy variable and the years after the elimination of

Section 936. These coefficients show differences between industries in Puerto Rico and the

United States during the years Section 936 was phased out and eliminated. The results show no

significant impact of the elimination of Section 936 on the log number of establishments, value

added, and employment in Puerto Rico (columns 1, 2 and 3). Coefficients on the interaction

terms are insignificant. Coefficients on tax credit phase out, end of tax credit and the Puerto

Rico dummy variables are all significant. However, we find a significant effect of the elimination

on Section 936 on average wages (column 4) in Puerto Rico, the coefficient on the interaction

term between the Puerto Rico dummy variable and the end of Section 936 tax credit dummy

variable is significant at the 10% level. The estimated coefficient is -.167 and shows average




                                                  12
manufacturing wages in Puerto Rico declined by approximately 16.7% relative to manufacturing

wages in the U.S.

       Table 5 shows estimates of the impact of the phase out and elimination of Section 936 on

the log number of manufacturing establishments, value of sales or shipments, employment and

average wages of workers using the states of Indiana, North Carolina and Oregon as controls.

Results show no impact of the elimination of Section 936 on sales or shipments, employment and

average wages in Puerto Rico (columns 2, 3 and 4). However, estimates show a significant

impact of Section 936 on the number of manufacturing establishments (column 1). The

coefficient on the interaction term between the Puerto Rico dummy variable and the dummy

variable for the ten-year phase out period of Section 936, is significant at the 10% level and is

estimated at -.186. The coefficient on the interaction term between the Puerto Rico dummy

variable and the years after the elimination of Section 936 is significant at the 10% level and is

estimated at -.280. This suggests the elimination of Section 936 may be responsible for an

18.7% to 28.0% reduction in the number of manufacturing establishments in Puerto Rico.

       Table 6 shows estimates of the impact of the phase out and elimination of Section 936 on

the log numbers of manufacturing establishments, value of sales or shipments, employment and

average wages of workers using the states of Indiana, North Carolina, Oregon and New Jersey as

controls. New Jersey was added to the control group because it has one of the largest

concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the United States. Our regression estimates including New

Jersey in the control group show no impact of the elimination of Section 936 on the number of

manufacturing establishments, sales or shipments, employment and average wages in Puerto

Rico. All coefficients on the interaction terms are insignificant (columns 1, 2, 3, 4). This

suggests that our results are sensitive to the states included in the control group. Is the group of



                                                 13
states that include New Jersey an appropriate control group for Puerto Rico? The answer is not

clear but we believe New Jersey is not a perfect comparison state for Puerto Rico. Manufacturing

wages in Puerto Rico were approximately 48% lower than those in New Jersey in 1987 (see

Appendix C). Thus, despite its large concentration of pharmaceutical firms it may not be the

best control for manufacturing industry trends in the island.



Conclusions

       After decades of offering tax exemption programs for U.S. corporations located in Puerto

Rico, Congress phased out the IRS Section 936 tax exemption program from 1995 to 2005, and

completely eliminated it by January 2006. Theoretical models and empirical studies of the

impact of taxes on FDI predict the elimination of tax credits should have reduced the number of

U.S. corporations located in Puerto Rico. Prior to this research, there has been no econometric

analysis of the impact of the phase out of IRS Section 936 on the manufacturing industry in

Puerto Rico.

               Using industry panel data, compiled from the IRS Statistics of Income for U.S.

Possessions Corporations, the U.S. Economic Census for Outlying Areas, and the mainland U.S.

Economic Census, we analyze the effects of the phase out and elimination of Section 936 on the

number of establishments, value added (sales or shipments), employments and wages using a

difference in difference methodology. Regression results show the elimination of Section 936

had a negative impact on average manufacturing wages in Puerto Rico when using the U.S. as a

control group. We estimated manufacturing wages in Puerto Rico declined by 16.7% due to the

elimination of the tax exemption program. We also estimate the elimination of Section 936 may

be responsible for an 18.7% to 28.0% reduction in the number of manufacturing establishments



                                                14
in Puerto Rico, when using Indiana, North Carolina, and Oregon as the control group. These

results are sensitive to the inclusion of states in the control group. However, there are no perfect

control groups for Puerto Rico because on average in 1987 manufacturing wages in the island

were 53% lower than in the mainland U.S. Thus, we believe our estimates are a lower bound of

the true effect of the elimination of tax exemption in Puerto Rico as, other things equal, the

island should have not experienced as large a decline in manufacturing as the rest of the U.S.

       How could the elimination of the Section 936 tax exemption program affect the number

of establishments and average wages but not the number of manufacturing workers. Our data

shows Puerto Rico experienced a decline in manufacturing jobs from 1995 to 2012. This also

occurred in the control groups: U.S. (all states), Indiana, North Carolina, Oregon and New

Jersey. The jobs that Section 936 created in Puerto Rico were in high paying industries:

pharmaceuticals, medical devices and electronic equipment. The reduction of these types of jobs

had the effect of decreasing average manufacturing wages in Puerto Rico. Our research suggests

the phase out and elimination of the Section 936 tax exemption program contributed to the

economic deterioration of the manufacturing industry in Puerto Rico.
