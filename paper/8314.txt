                                         I.     INTRODUCTION

       The canonical Permanent-Income Hypothesis (PIH) assumes that consumers have

certainty-equivalent preferences and do not face any liquidity constraints. Under these

assumptions the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of liquid wealth depends on model

parameters, but generally averages less than 0.1. The MPC out of predictable income or

"liquidity" (e.g. increases in credit limits), which do not entail wealth effects, should be zero. The

leading alternative view of the world is that liquidity constraints are pervasive. Even when they

do not currently bind they can be reinforced by precautionary motives concerning the possibility

that they bind in the future. Under this view the MPC out of liquidity can equal one over a range

of levels for "cash-on-hand," defined to include available credit [Deaton 1991, Carroll 1992, and

Ludvigson 1999].

       Liquidity constraints have implications in many areas of economics, in addition to

consumption theory. For instance, they can amplify the effects of fiscal policy and other business

cycle shocks [Hubbard and Judd 1986]. While they increase saving they can retard investment in

human capital and thus slow growth [Jappelli and Pagano 1999]. Nonetheless, there is still no

agreement about the quantitative importance of liquidity constraints and precautionary motives in

practice [Browning and Lusardi 1996]. Although some micro studies have found evidence that

liquidity constraints distort consumption [e.g., Hall and Mishkin 1982, Zeldes 1989], other

studies have not [e.g., Altonji and Siow 1987, Runkle, 1991]. Part of this disagreement is due to

the difficulty identifying which households in the data are in fact constrained. Most studies split

the sample on the basis of net worth, but this conflates credit demand and supply. The fact that

someone has low or negative net worth does not imply that he cannot increase his borrowing

[Jappelli 1990].


                                                  1
        Under the PIH the elasticities of consumption and saving to interest rates also depend on

model parameters, such as the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Like liquidity constraints,

these elasticities have wide-ranging implications, for instance to monetary policy, business cycles

[King, Plosser, and Rebelo 1988], and tax incentives for saving. Most studies have found small

effects of interest rates on consumption and saving [e.g., Hall 1988]. However, it remains unclear

whether interest-rate elasticities are truly small, or whether these findings are spurious, due for

instance to measurement problems like the difficulty of observing household-specific interest

rates [Browning and Lusardi 1996, Mishkin 1995].1

        To test whether liquidity constraints and interest rates really matter in practice, this paper

uses a unique new data set containing a panel of thousands of individual credit card accounts

from several different card issuers. The data set is of very high quality. It includes essentially

everything that the issuers know about their accounts, including information from people’s credit

applications, monthly statements, and credit bureau reports. In particular it separately records

credit limits and credit balances, allowing us to distinguish credit supply and demand, as well as

account-specific interest rates. These data allow us to analyze the response of debt to changes in

credit limits and thereby estimate the MPC out of liquidity, both on average and across different

types of consumers. The analysis generates clean tests distinguishing the PIH, liquidity

constraints, precautionary saving, and behavioral models of consumption, which are outlined in

the next section. We also estimate the sensitivity of debt to interest rates, and the interaction of

interest rates with liquidity constraints.




1
  Ausubel [1991]’s “underestimation hypothesis” tries to explain why consumers might be insensitive to credit card
rates in particular, by assuming that consumers underestimate the probability they will borrow on their cards or that
the costs of switching to other cards are large. [See also Calem and Mester 1995.]


                                                         2
        Credit cards play an important role in consumer finances, so they are a good place to look

for the effects of liquidity constraints and interest rates. About 20 percent of aggregate personal

consumption is already being purchased using credit cards [Chimerine 1997] and with the growth

of e-commerce this fraction is likely to grow. Moreover, for most households credit cards, in

particular bankcards (i.e., Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and Optima cards), represent the leading

source of unsecured credit. About 2/3 of households have at least one bankcard, and of these

households at least 56 percent – a remarkably large fraction – are borrowing on their bankcards,

that is, paying interest, not just transacting [1995 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)].2

Conditional on borrowing, the median bankcard account is borrowing over $2000, with about

another $5000 of balances on other cards [authors’ calculations. See also Yoo 1998.]. These are

large magnitudes in the context of typical household balance sheets. They are also large in the

aggregate: total credit card borrowing amounts to about $500B [Federal Reserve Board 1998].

        To preview the results, we find that increases in credit limits generate an immediate and

significant rise in debt, counter to the PIH. The average "MPC out of liquidity" (dDebt/dLimit)

ranges between 10-14 percent. The MPC is much larger for people starting near their credit limit,

providing concrete evidence that liquidity constraints are often binding. However, the MPC is

significant even for people starting well below their limit. We show that this response is

consistent with buffer-stock models of precautionary saving. Nonetheless, there are other results

2
  This figure probably understates the fraction of households borrowing on their bankcards, because it is computed
as the fraction of SCF households with positive debt on their bankcards, but SCF households substantially
underreport their bankcard debt. This underreporting can be seen by comparison with our account data (described
below) or the aggregate data on revolving consumer credit collected by the Federal Reserve, which is mostly credit
card debt (including debt on retail-store cards). The 1995 SCF records average credit card debt (including retail-
store debt) of around $2000 per household with credit cards. By contrast, allocating the approximately $400B of
aggregate revolving debt in 1995 (adjusted for transactions balances) evenly across the 3/4 of households with credit
cards (including retail-store cards) yields over $5000 of debt per household in 1995. In our account data about 52
percent of all bankcard accounts revolve, but this includes accounts that are not currently being used to borrow or




                                                         3
that conventional models cannot easily explain, such as the fact that many credit card borrowers

simultaneously hold low yielding assets. Unlike most other studies, we also find strong effects

from changes in account-specific interest rates. The average long-run elasticity of debt to the

interest rate is approximately -1.3. Less than half of this elasticity represents balance-shifting

across cards, with most reflecting net changes in total borrowing. The elasticity is larger for

decreases in interest rates than for increases, which can explain the widespread use of temporary

promotional rates. The elasticity is smaller for people starting near their credit limits, again

consistent with liquidity constraints.

        Section II outlines our framework for testing for liquidity constraints and other

alternatives to the PIH, and for controlling for the endogeneity of credit supply. Section III

describes the data and Section IV develops the econometric methodology. Sections V and VI

estimate the average response of debt to changes in credit supply, credit limits and interest rates

respectively. Section VII analyzes the heterogeneity in people’s responses to credit, focusing on

the ability of liquidity constraints and other models to explain the heterogeneity. Section VIII

concludes, and is followed by a Data Appendix.



                                              II.      FRAMEWORK

1. Liquidity Constraints and Other Models

        Because bankcards are the marginal source of credit for most households, they can be

used to measure the pervasiveness of liquidity constraints. Considering the usefulness of

bankcards for borrowing and transacting, it is plausible that many of the 1/3 of households

without bankcards are liquidity constrained. Jappelli, Pischke, and Souleles [1998] found that


transact. Since the average cardholder has multiple cards, this understates the fraction of individuals borrowing.


                                                        4
their consumption is disproportionately sensitive to their income; i.e., people with bankcards are

better able to smooth their consumption than people without bankcards. Of the 2/3 of households

with bankcards, the over 56 percent that are borrowing and so paying high interest rates

(averaging around 16 percent) might also be considered liquidity constrained, lacking access to

cheaper credit. Combined with the households lacking bankcards, they bring the overall fraction

of potentially constrained households to over 2/3 (≈ 1/3 + 2/3 * .56). However this calculation

relies on the weaker notion of liquidity constraints as a wedge between borrowing and lending

rates. Below we show that household balance sheets are complicated, simultaneously including

both assets and liabilities with many different interest rates.

        Instead this paper mostly focuses on the stricter notion of liquidity constraints as quantity

constraints. We find that about 14 percent of bankcard accounts have a utilization rate, defined as

the balance divided by the credit limit, above 90 percent, leaving less than 10 percent of the

credit line free. For these accounts liquidity constraints are arguably binding. However, focusing

on just currently binding constraints can understate the full impact of liquidity constraints. In

models with precautionary motives liquidity constraints can have large effects on the level of

consumption and welfare even when they do not currently bind, so long as there is a possibility

that they bind in the future.

        The most direct way to test whether liquidity constraints matter is to see whether changes

in liquidity have real effects. Accordingly this paper estimates the MPC out of credit card

liquidity, dDebt/dLimit. When someone’s credit limit (credit line) increases, what fraction of that

extra liquidity does she use to borrow and spend? Under the PIH, which assumes no liquidity

constraints, the answer should be zero. Alternatively, if liquidity constraints exist but only matter


Conditional on an account currently being used, about 70 percent of accounts borrow.


                                                        5
when currently binding, the MPC should be positive and large only for people with very high

utilization rates. However, if the possibility of future liquidity constraints also matters, for

precautionary reasons, the MPC would be positive even at lower levels of utilization. Consider

someone with a credit limit of $10,000 and a balance of $2500. Does raising the limit to say

$11,000 have any effect on debt?

        We also estimate the elasticity of debt to interest rates, which is of independent interest.

When someone’s credit card rate rises, by how much does she change her debt? We highlight the

interaction of interest rates with liquidity constraints. In the absence of constraints people with

substantial debt might be more sensitive to interest rates than people with little or no debt. But

binding liquidity constraints would make people less sensitive, ceteris paribus. Hence we also

test for liquidity constraints by examining how interest rate elasticities vary with utilization rates

and demographic characteristics.

2. The Credit-supply Function

        Endogeneity is a generic problem in studies of the effects of credit supply, including

monetary policy [Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans 1996, Kashyap and Stein 1995].3 In our

case there could be a problem if credit card issuers increase credit supply when they expect credit

demand to rise. Then part of the observed response in debt could be the result of a demand shock,

not just a response to supply. However, our data allows us to go further than most previous

studies to address the endogeneity of both credit limits and interest rates. We follow two general

strategies.

3
 Most studies of the impact of monetary policy on households have used aggregate time-series data. Bernanke and
Gertler (1995) find that aggregate consumption responds immediately and strongly to monetary shocks, whereas
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1996) find that aggregate household debt does not change for several quarters.
Ludvigson (1998) finds an immediate effect on aggregate automobile credit in particular, but the effect is small in




                                                        6
         First, we use an unusually rich set of control variables to capture the endogenous part of

credit-supply changes. Monthly time dummies control for seasonality and all other aggregate

economic effects. First-differencing and fixed individual effects accommodate all persistent

characteristics of the account-holders. Indicator variables for whether the line change was

requested by the account-holder help control for changes in individual credit demand. Most

notably, we also control for the credit-risk scores, which are the issuers’ own summary statistics

for the default risk and profitability of each account. With millions of accounts to manage, the

issuers have largely automated their decision-making, relying very heavily on the scores in

deciding credit policy for each account, including credit-limit and interest-rate policy [Moore

1996]. The issuers estimate the scores using all the information at their disposal, both in-house

(the "internal" scores) and at the credit bureaus (the "external" scores). Thus the scores

essentially summarize the fundamental characteristics of each account.4 We also control for the

most important of these characteristics directly, including account debt levels and account age

(time since booking).5 Because the data includes the account characteristics tracked by the issuers

themselves, this strategy of controlling should be a compelling check against endogeneity.

         Second, we also use instrumental variables (IV) to isolate exogenous changes in credit

supply. In particular we exploit exogenous "timing rules" built into the credit-supply functions.

For instance, many issuers will not consider (or are less likely to consider) an account for a line

change if it has been less than six months or less than one year since the last line change. Hence


magnitude. There is somewhat more evidence of consumer sensitivity to mortgage rates. See e.g. Hurst and Stafford
(2000) for an analysis of mortgage refinancing and liquidity constraints.

  While the scoring functions are proprietary, they are known to heavily reflect a person’s past borrowing and
delinquency history.
5
  While we considered many other account characteristics as well, the reported results focus on these variables based
on results in a companion paper. Gross and Souleles [2001] used the same data source to estimate hazard models of
default, including bankruptcy. They empirically evaluated the implications of the various account characteristics that



                                                          7
for a given account the probability of a change is exogenously higher in certain months than in

others. Accordingly we instrument for line changes with dummy variables for the number of

months since the latest line change, controlling for account fundamentals. Consider, for example,

two accounts opened at the same time that currently have the same credit scores but are on

different timing cycles for exogenous reasons. Suppose one account had its latest line increase 12

months ago, the other had it 11 months ago. Because of the timing rules the first account is more

likely to have its line go up this month, even though there is no fundamental difference between

the accounts. Our IV estimates compare the resulting debt of the first account to the debt of the

second account. As a result the estimates exploit only exogenous variation in the timing of a line

change. In addition we can condition on the total number of line increases that each account

receives during the sample period. This controls for all the factors justifying the increases in the

first place. The remaining variation is purely in the high-frequency timing of the line increases, as

induced by the exogenous timing rules, conditional on the increases taking place. Such IV

specifications are an unusually powerful response to endogeneity.

        We handle interest rates analogously. In particular credit card issuers also use exogenous

timing rules for changing interest rates, which we exploit as instruments. For instance, many

issuers offer low promotional rates that expire after a pre-specified period like 6 months or 12

months. Also, for contractual reasons interest rates on fixed rate cards can often be changed only

periodically.

        Credit supply still varies across accounts with the same fundamental characteristics and

timing cycles. Although the details of the credit-supply functions are proprietary, and vary across

issuers, there are a number of factors generating this remaining variation. First, there is a time-


the issuers track for account risk and profitability. Apart from the scores, debt levels and being a newly opened


                                                       8
series dimension to credit supply. Issuers can vary the total amount of credit they allocate to their

credit card portfolios over time. Such variation is likely endogenous, because aggregate shocks

influence both the supply and demand for credit. We use the month dummies to control for this

endogeneity.

         Second, cross-sectionally, credit-supply policies are functions of both fundamental

account characteristics and numerous institutional constraints, in addition to the timing rules,

which are arguably exogenous. At a given issuer, different accounts can be considered for line

changes at different times, by different managerial divisions, whose operating procedures vary

somewhat even though they all draw upon the same fundamental account information. For

example, as a result of mergers, portfolio acquisitions, or other historical reasons, an issuer’s

accounts might have been divided into different sub-portfolios, across multiple computer

systems. Because of computing and other constraints, in any given month only the accounts in

some sub-portfolios on some systems might be considered for a line change; the other accounts

would be considered in subsequent months. Also, some accounts might have been booked under

a myriad of different marketing programs, and so be managed by different people changing credit

supply at different times. Some of these programs involve randomized experiments, but even the

others are unlikely to confound our analysis. Consider, for example, credit cards that were

designed to attract Chicago Bears football fans (perhaps by including a picture of the Bears’ logo

on the face of the cards). Knowing that the person who opened the account is a football fan does

not help predict subsequent high-frequency changes in his demand for credit that the issuers use

to change credit limits. Hence such institutional variation is exogenous for our purposes, even

before instrumenting. Also, first-differencing and individual account dummies directly control


account played the most significant roles, though not nearly as significant as the scores themselves.

for differences across marketing programs and other sub-portfolios, as well as any other

persistent characteristics of the account and account-holder.

         Background econometric analysis supports this description of the credit-supply function.

Account fundamentals like the scores, debt levels, and account age are statistically very

significant in explaining line changes (especially the scores, which have chi-squared statistics

above 1500 in probit models of whether the line changes). Nonetheless the fundamentals explain

a relatively small part of the high-frequency variation in credit limits exploited here. For instance,

they account for only about 5 percent of the probability of a line change in any given month,

according to the pseudo R2 from a probit model. Adding as explanatory variables our instruments

for the number of months since the latest line change raises this figure to 17 percent. These

results confirm the importance of institutional constraints, of which our instruments are but one

example. That is, even though our fundamental control variables do not explain all the variation

in credit supply, the remaining variation can reasonably be taken as exogenous. Further, our

instruments should be powerful guards against any remaining endogeneity. Similarly for interest

rates, the fundamentals alone are very significant but explain only about 5 percent of the monthly

probability of a rate change; but adding the instruments raises this figure to 33 percent.6,7




6
  Adding other available account characteristics does not substantially increase these pseudo R2 figures. Adding
month dummies to control for the time-series variation raises them to 27 percent for credit limits and 48 percent for
interest rates. Hence this analysis has accounted for about a quarter to a half of the credit-supply functions.
7
  Industry sources confirmed this analysis anecdotally. One even pointed out its implication for monetary policy lags.
Although it would be optimal to adjust credit supply simultaneously for all accounts immediately after a change in
monetary policy, in practice institutional constraints significantly delay the full adjustment. These constraints can
also help explain the "stickiness" of credit card interest rates pointed out by Ausubel [1991].

                                           III.     DATA DESCRIPTION

        The data used in this paper is proprietary, coming from the account archives at several

anonymous issuers of bankcards. Each issuer provided a random sample of all their personal

bankcard accounts open as of 1995.8 Because the issuers include some of the largest credit card

companies in the U.S., the data should be generally representative of credit cards in the U.S. in

1995. For computational tractability, this paper uses a large randomized subset of the original

data consisting of about twenty-four thousand accounts. These accounts are followed monthly for

different periods of time, depending on the issuer, or until they attrite; but on average for just

over 24 months. Thus the sample is unbalanced, but in total extends from January 1995 through

January 1998.

        The unit of observation is a credit card account, which generates a single monthly

statement no matter how many people use the account, even if multiple cards have been issued

for the account. There are four general types of information available. First, the bulk of the data

consists of the main information listed on the account’s monthly billing statement, including

statement totals such as balances, payments, and interest charges, as well as the credit limit and

interest rate. The majority of issuers archived this information by the monthly billing cycle for

each account, while other issuers stored the data by calendar month. Second, there is also data

that the issuers obtain from the credit bureaus, usually at a monthly or quarterly frequency, such

as the external credit scores and balances on other credit cards. Third, issuers track administrative

data related to each account, such as the internal credit scores, information about previous

changes in the credit limit and interest rates, and the date the account opened. Finally, there is



8
 Some accounts may in fact be used for business purposes, however they are the personal liability of the individual
borrower.


                                                        11
some limited demographic data from the credit application, such as the age and income of the

account-holder.

        Different credit card issuers track somewhat different sets of variables depending on their

source. To protect the identity of the accounts and the issuers, the data from different issuers

were pooled together, with great care taken to define variables consistently across issuers. The

reported results will focus on variables common to multiple issuers. They have been confirmed

separately for each issuer to insure that pooling is not driving the conclusions. Table I provides

summary statistics for the main variables used in the analysis. A Data Appendix further describes

the data.

        Credit cards are used for both transactions and borrowing purposes. To distinguish the

two uses, the key dependent variable is interest-incurring debt. For the issuers that provided

balance information by billing cycle, debt is defined to be actual balances rolled over into the

next month. This equals the closing balance in the cycle net of the subsequent payment. For

issuers that provided balance information by calendar month, debt is defined as the balance at the

end of the month net of the subsequent payment, if interest payments were subsequently incurred.

The difference in this figure from one calendar month to the next provides a consistent measure

of the change in account liabilities between the same point in two consecutive billing cycles.9

        This data has a number of unique advantages compared to traditional household data sets

like the SCF or the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. First, the large sample with little

measurement error should provide much more power than usual to identify the effects of credit

supply. Second, because each account is observed over many months, it is possible to study

9
 The results below were checked separately across both types of balance information. Also, for a subset of accounts
we acquired balance information by both cycle and month. For these accounts the results were insensitive to the




                                                        12
dynamics and control for fixed effects. Third, unlike most studies, credit demand can be

distinguished from credit supply. Not only do we separately observe credit limits and balances,

we can also control for the endogeneity of credit supply changes.

        Using account data does, however, entail a number of limitations. First, there is little

information about some potentially important variables like household assets or employment

status. However the issuers also lack access to this information, so its absence will not effect our

identification strategy. Second, the main unit of analysis in the data is a credit card account, not

an individual or a household. We partially circumvent this limitation by using data from the

credit bureaus, which cover all sources of credit used by the account-holder, in particular other

credit card balances. (The credit bureau data on balances does not distinguish transactions

balances and debt, however.)



                                    IV.      ECONOMETRIC METHODOLOGY

        The results in this paper can be interpreted as an event study of how credit card debt

responds to changes in credit supply, both in quantities and prices, over a period of about a year.

Let Di,t be the amount of debt held by account i at the end of month t, and let Li,t be the account’s

credit limit (the line) as of the start of month t. A traditional event study might focus on a month t

in which the limit changes, and regress Di,t+s - Di,t-1 on Li,t - Li,t-1 for various s = 0, 1, 2, …. The

resulting coefficients would give the response of debt, per dollar of line increase, over horizons

of length s. However, since a given account can experience multiple line changes and especially

multiple interest rate changes, a more flexible approach is required. The natural extension in this

setting is to estimate a distributed lag model, which controls for the effects of multiple changes


distinction. For instance, the estimated "impulse responses" (as in Figures I and II below) retained their original


                                                        13
within the estimation window. The main specification identifying the effect of changes in credit

limits is equation (1):


(1)      ∆Di,t = α’timet + βo ∆Lit + β1 ∆Li,t-1 + β2 ∆Li,t-2 +… β12 ∆Li,t-12 + γ’Xit + εi,t,


where ∆Di,t ≡ Di,t - Di,t-1. The vector time represents a complete set of month dummies, which

controls for all aggregate effects, including seasonality and the business cycle, trends in debt over

time, and aggregate credit supply (both liquidity and interest rates). Sometimes additional control

variables X will be added, often with twelve lags corresponding to the twelve lags for ∆L.

         The coefficient βo measures the contemporaneous increase in debt in response to a line

increase, per dollar of line increase. The marginal coefficients β1, β2, …, β12 measure the

additional increases in debt one month after the line increase, two months later, …, and twelve

                                                         k
months later, respectively. Consequently bk ≡ ∑ β j gives the cumulative increase in debt after k
                                                        j =0



months, k = 0-12. Twelve lags were sufficient for bk to converge. Attention will therefore focus

on bTot ≡ b12, the long-run, total effect on debt. bTot can be interpreted as the fraction of a line

increase that is borrowed, or the MPC out of liquidity (dD/dL). This interpretation is analogous to

the MPC out of predictable income estimated in Campbell and Mankiw [1990].10

         The dependent variable is the change in debt between months t-1 and t. Using differences

controls for individual effects in the level of debt or the credit line. In the event study

interpretation, i’s debt after an increase in his credit line is being compared to his debt before the

line increase. This identifies the within variation in his debt due to within variation in his line.


shape, and their long-run effects bTot changed by only about 3 percent in magnitude.




                                                         14
Various extensions will consider additional controls for the endogeneity of line changes. For

instance, account dummies will sometimes be added to equation (1), controlling for individual

effects in the growth in debt as well. We will also distinguish people who requested their line

increase, add the credit scores and other fundamental account characteristics as control variables,

and use instruments exploiting the exogenous timing rules built into the credit supply function.

Further extensions will test whether the MPC out of liquidity bTot differs across various groups of

accounts. Indicator variables for these groups will be added to equation (1), both directly and

interacted with all lags of ∆L.

        About 4 percent of credit lines change in any given month. Unlike interest rates which

both increase and decrease, issuers have been reluctant to decrease lines, so ∆L is generally non-

negative.11 People who do not receive a line increase in a given month remain in the sample that

month with the corresponding ∆L equal to zero. These people serve in a sense as a control group,

in that the estimated coefficients will pick up the effects of line changes relative to the debt of

this group.

        The specification for changes in interest rates is analogous, except that only nine lags

were needed for convergence:12


(2)           ∆Di,t = α’timet + βo ∆rit + β1 ∆ri,t-1 + β2 ∆ri,t-2 +… β9 ∆ri,t-9 + γ’Xit + εi,t,




10
   They use aggregate data. Using micro data, Souleles [1999] and Souleles [2001] estimate analogous MPCs out of
predetermined tax refunds and cuts in payroll taxes. (See also Parker 1999.) Ludvigson [1999] relates changes in
aggregate consumption to changes in aggregate consumer credit.
11
   Thus line changes are essentially permanent. Apart from the promotional rates discussed below, interest rates are
also very persistent, with an AR(1) coefficient above 0.9.
12
   In both equations (1) and (2) we started with 12 lags of the regressors ∆L and ∆r, and removed insignificant lags
so long as the adjusted R2 did not decrease. Graphs of the cumulative coefficients {bk|k=0-12} (the impulse
responses) visually confirmed the convergence. (See Figures I and II for examples.)


                                                        15
where ri,t is account i’s interest rate as of the start of month t. The coefficients βj identify the

within variation in debt due to within variation in interest rates. The cumulative coefficient bTot ≡

b9 gives the total change in debt from a one percentage point increase in the interest rate, i.e., the

long-run semi-elasticity (dD/dr). Again these coefficients can be motivated as the product of an

event study regressing Di,t+s - Di,t-1 on ri,t - ri,t-1 for an interest rate change at t. Alternative

specifications will also be considered. The controls for the endogeneity of interest rates are

analogous to those for the credit limits. Some extensions will jointly estimate the effects of

interest rates and credit limits, but the results are similar to those found estimating equations (2)

and (1) individually.

       While the month dummies in equation (2) partial out aggregate interest rates, there

remains substantial idiosyncratic variation in the account-specific interest rates ri,t. About 20

percent of interest rates change in any given sample month, both up and down.

       Equations (1) and (2) are estimated by OLS, unless stated otherwise. The standard errors

allow for heteroscedasticity across accounts as well as serial correlation within accounts. The

analysis will begin by examining the debt held on the credit card accounts in the main sample.

This examination is of interest for understanding how people use individual credit instruments

and the industrial organization of the credit card industry. For the macroeconomic implications of

credit, we also want to examine the effect of credit supply on the total amount of debt held by the

account-holder. To this end we will also use the credit bureau data on the balances held on other

credit cards owned by account-holder i. In extensions we will replace the dependent variable in

equations (1) and (2) with the change in these other balances. If the resulting long-run effects bTot

have the opposite sign as those for the cards in the main sample, that will provide evidence of




                                                 16
“balance shifting,” i.e., of people shifting balances across cards in response to changes in credit

supply.



                             V.      RESULTS: CHANGES IN CREDIT LIMITS

          This section estimates the average response of debt to credit line increases, beginning

with the credit card accounts in the main sample. The analysis of heterogeneity appears in

Section VII, after the results for interest rates in Section VI.

          Table II records the long-run response of debt bTot, which can be interpreted as the MPC

out of liquidity. As a starting point, row (1) uses the entire sample. The estimated bTot is relatively

large at just under 0.13 and quite significant (t-ratio of 6). Over the year following a line increase,

each extra thousand dollars of liquidity generates on average a $130 increase in debt, an MPC of

13 percent. In absolute terms (calculated by replacing the regressors ∆L in equation (1) with

indicator variables I(∆L>0)), this corresponds to a $350 average increase in debt per line increase.

Hence liquidity matters, counter to the PIH.

          For brevity the intermediate cumulative coefficients {bk | k = 0-11} are not reported but

can be found in the working-paper version of this paper. When graphed they give the "impulse

response" to liquidity. (Figure I provides an example of the impulse response, for a smaller but

preferred sample used below.) Debt rises sharply and significantly over the first two months after

a line increase, and then smoothly asymptotes to bTot. Such a clean result is rare in micro data.

Presumably the difference is due to the large sample with little measurement error. The time

dummies in equation (1) are also jointly significant (not reported).




                                                   17
         The remaining rows of Table II show the results of various extensions.13 Rows (2) to (8)

address the potential endogeneity of credit limits, employing a number of strategies to ensure that

it is not driving the results. First, recall that the time dummies control for all aggregate effects.

For instance, they control for the fact that issuers might offer additional credit before Christmas

knowing that on average debt will subsequently rise. But the time dummies do not control for the

analogous idiosyncratic situation in which, when someone expects to make a big purchase in the

near future, he calls his issuer and requests a line increase. In this situation there would be

reverse causality: the expected future purchase would be responsible for the line increase.

         Fortunately, for a large subset of our data we know whether the line increase was

requested by the account-holder or not. The requested changes, which the issuers call “manual”

changes, account for about 10 percent of the total number of line changes; the remaining 90

percent, called “automatic” changes, are initiated by the issuers. A dummy variable was created

to identify manual line changes, and this dummy and its twelve lags were interacted with the

regressors ∆L and its lags in equation (1). Row (2) reports the resulting bTot for both manual and

automatic line increases. Not surprisingly debt rises much more after a manual increase,

significantly so. bTot in this case is over 100 percent of the extra line, though the standard errors

are larger because of the smaller number of manual changes. More interestingly, debt also

responds to automatic line changes. Their MPC bTot remains significant and large at about 0.10

($290 in absolute terms). Figure I shows the impulse response for automatic changes, which

remains relatively smooth despite the smaller sample. Therefore, even though in the full sample

we do not always know which line changes were automatic and which were manual, we do know

13
  Since different issuers collect somewhat different data, we are unable to apply all of the extensions simultaneously
and still pool across a sufficiently large number of accounts and issuers. We therefore apply the extensions in groups.




                                                          18
that the small number of manual changes are not driving the results. Nonetheless we will often

add the interaction terms for manual line changes as controls in subsequent extensions when the

sample size permits, including in rows (3)-(8) which focus on endogeneity. In these cases we

report bTot for the uninteracted ∆L terms, which represents the MPC for automatic line changes. In

other specifications which do not explicitly include the controls for manual changes, we have

checked that their omission does not change our conclusions.

       Second, issuers try to identify the types of potential customers that will borrow and pay

interest but not default. Row (3) adds fixed account effects to equation (1), which control for all

persistent characteristics of the account and account-holder, including the sub-portfolio to which

the account belongs. These are fixed effects in the change in debt, which should be a powerful

control for endogeneity. Nonetheless the MPC bTot remains significant and actually rises slightly

to 0.14.

       Third, we control directly for the credit-risk scores, which summarize the fundamental

account characteristics affecting credit policy for each account. We use both the internal and

external scores. Each score was first normalized relative to the average score for the

corresponding issuer. A third order polynomial in these normalized scores was interacted with

dummy variables for the issuers, to allow each issuer to use its scores non-parametrically and

differently. These interacted variables were added to equation (1), along with twelve lags to




We have confirmed in unreported regressions that our conclusions are robust to applying the extensions
simultaneously.




                                                 19
control for past line changes.14 The results are in row (4). While the scores are significant (not

reported), they reduce bTot only slightly to .085 and it remains significant.15

         We can also directly control for the account fundamentals. Row (5) includes third order

polynomials in the two scores and in account debt and account age, the other variables

highlighted by Gross and Souleles (2001).16 bTot remains significant and similar in magnitude to

the preceding estimates. The results are also similar on controlling for other salient account

characteristics.17 This robustness suggests that the variation driving the results is indeed

exogenous, the product of non-fundamental institutional constraints.

         Fourth, to control for any remaining endogeneity we exploit the exogenous timing rules

described in Section II. We instrument using dummy variables for the number of months since

each account’s latest line change. These dummies and their lags were interacted with issuer

dummies, to allow each issuer to use different timing rules.18 As already noted, in the first-stage

14
    We also interacted these variables with time dummies, to allow each issuer to use the scores differently over time.
Because of the large number of resulting regressors, we did this in smaller test samples. This time interaction had
little effect on the main results in the test samples.
15
     In this and other extensions, the sample size can vary with missing variables. For instance, the scores are
occasionally missing or changed to a flag value (e.g., if there was not enough data on record at the bureaus to have
computed a score).
16
     Again these variables are interacted with issuer dummies. To conserve memory the reported specification
includes these three characteristics (normalized scores, debt, age) only from month t-1 in equation (1), without lags.
The results are robust to adding lags. We also added account age and debt from month t-1 to the full set of scores
with 12 lags used in row (4), but again the results are similar.
17
    The results are also robust to controlling for past debt levels D with 12 lags, or for 12 lags of the dependent
variable ∆D. There is little information available to issuers that is useful in predicting future high-frequency changes
in an account’s demand for credit, other than the account’s previous debt dynamics. These control variables
summarize this information (which also appears in the scores), including account-specific seasonality, and so are
powerful controls. We also added six future values of the regressors ∆L to equation (1), i.e. ∆Li,t+1 to ∆Li,t+6. Their
coefficients were statistically insignificant, both individually and jointly, and small in magnitude. This suggests that
the high-frequency variation in lines exploited here is not an endogenous response to preceding debt dynamics. This
implication can also be illustrated using the event-study specification. Let bs be the coefficient from regressing (Di,t+s
-Di,t-1) on (Li,t -Li,t-1), for a line change at t. s<0 represents the "pre-event" window. The estimated bs for s = -6 to -1
are insignificant and small, especially conditioning on the credit scores. Thus debt is not significantly changing in
advance of the line increases, only afterwards.
18
    If the issuer’s variable that directly records the month of the latest line change is missing, we recreate it when
possible. We can compute the number of months since an account’s most recent line change within the sample
period, for all but its first line change within the sample.


                                                            20
these instruments are quite significant (p-value < .0001), with an R2 of about 0.03, which is

relatively large in the context of related micro studies; they also pass the overidentification test.

The results are in row (6). Again bTot does not change very much, rising slightly to 0.11.

Reassuringly the standard errors remain small and the underlying impulse response remains

smooth.

       To bolster these results we add some control variables (from month t-1) to equation (1),

in addition to instrumenting for the line changes. Row (7) again adds the third order polynomials

in the two credit scores, which for the issuers summarize the history of account behavior. This

specification compares accounts whose past behavior was similar, but some are getting line

increases in a given month and others are not, because they happen to be on different timing

cycles. To ensure that our instruments are not biased against younger accounts, we also include a

third order polynomial in account age. There is no reason to believe that the correlation of the

remaining variation in credit line policy with the instruments is endogenous. These controls

decrease bTot slightly to 0.08, but it remains quite significant. Row (8) instead adds dummy

variables for the total number of line increases an account receives during the entire sample

period. These variables control for the factors justifying the line increases. The remaining

variation is purely in the high-frequency timing of the increases. Nonetheless bTot remains

significant and large.

       We conclude that endogeneity is not driving the results. They remain remarkably

consistent across a large number of specifications, with richer controls and instruments than

available in most previous studies of credit supply. There appears to be a causal link from

liquidity to debt, with an average MPC between 10-14 percent depending on the specification.




                                                 21
         Although interest rates are analyzed in the next section, it is important to ensure that they

are not confounding the results here for credit limits. Row (9) adds to equation (1) the change in

interest rates (∆r) with 12 lags. The reported bTot for credit limits does not materially change.19 In

analogy with an Euler equation [e.g., Campbell and Mankiw 1990], row (10) adds instead the

level of interest rates with 12 lags (r, not ∆r). bTot remains the same as in the previous row.

         Finally, to determine the effect of line increases on the aggregate economy, it matters

whether net debt is increasing, or whether people are simply shifting balances away from their

other credit cards to their card in the main sample with the new, larger credit line. Row (11)

shows the results using the change in other credit card balances held by the account-holder as the

dependent variable in equation (1). A negative value for bTot would represent balance-shifting, an

offsetting decline in balances on other cards. The estimated bTot is however insignificant and

positive. Thus there is no evidence of offset from the other cards, so the previous results

represent a net increase in debt, and hence have aggregate implications.20



                               VI.      RESULTS: CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES

         Table III estimates the effect of interest rates on debt, using equation (2), again beginning

with the credit cards in the main sample. In row (1), the long-run effect bTot (≡b9) is about -$110,

a large and significant coefficient (with t-ratio about 13). Each percentage point increase in the

interest rate leads to a $110 decline in debt on average, within 9 months. Thus higher interest

rates lead to substantially less borrowing – people are in fact sensitive to interest rates. The


19
   This follows from the fact that line changes and rate changes are not disproportionately correlated. This fact also
supports the conclusion above regarding endogeneity. Unconstrained, optimal credit policy would determine credit
lines and interest rates jointly, presumably resulting in greater correlation.
20
   Furthermore, adding other balances directly as a control variable in equation (1) has little effect on the previous
results.


                                                         22
impulse response, graphed in Figure II, is again quite smooth and significant. It shows that debt

responds immediately, declining by about $70 in the first two months after a rate change. These

estimates correspond to short-run and long-run elasticities of about -0.8 and -1.3, respectively.

They are larger and more significant than in most other micro studies of interest rates. Again the

difference is probably due to the large sample and reduced measurement error in our data, both in

debt and in interest rates, which are the account-specific marginal cost of credit. 21

           The other rows of Table III display various extensions. First, row (2) controls for cross-

sectional differences in credit limits by normalizing debt by the credit limit. The dependent

variable is the change in this debt ratio (∆(D/L)i,t). The impulse response remains qualitatively

similar to that in Figure II, with each percentage point increase in interest rates reducing the

normalized debt ratio by about 1.7 percentage points. Since the average credit limit is about

$6200, this is consistent with the results in row (1). The next few rows address the endogeneity

of interest rates, using specifications analogous to those above for credit limits. In rows (3)-(5),

adding to equation (2) fixed effects or the fundamental account attributes (the scores, plus

account age and debt) does not materially change the results. This again suggests that the

variation being exploited is exogenous.

           As with credit limits, the issuers also use exogenous timing rules for interest rates, for

instance changing rates after fixed periods like 6 months or 12 months. Row (6) therefore

instruments with dummy variables for the number of months since the latest rate change. The

first-stage R2 is about 0.02. (Again the instruments are very significant, with p-value < .0001, and

pass the overidentification test.) The resulting bTot is somewhat smaller in magnitude than before,

at about -$80, but still quite significant. In row (7), adding to the IV specification third order

21
     The results using the percentage change in the interest rate, ∆r/r, are qualitatively similar to those reported.


                                                              23
polynomials in the credit scores and account age increases the magnitude of bTot. Thus, even

controlling for account fundamentals the exogenous timing rules affect debt. Row (8) instead

controls for the number of interest rate changes each account receives during the sample period.

bTot remains quite significant. This coefficient reflects purely exogenous variation in the timing of

rate changes, even controlling for the fact that rates changed. Row (9) confirms that these results

are not due to changes in credit limits. Overall, the results are again remarkably consistent across

specifications. We conclude that they are not driven by endogeneity.

        Row (10) distinguishes the effects of increases versus decreases in interest rates, by

interacting the regressors ∆r and its lags in equation (2) with indicator variables for their signs.

The resulting long-run effect for increases in rates is bTot∆r>0 = -$90, for decreases in rates bTot ∆r<0

= -$320. That is, debt declines in response to increases in borrowing rates, and rises even more
                                                                                  ∆r<0
strongly in response to decreases in borrowing rates (with bTot                          significantly larger in

magnitude than bTot ∆r>0). Such an asymmetry implies that temporary interest rate reductions can

ratchet up the amount of debt. This implication can explain the widespread use of promotional

offers like teaser rates.22

        These results also suggest the possibility that when interest rates change people are

transferring balances between their card in the main sample and their other cards. Row (11) uses

other card balances as the dependent variable in equation (2). A positive bTot would represent

balance-shifting away from a card whose interest rate has increased. In fact the estimated bTot is

almost +$40, and significant at the 6 percent level. For each percentage point rise in the interest

rate on the card in the main sample, while its debt declines by about $110, other card balances


22
   Debt is more sensitive to large changes in rates, resulting from promotional offers, than small changes, but even
the response to small changes is significant. (See the working paper.)


                                                        24
rise by about $40 on average, for a net decline of about $70. Therefore there appears to be some

balance-shifting between cards. People’s sensitivity to interest rates is large enough to overcome

some switching costs. However the balance-shifting is only partial; there is a net decline in total

borrowing. The net long-run elasticity is still large at about -0.85.



                                  VII.   HETEROGENEITY AND INTERPRETATION

              The results so far do not distinguish whether all people are responding equally to credit

supply, or whether the response is limited to part of the sample. We now investigate the

heterogeneity in people's responses. The goal is to identify what models of consumption explain

these responses and credit card usage more generally.

              Table IV starts with the leading alternative to the PIH, liquidity constraints. Panel A

analyzes the effects of credit line changes. It includes the controls for manual changes to ensure

they are not driving the results; the reported bTot is for the automatic changes. Equation (1) is re-

estimated distinguishing accounts according to their initial utilization rate (balances divided by

the line).23 To avoid endogeneity, this rate is taken from month t-13, the beginning of the

distributed lag horizon in equation (1). Indicator variables were created for accounts with initial

utilization above 0.90 and for accounts with utilization below 0.50. The omitted category is

initial utilization between 0.50 and 0.90. These indicators were interacted with all lags of ∆L in

equation (1). The results appear in row (1). The people starting at over 90 percent utilization are

the ones most likely to be facing binding liquidity constraints. In fact their MPC out of liquidity

bTot util>.9 is almost 50 percent and quite significant. This coefficient is significantly larger than bTot
util .5-.9
             and bTot util<.5 for the lower utilization groups. Hence the MPC varies with utilization. The




                                                       25
sharp response by the high utilization group suggests that their liquidity constraints are indeed

binding. This is concrete evidence that liquidity constraints matter.

         However, even the people starting at lower levels of utilization significantly respond to

liquidity. bTot util .5-.9 is almost 0.16 and even bTot util<.5 for people with most of their line free is 0.07.

Both coefficients are statistically significant (though not significantly different from each

other).24 In absolute terms, these coefficients correspond to average increases in debt of about

$500 and $170 per line increase, substantial amounts. This evidence is inconsistent with the view

that only currently binding liquidity constraints matter.

         The evidence is, however, potentially consistent with the interaction of precautionary

motives and the possibility that liquidity constraints bind in the future, as in buffer-stock models

[Deaton 1991, Carroll 1992, Ludvigson 1999]. In the current context, these models generate an

optimal amount of credit card line to keep free, as a precautionary buffer against future adverse

shocks, and hence pin down the utilization rate. Changes in credit limits can then generate

changes in borrowing even at utilization rates well below 100 percent, as in row (1).

         To further evaluate the buffer-stock model, we consider a simple, homothetic version (as

in Ludvigson, 1999), in which the optimal buffer of unused credit can be a constant fraction of

the credit line, generating a constant target utilization rate. To test this possibility, in row (2) the

dependent variable in equation (1) is replaced by the change in the utilization rate (∆utilizationi,t).

The coefficients bTot now represent the long-run, cumulative response of utilization after a line

increase, separately by initial utilization rate as before. The estimated bTot are quite small, within a


23
   Because the credit limit constrains the magnitude of total balances, not just debt, we include transactions balances
as well as debt in the numerator of utilization. The conclusions are similar using just debt in the numerator.
24
   The impulse response coefficients {bk} jointly differ across the two lower utilization groups. And both of their
impulse responses differ from that for the high utilization group. Thus there are differences in the paths of debt, not
only in the long-run effects bTot.


                                                          26
percentage point or so of zero. Hence, for each utilization group, in the long-run utilization

returns back near its initial level (that is, about 90 percent for someone starting at 90 percent

utilization, about 50 percent for someone starting at 50 percent utilization, etc.).25 These

dynamics are consistent with people having constant target utilization rates, at least on average.

Of course such targeting could be due to behavioral rules-of-thumb, but as noted it is also

compatible with conventional precautionary motives.26 Under either explanation, the important

point is that additional liquidity increases debt even at low utilization rates, leading to larger

aggregate effects than if only currently binding constraints mattered.

        Row (3) tests whether liquidity constrained people are less sensitive to changes in interest

rates. Equation (2) is estimated distinguishing increases and decreases in interest rates (as in row

(10) of Table III), both interacted with the three initial utilization groups as before (with

utilization taken from month t-10). This yields six different coefficients bTot for the long-run

effects of interest rates. The estimated coefficients vary non-monotonically with utilization, for

both increases and decreases in rates. For decreases in rates, accounts with utilization between

0.5-0.9 are the most sensitive to interest rates, accounts with utilization above 0.9 are the least

sensitive (with the difference between them statistically significant). The credit limit

automatically constrains high utilization people from substantially increasing their debt in

response to lower interest rates, but it does not prevent people from decreasing their debt in

response to higher rates. For increases in rates, the estimated bTot∆r>0 is again smaller for

accounts with utilization above 0.9 than for accounts with utilization between 0.5-0.9, though not

25
   The underlying impulse responses are illustrated in the working paper. To summarize them, in the month of the
line increase utilization rates sharply decline, because the line in the denominator of utilization has risen. But
thereafter the cumulative coefficients {bk} smoothly rise, back up near zero within five months or so.




                                                       27
significantly so (only at the 13 percent level). This non-monotonicity of interest-rate elasticities is

again consistent with liquidity constraints.

        Table V examines other dimensions of heterogeneity in credit card usage. To begin with,

column (1) shows how utilization rates vary across accounts of different characteristics, reporting

the fraction of accounts with high utilization rates, above 0.90. Each row splits the sample at the

median of the corresponding characteristic, including the real income and age of the account-

holder derived from the credit application data. For the overall sample, almost 14 percent of

accounts have high utilization. But for young account-holders, in row (4), this fraction rises to

about 18 percent, which is consistent with other evidence that the young are disproportionately

liquidity constrained [Jappelli 1990]. In row (2) people with low credit scores are much more

likely to have high utilization rates than people with high scores, 26 percent versus 2 percent.27

This result is also consistent with liquidity constraints, because lenders are reluctant to extend

credit to people with low scores. However reverse causation is likely also to be at play, because

high debt levels can lead to lower scores. Low income and newer accounts (time since booking)

have slightly higher utilization rates than average (rows (3) and (5)).28

        The more direct test of liquidity constraints looks for high MPCs out of liquidity, as

reported in column (2). Indicator variables for being above the median of each characteristic are

interacted with all the lags of ∆L in equation (1). For the time-varying characteristics (credit

26
   Indeed, rule-of-thumb targets for utilization rates might serve to approximate optimal buffer-stock policies for
liquidity. Allen and Carroll [2000] consider how close rule-of-thumb consumption behavior comes to optimal
behavior.
27
   Table V uses the normalized internal scores; using the external scores yields similar conclusions.
28
   These results apply to individual bankcard accounts. Utilization rates calculated from the 1995 SCF, which
combines all bankcards a household owns, are smaller in magnitude because of the underreporting of debt discussed
in Footnote 2. Only 3 percent of SCF households with bankcards report combined utilization rates above 90 percent.
Nonetheless the cross-sectional effects of household age and income in the SCF are qualitatively the same as in
Table V. Also, credit bureau sources report that during our sample period about 15 percent of individuals with
bankcards had combined utilization rates above 90 percent, consistent with our account data.


                                                        28
limits and scores), the indicator is taken from month t-13 (t-10 for interest rates in column (3)).

For the other characteristics derived from application data and hence essentially cross-sectional

(income and age of the account-holder, age of the account), the indicator is based on their values

in 1995, the start of the sample period.29 Column (2) includes again the controls for manual line

changes, except in row (3).30 In row (1), the MPCs bTot are similar in magnitude for accounts with

small and large credit limits, and not significantly different (p-value = .675). Thus the response

of debt to the credit limit is independent of the size of the limit, at least within the range in the

sample. This result supports the specification in equation (1), which uses the absolute change in

the limit as the independent variable. In row (2) the MPC for people with low credit scores is

substantially larger than for people with high scores, significantly so at the 7 percent level. This

bolsters the previous evidence that low credit scores reinforce liquidity constraints. Unless the

scores are themselves functions of the MPC, which seems unlikely, this result is not due to

reverse causation. Row (3) shows that low income people have a larger MPC on average, though

not significantly so. In row (4) young people have a much larger MPC than older people, about

double in magnitude though not significantly different. (The result is similar for the youngest

quartile of account-holders.) This is again consistent with liquidity constraints. Similarly in row

(5), newer accounts have somewhat larger MPCs on average. Overall, these results suggest that

liquidity constraints are pervasive and vary across the population, disproportionately affecting

low income and, in particular, young people. They also highlight the importance of the credit

scores in gaining access to credit. Yet the results are less significant than those in Table IV,


29
   That is, we computed account and account-holder age in 1995. For real income (1982-84$) in 1995, we assumed a
real growth rate of 2.5 percent per year to allow for growth in income between the time of application and 1995. The
results are similar using nearby growth rates.
30
   To ensure sufficient pooling, since income is often missing. We have confirmed that the conclusions for income
are the same including the manual controls.


                                                        29
which split the sample directly by utilization rates. There is a great amount of heterogeneity

regarding liquidity constraints even within each of these characteristic groups of people.

        Column (3) contrasts how the same groups respond to changes in interest rates. To

control for cross-sectional variation in credit limits, the dependent variable is again normalized

by the limit (∆(D/L)i,t, as in row (2) of Table III). People with low scores and low income are less

sensitive to interest rates, significantly at the 6 percent and 10 percent levels respectively. This is

again consistent with liquidity constraints. However young people and newer accounts are

slightly more sensitive to interest rates, though neither distinction is significant.

        Turning to Table VI, the bottom two rows examine alternative measures of liquidity

constraints, using data from the 1995 SCF. Overall (in column (1)), 67 percent of households

have a bankcard, leaving 33 percent of households without access to this important source of

credit and so possibly liquidity constrained. Access also varies substantially across demographic

groups, as shown in columns (2)-(4). Low income, young, and low education households are

much less likely to have bankcards. The bottom row of Table VI reports the fraction of

households borrowing (i.e., paying interest) on bankcards, conditional on having a bankcard.

(See the Data Appendix for SCF data definitions.) On average 56 percent of bankcard-holding

households are borrowing on their cards (column (1)), a remarkably large fraction, and probably

a lower bound considering the measurement error in the SCF. (See Footnote 2.) These

households would be considered liquidity constrained under the weaker notion of an operative

wedge between borrowing and lending rates. Credit card interest rates averaged over 16 percent

during the sample period (Table I), much larger than typical saving rates.31 The fraction of

households borrowing also varies across demographic groups, as indicated in columns (2)-(4).




                                                   30
The effect of income and education is not monotonic, with both very low and very high income

and education households less likely to borrow than households in the middle. Nonetheless it is

surprising that 52 percent of high income households and 49 percent of high education

households are borrowing on their credit cards. Young households are much more likely to

borrow than old households, 69 percent versus 29 percent, and so again appear disproportionately

liquidity constrained.

         The results so far are arguably consistent with conventional models of liquidity

constraints reinforced by precautionary motives. However conventional models have more

trouble explaining some other aspects of credit card use. Most saliently, why does such a large

fraction of the population hold credit card debt? And why do so many of these borrowers

simultaneously hold assets yielding low returns?

         We begin with the first question. Conventional buffer-stock models calibrated using

historical income profiles have difficulty rationalizing so much borrowing. Motivated in part by

our results, Laibson et. al. [2000] show that allowing for hyperbolic discounting substantially

increases the fraction of households that would borrow on their credit cards, though not quite

enough to match the data, especially for high wealth households. Hyperbolic discounting also

raises the average MPC.32 Alternatively, perhaps people expect that their future income will rise

faster than calibrated using historical data (the "new era" view), justifying more borrowing.



31
   As Table I reports, the debt-weighted interest rate is actually a little larger than the average rate. This rules out the
possibility that most of the credit card borrowing is done at low, promotional interest rates.
32
   The consumption policy functions for the hyperbolic buffer-stock consumers are qualitatively similar to those for
the exponential buffer-stock consumers. Hence the difference between them is primarily quantitative, and depends
on the model calibration. Laibson et. al. carefully calibrate their models with realistic returns, if anything biased in
favor of credit card borrowing. Related simulations in Angelatos et. al. [2000] of conventional buffer-stock models
generate an average MPC out of predictable income, which should be an upper bound to the MPC out of liquidity, of
about 0.03-0.06, well below the 0.10-0.14 estimated in this paper. Changing the discounting from exponential to
hyperbolic raises the MPC out of predictable income to about 0.17-0.27.


                                                            31
       Turning to the second question above, the portfolio puzzle, Table VI describes the asset

holdings of bankcard borrowers. Column (1) starts with the overall sample averages. Conditional

on borrowing on their bankcards, 95 percent of households have positive net worth and so could

have paid off some of their expensive credit card debt by drawing down various assets. For

instance, almost 70 percent have positive housing equity, and so would be better off using lower

cost home-equity debt (currently charging around 7-9 percent, not including tax deductions).

Over 90 percent have positive holdings of financial assets, even excluding illiquid, tax-favored

retirement assets. Most puzzling of all, over 90 percent of people with credit card debt have some

very liquid assets in checking and savings accounts, which usually yield at most 1-2 percent.

Granted, some transactions cannot easily be made using credit cards – though it behooves

borrowers to seek out vendors accepting credit cards, and the ability to write checks against

credit card accounts, or to take out cash advances, increases the scope of possible transactions.

To accommodate cash transactions, Table VI allows for one month's worth of gross total

household income to be kept in liquid assets for transactions purposes, which is arguably

generous. Yet 1/3 of credit card borrowers still have more than this much income in liquid assets.

These assets could instead have been used to pay down their credit card debt. These results

persist even for people with substantial debt. For over 10 percent of bankcard-holding

households, bankcard debt amounts to more than one month’s income. Yet again about 1/3 of

these high-debt households have over one month’s income in liquid assets.

       Such behavior is puzzling, apparently inconsistent with no-arbitrage and thus inconsistent

with any conventional model. Perhaps behavioral models of self-control or mental accounts

might help explain it. For example, some people might need to undertake costly actions to limit

their “impulse” spending (or spending by their spouses). By not fully paying off credit card


                                               32
balances, people can reduce their liquidity and thereby help reduce the temptation of available

credit. Laibson et. al. [2000] develop a more sophisticated model of self-control. They show that

hyperbolic consumers are more likely than exponential consumers to simultaneously borrow on

credit cards and invest in an illiquid asset of a given return. But hyperbolic discounting alone

cannot justify simultaneously borrowing and holding liquid assets, which violates no-arbitrage.

Alternatively, borrowers planning to file for bankruptcy have an incentive to hold some assets, up

to the amounts protected by the bankruptcy exemption rules [Lehnert and Maki 2000]. However

such strategic bankruptcy planning should be undertaken only just before filing, to avoid paying

unnecessary interest.

       The remaining columns of Table VI show how these asset holdings vary with

demographic characteristics. Each borrowing group holds substantial assets on average. Even for

high income and high education households (columns (2) and (4)), over a third of borrowers

simultaneously hold more than one month’s income in liquid assets. Hence the puzzle of credit

card borrowing is not limited to a single demographic group.



                                        VIII.   CONCLUSION


       This paper has analyzed how consumer debt responds to changes in credit supply. We

utilized a unique new data set of credit card accounts to estimate both MPCs out of liquidity and

interest-rate elasticities. We also evaluated the ability of different models of consumption and

saving to rationalize these estimates, distinguishing the PIH, liquidity constraints, buffer-stock,

and behavioral models. The data set separately records credit limits and balances, allowing us to

distinguish credit supply and demand, as well as account-specific interest rates. It also provides




                                                33
an unusually rich set of controls and instruments for the endogeneity of credit supply. While

measurement error might have thwarted previous studies of credit supply using traditional

household data sets, it is much less a problem here. As a result the “event studies” in this paper

provide more powerful tests than usual of whether liquidity constraints and interest rates really

matter in practice.

       We found that increases in credit limits generate an immediate and significant rise in

debt, counter to the PIH. The average long-run MPC out of liquidity ranges between 10-14

percent. The MPC is much larger for people starting near their credit limit, providing concrete

evidence that liquidity constraints are binding. However, even people starting well below their

limit significantly respond. We showed this response is consistent with buffer-stock models of

precautionary saving. Nonetheless there are other results that conventional models cannot easily

explain, such as the fact that many credit card borrowers simultaneously hold low yielding assets.

Behavioral models might help explain some of the remaining puzzles.

       Unlike most other studies, we also found strong effects from changes in account-specific

interest rates. The average long-run elasticity of debt to the interest rate is approximately -1.3.

Less than half of this elasticity represents balance-shifting across cards, with most reflecting net

changes in total borrowing. The elasticity is larger than average for declines in interest rates,

which can explain the widespread use of temporary promotional rates. The elasticity is smaller

for people starting near their credit limits, again consistent with liquidity constraints.

       These results help quantify the aggregate implications of changes in credit supply. To

illustrate, suppose every account exogenously received the average credit line increase of about

$2000 (the intensive margin). Given the multiplier for automatic line increases in Table II (row

(2)), this would lead to about a $200 increase in debt per bankcard. Since the average household


                                                  34
holds over 2 bankcards, this comes to over $40B in the aggregate. For comparison, this figure is

about 10 percent of the size of the annual increase in aggregate consumption. Offering new credit

cards (the extensive margin), especially to liquidity constrained households, would increase the

aggregate effect. Such large responses, however, might also change the equilibrium interest rate.

We do not know the magnitude of the resulting general equilibrium effect, but Table III (row (1))

implies that for every 1 percentage point rise in credit card rates, debt will decline by about $110

per card, potentially partly offsetting the above response. (Presumably there would be less

balance-shifting than in row (11) of Table III if interest rates rise on all cards at the same time.)

By contrast, after a monetary expansion lower interest rates would bolster the stimulative effects

of larger credit lines. Overall, the results imply that the consumer plays a potentially important

role in the transmission of monetary policy and other credit shocks.

       We also documented the pervasiveness of liquidity constraints, under different definitions

and across different demographic groups. About 1/3 of households lack bankcards, and well over

half of the households with bankcards are rolling over debt and paying high interest rates.

Almost 15 percent of bankcard accounts have utilization rates above 90 percent. Most tellingly,

for these accounts the average MPC out of liquidity is almost 50 percent. Under most of these

definitions, liquidity constraints were found to disproportionately affect young and low income

people, and people with low credit scores.

       We plan to extend this analysis in a number of ways. First, when issuers raise credit lines

or lower interest rates, they are trading off larger interest payments with larger probabilities of

default. In a companion paper, Gross and Souleles (2001), we estimated hazard models of default

using the same data source used in this paper. These two papers should be combined to identify

the profit-maximizing credit-supply function. Second, our results bear directly on the two


                                                 35
margins on which monetary policy operates, the quantity and price of credit. But we have

investigated only the second half of the consumer-credit channel, namely how people respond to

changes in the supply of credit from lenders. Little is known about the first half of the channel,

how credit card issuers and other consumer lenders change credit supply in response to monetary

policy or other business cycle shocks.

       Finally, more structural models of credit supply and demand can be constructed and

calibrated. The results of this paper and the companion paper suggest a number of features that

should be incorporated into such models. For instance, the unused line of credit serves as a

precautionary buffer; consumers have the option to default but at the cost of restricting their

future access to credit; the credit line and interest rate are endogenous functions of past

borrowing behavior; and there are wedges (possibly including those suggested by behavioral

models) between the marginal costs of cash and credit making them imperfect substitutes in

transactions.

                                                  DATA APPENDIX

         The unit of analysis is an individual bankcard account. For most accounts, statement

totals such as balances are recorded by the monthly billing cycle; for other accounts, they are

recorded by calendar month. The credit bureaus store their information by individual

borrower, not household.

         The main variable definitions are as follows. Let bali,t be account i’s balance at the end

of period t (whether by billing cycle or calendar month). Then i’s debt at the end of period t is

defined as Di,t ≡ bal i,t - paymenti,t+1, where paymenti,t+1 is i’s payment in period t+1. When

the data is tracked by cycle, this is the amount of debt rolled over into the next period. If the

data is tracked by calendar month, Di,t is set to zero if no interest charges are incurred in

period t+1.33 Li,t is the credit limit as of the start of period t. ri,t is the interest rate (annual

percentage rate) as of the start of period t, including any promotional rate underway. If there

are separate credit limits and interest rates for retail purchases, cash advances, etc., we use the

variables for retail purchases. (The credit limit for retail purchases is usually the overall credit

limit for the account.) The utilization rate is the ratio of balances to the credit limit,

utilizationi,t ≡ bali,t/Li,t. A manual line increase is one requested by the consumer; an

automatic line increase is initiated by the issuers’ automated systems. The internal credit-risk

scores are measures of account risk and profitability based on account data from the issuer;

the external scores are based on data from the credit bureaus across all sources of credit held




33
   For balances tracked by calendar month, the main results use Di,t only if nonnegative, but are insensitive to this
distinction. For a subsample of accounts we have balances by both calendar month and cycle. In this subsample, this
definition of debt by calendar month yields quantitatively very similar results as those using actual debt by cycle.
Alternative definitions, including retaining the negative values of Di,t or not subtracting paymenti,t+1 from bali,t, yield
similar but slightly noisier results.
by the account-holder. The credit bureau variable on other balances records total balances on

other credit cards held by the account-holder, including transactions balances, not just debt.

       The SCF data is weighted to be representative of the US, and generally limited to

bankcard debt (e.g., not including retail-store credit cards). Bankcard debt comes from

variable #413: “After the last payment(s) (was/were) made on (this/these) [bankcard]

accounts(s), roughly what was the balance still owed on (this/all these) account(s)?” A

household is said to be borrowing on its bankcards if this variable is positive.

The unit of observation is a credit card account. Debt is interest-incurring balances, as defined in
the text. The differenced variables represent monthly changes. Debt and credit limits are
measured in current dollars (1995-98). The sample is that used for Table II, except for the
interest rate statistics which correspond to Table III (# obs =185151).

A distributed lag model (equation (1)) was used to estimate the dynamic response of credit card debt ∆D to changes
in credit limits ∆L including 12 lags. bTot (= b12) gives the long-run, cumulative change in debt as a fraction of the
change in the line (the MPC out of liquidity), dD/dL. All regressions include a full set of month dummies. The
standard errors allow for heteroscedasticity across accounts as well as serial correlation within accounts. Sample
sizes vary with missing variables. Row (2) distinguishes manual line changes (requested by the consumer) from
automatic changes (initiated by the issuer), and includes separate intercepts for each case. Rows (3)-(8) include the
controls for the manual line changes; the reported bTot is for the automatic changes. Row (3) includes a fixed effect by
account. Row (4) includes as controls a cubic polynomial in the normalized credit scores, both internal and external,
interacted by issuer dummies; and then twelve lags of all these terms (i.e., 2 scores x 3 polynomial terms x 13 lags x
issuer dummies). Row (5) includes cubic polynomials in the two scores, debt and account age; all from month t-1
and all interacted by issuer dummies. Rows (6)-(8) instrument for ∆L with indicator variables for the number of
months since the latest change in line. Row (7) includes as controls cubic polynomials in the two scores and account
age, from month t-1. Row (8) includes dummy variables for the total number of line changes each account received
during the sample period. Row (9) includes as controls the change in account interest rate with 12 lags. Row (10)
includes instead the level of the interest rate with 12 lags. In row (11) the dependent variable is balances on other

A distributed lag model (equation (2)) was used to estimate the dynamic response of credit card debt ∆D to changes
in credit card interest rates ∆r including 9 lags. bTot (= b9) gives the long-run, cumulative change in debt per
percentage point increase in rates, dD/dr. All regressions include a full set of month dummies. The standard errors
allow for heteroscedasticity across accounts as well as serial correlation within accounts. Sample sizes vary with
missing variables. In row (2) only, the dependent variable is the change in the ratio of debt to the credit limit. Row
(3) includes a fixed effect by account. Row (4) includes as controls a cubic polynomial in the normalized credit
scores, both internal and external, interacted by issuer dummies; and then nine lags of all these terms (i.e., 2 scores x
3 polynomial terms x 10 lags x issuer dummies). Row (5) includes cubic polynomials in the two scores, debt and
account age; all from month t-1 and all interacted by issuer dummies. Rows (6)-(8) instrument for ∆r with indicator
variables for the number of months since the latest change in rates. Row (7) includes as controls cubic polynomials in
the two scores and account age, from month t-1. Row (8) includes dummy variables for the total number of rate
changes each account received during the sample period. Row (9) includes as controls the change in account credit
limit with 9 lags. Row (10) distinguishes the response to increases versus decreases in interest rates, including
separate intercepts for each case. In row (11) the dependent variable is balances on other credit cards held by the

This table contrasts the response of debt to credit supply (bTot) across accounts starting with different initial
utilization rates (balances divided by the credit limit). In Panel A, for changes in credit limits (equation (1)),
utilization is taken from month t-13; in Panel B, for changes in interest rates (equation (2)), it is taken from month t-
10. Row (3) also distinguishes increases versus decreases in interest rates, for each utilization group. In rows (1) and
(3) the dependent variable is the change in debt ∆D. In row (2) it is the change in utilization rate. Panel A includes
controls for manual credit limit changes; the reported bTot is for the automatic changes. All regressions include
separate intercepts for each utilization group, and a full set of month dummies. The standard errors allow for
heteroscedasticity across accounts as well as serial correlation within accounts.

This table contrasts the response of debt to credit supply (bTot) across accounts of different characteristics. In column
(2) the dependent variable is the change in debt ∆D and the independent variables are changes in the credit limit ∆L
(equation (1)). In column (3) the dependent variable is the change in debt normalized by the line and the independent
variables are changes in interest rates ∆r (equation (2)). Each row in column (2) and in column (3) represents a
separate regression. Column (1) reports the fraction of accounts with utilization rates above 90 percent. Each row
splits the sample at (approximately) the median of the characteristic in that row. For the time-varying characteristics
in rows (1) and (2), the characteristics are taken from month t-13 for credit limits (column (2)), month t-10 for
interest rates (column (3)). For the characteristics in rows (3)-(5), which come from cross-sectional application data,
their 1995 values are used. Row (2) uses the normalized internal credit score. Income is real application income
(1982-84$), extrapolated to 1995 assuming a real growth rate of 2.5 percent per year. The reported p-values are for
tests that bTot is the same across both groups in the row. Except for row (3), column (2) includes controls for manual
credit limit changes; the reported bTot is for the automatic changes. See text for further details. All regressions include
separate intercepts for each characteristic group, and a full set of month dummies. Sample sizes vary with missing
variables. The standard errors allow for heteroscedasticity across accounts as well as serial correlation within
accounts.

Source: 1995 SCF. N = 3258. Results are weighted to be representative of the U.S. The bottom two rows give the
fraction of households in each group (each column) that have bankcards, and the fraction that are borrowing on their
bankcards conditional on having bankcards. Borrowing households are those rolling over positive bankcard balances
after their latest payments. The columns labeled "% positive" give the fraction of households in the group whose
holdings of the asset in that row are positive. Asset definitions generally follow standard SCF codebook suggestions,
with the exception that net worth does not include credit card debt. Non-retirement financial assets exclude IRA’s
and defined-contribution pensions. Liquid assets include amounts in checking, saving, money-market, and brokerage
call accounts. Income is gross total household income. Asset holdings are all conditional on having and borrowing
on at least one bankcard. Age and education refer to the household head. Columns (2) and (3) contrast the bottom
25%, the middle 50%, and the top 25% of the income and age distributions respectively.
