                                             ABSTRACT

Does quality of care systematically differ among government-owned, private not-for-profit, and
for-profit hospitals? A large empirical literature provides conflicting evidence. Through quantitative
review of 46 studies since 1990, we find that several study features that can explain divergent results:
analytic methods, disease studied, and data sources. For unprofitable care, how studies handle market
competition and regional differences account for substantial variation. Policymakers should be aware
that differences in results appear to arise predominantly from differences between studies’ analytic
methods. Moreover, conventional methods of meta-analytic synthesis should be applied with great
caution given the considerable overlap among studied hospitals.

I.   Background

       Does quality of care systematically differ among government-owned, private not-for-

profit, and for-profit hospitals? This question is of considerable policy importance in the United

States and many other countries. A large empirical literature on this topic provides conflicting

evidence. Unlike the clinical literature, systematic reviews and meta-analysis remain rare for

such questions of health service delivery, and none to date focuses on explaining the

heterogeneity in study results.

       The objective of this systematic review is to examine what factors explain the diversity of

findings regarding hospital ownership and quality of care, as well as measures of benefits

provided to a hospital’s surrounding community (including uncompensated care to the poor and

uninsured and other unprofitable services). We employ meta-regressions to quantify

heterogeneity explained by study-level variables hypothesized to effect results—such as each

study’s methodology to account for confounding factors, whether the study analyzes patient- or

hospital-level data (or both), time period of the data or regions covered. Our review is part of a

larger project applying meta-analytic techniques to the literature since 1990 on hospital

ownership and performance; Shen and colleagues report the results on financial performance and

ownership.1

       The only previous systematic review of hospital ownership and quality of which we are

aware identified 15 studies published between 1988 and 2001 comparing mortality rates among

private not-for-profit and for-profit hospitals.2 Our study differs from theirs in several respects:

we focus on explaining variation, rather than suggesting “one overall answer”; we include

studies analyzing patient outcomes other than mortality (e.g., adverse events), as well as

measures of community benefits; we include government ownership in the review; we do not




                                                 2
exclude studies analyzing ownership conversions, but rather test the hypothesis that conversion

studies differ systematically from others; and perhaps most importantly, we address the problem

of applying conventional meta-analytic techniques to this literature because many studies

analyze overlapping samples of hospitals. Our literature search identified 31 studies of patient

outcomes and 15 studies analyzing various measures of community benefits that fit our inclusion

criteria.



II.   Methods

Literature Search, Selection and Extraction

        Data Sources. Our literature search employed the keywords “hospitals,” “ownership,”

“for-profit,” “not-for-profit,” “nonprofit,” and their combinations. Databases included Medline,

EconLit (Economics Literature), and Proquest/ABI (for dissertations), as well as hand search and

work cited in previous qualitative reviews.3 We included all published and unpublished articles

or book chapters written in English between January 1990 and July 2004, initially resulting in

1357 potentially relevant studies. We identified 77 additional studies by asking corresponding

authors for any new or unpublished work comparing hospitals of different ownership forms. (See

Figure 2 of Shen et al. 2005 for literature selection process)

        Study Selection. We selected studies of general, acute, short-stay hospitals in the United

States that used multivariate analysis to study hospital performance. The hospital sample had to

include hospitals from at least two of our three included ownership forms (government-owned,

private not-for-profit and private for-profit). We excluded studies that only compared sub-

categories of ownership (such as religious vs. secular private not-for-profits) or focused on

hospitals of the Department of Veterans Affairs. From the 340 studies fitting these selection




                                                  3
criteria, we further narrowed down the field to studies examining one or more of the following

outcomes: financial performance; patient outcomes (mortality, complications, and other adverse

outcomes); uncompensated care, unprofitable services or other measures of community benefits;

or staffing. Two authors (Eggleston and Shen) independently applied these selection criteria,

achieving 7% discrepancy in coding, with consensus resolution of all differences. From the 169

citations that fell within this outcome scope, we excluded duplicates (such as dissertations and

subsequently published papers), studies with very small sample sizes (fewer than 50 hospitals),

and studies that did not report needed data (e.g., ownership coefficients in a regression) and for

which authors were unable to supply that data.

       Through this search and selection process, we identified 141 studies. In this paper, we

report results from analysis of the 46 studies in two broad categories: 31 studies of patient

outcomes; and 15 studies of uncompensated care, unprofitable services, or other measures of

community benefits (henceforth referred to jointly as “unprofitable care”). We include the

complete bibliography of the included studies in the appendix.

       Data extraction. We extracted data needed to construct measures of treatment effect and

to test our pre-specified hypotheses about underlying sources of heterogeneity in studies of

hospital ownership. The data fields included each study’s data sources; sampling frame (covered

years, covered regions, number of hospitals and patients); detailed outcome definition(s); and the

ownership coefficients and their associated statistics (such as standard errors, degrees of freedom

of the empirical model, etc). Not all studies report the necessary statistics. For example, many

policy journals report only the significance level of the coefficient. We contacted the

corresponding authors to get the exact t-statistics where possible. In cases where we could not




                                                 4
get the exact number, we estimate the t-statistic by generating a random number within the

reported significance range.

       We coded each study’s analytic methods using binary variables for whether the study

included the following information: patient demographic characteristics; co-morbidities;

hospital-level characteristics (such as bed size, share of Medicare and/or Medicaid admissions);

market-level characteristics (such as per capita income, population size, concentration or

competitiveness measures); and cross-sectional or panel data estimation methods. We also coded

whether ownership variables were only included as control variables and not the main research

question of the study, and whether the analyses explicitly address ownership conversion.

       During the study design process we recruited and surveyed an expert panel of thirteen

prominent researchers in the area of hospital ownership and performance who provided input on

the research design.



Statistical Methodology


       The 47 studies analyze diverse dependent variables. Even within a narrowly defined

category (such as mortality), some dependent variables are measured as continuous variables at

the hospital-level; others are dichotomous outcomes at the patient level. In order to have a

standardized measure of ownership effect, we use the partial correlation coefficient to define

each study’s effect size based on statistics that are commonly reported in published studies (t-

statistic and degrees of freedom), standardized using the Fisher transformation.4 The partial

correlation coefficient describes the relationship between the dependent variable and the

ownership variable, holding other variables constant. It measures the correlation between a

given ownership form and performance measure, controlling for the effect of covariates.



                                                 5
       Explaining Variation in Study Results Using Meta-Regression Analysis. We

employed random-effects meta-regression analysis to quantify to what extent various study

characteristics account for heterogeneity of findings.5 The dependent variable is the standardized

effect size from each study. Empirical features of each study serve as explanatory variables. The

regression model is necessarily parsimonious, given the limited number of studies in each

category and the collinearity of many study features (such as data source and region covered).

       We hypothesized that several factors might account for a substantial fraction of between-

study variation in findings of patient outcomes. First, studies vary in the outcome analyzed (e.g.,

heart condition mortality vs. all-cause mortality) and in their unit of analysis: some use patient-

level data, while others use aggregate data at the hospital level. We group studies according to

the unit of their observations. Second, ownership differences might be affected by whether

studies examine short-term or long-term mortality rates. Third, studies vary by the type of

confounding factors they control for in the regression. Some studies were able to control for co-

morbidities, while others did not. Fourth, we hypothesized that results might be driven by the

underlying data sources: studies using Medicare claims might produce different results from

those using all-payer data. Lastly, the variation in results might also be explained by the covered

periods of the study and/or the regions studied. We also examined correlations among these

individual factors. Limited sample size and collinearity precluded including all the hypothesized

explanatory variables simultaneously.

       For unprofitable care, we had even fewer studies, and all at the hospital level. Moreover,

the analytical issues in unprofitable care are different from those of patient outcomes; market

conditions are likely to play an even larger role. We categorize studies according to how they

model market competition. Based on the theoretical and empirical literature, we hypothesize that




                                                  6
studies not explicitly accounting for hospital market competition are likely to find larger

ownership differences than those that explicitly model hospital competition (for example, by

implementing a selection model) or those that employ panel data estimation methods to

minimize the unobserved heterogeneity across markets. We also explore whether regional

differences explain heterogeneous results.

       Overlapping samples problem. Conventional meta-analyses combine results from

mutually exclusive patient populations. Yet many studies we reviewed analyze the same set of

hospitals – and potentially the same patient outcomes – in overlapping years. There are fewer

than 6000 hospitals in the United States; many hospital studies analyze national samples, and

most use one or more of a few common data sources (Medicare claims or state-specific

administrative data). For example, among the 31 patient outcome studies, the median hospital

sample size per year is 1378. In another example, of the studies using Medicare claims data

comparing private hospitals, almost three-quarters use data spanning both the 1980s and 1990s

that is representative of hospitals from the whole country, suggesting significant overlap.

       Our effect size measures, defined by partial correlation coefficients, should remain valid

when observations are correlated.6 However, the studies do not represent independent samples,

and statistical power will not increase proportionally with each additional study’s sample size.

Thus, unlike most meta-analyses with independent samples, we do not report the combined

effect size from the random-effects analyses. Our focus instead is on what explanatory variables

help to account for the wide variation in study results.

       Publication bias. We looked for evidence of publication bias by examining the

relationship between the absolute value of t-statistics and the square root of degrees of freedom7

as well as the traditional funnel plot; we do not find evidence of publication bias.




                                                  7
III. Results

       Exhibit 1 summarizes our included studies. The 31 studies of patient outcomes include

several analyzing multiple outcomes. 24 analyze short-term mortality (patient follow-up period

less than 180 days), 6 analyze long-term mortality rates (including 5 that also analyzed short-

term mortality), and 13 analyze other adverse patient outcomes, such as surgical complications

or medical errors. We also review 15 studies on measures of unprofitable care: 9 analyze

uncompensated care (charity care plus bad debt); 6 analyze unprofitable services; and 2 analyze a

broader metric of community benefits (e.g., including services to public program beneficiaries,

outreach efforts, etc.). Most studies of patient outcomes are representative of the entire United

States, but more than half of the studies comparing private nonprofit and for-profit

uncompensated care use data from California or Florida. Hospital sample sizes are often quite

large, especially for studies using panel data, suggesting that many studies analyze the same

hospitals in similar time periods. Many hospital-level analyses do not report patient sample sizes.

       The effect sizes and their confidence intervals from random-effects models for patient

outcomes and unprofitable care appear in Exhibits 2 and 3, respectively. In each case, Exhibit A

summarizes studies comparing for-profits to private not-for-profits, and Exhibit B summarizes

studies comparing government hospitals to private not-for-profits. A positive effect size

indicates that for-profits (or government hospitals) are associated with a higher level of adverse

events or unprofitable care, compared to private not-for-profit hospitals. The majority of studies

find no statistically significant difference between not-for-profit and for-profit hospitals in

mortality or other adverse events. Exhibit 2B illustrates that most studies that used nationally

representative data find government hospitals to have higher short-term mortality rates than

private not-for-profits, but less difference in long-term mortality or other adverse events. Exhibit




                                                  8
3A shows that most studies find either no difference or for-profit hospitals provide less

unprofitable care than not-for-profits do. Exhibit 3B shows that studies using panel data

estimation methods consistently find no difference between not-for-profit and government

hospitals, whereas studies using cross-sectional data and methods have wider variation in sign

and magnitude of their effect sizes.

       In all cases the chi-square test for heterogeneity clearly rejects the null hypothesis that

our combined studies are a homogeneous set (data not shown), thus validating our approach of

using random effects regression models in our meta-regressions. Similar to studies of ownership

and other aspects of performance8, a plot of sample size and t-statistics does not reveal a pattern

of t-statistics hovering around 2 regardless of sample size (not shown). Thus, we find no

evidence of publication bias.



Explaining Variation in Studies Examining Patient Outcomes

       Exhibit 4 presents our meta-regression results for variation in studies examining patient

outcomes. Each panel represents a separate regression, since we have too few studies and too

much correlation among some explanatory factors to include them all in one meta-regression. A

positive coefficient indicates that for-profits (or government hospitals) are associated with a

higher rate of adverse events than private not-for-profit hospitals. Note that the number of

observations in the meta-regression does not correspond perfectly with that in the figures; the

figures plot a single point for each study (e.g., averaging effect sizes across years if the study

reported separate results for multiple years), whereas the meta-regressions use the separate

estimates from such studies.




                                                  9
       We first consider whether differences in type of patient outcome can explain variations in

study findings about ownership. For comparisons between not-for-profit and for-profit hospitals,

the estimated constant term indicates no statistically significant difference between private not-

for-profits and for-profits for the 48% of studies analyzing all-cause mortality, the reference

group. The 21% of studies analyzing all-cause patient outcomes other than mortality also find no

difference. The remaining studies that focus on heart conditions find for-profits to have higher

rates of adverse outcomes at a 5% level of significance. The low I-squared indicates that

accounting for categories of patient outcome helps to explain significant heterogeneity across

studies – in this case, the covariates explain 67% of the variation.

       For comparisons of government hospitals to not-for-profits, the half of studies analyzing

all-cause mortality (the reference group) is associated with a strongly significant finding of

higher government mortality or other adverse events (with a magnitude more than twice that

found for heart-disease studies comparing for-profits to not-for-profits). Studies of heart

conditions (22% on mortality and 11% on adverse outcomes) found higher rates of adverse

events in government hospitals, although the quality gap is smaller (adding the coefficient to the

reference group/constant of 0.046 yields about 0.023). Studies of all-cause patient outcomes

other than mortality find essentially no difference between private not-for-profit and government

hospitals.

       The second set of meta-regressions reported in Exhibit 4 examines the proportion of

heterogeneity explained by different studies’ level or unit of analysis. For comparisons of

private hospitals, the estimated constant term indicates no statistically significant difference

between not-for-profits and for-profits for the 29% of studies with patient-level analyses, the

reference group. Hospital-level analyses yield a point estimate of worse for-profit quality, but




                                                 10
the coefficient does not reach statistical significance at conventional levels. The remaining 40%

of studies utilize both patient- and hospital- level analyses. This category refers to studies in

which the hospital-level dependent variable is constructed from a regression using patient-level

data, to control for confounding from patient demographics. Such combined-level analyses find

worse for-profit quality, with the same point estimate as for hospital-level analyses, now

statistically significant at the 10% level.

        Patient-level analyses also suggest no statistically significant difference between not-for-

profit and government hospitals, whereas hospital-level analyses find government hospitals

associated with higher mortality and other adverse events. Studies using a combination of

patient- and hospital-level data also find government hospitals associated with lower quality; this

latter effect is significant at the 2% level, but about half the magnitude of the hospital-only

analyses, indicating that both-level analyses find less of a quality gap between government

hospitals and not-for-profits than hospital-level analyses do.

        The third set of meta-regressions test the hypothesis that differences in patient follow-up

period explain heterogeneity of study results. Studies of mortality usually specify whether

patient follow-up was only in-hospital or was all-location (e.g., linking patients to death

certificates) for a specific period of time, such as 30 days post-admission. Studies of other

adverse events seldom report when the adverse event occurs. For private hospitals, none of these

categories are associated with a statistically significant difference between private not-for-profits

and for-profits.

        For studies including a comparison of private not-for-profit and government hospitals, the

56% of studies using in-hospital and unspecified period of patient follow-up find government




                                                 11
hospitals associated with significantly higher mortality and rates of other adverse events. Studies

examining other categories of patient follow-up do not differ statistically from that result.

       In the next panel, we test our hypothesis that data sources might explain a significant

proportion of between-study heterogeneity. Studies using the National Long Term Care Survey

find not-for-profits associated with lower quality than for-profits. Studies using Medicare or

other data sources tend to find no statistically significant difference between private not-for-

profits and for-profits. For private not-for-profit and government hospitals, the 72% of studies

using Medicare claims are associated with findings of lower quality in government-owned

hospitals, although the difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels.

       In testing the hypothesis for co-morbidity adjustment, we find that the one-third of

studies with no co-morbidity information find statistically significant higher rates of mortality

and other adverse events in for-profit hospitals. By contrast, the two-thirds of studies that

explicitly control for confounding from patient co-morbidities are associated with no statistically

significant difference between not-for-profits and for-profits. Studies comparing private not-for-

profit and government hospitals find government hospitals associated with higher mortality and

rates of other adverse events, with an even larger quality gap in the half of studies that adjust for

co-morbidities. Note that including patient co-morbidity information is positively correlated

with some weakness in study design—most of these are studies that examined only in-hospital or

unspecified patient follow-up period and have data only from the 1980s. Differences in covered

periods also explain some heterogeneity; more recent data is generally associated with fewer

ownership differences in patient outcomes. For private hospitals, a meta-regression reveals that

studies using data only from the 1980s and studies that use data spanning the 1980s and 1990s

consistently report lower for-profit quality. The 35% of studies using data from the 1990s




                                                  12
forward are associated with virtually no difference between private not-for-profits and for-profits,

although that coefficient is only borderline significant at conventional levels.

         Among studies that included government hospitals, studies using data only from the

1980s find higher mortality and rates of other adverse events in government hospitals (0.021 +

0.032 = 0.053, about the same magnitude as that associated with hospital-level analyses).

Studies spanning the 1980s and 1990s find a smaller quality gap (by about 50%), and studies

using 1990s or more recent data do not differ statistically from those spanning the 1980s and

1990s.

         Overall, these study features explain a substantial portion of the heterogeneity across

studies (as measured by the I-squared). We also examined whether disciplinary focus or

publication outlet helps to explain divergent study findings. A meta-regression found no

statistically significant differences in standardized effect sizes of studies published in medical

journals (38%), economics journals (33%), or policy journals (29%). There were also no

statistically significant differences among regions covered in the patient outcome studies.

Finally, we found no systematic differences in estimated ownership effects between studies that

did and did not examine ownership conversions. (All meta-regression results are available from

the authors upon request.)



Explaining Variation in Studies Examining Unprofitable Care

         Fewer of our hypothesized factors explain a significant proportion of between-study

variation in studies of unprofitable care. Exhibit 5 presents results from the three sets of meta-

regressions that do seem to have some explanatory power for understanding diverse findings in

the literature. First consider the type of unprofitable care examined. For private hospital




                                                  13
comparisons, analyses of uncompensated care find for-profits provide less, and analyses of

unprofitable services or broader measures of community benefits do not differ significantly in

their overall findings (i.e., they also find for-profits provide less). For studies including

government hospitals, the one-third analyzing uncompensated care finds that government

hospitals provide more than private not-for-profits (significant at the 5% level and with a

magnitude of more than twice the difference among private hospitals). The other two-thirds of

studies, examining unprofitable services or community benefits, are associated with a reverse

effect, implying that private not-for-profits supply slightly more such services than their

government counterparts.

       How studies empirically account for hospital competition provides additional insight

regarding diversity of study findings. About 50% of studies do not explicitly model hospital

competition (although most of them do include some market characteristics as independent

variables). A quarter of the studies explicitly model hospital competition either through selection

models or a more sophisticated procedure to define hospital markets. About a third of the studies

use panel data and employ fixed-effect or random-effect models to minimize potential estimation

bias due to unobserved market heterogeneity. The second panel of Exhibit 5 shows that studies

with no explicit treatment of hospital competition tend to find that for-profit hospitals provide

significantly less unprofitable care than nonprofits do (-0.07; p<0.05). The ownership gap is

much smaller when estimated by studies that model competition explicitly or use panel data

estimation methods; such studies essentially find no difference between not-for-profit and for-

profit hospitals in provision of unprofitable care. For studies comparing not-for-profit and

government hospitals, there is no significant difference in effect sizes among these three types of




                                                  14
studies, partly because so few studies compare unprofitable care provided by not-for-profit and

government hospitals.

       Finally, the last panel of Exhibit 5 reports a meta-regression on covered regions. Studies

using California data find that for-profits provide just as much if not more unprofitable care than

their private nonprofit counterparts (-0.048 + 0.086=0.038). Note that this “California effect”

emerges despite a positive correlation between California data and two study features associated

with for-profits providing less than nonprofits: analysis of uncompensated care (compared to

broader measures of community benefits) and including ownership only as a control variable

(compared to ownership differences being a study’s primary research question). By contrast

with California, studies of Florida data find for-profits provide significantly less unprofitable

care (-0.136). Almost half of studies use data that is representative of the US as a whole or is

specific to other combinations of states; those studies are associated with for-profits providing

significantly less unprofitable care than private not-for-profit hospitals do (-0.048). Meta-

regressions using our other hypothesized explanatory variables (e.g., time period covered) find

no statistically significant effects. Overall, the study features we examined explained much less

of the heterogeneity across unprofitable care studies than they did for studies of patient benefits;

in most cases, the I-squared is substantially higher than when we examine patient outcomes, and

percentage explained compared to the null model (with no covariates) is much lower.



IV. Conclusions

       We conducted a systematic review of the empirical literature since 1990 to examine what

factors explain the diversity of findings regarding hospital ownership and quality of care, as well

as measures of community benefits.




                                                 15
           Our meta-regression analyses revealed several correlates of study heterogeneity.

Differences in analytic methods are the most salient. For studies of patient outcomes comparing

not-for-profit and for-profit hospitals, study features that can explain most of the variation in

effect sizes include disease or outcome studied, whether or not the study adjusted for patient co-

morbidities, and data sources. For unprofitable care, how studies handle market competition in

their empirical methods, as well as regional differences, account for substantial variation in

results.

           Differences in the unit of analysis yield contrasting findings: patient outcomes do not

statistically differ across all three ownership forms when analyses were done at the patient level,

whereas hospital-level and combined-level analyses find the highest rates of mortality and other

adverse events at government hospitals, lower rates at for-profits, and the lowest rates at private

nonprofit hospitals. We find that studies that do not adjust for co-morbidities tend to find a

bigger gap between private not-for-profits and for-profits. Including co-morbidities reduces

estimates of the quality gap among private hospitals, while maintaining (or widening) the

government-private nonprofit quality gap. It is important to note, however, that including patient

co-morbidity information is positively correlated with in-hospital or unspecified patient follow-

up period and having data only from the 1980s (and negatively correlated with a focus on heart

condition outcomes, a longer-term patient follow-up period, combined patient- and hospital-level

analysis, and data spanning the 1980s and 1990s). Thus, including patient co-morbidities does

not necessarily represent a “gold standard” in this literature.

           Studies of data from the 1980s (or spanning both the ‘80s and ‘90s) find more of a quality

difference between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals than studies using more recent data.

Similarly, studies that examine data from before 1990 find the gap between private not-for-profit




                                                   16
and government-owned community hospitals to be substantially larger than studies that examine

data from the 1990s. These results are consistent with predictions of convergence among

ownership forms in the increasingly competitive environment. Part of the time-trend toward

finding fewer ownership differences with more recent data can also be explained by differences

in analytic methods, since more recent studies often use methods specifically developed to

control for confounding from market structure and unobserved differences in patient severity.

       The meta-regression allows us to disentangle regional differences in unprofitable care.

Studies examining nationally representative samples, and of Florida in particular, tend to find

for-profits provide less unprofitable care, whereas California for-profit hospitals seem to be

providing comparable amounts as their private nonprofit counterparts.

       It is also worth noting what factors do not help to explain differences in study findings.

For example, we found no systematic differences in estimated ownership effects between studies

that did and did not examine conversions. Similarly, regions covered explained little of the

variation in studies of patient outcomes, and the time period of the data explained little variation

among studies of uncompensated care and other measures of community benefits. Analyses

dropping outliers47 found fairly similar results to those reported here. (All such sensitivity

analyses are available from the authors upon request.) Although methods to detect publication

bias are not perfect, it is not surprising that we found no evidence of publication bias—

theoretical predictions about ownership effects vary.

       Our results contrast with those of the sole previous systematic review in this area.9

Whereas we aim to explain the heterogeneity in study results, the previous study aimed to

provide a single definitive answer to the question of whether quality differs in for-profit and

private not-for-profit hospitals. Yet the nature of observational studies in this area severely




                                                 17
limits the ability of meta-analysis to achieve that goal: the studies not only are observational, but

draw from overlapping samples, so that many studies include data from the same hospitals or

even the same patients. Although Devereaux et al. describe their review as including “fifteen

observational studies, involving more than 26,000 hospitals,” there are actually fewer than 6000

hospitals in the entire US. The authors note that almost all studies draw from the same database,

but do not mention that the studies therefore do not represent independent samples. Another

reason for interpreting the single answer from Devereaux et al. with caution is that they use

patient sample size to define confidence intervals, whereas ownership is a hospital-level

characteristic. Since there are many fewer hospitals than patients, using patient sample size

yields a misleadingly precise estimate of hospital-level mortality differences and tends to give

the largest weight to studies with the fewest controls for confounding factors (because authors

often restrict sample size specifically to remove residual confounding from case mix or market

characteristics).

        Our paper also has several limitations. First, the tremendous diversity of dependent

variable definitions and analytic methods (e.g., dichotomous and continuous, risk differences and

relative risks) preclude using a more interpretable definition of effect size that would be

comparable across studies. The standardized effect size that we use provides less intuitive

interpretation of the ownership effect for clinical or policy decisions. However, by the

conventional Cohen standard10, magnitudes of our effect sizes mostly fall into what is considered

the “small” effect region (r<0.10), indicating that ownership appears to play a much less

important role in influencing hospital performance than other hospital characteristics, even when

it is a significant predictor. Second, although we identified far more studies than many

systematic reviews do, the limited number as well as substantial collinearity among study




                                                 18
features preclude controlling for all the hypothesized determinants of study heterogeneity in the

same meta-regression (correlation matrices among study features are included in the Appendix).

Finally, we discuss here only a few key aspects of hospital performance, rather than a

comprehensive overview of all potential differences by organizational form. Although we

examine potential systematic differences in studies that control for market-level factors, we do

not focus on market-level spillover effects among hospitals of differing ownership forms. Others

have argued that such spillover effects can be very important, and that for-profit providers might

substantially raise the overall “cost-effectiveness” or productivity of service delivery through

such mechanisms.11

       Policymakers and researchers seeking to interpret the literature on hospital ownership and

quality of care (or community benefits) should be aware that findings differ significantly

according to the analytic methods of individual studies, and that conventional methods of meta-

analytic synthesis are inappropriate given the considerable overlap among studied hospitals.

Moreover, there appears to be as much, if not more, heterogeneity among hospitals of the same

ownership form as across ownership forms. Future research on the determinants of this variation

would be useful.

Note: Each panel represents a separate regression; a positive coefficient indicates that for-profit (or government) hospitals are associated with a
higher level of that dependent variable than private not-for-profit hospitals. The significance test was obtained using the permutation test
approach in Higgens and Thompson (2004) to avoid spurious findings. The I2 for the null model with no covariates is 0.252 for studies
comparing nonprofits and for-profits, and 0.405 for studies comparing nonprofits and government hospitals.
