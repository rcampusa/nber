            REAL INTEREST, MONEY SURPRISES AND ANTICIPATED INFLATION


     This paper investigates the hypothesis that surprise changes in the money

supply and anticipated inflation (the Mundeil—Tobin effect) are both inversely

related to the expected real interest rate. The two novel aspects of the

investigation are tests of the hypothesized impact of money surprises on real

rates while simultaneously testing the Mundell—Tobin hypothesis and estimation

employing transfer function methodology developed by Box and Jenkins (1970).

The transfer function enables the investigator to entertain the hypothesis that

residuals may not follow a simple AR—i process, as is usually assumed in correc-

tions for correlated residuals, but rather may be appropriately represented by

a more complex ARMA process. Based on quarterly data from 1959—I — 1980—IV,

results obtained constitutes failure to reject either an inverse relationship

between money surprises and expected real interest or an inverse relationship

between anticipated inflation and expected real interest. These findings do

not constitute a rejection of market efficiency.

1.    Introduction


      The hypothesis attributed to Fisher (1930) and more recently the

innovative investigation by Fama (1975) have predisposed many econo-

mists to treat the expected real rate of interest as a constant. At

the very least, as a "real" magnitude, the expected real interest rate is

appealingly viewed as being independent of monetary phenomena.

      The late 1970's and early 1980's have produced events which force

re—evaluation of the maintained hypothesis of constancy of the expected

real rate (hereafter referred to as the "real rate"). For example, from

December, 1980 to June, 1981 the expected rate of inflation fell by 165

basis points from an annual rate of 10.51 percent to an annual rate of

8.86 percent.1 Over the same period 3—month treasury bill rates continued

to remain largely between 14 and 16 percent with average yields of 15.02

percent in December, 1980 and 14.95 percent in June, 1981. Since there is

ample evidence that security markets continue fully to reflect changes in

anticipated inflation in nominal market rates, a large drop in anticipated

inflation which is not accompanied by a drop of similar magnitude in

nominal interest rates forces consideration of a possible offsetting rise

in the real rate.2

      Statistical investigations regarding the possibility of movements in

the real rate have appeared with increasing frequency since publication of

Fama's (1975) provocative article.3 Nelson and Schwert (1977) argued that

Fama's test of the joint hypothesis of market efficiency and constancy of

the real rate was not sufficiently powerful and after applying more power-

ful tests concluded that the data permitted rejection of the hypothesis of

constancy of the real rate. Other investigations including those by
                                2



Hess and Bicksier (1975), Carison (1977), Carbade and Wachtel (1978)

and Levi and Makin (1979) have rejected the hypothesis of constancy of

the real rate while tending to support the hypothesis that market in—

terest rates include an efficient inflationary premium.

      More recently investigators have moved from merely testing the

hypothesis of constancy of the real rate to searching for an ex-

planation for the real rate movements suggested by a large body of

statistical evidence. Mishkin (1981) has investigated the relation-

ship between the real rate and anticipated inflation suggested by

Mundell (1963) and Tobin (1965). Levi and Makin (1979, 1981) and

Hartman (1981) have considered effects of inflation uncertainty on

the real rate. Dwyer (1981) has found that the real rate is inde—

pendent of predictable changes in the money supply.

      This paper investigates the hypothesis that surprise changes in

the money supply are inversely related to the real interest rate while

simultaneously allowing for operation of the Mundell—Tobin effect of

anticipated inflation on the real rate The two novel aspects of

the investigation are tests of the hypothesized impact of money sur-

prises on real rates in conjunction with tests of the Mundell—Tobin

hypothesis and estimation employing transfer function methodology de-

veloped by Box and Jenkins (1970). The latter aspect of the study

is shown to produce a significant impact upon conclusions regarding

the hypothesized impact of money surprises on real rates. In parti-

cular it is shown that a useful aspect of transfer functions is the

ability to entertain the hypothesis that residuals may not lollow a
                               3




simple AR—i process but rather may be appropriately represented by

a more complex ARNA process.

      Section 2 lays out the hypothesis to be tested and discusses

tecniques employed to estimate money surprises. Section 3 presents

results of tests of constancy of the real rate and employs them to

explain recent observed behavior of nominal interest rates. Section

4 employs the results to suggest an explanation of changes over time

in the dominant source of movements in nominal interest rates. Some

concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.


2.    Natural and Cyclical Components of the Real Rate


Components of the Real Rate


      The hypothesis to be tested here involves decomposition of the

real rate into a long—run, underlying or "natural" component and a

short—run, "cyclical" component. The analogy with the decomposition

by Lucas (1973) of real output into a "natural" and a "cyclical" com-

ponent is obvious.

      The natural portion of the real rate is determined by the marginal

productivity of capital and the marginal rate of time preference of

consumers.5 The equilibrium natural real rate equates, at the margin,

the subjective rate at which investors are willing to trade—off be—

tween current and future consumption with the rate at which the marginal

product of capital defines the objective, technological marginal rate

of transformation between current and future goods. Under the Mundell—

Tobin effect, the natural portion of the real rate can be affected
                               4



by changes in anticipated inflation. A rise in anticipated inflation

causes a shift out of money balances and into real capital thereby

depressing the marginal product of capital and the equilibrium real

rate. This is the "Tobin Effect.'t Mundell (1963) describes a

similar phenomenon whereby a rise in anticipated inflation depresses

equilibrium real cash balances in turn elevating the steady state level

of flow saving due to the real balance effect. Equilibrium is re

stored by means of a lower real interest rate which elevates the level

of investment until it equals the higher level of saving. This effect,

operating as it does on the steady state level of saving,is not ex-

pected to be subsequently reversed in the absence of further change in

the rate of anticipated inflation.

      The hypothesized impact of a money surprise on real interest

arises from an assumption of "sticky" price adjustment. Money growth

above its anticipated level results in an excess supply of money if

prices are sticky in the short run, assuming also that surprise money

growth does not immediately cause a rise in real income sufficient

to absorb excess money supply. Until prices adjust fully to absorb

excess money supply, the only alternative is for real interest to fall

thereby lowering (cet. par.) nominal interest by an amount sufficient

to clear the money market.

      The impact of a money surprise on the real rate ought to be

temporary, lasting only as long as stickiness of prices prevents

adjustment to monetary equilibrium without some adjustment of the

real rate. Its duration and existance is an empirical question the
                                   5




answer to which ought to shed some light on the speed of adjustment

of overall prices.

      The exact formulation to be investigated here includes the

Fisher equation and a hypothesis dividing the real rate into natural

and cyclical components (where all rates are continuously compounded):


            i =
                   r   +                                          (1)




            r =    r' + rC                                        (2)



               =       —                           >   0)
                                           (a0,c                  (3)




               =   — Y1(m__im) +       e      (y1 >     0)        (4)



where:

               =   nominal interest rate at time "t."

               = expected real interest rate (with r the "natural"

                   portion and r the "cyclical" portion).


    (mt—tim:) =    surprise   money growth measured as the difference

                   between the (log) current money supply and the (log)

                   anticipated (as of t—l for t) money supply.6

               =   anticipated   inflation or the log of the price level

                   expected as of t for t + 1 less the log of the actual

                   price level: tt+l — Pt.


            e = an     error term, normally distributed withnean zero.
                                 6




        Substituting into (1) from (2), (3) and (4) gives an expression

 for the nominal interest rate in terms of a constant term, anticipated

 inflation, a money surprise and an error term:7


              i =
                    a0
                         + (l) — y1(m_im)       +   e          (5)




Equation (5) suggests that regression of nominal interest on a constant,

moneysurprise and anticipated inflation ought to: (a) provide an
estimate of the portion of the natural real rate unaffected by antici-
pated inflation   the constant term;   (b) test the hypothesized negative

impact of a money surprise on the real rate by checking to see if the

coefficient on the surprise is significantly less than zero and;     (c)

test the hypothesized negative impact of anticipated inflation on

real interest by checking to see if the coefficient on anticipated

inflation is significantly below unity. Examination of the impact

running from lagged values of anticipated inflation to contemporary

nominal interest ought not to indicate subsequent reversal of the

initial negative impact. Alternatively, the hypothesized, temporary

negative impact of a money surprise ought not to persist in which case

distributed lag coefficients on the money surprise term ought to sum

to zero.

        The notion being advanced here that monetary shocks cause the real

rate to diverge temporarily from its long run equilibrium value is

also investigated in a meticulous study by Cornell (1981), extending

the work of Fama and Gibbons (1980). Cornell finds that monetary shocks

connected with reserve settlements on 1ednesdays cause temporary (1 day)
                                7



movements in the (Fed funds) real rate of the sort hypothesized above

 in equation (3)•8 He suggests further that a possible reason for the

failure of Fama and Gibbons to detect such effects is prompt action

by the Fed to offset such shocks. Cornell explicitly recognizes, how-

ever, that given (p. 18): "a dramatic shift to a policy of slow con-

stant growth of the monetary base.. .   it may turn out that reserve problems
which develop on Wednesday suddenly have a large and sustained impact

on the ex ante real rate." In short, while Cornell's investigation

of the impact of monetary shocks on the real rate is conceptually

similar to this investigation, his explicit finding of a one—day impact

resulting from Wednesday (lagged) reserve settlement shocks says

nothing direct about the possible impact of a 1 quarter money shock

on real rates of return on 90—day T—bills investigated here since he

appears to view shocks as essentially being offset within a day.

However, the above quotation clearly indicates a view that a shock

which spans a quarter would produce an impact on the real rate mea-

sured at quarterly intervals.

      In another related study, Grossman (1981) considers the response

of interest rates on Treasury bills to weekly money supply announcements

by the Fed. With the change in the bill rate between 3:30 and 5:00 p.m.

on announcement day as the dependent variable, Grossman finds a positive

link running from money surprises (positive if money is above a consensus,

predicted level) to the change in interest rates. This positive relation-

ship reflects, in Grossman's view, "the Systems technique of operation't

whereby faster money growth results in movement toward the upper bound

and causes the public to anticipate tightening by the Fed.
                                 8



        The positive sign of the relationship between a money surprise

 and the change in interest hypothesized by Grossman is the reverse of

 the relationship hypothesized by Cornell and this study. In effect,

 Grossman's rationale for this positive relationship is a policy reaction

 function built into Fed operating procedures during the September, 1977

 through September, 1979 sample period examined. Money growth above the

 targeted level would cause the Fed to move to raise the federal funds

 rate and the public would anticpate such action thereby bidding up

 interest rates in anticipation of such a move. While this response may

 be possible over an intra—day time interval for a given policy regime,

 findings of Cornell and this study (reported below) suggest that, for

 daily or quarterly data where an attempt is made to control for antici-

 pated inflation, greater—than--anticipated money growth will temporarily

depress the real rate.


Measurement of Money Surprises


      This study employs residuals from an ARMA (1,5) model of money (Ml—B)

growth as money surprises.9 It would be possible to estimate money sur-

prises using alternative measures of money such as M—2 and/or using al-

ternative representations of anticipated money growth such as those

linking behavior of the money supply to targets of monetary policy as in

Barro (1977). While the range of conceivably possible measures of money

surprises is wide, experimentation with a number of conceptually different

measures in Makin (1982) produced highly correlated measures (all over

0.90) of money surprises and little impact upon results of testing the

natural rate hypothesis.
                                    9



      There also arises the issue of sample data employed to estimate

the model of money supply behavior. If the form of the ARMA model changes

over time or coefficients of a given ARNA model change over time then

forecasts as of time "t"   should       only employ data available as of time

"t." This problem, alluded to by Sheffrin (1979), also appears to be

more serious in principle than in practice (see Makin (1982)). It is

worth noting here that Khan (1981) has developed a far more tractable

alternative than Sheffrints procedure of periodic re—estimation for esti—

mation of surprises using only data which would have been available to

forecasters at the time forecasts were being made. Khan's technique of

ttsequential estimation" employs the procedure of Brown, Durbin and

Evan's (1975) to produce a series of any length of updated, coefficient

estimates for a given ARMA model which requires only one matrix in-

version to produce the initial ARMA model estimate. This procedure is

appealing and can be used for a wide range of data series from which

one desires to extract "surprises" in a logically consistent manner.

For postwar U.S. money series, however, it appears that the procedure

produces little impact on actual measures of "surprises." For the

sample period from March, 1973 to June, 1981 a series on M—2 surprises

estimated using Khan's method was regressed on a surprise series estimated

from the March, 1973 — June, 1981 sample period. The result yielded

a constant term not significantly different from zero Ct—statistic =

0.97) and an estimated surprise coefficient of 0.93, only 1.21 standard
errors below unity. The two series are presented below in Chart 2 from

which the high degree of their correlation is obvious.

      The overall result of careful consideration of alternative mea-

sures of postwar, U.S. money surprises, which may well not generalize

to other series, is to suggest that in—sample ARNA models serve as
                               10



well as any. This is a useful piece of information as it suggests that

the simplest method of estimating money surprises serves as well as

any of the more complex alternatives.


3.    Testing for Constancy of the Real Rate


Estimation Results: Correcting for Correlated Residuals


      Results of estimating interest rate equations are presented in

Table 1. It is clear from equation (1.4) that after dealing with the

problem of properly modeling residuals, it is impossible to reject the

two hypotheses advanced in Section 2 about behavior of the real rate.

A one percent positive money surprise produces a significant negative

impact on the real interest rate estimated to be about 28 basis points

while a one percent rise in anticipated inflation depresses the real

interest rate by an estimated 25 basis points (1 — 0.746     0.25).

The relevant test of the hypothesized negative impact of anticipated

inflation on the real rate is whether the coefficient on       is signi-

ficantly below unity. The estimated coefficient of 0.746 in equation

(1.4) lies 2.71 standard errors below unity which is significant at the

0.01 level.

      The significance of employing the transfer function technique to

estimate equation (1.4) can be seen by comparing equations (1.1) through

(1.3) with (1.4). In equation (1.1) it is clear that anticipated in-

flation alone leaves highly autocorrelated residuals (DW =   0.58).
Addition of the money surprise term raises the Durbin—Watson statistic

somewhat and adds to overall explanatory power but leaves an

unacceptably high level of indicated autocorrelation in residuals. The

usual procedure would be to correct equation (1.2) for autocorrelated

residuals. The result of employing the Cochranc—Orcutt procedure is

reported as equation (1.3). The result is a drop in overall significance
                               12



levels leaving one to conclude from equation (1.3) that a money surprise

does not produce a statistically significant negative impact on the real

rate. However, inspection of the residuals from equation (1.2) suggests

that they are not adequately represented by an AR(1,O) model. Estimation

of a transfer function (equation (1.4)) reveals that an AR(l,3) model

is required to leave white—noise residuals. Proper modeling of resi-

duals produces a substantive impact upon the conclusion regarding the

negative impact of a positive money surprise on the real rate, to the

effect that the data do not permit rejection of the hypothesized relation-

ship. This result carries with it the implication that prices are some-

what sticky, at least for a period of up to one quarter.

      It would of course be desirable to provide prior hypotheses regard-

ing implications for estimated parameter values or estimated standard

errors of mismodeling residuals. Hendry (1977) has investigated the

question and found that little in general can be said particularly where

higher order processes are involved.10 The best operational rule is

simply to model residuals in a way that leaves white noise residuals

and not to simply assume that an AR(1,O) representation is correct.


Possible Impact of Money Surprise on
Anticipated Inflation


      It is worth noting that the estimated coefficient on anticipated

inflation is little affected by inclusion of a money surprise term. The

possibility exists that the level of anticipated inflation may be

positively correlated with a money surprise which, given a negative

impact of a money surprise on the real rate, would tend to bias
                               13



 downward the estimated impact of anticipated inflation on nominal in-

 terest when the money surprise is omitted from the equation. Such a

 possibility deserves consideration in the light of a persistent tendency

 for the estimated impact of anticipated inflation upon nominal interest

 to lie below the value of unity anticipated under the Fisher hypothesis.11

The fact is, however, at least for the sample under investigation here,

that the correlation coefficient between anticipated inflation and money

surprise is only 0.21. The overall implication is that the persistent

finding that the estimated coefficient on anticipated inflation lies

below unity may well be due to the negative impact of anticipated infla-

tion on the real rate rather than to biasedness associated with omission

of a money surprise. Failure to entertain this hypothesis has led investi-

gators to search over a wide range of alternative explanations including

measurement error on anticipated inflation, "fiscal illusion" (Tanzi

(1980)) and failure to control adequately for other events such as the

level of economic activity on inflation uncertainty which may also

affect the real rate. All of these possible effects may be valid, but

it would be useful to reconsider them in the light of a possible Mundell—

Tobin effect.12


Persistence of Money Surprise and Anticipated
Inflation Effects


      If the impact of a money surprise is found not to be reversed after

a quarter or more the implication is that prices tend to be sticky

over a longer period of time. A persistent impact of anticipated infla-

tion on subsequent real rates would suggest a permanent impact upon
                               14



the rate of capital formation under the Mundell—Tobin hypothesis.

These possibilities can easily be checked with output from the trans-

fer function estimation procedure. Cross correlations between unex-

plained changes in the dependent variable and each of the exogenous

variables enable a check on possible distributed—lag relationships.

For the money surprise, the Chi—Square test statistic for cross cor-

relations with 12 degrees of freedom is 14.3 with a p—value of 0.28.

While this result constitutes only a marginal rejection of possible

lagged relationships over 12 periods, inspection of the plot of cross

correlations reveals that all of the cross correlations lie below two

standard errors from zero. The most significant cross correlation at

lag 3 did not enter significantly when added to equation (1.4). A

hypothesis of price stickiness for periods of more than one quarter is

supported by these findings whereby the initial downward pressure on

the real rate is not subsequently reversed. Such a finding is contrary

to the views of many economists regarding the degree of price flexi-

bility and in view of the marginal rejection of a lagged relationship

between money surprises and the real rate suggested above, more investi-

gation may be called for. For now it is worth noting that the

(insignificant) lagged cross correlations between the money surprise

and the unexplained portion of the dependent variable are all positive

from quarters 1 through 3, ThIs suggested a tendency for (negative)

effects of the surprise to be erased over a somewhat irregular pattern

spanning about 9 months.

      The Chi—Square test statistic for cross correlatIons with antici-

pated inflation given 12 degrees of freedom Is 8.52 which carries a
                                  15



1—va1ue of 0.744. This constitutes a highly significant rejection of a

possible lagged relationship between the real rate and anticipated in—

flation and suggest, consistently with the Mundell-Tobin hypothesis that

a rise in anticipated inflation produces a permanent negative impact

on the real rate.13


Controlling for Other Variables


      In an earlier study of the effects of anticipated inflation on

nominal interest, Levi and Makin (1979, 1981) controlled for the impact

of output growth and inflation uncertainty upon the real rate, finding

both to have a negative impact. Bomberger and Frazer (1981) also found

that a Livingston measure of inflation uncertainty had a significant

negative impact on   interest   rates.

      More recently, Hartman (l981 has argued that the real rate ought

to be defined as the nominal rate lds the   expected   rate of inflation plus

the variance of the inflation rate. This implies a measure of inflation

variance on the right—hand side of equation (4) with a coefficient of

minus 1, Neither real growth nor inflation uncertainty entered signi-

ficantly when added to equation (1.4) either separately or together.

This result suggests that the money surprise term in equation (1.4) is

capturing the impact on the real rate of inflation uncertainty and output

growth. Larger money surprises may well elevate inflation uncertainty.

The natural rate hypothesis -suFts that money surprises raise the

level of real output but not its rate oi growth. However, price sticki-

ness within a quarter or inventory effects may cause money surprise

effects on real output growth. The price stickiness requirement is
                              16


consistent with the finding that a money surprise is inversely related

to the real rate. Full reconciliation of results reported here with

earlier investigations will require further investigation hut ought to

provide additional insights into short run real effects of monetary

disturbances.

      The association of money surprises with movements in expected real

rates of interest suggests that, controlling for expected inflation, the

that volatility of expected real interest has accounted for more move-

ments of nominal interest than has volatility of expected inflation.

      Some of the most intense upward pressure on real interest rates

in the United States appears to have materialized during the second

quarter of 1981. Charts 1 and 2 suggest that the reason for this is a

sequence of negative money surprises during that time. It appears that

in the wake of the very large negative arid then positive monetary sur-

prises inherent in the imposition and then removal of credit controls

during 1980, another sequence of surprises, this time positive—negative,

has materialized in the first half of 1981.

      Forces operating on nominal interest rates during the first half

of 1981 can be described in terms of events affecting expected inflation

and expected real interest rates. Election of a new president and ex-

pectations of budget—balancing and/or monetary control tended to lower

expected inflation over the first six months of 1981 (see Table 2).

The brief acceleration of money above expected levels tended to depress

real interest rates during the first quarter of 1981 with the combined

effect that nominal interest rates, particularly short rates, fell during

the first quarter of 1981. However, an apparent tmini_accordfl at the end

of March 1981 between the U.S. Treasury and the Fed saw sharply in-

creased pressure to keep monetary aggregates, then above target, at

or below targeted levels. The result was a sharp deceleration of money

growth during the second quarter of 1981 which came as a surprise to

most observers (see Charts 1 and 2). Such large negative surprises

put strong upward pressure on expected real interest rates which more
                               19


 than swamped the depressing impact of lower inflationary expectations.

 It may have been that most of the drop in inflationary expectations

 had come during the first quarter of 1981 so that most of the second

 quarter sharp rise in expected real interest rates (estimated, based

 on Tables 1, 2 and 3 to be between 2 and 3 percent) was transmitted

 directly to nominal rates with no offset from lower expected inflation.


5.     Concluding Remarks


      This paper has tested the hypotheses that money surprises and anti—

cipated inflation are both inversely related to the expected real rate

of interest. Based on quarterly data from 1959—I — 1980—IV, results

obtained constitute failure to reject either hypothesis.

      An examination of the behavior of money surprises before and after

institution of new operating procedures by the Federal Reserve Board

in October, 1979 indicates a sharp elevation of both the level and vola-

tility of such surprises. Based on results reported here, the increased

volatility of money surprises, during a time when the volatility of

anticipated inflation had, if anything, fallen relative to pre—October

1979, suggests that the post—October 1979 period has seen movements of

nominal interest rates due more to changes in expected real interest

rates than to changes in anticipated inflation)3 This would explain

Hodrick's observation of a change in the sign of observable comovements

of nominal interest differentials and exchange rates prevalent since

October, 1979 as well as the apparent absence of response of nominal

interest rates to a drop in inflationary expectations during the first

half of 1981.
                              20



      The primary implication for monetary policy of findings reported

here is to dispute the result of Fama and Gibbons (1980) whereby a

sudden transition to a sharply reduced rate of growth of the money

base would reduce short—term nominal rates. On the contrary, empirical

findings reported in Section 3 suggest that, unless a negative money

surprise results in an instantaneous equal percentage drop in infla-

tionary expectations, the overall result will be a rise ,   at   least tem-

porarily, in the nominal rate due to a rise in the real rate. Such a

rise appears likely since no such close relationship between money sur-

prises and anticipated inflation is evident in the data examined here.

      Overall, the implied conclusion for monetary policy is identical

to that reached by Cornell (1981), p. 19:


     "Until further work is done, however, it would be dangerous
     to accept the classical hypothesis that the ex ante real in-
     terest rate is unaffected by monetary policy."

 1.   This figure is based on Livingston survey data for 6 month hori-
      zon expectations regarding the consumer price index. The twelve
      month horizon figure for CPI also indicated a drop of 165 basis
      points while 6 and 12 month horizon numbers for WPI indicated
      drops of 192 and 174 basis points respectively. Updated Livingston
      survey data is now compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of
      Philadelphia.

2.    Another event in the international sphere has raised questions
      about the constancy of the real rate. Until November of 1978
      it was typical to observe, in the United States at least, rising
      relative nominal interest rates accompanied by depreciation of the
      dollar against foreign currencies like the deutschemark and the
      yen. Such comovement was readily explained in terms of a rise in
      U.S. nominal rates due to higher anticipated inflation. However,
      as reported in Hodrick (1981), since 1980 rising relative nominal
      interest rates in the United States have tended to be associated
      with dollar appreciation and conversely. A proximale explanation
      for this phenomenon would be an assertion that real interest
      rate movements have tended to dominate as causes of nominal rate
      movements during the early 1980's. If such were true the observed
      dollar appreciation which has coincided with rising nominal U.S.
      interest rates could be explained by incipient capital inflows
      attendant upon higher U.S. real rates which simultaneously caused
      the nominal interest rate to rise.

3.    Even well before the investigations discussed here Irving Fisher
      himself reported, based on an investigation of market interest rates
      during the 19th and late 20th centuries in London, New York, Berlin,
      Calcutta and Tokyo, that "the real rate of interest in terms of
      commodities is from seven to thirteen times as variable as the
      market rate of interest expressed in terms of money." (Fisher
      (1930), p. 415).

4.    Mishkin (1981) found a significant negative impact upon the real
      rate of a lagged actual (CPI) inflation rate taken as a proxy for
      anticipated inflation. An ARIMA (0,1,1) inflation model with a
      seasonal MA—L term also provided an expected inflation proxy with
      a significant negative impact on the real rate.

5.    Alamouti (1980) provides a similar description of determination
      of the real rate. Determination of the real rate in this manner is
      suggested directly by the full title of Fisher's (1930) classic:
      The Theory of Interest as Determined by Impatience toSperid Income
      and Opportunity to Invest It.

6.    Since actual money growth less anticipated money growth is written
                                            =
      as: (mt—mt_l) —   (t_lm   —
                                    mt_l)       (mt—tim)
7.    Tax effects alluded to by Darby (1975) and Feldstein (1976) are
      ignored for now. Mishkin (1981) finds that inclusion has little
      impact on conclusions regarding non—constancy of the real rate.

8.    Cornell is clearly thinking of shocks to the monetary base in the
      form of a shortage or excess of bank reserves.

9.    The Chi—Square test statistic for the hypothesis that the residuals
      of the ARMA(1,5) model is 6.84 with 14 degrees of freedom which
      implies a significance level of 0.94. The model was estimated
      using quarterly data from 1959—I — l980—IV.

10.   Hendry also suggests that identifying the correct order of error
      autocorrelation is more important than the form (AR or MA). More
      specifically had the true error process been ARNA(0,l) an ARNA (1,0)
      would do reasonably well. But since the true process in equation
      (1.4) was ARMA(l,3), ARMA(l,0) represents a serious misspecification.

II.   A value above unity is anticipated if tax effects articulated by
      Darby (1975) and Feldstein (1976) are considered. See Tanzi (1980)
      for a discussion of these articles and others which investigate
      the quantitative impact of changing inflationary expectations on
      nominal interest. Tanzi argues that "fiscal illusion" or failure
      to account for taxes may be responsible for lower than expected
      coefficients when nominal interest rates are regressed on antici—
      pated inflation.

12.   Levi and Makin (1978, 1979, 1981) have investigated a number of
      these effects in a model including a Mundell—Tobin effect. This
      paper, however, adds consideration of "money surprise" effects
      on the real rate.

13.   The problem of inference here is complicated by the fact that the
      Mundell—Tobin hypothesis hinges upon the difference of the co-
      efficient on anticipated inflation from unity and not from zero.
      However, both the incorporation of a change in anticipated inflation
      into nominal interest and the real impact under the Mundell—
      Tobin hypothesis are expected to be permanent. This generates a
      prior hypothesis of persistence with no subsequent reversal which
      is not contradicted by the data.

14.   A similar suggestion has been advanced by Keran and Pigott (1980).
