                                                ABSTRACT

This paper develops a generalization of the formulas proposed by Kuttner (2001) and others for purposes
of measuring the effects of a change in the fed funds target on Treasury yields of different maturities.
The generalization avoids the need to condition on the date of the target change and allows for deviations
of the effective fed funds rate from the target as well as gradual learning by market participants about
the target. The paper shows that parameters estimated solely on the basis of the behavior of the fed
funds and fed funds futures can account for the broad calendar regularities in the relation between
fed funds futures and Treasury yields of different maturities. Although the methods are new, the conclusion
is quite similar to that reported by earlier researchers-- changes in the fed funds target seem to be associated
with quite large changes in Treasury yields, even for maturities up to ten years.

1     Introduction.

Economists continue to debate how much of an eﬀect monetary policy has on the economy.

But one of the more robust empirical results is the observation that changes in the target that

the Federal Reserve sets for the overnight fed funds rate have been associated historically

with large changes in other interest rates, even for the longest maturities.       This paper

contributes to the extensive literature that tries to measure the magnitude of this eﬀect.

    One of the first eﬀorts along these lines was by Cook and Hahn (1989), who looked at how

yields on Treasury securities of diﬀerent maturities changed on the days when the Federal

Reserve changed its target for the fed funds rate. Let is,d denote the interest rate (in basis

points) on a Treasury bill or Treasury bond of constant maturity s months as quoted on

some business day d, and let ξ d denote the target for the fed funds rate as determined by the

Federal Reserve for that day. Using just those days between September 1974 and September

1979 on which there was a change in the target, Cook and Hahn estimated the following

regression by OLS:

                           is,d − is,d−1 = αs + λs (ξ d − ξ d−1 ) + usd .                  (1)

Their estimates of λs are reported in the first column of Table 1 for securities of several

diﬀerent maturities. These estimates suggest that when the Fed raises the overnight rate

by 100 basis points, short-term Treasury yields go up by over 50 basis points and there is a

statistically significant eﬀect even on 10-year yields.

    Subsequent researchers found that the magnitude of the estimated coeﬃcients for λs

were significantly smaller when later data sets were used. For example, column 2 of Table 1

                                                 2
reports Kuttner’s (2001) results when the Cook-Hahn regression (1) was re-estimated using

data from June 1989 to February 2000; see also Nilsen (1998).

   However, Kuttner (2001) also identified some conceptual problems with regression (1).

For one thing, the market may have anticipated much of the change in the target ξ d that

occurred on day d many days earlier, in which case those expectations would have already

been incorporated into is,d−1 . In the limiting case when the change was perfectly anticipated,

one would not expect any change in is,d to be observed on the day of the target change. To

isolate the unanticipated component of the target change, Kuttner used fd , the interest rate

implied by the spot-month fed funds contract on day d.                      These contracts are settled on

the basis of what the average eﬀective fed funds rate turns out to be for the entire month

containing day d. Since much of the month may already be over by day d, a target change

on day d will only have a fractional eﬀect on the monthly average. Kuttner proposed the

following formula to identify the unanticipated component of the target change on day d,
                                           µ                 ¶
                                   u               Nd
                                ξ̃ d   =                         (fd − fd−1 ),                         (2)
                                               Nd − td + 1

where Nd is the number of calendar days associated with the month in which day d occurs

and td is the calendar day-of-the-month associated with day d. Kuttner then replaced (1)

with the regression

                                                                       u         u
                      is,d − is,d−1 = αs + γ s (ξ d − ξ d−1 − ξ̃ d ) + λs ξ̃ d + usd                   (3)


with additional modifications if d were the first day or one of the last three days of a month.

Kuttner found that the γ s were essentially zero, meaning that target changes that were

                                                       3
anticipated in advance have no eﬀect on other interest rates. Kuttner’s estimates of λs , the

eﬀects of unanticipated target changes, are reported in column 3 of Table 1, and turn out to

be a bit larger than the original Cook-Hahn estimates.

   Poole and Rasche (2000) proposed to sidestep the issues associated with a mid-month

target change by using not the spot-month contract on day d but instead the one-month-

ahead contract, that is, the interest rate implied by a contract purchased on day d for

settlement based on the average fed funds rate prevailing in the following month, denoted

fd1 . They then replaced the expression in (2) with

                                       u
                                      ξ̃ d = fd1 − fd−1
                                                    1
                                                        .                                 (4)


Their estimates for λs using this formulation turned out to be similar to Kuttner’s, and are

reported in the fourth column of Table 1.

   However, mid-month target changes remain an issue for the Poole-Rasche estimates,

because there is always the possibility of a second (or even a third) change in the target

some time after day d and before the end of the following month; indeed this turned out to

be the case for about half of the target changes observed between 1988 and 2006. Gürkaynak,

Sack, and Swanson (2007) developed an analog to Kuttner’s formula (2) based on the date of

the next target change that followed after the one implemented on day d; see also Gürkaynak

(2005).

   Another potential drawback to either (2) or (4) was raised by Poole, Rasche and Thornton

(2002).   These authors noted that, particularly prior to 1994, market participants may

not have been perfectly aware of the target change even at the end of day d, in which

                                              4
case these formulas would include a measurement error that would bias the coeﬃcients

downward. Poole, Rasche and Thornton developed corrections for the estimates to allow

for this measurement error.

   A related issue is that the series for ξ d , the actual target change, is itself subject to

measurement error, as indeed Kuttner (2001) and Poole, Rasche and Thornton (2002) used

slightly diﬀerent series.   Learning about the target change presumably also began well

before day d. For both reasons, one would think that data both before and after day d

should typically be used. In this paper I develop a generalization of the Kuttner (2001) and

Poole, Rasche, and Thornton (2002) adjustments for purposes of estimating the parameter

λs . The basic idea is to suppose that there exists some day within the month at which

the target may have been changed, but to choose deliberately not to condition on this date

for purposes of forming an econometric estimate.      The paper also generalizes the earlier

approaches by explicitly modeling the diﬀerence between the eﬀective fed funds rate and the

actual target.

   I begin in Section 2 with an examination of the relation between the target rate chosen

by the Fed and the actual eﬀective fed funds rate. Section 3 develops a simple statistical

description of how these deviations, along with the process of learning by the market about

what the fed funds target is going to be for this month, would determine the volatility of

the spot-month futures rates. I show in Section 4 how the parameters estimated from the

behavior of the eﬀective fed funds rate and the spot-month futures rate can be used to

predict calendar regularities in the estimated values for a generalization of the coeﬃcient λs



                                              5
above. Section 5 finds such calendar regularities largely borne out in the observed relation

between Treasury rates and daily changes in the spot-month futures rate, and develops new

estimates of this parameter. Although the method and data set are rather diﬀerent from

the earlier researchers, my estimates in fact turn out to be quite similar to those originally

found by Kuttner (2001) and Poole and Rasche (2000).




2       The eﬀective and target fed funds rate.

In this paper I will be indexing time in two diﬀerent ways, using calendar days t for developing

theoretical formulas and business days d to apply these ideas to actual data. The theoretical

formulas will be developed for a typical month consisting of N calendar days indexed by

t = 1, 2, ..., N , whereas the data set will consist of those days d = 1, 2, ..., D for which I have

data on both Treasury interest rates and fed funds futures rates; d = 1 corresponds to Oct 3,

1988 and d = D = 4552 corresponds to Dec 29, 2006. The empirical sample for all estimates

reported in this paper also excludes the volatile data from September 13 to September 30,

2001.

    The eﬀective fed funds rate for calendar day t, denoted rt , is a volume-weighted average

of all overnight interbank loans of Federal Reserve deposits for that day. All numbers in

this paper will be reported in basis points, so that, for example, a 5.25% interest rate would

correspond to a value of rt = 525.      Since October 1988, the Chicago Board of Trade has

oﬀered futures contracts whose settlement is based on the average value for the eﬀective

fed funds rate over all the calendar days of the month (with Friday rates, for example, also

                                                 6
imputed to Saturday and Sunday). For a month that contains N calendar days, settlement

of these futures contracts would be based on the value of
                                                         N
                                                         X
                                                    −1
                                            S=N                rt .                                    (5)
                                                         t=1


The terms of a given fed funds futures contract can be translated1 into an interest rate

ft such that, if S (which is not known at day t but will become known by the end of the

month) turns out to be bigger than ft , the buyer of the contract has to compensate the seller

by a certain amount for every basis point by which S exceeds ft . If the marginal market

participant were risk neutral, it would be the case that


                                               ft = Et (S)                                             (6)


where Et (.) denotes an expectation formed on the basis of information available to the market

as of day t. I will in this paper be considering only spot-month contracts, that is, contracts

for which by day t we already know some of the values for r (namely rτ for τ ≤ t) that will

end up determining S. My forthcoming paper demonstrates that for futures contracts at

short horizons (the spot-month, 1-month-ahead, and 2-month-ahead contracts), expression

(6) appears to be an excellent approximation to the data, though Piazzesi and Swanson

(2006) note potential problems with assuming that it holds for longer-horizon contracts.

       Suppose that the Fed changes the target for the eﬀective fed funds rate on calendar day

n of this month. Kuttner (2001) suggested that we could use the change in the spot-month

contract price on day n to infer how much of the change in the target interest rate caught
   1
     Specifically, if Pt is the price of the contract agreed to by the buyer and seller on day t, then ft =
100 × (100 − Pt ).

                                     N −n+1

I will provide a formal derivation of (7) as a special case of a more general statistical inference

problem explored below, but would first like to comment on one potential drawback of (7),

which is that it implies a huge reweighting of observations that come near the end of the

month (n near N ). Kuttner (2001, p. 529) recognized that this is a potential concern here

arising from the fact that (7) abstracts from the deviation between the Federal Reserve’s

target for the eﬀective fed funds rate and the actual eﬀective rate, and as a result blows

up this measurement error for observations near the end of the month.            Kuttner himself

avoided using (7) for the last 3 days of the month. Other researchers like Gürkaynak (2005)

avoid applying it to data from the last week.

    Figure 1 plots the relevant variables for December 1990, which was a particularly wild

month as banks adjusted to lower reserve requirements (Anderson and Rasche, 1996). Al-

though the Fed had lowered the target to 725 basis points on December 7, the eﬀective fed

funds rate was trading well above this the week after Christmas, and speculators seemed to

be allowing for a possibility of a big end-of-year spike up, such as the 584-basis-point increase

in the eﬀective fed funds rate that was seen in the last two days of 1985 or the 975-basis-point

spike between December 28 and December 30 of 1986. In the event, however, the eﬀective

funds rate plunged 200 basis points on December 31, 1990.

   Since the December 1990 futures contract was based on the eﬀective rate rather than

the target, speculators were watching these events closely.       The futures rate was tending

                                                8
well above the new target of 725 basis points in the latter part of December, partly because

the month’s average would include the first week’s 750-basis-point target values, partly

because the eﬀective rate had been averaging above the new target subsequently, and partly

in anticipation of an end-of-year spike up.      When it became clear on December 31 that

the last day of the year generated a big move down rather than up, the December futures

contract fell by 23 basis points on a single day. Formula (7) would call for us to multiply

this number by 31, to deduce that the interest rate surprise on this day was some 713 basis

points, plausible perhaps if the market was anticipating a spike up to 1250 rather than the

plunge down to 550 that actually transpired. Although this is an extreme example, it drives

home the lesson that one really wants to downweight the end-of-month observations rather

than blow them up in the manner suggested by the expression in (7).

   In the next section I’ll propose a more formal statement of this problem and its solution.

A necessary first step is to document some of the properties of the deviation between the

target that the Fed has in place for business day d (denoted ξ d ) and the actual Fed funds

rate.   The eﬀective fed funds rate rd was taken from the FRED database of the Federal

Reserve Bank of St. Louis (which in turn is based on the Board of Governors release H.15),

and for the target ξ d I’ve used the FRED series which comes from Thornton (2005) prior to

1994 and FOMC transcripts since. I first estimated the following regression (similar to the

models in Taylor, 2001, and Sarno, Thornton, and Valente, 2005) by ordinary least squares

(standard errors in parentheses):


                         rd − ξ d = 2.45 + 0.300(rd−1 − ξ d−1 ) + êd .                  (8)
                                    (0.29)   (0.014)


                                                9
    This regression establishes that there is modest serial correlation in deviations from the

target.    Of particular interest in the next section will be the calendar variation in the

variability of êd .   Let ω jd = 1 if day d occurs on the jth calendar day of the month and

zero otherwise. A regression of ê2d on {ω jd }31
                                               j=1 then gives the average squared residual as a


function of the calendar day of the month:

                                                   31
                                                   X
                                        ê2d   =         β̂ j ω jd + v̂d .
                                                   j=1


The estimated values β̂ j are plotted as a function of the calendar day j in Figure 2 along with

the 95% confidence intervals for each coeﬃcient. A big outlier on January 23, 1991 (when

the funds rate spiked up nearly 300 basis points on a settlement Wednesday) is enough to

skew the results for day 23.      Apart from this the most noticeable feature is an increased

volatility of the deviation of the funds rate from the target towards the end of a month.

One can represent this tendency parametrically through the following restricted regression,


                                ê2d = 283 + 1746 × 0.5(31−td ) + v̂d ,                     (9)
                                      (40)         (232)



for td the calendar day of the month associated with business day d. The predicted values

from (9) are also plotted in Figure 2. A simple formulation based on (8) and (9) will be used

to characterize the modest predictability of deviations from the target and their tendency to

become more pronounced at the end of the month in the theoretical derivations in the next

section.

3     Accounting for the volatility of spot-month futures
      prices.

Suppose that market participants know that, if the Fed is going to change the target within

a given month consisting of N calendar days, it would do so on calendar day n, so that its

target is a step function:
                                    ξ t = ξ 0 for t = 1, 2, ..., n − 1

                                    ξ t = ξ n for t = n, n + 1, ..., N.

The eﬀective fed funds rate for each day is the sum of the target for that day plus the

deviation from the target, denoted ut :


                                                 rt = ξ t + ut .


It follows from (5) and (6) that
                   "                         #
                         N

    On the day before the target change, I presume that market participants had some

expectation of what the target was going to be, denoted En−1 (ξ n ). The actual target would

deviate from this by some magnitude hn :


                                            ξ n = En−1 (ξ n ) + hn .


If the equilibrium fed funds price is determined by risk-neutral rational speculators, the

forecast error hn would be a martingale diﬀerence sequence that represents the content of

                                                       11
the news about ξ n that arrived on the day of the target change itself. Similarly,


                                    ξ n = En−2 (ξ n ) + hn + hn−1

whereas for t > n, changes in futures prices are driven solely by the deviation of the eﬀective

fed funds rate from the target:

   Prior to 1992, the day of a target change would often (but not always) occur the day

after an FOMC meeting.         Since 1994, it usually has occurred on the day of an FOMC

meeting, but there are exceptions— three times in 2001 (January 3, April 18, and September

17) the Fed changed the target without a meeting, and in August and September of 2007

there was active speculation that the Fed was considering or possibly had even already

implemented an intermeeting rate cut.               Rather than treat the date n as if always known

to the econometrician, I have followed a diﬀerent philosophy, which is to ask, How would

the data look if it were generated by (15) but the econometrician does not condition on

knowledge of the particular value of n?              Suppose that the target change date (which the

formula assumed was known to market participants as of the start of the month) could have

occurred with equal probability on any one of the calendar days n = 1, 2, ..., N. If we let η

denote the unknown date of the target change, then the unconditional data would exhibit a

calendar regularity in the variance that is described by

   Expression (16) describes the variance of changes in the spot-month rate as the sum

of two terms.     The first term (κ1 (t)) represents solely the contribution of deviations of

the eﬀective funds rate from the target. For days near the beginning of the month (N − t

large), this is essentially equal to γ 0 /(1−φ)2 (the unconditional variance of ut ) divided by N 2

(since each ut contributes with weight 1/N to the monthly average). This declines gradually

during the month (since there are fewer days remaining for which the serial correlation in

ut contributes to the variance) but then rises quickly at the end of the month due to the

large value of γ 1 , reflecting the increased volatility of deviations from target at month end.

The second term (κ2 (t)) represents the contribution of target changes to the volatility of

the spot-month rates.     This contribution declines monotonically as the day of the month

t increases owing to the fact that, as the month progresses, it becomes increasingly likely

that the target change for the month has already occurred and there is no more uncertainty

about the value of ξ n for that month.       Added together, expression (16) implies that the

variance of changes in the spot-month futures rate should decline over most of the month

but then increase at the very end.

   Expression (16) was derived under the assumption that at the beginning of every month,

market participants are certain that there will be a target change on day n of the month.

If instead there is a fraction ρ of months for which people anticipate a change on some day

n and a fraction 1 − ρ for which they are certain there will be no change, the result would




                                                15
be that the last term in (16) would be multiplied by ρ,


                                  E(ft − ft−1 )2 = κ1 (t) + γ 2 κ2 (t),                             (17)


where γ 2 = ρσ 2h .

       I tested this model using daily data on fed funds futures contracts.2            Figure 3 plots

change in the spot-month futures rate on the calendar date

for ω jd = 1 if day d occurs on calendar day j and is zero otherwise. In other words, β̂ j is the

average squared change for observations falling on the jth day of a month. These indeed

exhibit a tendency to fall over most of the month but then rise at the end.

       Let td denote the calendar day associated with business day d (in other words, if ω jd = 1,

then td = j). I then tested whether the specific function derived in (17) could account for

this pattern by estimating via OLS the following relation:


                              (fd − fd−1 )2 = κ1 (td ) + 27.9κ2 (td ) + v̂d .                       (19)
                                                            (3.3)


Note that all the parameters appearing in the functions κ1 (t) and κ2 (t) are known previously

from the observed behavior of deviations of the eﬀective fed funds rate from its target, so that
   2
      Data for October 3, 1988 through June 30, 2006 were purchased from the Chicago Board of Trade,
while data for July 3, 2006 through January 29, 2006 were downloaded from the now-defunct website
spotmarketplace.com. For d corresponding to the first day of the month (say the first day of February for
illustration), fd − fd−1 was calculated as the change in the February contract between February 1 and the
last business day in January. For all other days of the month, it was simply the change in the spot-month
contract between day d and the previous business day.

                                                     16
only a single parameter was estimated directly from the behavior of the futures data, with

this parameter having the interpretation as the variance of daily news the market receives

in a typical month about the upcoming Fed target (recall equation (17):


                                        γ̂ 2 = ρ̂σ̂ 2h = 27.9.
                                                        (3.3)



Note also that (19) imposes 30 separate restrictions on the 31 parameters of the unrestricted

regression (18). The F (30, 4521) = 0.59 test statistic leads to ready acceptance of the null

hypothesis that this relation is indeed described by the function given in (16) with a p-value

of 0.96 (again, treating κj (t) as known functions).            The model thus successfully accounts

for the tendency of spot-month futures volatility to decline over most of the month but then

increase the last few days. The actual volatility seems to increase more at the end of the

month than the model predicts, though it is possible to attribute this entirely to sampling

error.


4        Inferring market expectations of target changes from
         spot-month futures rates.

We are now in a position to answer the primary question of this paper, which is, What does

an observed movement in the spot-month futures rate signal about market expectations

about the target rate that is going to be set for this month? Let Λt denote the information

set available to market participants as of date t and let Ωt = {ft , ft−1 , ...} be the information

set that is going to be used by the econometrician to form an inference, where it is assumed

that Ωt is a subset of Λt , that the previous target ξ 0 is an element of both Ωt and Λt , and


                                                 17
that the date of the target change n is an element of Λt but not of Ωt . Our task is to use

deviations of the fed funds rate from the target and squared changes in the spot-month

futures rate.

      Figure 4 plots the function κ4 (t) for these parameter values. To understand the intuition

for this function, consider first the case in which the fed funds rate is always identically equal

to the target, so that σ 2ε,t and κ1 (t) are both zero. From (14), the expected squared change

in the spot-month rate conditional on knowing that the target change will occur on day n

For N large and t = 1, the numerator of (24) would be approximately (1/2) and the denom-

inator about (1/3), so that the coeﬃcient β(1) would be close to 1.5. This is bigger than

Kuttner’s expression (7), which equals unity at n = 1, because a one unit increase in h1 will

increase the expected target on day n > 1 by one unit but increase the futures rate on day

t = 1 by only [(N − n + 1)/N] < 1. Kuttner’s formula assumes that, if we use the day t = 1

change in the futures, the target change occurs on day n = 1, whereas our formula assumes

that in all probability the actual change is going to be implemented on some day n > 1.

   Going from t to t+1, we drop N −1 [(N −t+1)/N ] from the numerator and drop the smaller

magnitude N −1 [(N − t + 1)/N ]2 from the denominator, so that the ratio (24) monotonically

increases in t until it finally reaches the same value as (7) on the last day of the month:

                                                  β(N ) = N.

   In the presence of targeting errors, expression (22) adds the term κ1 (t)/γ 2 to the denom-

inator of (24), so, as noted by Poole, Rasche, and Thornton (2002), the optimal inference

                                                           20
in the presence of targeting errors always puts a smaller weight on ft − ft−1 than does (24).

This explains why the function κ4 (t) in Figure 4 begins at a value below 1.5 for t = 1.

The function κ4 (t) then begins to increase monotonically in t for the same reason as in

(24). However, as t increases, both the numerator and denominator in (24) become smaller

whereas κ1 (t)/γ 2 is approximately constant (at least for small t). This latter eﬀect eventu-

ally overwhelms the tendency of (22) to increase in t and it begins to fall after the 20th day

of the month. This decline accelerates toward the very end of the month as κ1 (t) starts to

spike up from the end-of-month targeting errors.


5     Response of interest rates to changes in fed funds
      futures.

We’re now ready to return to the original question of how interest rates at various maturities

seem to respond to the spot-month fed funds futures rate. Deviations of the funds rate from

the target should have a quite negligible eﬀect on maturities greater than 3 months since

the autocorrelation implied by (8) dies out within a matter of days. We should therefore

find that if we regress the change in Treasury yields on the change in the spot-month futures

rate, the value of the regression coeﬃcient should exhibit exactly the same pattern over the

month as the function in Figure 4— the impact should rise gradually through the first half

of the month and fall oﬀ quickly toward the end of the month.

    As a first step in evaluating this conjecture, divide the calendar days of a month into

j = 1, 2, ..., 8 octiles, and let ψ jd = 1 if business day d is associated with a calendar date in

the jth octile of the month. For example, ψ 1d = 1 if day d falls on the first through fourth

                                               21
days of a month, while ψ 8d = 1 if it falls on the 29th, 30th, or 31st.             Let is,d denote the

yield in basis points on day d for a Treasury bill or bond of constant maturity s months;

for example, i12,d would be the 1-year rate. Daily Treasury yields were taken from the St.

Louis FRED database. Consider OLS estimation of

                                              8
                                              X
                            is,d − is,d−1 =         αjs ψ jd (fd − fd−1 ) + usd .                 (25)
                                              j=1


The OLS estimates α̂j(t),s along with 95% confidence intervals are plotted as a function

of calendar day t = 1, 2, ..., 31 in Figure 5 for s = 12 corresponding to a 1-year Treasury

security.   These indeed display very much the predicted pattern— an increase in the fed

funds futures rate around the middle of the month has a slightly bigger eﬀect on the 1-year

Treasury rate than would the same move at the beginning of the month, and a much bigger

eﬀect than the same move had it occurred toward the end of the month. The same pattern

holds for shorter yields (Figure 6) and longer yields (Figure 7).

   According to the theory, we can capture the exact eﬀect predicted for each calendar day

by regressing the change in interest rates on the product of the change in fed funds futures

with the function in (22)


                             is,d − is,d−1 = λs κ4 (td )(fd − fd−1 ) + usd                        (26)


where td is the calendar day-of-the-month associated with business day d, λs is the eﬀect of

a 1-basis-point increase in the target rate on a Treasury security of maturity s months, and

usd results from factors influencing yields that are uncorrelated with changes in the expected

target rate.   Note that all the parameters governing κ4 (t) having been inferred from the

                                                      22
behavior of fed funds rates and futures alone. Estimates of λs for diﬀerent maturities s are

reported in the first column of Table 2, and the value of λ̂s κ4 (t) is plotted as a function of t

in Figures 5-7 for the diﬀerent maturities s.

   I investigated the adequacy of (26) in a number of diﬀerent ways. One obvious question

is how important the function κ4 (td ) is for the regression, comparing (26) with a specification

in which changes in futures prices have the same eﬀect on interest rates regardless of when

within the month they occur:


                               is,d − is,d−1 = cs (fd − fd−1 ) + usd .                       (27)


The specifications (26) and (27) are non-nested, but it is simple enough to generalize to a

model that includes them both as special cases:


                   is,d − is,d−1 = cs (fd − fd−1 ) + λs κ4 (td )(fd − fd−1 ) + usd .         (28)


If model (26) is correct, then we should be able to accept the null hypothesis that cs = 0,

whereas if (27) is correct, we should accept the null hypothesis that λs = 0. If neither

specification is correct, then we should reject both null hypotheses. The second and third

columns of Table 2 report the OLS coeﬃcient estimates and standard errors for (28). For

maturities greater than 2 years, we accept the null hypothesis that cs = 0 and strongly reject

the hypothesis that λs = 0. For maturities less than 2 years, both hypotheses are rejected,

suggesting that there is more to the response of short-term interest rates to fed funds futures

than is captured by (26) alone. Even in these cases, however, the term involving κ4 (t) makes

by far the more important contribution statistically. I conclude that the model successfully

                                                  23
captures a clear tendency in the data for the impact to vary across the month, although it

seems to leave something out in the description of the response of short-term interest rates.

   In the same spirit, we can nest (26) and (25):
                                 8
                                 X
               is,d − is,d−1 =         αjs ψ jd (fd − fd−1 ) + λs κ4 (td )(fd − fd−1 ) + usd .   (29)
                                 j=1

As reported in the last two columns of Table 2, results here are not as encouraging.              In

every case, we strongly reject the hypothesis that α1s = · · · = α8s = 0, meaning that for

each maturity s there are statistically significant deviations from the broad monthly pattern

that is predicted by (26), and in every case readily accept the hypothesis that λs = 0,

meaning that the specific variation within octiles that is predicted by (26) is not particularly

found in the data.

   These last results are perhaps not too surprising given the many approximations embod-

ied in (26), which assumed among other things that all months have N = 31 calendar days

and ignored both weekend eﬀects and the fact that some business days convey much more

important economic news than others (on this last point, see Poole and Rasche (2000) and

Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005)).

   We can in fact carry that last point a step further and estimate a separate coeﬃcient λjs

for every calendar day j = 1, .., 31:


                                                31
                                                X
                           is,d − is,d−1 =            λjs ω jd (fd − fd−1 ) + usd                (30)
                                                j=1

where ω jd = 1 if day d falls on the jth day of the month. Figure 8 plots the OLS estimates of

λjs as a function of the calendar day j along with 95% confidence intervals and the predicted

                                                       24
values for the function λjs implied by (26) for 1-year Treasuries. Again the broad pattern

seems to fit well, though again there are large deviations on some days that are well beyond

what could be attributed to sampling error, and formal hypothesis tests comparing (30) with

(26) (which the former formally nests as a special case) lead to overwhelming rejection, with a

p-value less than 10−10 for each s. In addition to the details noted above, individual outliers

are highly influential for the daily regression (30), and one would want to carefully model

these non-Gaussian innovations usd and GARCH eﬀects before trying to fit the unrestricted

pattern in any more detail. This and related tasks, such as trying to use information about

the actual date of the target change when it is unambiguously known, using 1-month or

2-month futures contracts in place of the spot rate, and exploring the consequences of a

secular change in σ 2h (e.g., Lang, Sack, and Whitesell (2003) and Swanson (2006)), we leave

as topics for future research.

   Although there is much more to be done before having a completely satisfactory under-

standing of these relations, I believe that the approach developed here gives us a plausible

interpretation of the broad regularities found in the data and a sound basis for generalizing

the Kuttner (2001) and Poole, Rasche and Thornton (2002) approaches.            Although the

methods involve some new uses of the data, the conclusion I draw is quite consistent with

earlier researchers— changes in the fed funds target seem to be associated with quite large

changes in Treasury yields, even for maturities up to ten years.
