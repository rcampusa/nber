                                             ABSTRACT

This paper uses micro-level data on mutual funds from different financial centers investing in equity
and bonds to study how investors and managers behave and transmit shocks across countries. The
paper finds that the volatility of mutual fund investments is driven quantitatively by both the underlying
investors and fund managers through (i) injections/redemptions into each fund and (ii) managerial
changes in country weights and cash. Both investors and managers respond to country returns and
crises and adjust their investments substantially, for example, generating large reallocations during
the global crisis. Their behavior tends to be pro-cyclical, reducing their exposure to countries during
bad times and increasing it when conditions improve. Managers actively change country weights over
time, although there is significant short-run pass-through from returns to these weights. Consequently,
capital flows from mutual funds do not seem to have a stabilizing role and expose countries in their
portfolios to foreign shocks.

1. Introduction

The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 reignited the interest in the behavior of financial

intermediaries in both propelling risk taking and propagating shocks across markets and

countries. In fact, several papers argue that financial intermediaries were at the core of

the global financial crisis, as well as in some of the previous crises in emerging

economies. In particular, the literature stresses that market participants tend to take

too much risk during good times, and run and retrench when shocks hit the financial

system.1 Countries and companies facing short-term or foreign currency debt, or simply

depending on volatile foreign financing, are then susceptible to shocks and can become

financially constrained as liquidity in the financial system dries up.

          In a world where most savings are intermediated, two types of market

participants become essential to understand the behavior of financial institutions when

investing domestically and globally: (i) the underlying investors delegating their assets

to financial intermediaries and (ii) the managers allocating those assets. In the case of

investments abroad, investors tend to channel the bulk of their assets through financial

intermediaries dedicated to investing across countries, pouring funds into those

institutions when they wish to diversify globally and withdrawing their funds when they

favor local assets. Managers, in turn, need to deal with these shocks from investors and

other shocks by deciding how much cash to accumulate and in which countries to

invest. The shocks managers face can be large. For example, during the 1998 Russian

crisis and the 2008-2009 global crisis, financial institutions faced severe liquidity

shortages and withdrawals from the underlying investors, leading to the collapse of

Long-Term Management Company (LTCM), Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers, and

pushing the entire world financial system to the brink of a meltdown.

          The link between the underlying investors and fund managers, partly driven by

limited information and principal-agent problems, is important because it can

profoundly affect portfolio allocations by financial institutions. This link exists because

managers are monitored by investors (and their own supervisors) and respond to the

incentives that the monitoring imposes on them. The relation between managers and

investors is perhaps more obvious in the case of demandable debt that affects banks and

bond mutual funds (among others), where short-term rollover decisions by investors are

strategic complements and condition managers that are involved in maturity

transformation.2 Bank runs are a good example of this since the incentives to run are

correlated among depositors, given that their demandable claims (whose value is fixed in

nominal terms) are returned on a first-come, first-served basis (Diamond and Dybvig,

1983). The maturity mismatch and the possibility of a run constitute a source of

fragility as liquidity may suddenly vanish (Brunnermeier, 2009; Shin, 2009; Raddatz,

2010; and Gorton and Metrick, 2011). Vulnerability can be exacerbated under the



2
    More specifically, when one investor withdraws financing, banks and bond mutual funds are more likely
to run into trouble. Thus, other things equal, other investors have more incentives to withdraw financing
as well. In this sense, the decisions by investors are strategic complements (Bulow et al., 1985).

                                                      2
presence of leverage, where margin calls can also trigger collapses.3 But fragility can

exist even in the case of demandable equity (characteristic of mutual funds), where the

value of the claims move in tandem with the value of the assets so the rush to get out

first is attenuated. For instance, if investors have asymmetric information and flows to

mutual funds are related to past returns, sudden collapses in returns can generate fire

sales by investors (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997), which accentuate the collapse in returns

resulting in further liquidations. This serial correlation of returns resulting from funds

selling assets at distressed prices provides incentives for investors to sell their claims as

soon as possible (before prices continue declining) and may result in run-like behavior.

The fact that investors can pull out their demandable (debt or equity) claims can

generate incentives for managers to avoid long-run arbitrage opportunities, herd, and

deviate from the optimal portfolios for the underlying investors (Scharfstein and Stein,

1990 and Stein, 2005, 2009). In the case of mutual funds, open-end structures allow

investors to monitor managers on a short-term basis and discipline them if they behave

badly, but this short-run monitoring can impose limits to arbitrage, as managers are

constrained to take long-run positions. For example, managers might not buy assets at

fire-sale prices during crises, which are likely to pay off in the long run, since they can

suffer short-term withdrawals from the underlying investors. Agency problems might

thus lead to short-term structures, vulnerability, fire sales by investors and managers,

and contagion effects.

          While the literature argues that the supply side of funds and, in particular, the

actions of managers and investors are important in the transmission of shocks, detailed

and direct evidence on how financial intermediaries behave in their international

investments is rather limited. Some papers analyze the case of bank flows, whereas

others study mutual fund flows across countries.4 Although very informative about the

behavior of institutional investors, these studies tend to focus on aggregate investment

flows into different countries (using bank flows, foreign direct investment, and portfolio

flows). Therefore, they mostly miss important micro aspects of the inner-workings of

financial institutions, like how fund managers and the underlying investors behave,

which seem essential to understand how financial intermediaries invest and react to

shocks. These reactions seem to be at the core of the transmission of crises. Three

exceptions that stand out and are good complements to this paper are Kaminsky et al.

(2004), Hau and Rey (2008), and Jotikasthira et al. (2009).5

    Kaminsky et al. (2004) study momentum trading by investors and managers of Latin American equity
funds during the Asian crisis. Hau and Rey (2008) use data on equity funds to study whether foreign
exchange and equity risk measures trigger rebalancing behavior at the fund and stock level. Jotikasthira
et al. (2009) analyze how the movements in outside investor flows force significant changes in the fund
portfolio allocations to emerging markets that drive emerging market equity returns, correlations among
emerging markets, and the betas of emerging markets on developed markets. A much larger literature
studies other aspects of the behavior of mutual funds, at the domestic or international level. See, for
example, Grinblatt et al. (1995), Wermers (1999), and Gompers and Metrick (2001) for the U.S. domestic
funds, and Kang and Stulz (1997), Dahlquist and Robertsson (2001), Kim and Wei (2002), Chan et al.
(2005), Gelos and Wei (2005), and Didier et al. (2010) for the international ones.

                                                      4
        In this paper, we use a micro-level dataset on international mutual funds to shed

new light on how investors and managers react to shocks and might help transmit them

across countries. International mutual funds are particularly useful as they enable us to

separately analyze: (i) injections/redemptions, driven by the underlying investors; (ii)

fund portfolios or country weights, which are at the sole discretion of managers; and (iii)

their interactions (how investors monitor managers).6 The main data consist of portfolio

weights and assets invested in each country around the world for 1,076 equity and bond

mutual funds on a monthly basis during 15 years, January 1996 and November 2010.

The data cover portfolio allocations to 124 developed and emerging markets and cash,

plus fund returns, which allow us to obtain injections and redemptions into each fund.

        With the assembled dataset, we study the contribution of the underlying

investors and managers to the transmission of shocks and crises, with special attention

to the global financial crisis. We explore several related questions of interest. How

volatile is the mutual fund investment across countries? Do mutual funds help transmit

crises, as the literature has argued for financial intermediaries? What was their specific

behavior during the global crisis? More generally, what is the role of investors and

managers? How volatile are injections? To what extent do weights remain constant over

time? To the extent that weights change, how much are they the cause of valuation

effects versus actual buying/selling in different countries or regions? How long does it

take for weights to adjust to shocks? How are cash positions used? Are there differences


6
    Henceforth, we often use the term “injections” to refer to injections/redemptions, with the
understanding that redemptions correspond to negative injections.

                                                   5
between bond and equity funds? Lastly, how much of the volatility of capital flows is

driven by the behavior of the underlying investors and how much by the behavior of

mutual fund managers? Are capital flows and retrenchments largely driven by flows into

and out of investment funds that lead them to liquidate positions across countries to

maintain portfolio weights, or by active changes in these country weights by fund

managers?

      The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows. Mutual fund assets

fluctuate substantially and pro-cyclically over time. Both the underlying investors and

managers are behind these movements, retrenching from countries in bad times and

investing more in good times. In the case of the underlying investors, wealth effects

(driven by shocks at home) seem to have a direct impact on how much they invest in

other countries. When shocks are correlated across countries, like during the global

crisis, they do not act as deep-pocket international investors buying assets abroad at

fire-sale prices. The investor behavior exerts pressure on managers, who need to react to

this pressure as well as to shocks to returns (or valuation effects). In the short run,

managers allow shocks to returns to pass-through to country weights, with the latter

changing substantially over time. Over the long run, weights deviate from the pass-

through effects. While during normal times managers do not allow the pass-through to

be complete (in relative terms they reallocate a small fraction to countries that are

doing badly), they behave pro-cyclically during crises, moving away from countries

experiencing turmoil. This pro-cyclicality is observed particularly in equity funds.



                                           6
Managers of bond funds hold a larger cash cushion, which allows them to better absorb

shocks. The behavior of managers and investors has a direct effect on capital flows to

countries around the world. In sum, neither managers nor investors seem to be

exploiting potential long-term arbitrage opportunities by being contrarian, especially

during crises, and exerting a stabilizing role. Instead, they seem to amplify crises and

transmit shocks across countries. The global crisis was a notable example of this type of

behavior.

      Our findings are relevant to different strands of the theoretical literature in both

international finance and finance. First, the results in this paper suggest that the

demandability of assets plays an important role in the reactions of investors, and is a

factor that cannot be neglected in future models of crises. We show that investors run

even from equity claims, not just from debt claims. This could be explained, for

example, by autocorrelation in returns or wealth effects coming from the investors’

home country. Moreover, a run by certain investors might trigger runs by other

investors, perhaps because of asymmetric information or because flows are related to

past returns.

      Second, the findings in this paper also contribute and provide evidence to the

theoretical literature that discusses whether the open-end and closed-end structure of

mutual funds matter. Our results from open-end funds indicate that when shocks are

correlated across countries, like during the global crisis, managers do not act as deep-

pocket international investors buying assets abroad at fire-sale prices. The behavior of



                                           7
investors exerts pressure on managers. The evidence is, thus, consistent with the

theoretical literature that argues that in open-end structures neither managers nor

investors act counter-cyclically, trying to benefit from potential long-term arbitrage

opportunities, and thus performing a stabilizing role. Instead, they seem to amplify

crises and transmit shocks across countries, which is also consistent with the large

contagion literature.7

          Third, the findings also relate to the literature that discusses how different types

of shocks trigger crises. There is an extensive literature on the origins and propagation

of financial crises, and a growing literature on the global financial crisis that tries to

understand why a relatively small shock in the U.S. subprime sector resulted in a global

recession and the near collapse of many financial institutions and markets. Several

papers in this literature conclude that financial institutions play an important channel

of the transmission of shocks across countries, producing large fluctuations in capital

flows.8 In this paper, we show micro-evidence that suggests that shocks to the supply

side of funds seem important in the transmission and amplification of shocks. With the

data we use, we are able to measure different effects inside financial intermediaries,

which other papers that focus on capital flows (aggregate or by type) cannot do, despite

the increasing interest in financial intermediaries in the transmission of crises. In

particular, we measure the shocks faced by managers investing internationally and the

Mendoza and Quadrini (2010).

way they respond to those shocks. Namely, we disentangle the actions of investors

injecting and withdrawing capital from open-ended funds, possibly as a way to discipline

managers, and the behavior of managers actively allocating country portfolios and

reacting to shocks from investors and returns. Our results support the claims that

shocks to financial institutions and their inner-workings are important to understand

crises.

          Fourth, there is an increasing interest in studying how portfolios are managed

when investing around the world and how shocks impact them. Important among shocks

are valuation effects.9 One advantage of working with mutual fund data is that we can

work with actual portfolios. This is helpful because, while there is much discussion on

portfolio reallocations, there is limited information on how portfolios are allocated and

managed. There are no data on the portfolios of households and little data on those of

other institutions like banks and hedge funds. Moreover, unlike country portfolios, the

data we use are not inferred from capital flow data. In our case, we link movements in

asset allocations to capital flows by an important group of foreign portfolio investors,

international mutual funds. Moreover, we analyze in detail what role valuation effects

play in changes in portfolio compositions.

          The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the data

and provides some basic statistics of the mutual fund investments across countries.

Section 3 discusses the shocks to managers and studies the variation in fund allocations

crises. Section 5 studies how the variations in the investor and manager responses affect

capital flows to different countries. Section 6 concludes.



2. Data and Summary Statistics

In this paper, we use a micro-level dataset consisting of an unbalanced panel of 1,140

international equity mutual funds and 121 international bond funds, containing the

monthly country portfolios of these funds over the period December 1995 to November

2010 for equity funds and July 2002 to November 2010 for bond funds. The dataset

comes from EPFR Global and includes active and dead cross-regional and regional

equity and bond funds registered in various domiciles globally. These funds invest in

over 124 developed and developing economies around the world. For each fund and

month, the dataset contains the total net asset (TNA) value of the fund denominated in

U.S. dollars, the percentage of the fund assets allocated to each country (which we refer

as country weights or weights), and the percentage held in cash. The dataset has actively

and passively managed funds with different investment scopes: global, emerging markets

and different regional funds (Table 1). The data also contain information on the fund

domicile, the family (investment or asset management company), and main currency

denomination.10 We generally use the term “fund type” to refer to any of these

dimensions of fund characteristics, clarifying the precise dimension when necessary.


10
     Our sample covers mainly open-end mutual funds. While EPFR Global data contain some closed-end
funds, their importance is relatively small. Moreover, many of the closed-end funds they cover allow for

                                                  10
          To perform the empirical analysis, we cleaned the original data in standard ways,

reducing the sample in about 15% and the total of funds to 1,076 starting in 1996.11 The

final dataset on country allocations contains 7,429,000 observations of the investments

of the included mutual funds across countries and time. There are substantially more

data (cross sectional and time series) and variety of funds for equity funds than for

bond funds. For this reason, we place somewhat more weight on the results using equity

funds.12

          We complement the analysis by collecting additional data from other sources

aimed mainly at computing inflows and outflows to funds and countries. To calculate

monthly injections into each fund, we collect data on fund prices (Net Asset Values,

NAVs) from Bloomberg and Datastream that we match to the corresponding funds from

EPFR Global by name and family. We are able to match about 90% of the funds in our

cleaned sample, ending up with 896 and 106 equity and bond funds, respectively, with




monthly or quarterly subscriptions and redemptions, and are therefore not truly closed. There is also flow
activity due to share buybacks or distributions being taken in cash.
11
     We conducted two basic cleanings. First, we removed fund-time periods where the data was reported at
a frequency other than monthly. This excludes some funds that report quarterly data during part of the
sample period. Second, we excluded funds that report data for less than 12 months in the entire sample
(unless they are present until the end of the sample period).
12
     Equity mutual funds cover the period January 1996 to November 2010 and contain nine types of funds
(of global and regional nature). There are a total of 965 mutual funds with 6,867,500 usable observations.
Instead, bond mutual funds cover the period July 2002 to November 2010, encompass two types of funds
(global and global emerging markets), and include a total of 111 mutual funds. The total number of
observations (country weights and cash) for bond funds is 561,500.

                                                    11
return data.13 The analyses in the paper that require fund return information are

restricted to this subset of funds.

          Since we do not know the detailed portfolio of each fund within a country, we use

country-level indexes to compute returns and assume throughout the paper that all

funds investing in a country experience the same return to their investments in that

country, disregarding country-return heterogeneity across funds.14 To this end we collect

monthly, dividend-adjusted price indexes in U.S. dollars for stock markets (MSCI

Standard Index, S&P Broad Market Index, and local sources for a total of 86 countries)

and bond markets (JP Morgan sovereign bond index for 78 countries).15 Analyses that

require country-return information are restricted to those countries and time-periods for

which we could gather these data.

          Table 1 shows the characteristics of the cleaned mutual fund sample (without

constraining by return price availability). Panel A reports sample characteristics by

13
     Information on ISIN is not available for the EPFR Global mutual funds, so we had to match the return
data with the EPFR Global data according to the mutual fund name and family, using an algorithm that
compares the (Levenshtein) distance across names (which takes into account the minimum number of
insertions, deletions, or substitutions necessary to change one string into the other). We then manually
screen out incorrect matches and complete the matching process. This procedure yields 896 matches for
equity funds and 106 matches for bond funds (over 90% of the sample). The total number of observations
of fund prices is 255,510.
14
     We believe this is a reasonable approximation given the documented synchronicity of returns across
assets within countries, especially in developing countries (Morck et al., 2000). Furthermore, we find a
strong correlation between the return of a fund computed directly from its NAV and the return computed
from the portfolio of country investments and country-level returns, which gives additional validity to our
approximation.
15
     The time coverage is January 1999-November 2010 for stock market indexes and July 2002-November
2010 for bond market indexes. The total number of observations of stock and bond market indexes across
countries and over time is 23,272.

                                                    12
equity/bond funds. There are 965 equity funds (85% of the entire original sample) from

January 1996 to November 2010, with a median number of 47 observations per fund.

The total number of bond funds is 111 (92% of the entire original sample), covering the

period July 2002 to November 2010, with a median number of 34 observations per fund.

Panel B reports the number of funds and observations by different partitions. Of the

total sample, 95% is actively managed and the rest is passively managed. Also, almost

65% of the funds have their investment scope in Asia (excluding Japan), global markets,

global emerging markets, or Europe. Finally, Table 1 documents the number of funds

and observations by domicile. The funds are primarily domiciled in developed market

jurisdictions, in fact, 80% of the funds are domiciled (in order of importance by the

number of funds) in Luxembourg, the U.S., the U.K., and Ireland. Appendix Table 1

classifies funds by mutual fund family. Average total net assets (first computed within

funds, and then across all funds) is around 620 million U.S. dollars for both equity and

bond funds. Appendix 1 provides more description of the data and some investment

patterns.

          Figure 1 shows the evolution of total net assets (TNAs) in equity and bond funds

by region. Panel A plots total assets for equity funds between January 1996 and

December 2000 and between June 2001 and November 2010.16 Panel B displays total

assets for bond funds between July 2002 and November 2010. The figure shows not only


16
     The division between both time frames in equity funds is an important one due to the relevance of
global equity funds. EPFR Global starts reporting information for global equity funds in June 2001. The
introduction of this type of funds adds nearly 90,000 million U.S. dollars to the total assets in all equity
funds.

                                                    13
the large increase in total assets over time, but also the sharp declines around crises,

particularly around the Asian and Russian crises and the global financial crisis. A

similar pattern is observed for bond funds. The figure also shows that, as a group, bond

funds are much smaller than equity funds (100 versus 599 billion U.S. dollars in

November 2010), even though the mean fund is of a similar size.

      It is interesting to observe not only the variation in TNAs but also that of

country weights, for which we focus on the period around the global financial crisis.

Figures 2 and 3 show the weights for equity and bond funds, respectively, with global

funds at the top and global emerging funds at the bottom. The figures illustrate the

evolution of weights for some of the main regions of investment within emerging and

developed countries. In particular, they show the weights in: (i) emerging economies

(emerging Asia, emerging Europe, and Latin America), developed Europe, and North

America for global funds and (ii) emerging Asia, emerging Europe, and Latin America

for global emerging funds. The figures also mark some of the main events around the

global crisis: the nationalization of Northern Rock, the collapses of Bear Stearns and

Lehman Brothers, and the AIG near-collapse.

      Figures 2 and 3 show several noteworthy features of the data. First, weights

fluctuate substantially over time. Second, there are significant reallocations across

regions especially at times of stress. For example, the figures for equity funds show that,

even though the epicenter of the crisis was in the U.S., managers started liquidating

their exposure to emerging economies after the collapse of Bears Stearns while they



                                            14
increased their exposure to North America. This is consistent with a relatively smaller

collapse in some asset prices in the U.S. than, for instance, in emerging Asia. Only in

early 2009 managers started reversing that trend. Among global emerging funds,

managers sold their positions in emerging Europe and Latin America and moved to

emerging Asia. For example, between June 2008 and July 2009 the mutual fund

exposure in Asia increased from 45% to 55%, while it decreased from 14% to 9% in

emerging Europe (after having dropped to 7%) and from 24% to 21% in Latin America.

Among bond funds, the large substitution took place between developed Europe and

North America in global funds, when managers reduced their exposure to Europe from

51% in March 2008 to 31% in November 2008 and increased their share in North

America from 7% to 19% during the same period. Global emerging funds sold their

positions in emerging Europe and bought assets in emerging Asia after August 2008.

      Figure 4 shows a similar plot but for cash positions, which increased for equity

funds in the buildup to the crisis and started declining sometime after the collapse of

Lehman Brothers. Bond funds show more variation in their cash positions before the

crisis, with global bond funds reducing their holdings and global emerging bond funds

increasing them. Nonetheless, bond funds quickly reduced their cash positions after the

collapse of Lehman.

3. Shocks to Managers and Portfolio Reallocations


Mutual fund managers decide on the allocation of the funds they manage, but the size of

these funds depends on the returns of their previous investments and the injection

(redemptions) of flows into (out of) the fund. While the return of a fund depends on its

past investments, the exact realization of the return is stochastic and can be considered

as a shock to the fund manager. Similarly, while the performance of a fund may affect

its injections and redemptions, ex-post these inflows and outflows are at the discretion

of the underlying investors and largely outside the control of managers.

      Mutual fund assets fluctuate importantly. The median growth rate of assets

across equity funds fluctuates between -30% and 20%, with a time average of 0.35% and

a standard deviation of 7.44% (Figure 5). Fluctuations in the median growth rate of

assets are somewhat smaller among bond funds, moving between -20% and 10% (time

average and standard deviation of 1.09% and 3.70%, respectively). Table 2 shows

interesting variation in the growth rate of assets of funds specialized in different

regions/segments. Among equity funds, those specialized in the group called emerging

Europe, Middle East, and Africa and in that called emerging Europe experience the

highest growth in assets and the highest variability of this growth. On the contrary,

funds specialized in Europe experience the lowest growth rate of assets. Similarly,

among bond funds the highest growth rates (and highest standard deviations) occur for

global emerging funds. Thus, at the TNA level, the data show a shift in favor of

developing countries during the period of analysis. The evolution of the median growth


                                           16
of assets of mutual funds is characterized by lengthy periods of expansion followed by

shorter periods of sharp contractions that roughly coincide with periods of international

financial turmoil. For instance, equity fund assets experienced large declines in 1997-

1998, 2001, and 2008. Because of sample restrictions, among bond funds we only observe

the drop in assets in 2008.

           Fund assets may grow because of higher returns of their investments or because

of injections to the fund by the underlying investors. In fact, the growth rate of fund ’s

total assets,       , can be trivially written as

                                                          ,                                                (1)

where         is the (net) return to fund         at time , and                 /       is the injection to

the fund           expressed as a fraction of the fund’s initial assets                  . While injections

are not directly observable, we can estimate them. To do so, we compute individual

fund returns on a given month and obtain injections from the difference between the

change in total net assets and individual returns. More formally,

                                                                 ,                                         (2)

where         is the gross rate of returns to fund            at time , computed as        ⁄      , with

being the fund price or NAV, adjusted by dividend payments.17


17
     A fund’s net asset value (NAV) corresponds to the total net assets (           divided by the number of
shares (     ). Thus, the ratio of NAV in two consecutive periods correspond to the ratio of the total asset
values times the inverse ratio of total shares        ⁄                     /            . The flows into the
fund can also be expressed as the increase (decrease) in shares times the value of the share
                      ⁄     . Replacing this in Equation (2), we obtain that the gross returns correspond to
the ratio of net asset values. The only caveat to our calculation is that total net assets discount the value
of a fund’s liabilities, such as the fees paid to the managers. However, if these fees are proportional to the

                                                     17
        The evolution of the returns and injections for the median fund is shown in

Figure 5, Panels B and C, while summary statistics are reported in Table 2. For the

median equity and bond funds, both returns and injections experience significant

fluctuations. Fluctuations in fund returns are much more volatile than those in

injections for equity funds (standard deviations of 6.23% and 2.05%, respectively), while

for bond funds the volatility of these components is similar (standard deviations of

2.53% and 2.05%, respectively). This is consistent with equity returns being more

volatile than those of fixed income securities (Schwert, 1989; Andersen et al., 2007).

Both components also exhibit a similar time pattern, which also coincides with that of

the growth rate of assets, suggesting that the components do not cancel each other.

Both returns and injections expand during good times and experience severe

contractions during periods of financial turmoil. Across types of funds by target region,

the most salient pattern is the large growth in injections to funds specialized in BRICs.

        The relative variability of returns and injections for equity and bond funds can

also be used to explain the variance of the growth rates of assets within funds. Among

equity funds, the variances of returns and injections explain roughly the same fraction of

the variability of the growth rate of assets (Table 2, Panel A). On average, the

variances of returns and injections explain, respectively, 47% and 53% of fund asset




assets under management they would only bias the levels of the variables but cancel out when computing
the returns and flows relative to initial assets.

                                                    18
growth variability.18 Among bond funds, however, the volatility of injections is behind

most of the overall variability in asset growth, explaining 89% of it. These results show

that price fluctuations are important drivers of the variation of the gross asset positions

of investors, especially in equity, which is consistent with valuation effects having

potentially important consequences for movements in net foreign asset positions too

(Gourinchas and Rey, 2007b).

          The variance decompositions reported above consider the whole period with

available data. However, it is possible that the contributions of returns and injections

vary between tranquil and crisis periods. This is indeed the case. Table 3 shows that

return variability plays a much more important role during crisis times. For instance,

during the global crisis the contribution of return variability to overall variance of

equity funds is 67%, compared to a 37% contribution in the four years leading to the

beginning of the crisis. Table 3, Panel B also shows that among bond funds, the

contribution of return variability increases from 12% prior to the crisis to 19% during

the crisis. These broad patterns tend to be relatively stable across fund types and crises.

          The previous results show that, at the fund level, both returns and injections

contribute to the variability of asset growth. They also show that returns and injections

vary over time in a manner that is consistent with the international business cycle. As



18
     Following Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (2005), we have equally imputed the covariance term to each
component (returns and injections). That is, the share of the variance of the growth of assets explained by
returns equals the ratio of the variance of returns plus the covariance between returns and injections to
the variance of the growth of assets. The contemporaneous covariance between returns and injections is
small and negative.

                                                    19
said above, both returns and injections show sharp drops during times of financial

turmoil, and lengthy expansions during tranquil times. It is, therefore, possible that the

ability of returns and injections to explain variations in assets comes mainly from all

these series sharing a common time component, but this is not the case, especially for

injections. While a common time component can explain 59% and 20% of the variability

of fund returns (for equity and bond funds, respectively), the same component explains

only 5% and 9% of the variability of injections.19

          A fund manager’s main decision is how to allocate his available funds across the

different assets in which he may invest, in particular across the countries where the fund

specializes. This decision may be driven by long-run structural factors behind the fund’s

strategic asset allocation (expected returns, covariance of assets across countries,

benchmarks being followed, and so forth), but it may also depend on short-run

variations in these or other factors. Faced with shocks to the return of their investments

or to injections by the underlying investors, fund managers may or may not decide to

reallocate their investments within and across countries. This is important because

weights that are relatively stable imply that only fluctuations in fund assets (either

because of returns or injections) will impact capital flows. On the other hand, country

weights that experience non-trivial fluctuations over time indicate that manager

decisions, on how to let weights adjust to relative price changes or how to buy and sell

assets differentially in different countries, play a role in international capital flows.


19
     These figures correspond to the overall   of an ordinary least squares regression between each of these
variables and a set of month fixed effects.

                                                     20
Appendix 2 shows that country weights indeed fluctuate significantly across funds and

over time. Next, we study in more detail the behavior of injections and weights.



4. Behavior of Investors and Managers

The evidence above shows that both the underlying investors and managers change

their positions over time, but tells us little about the ultimate determinants of mutual

fund investments across countries. For instance, it does not show us how investors and

managers respond to crises and shocks. These responses are crucial to understand if this

type of financial intermediaries may contribute to or dampen the transmission of crises

across countries. To advance in our understanding of their behavior, we model how

injections and weights vary over time using some parsimonious models that, nonetheless,

capture basic and important properties of the data.

      Underlying investors may link their injections into a fund to attributes that vary

at the fund level and over time. Therefore, to study the behavior of injections we regress

them on variables measuring the occurrence of crises (both at the countries of destiny of

a fund and the global level), returns of the fund, and returns of its country of origin.

This allows us to test, for example, if investors inject more resources into a fund when it

is performing well, as previously shown for U.S. mutual funds by Chevalier and Ellison

(1997), among others. It also permits us to estimate how investors react to changes in

the conditions experienced by the countries in which funds invest, measured by crisis at

the country of destiny. Furthermore, investors are also affected by shocks such as global



                                            21
crises and changes in the conditions at their country of origin, which can lead to change

their investments in the type of international mutual funds we analyze. During good

times, investors may feel richer and desire to invest more internationally and diversify

risk, and vice versa. But it could also be the case that investors prefer to invest more

internationally when conditions in their home countries worsen, since international

markets might provide better prospects in relative terms. Ex-ante, these effects are not

obvious. Investors may react to different types of shocks pro-cyclically, counter-

cyclically, or not react at all.

          We sequentially regress the injections to a fund on a weighted country crisis

dummy, a dummy variable taking the value one during periods of global turmoil, lagged

fund returns, and the returns of the fund’s country of origin.20,21 This is akin to an

augmented version of the specification estimated by Sirri and Tufano (1998) for U.S.




20
     In the regressions, we normalize the injections to a fund (given by Equation (2)) by the average assets
instead of the initial assets to isolate fluctuations in injections from fluctuations in initial assets. Results
using injections normalized by initial assets (available upon request) are qualitatively and quantitatively
similar to those reported here, but estimators are less precise because of the additional volatility of the
denominator in the expression.
21
     The weighted country crisis dummy is constructed using yearly country crisis data, weighted by the
fund’s country portfolio weights at the beginning of the year. The crisis variable comes from Broner et al.
(2010) and dates a crisis the years when a country suffers at least a banking, debt, or currency crisis,
according to indicators widely used in the literature. The periods of global turmoil are: July 1997-
December 1997 (the Asian crisis), August 1998-December 1998 (the Russian crisis), March 2001-December
2001 (the dotcom bust, September 11, and the Enron scandal), and September 2008-June 2009 (the global
financial crisis). Fund returns are computed from fund-price data. Returns of the fund’s country of origin
are measured using a broad equity price index from the country where the fund is located. Funds that are
domiciled in Luxembourg are matched with country returns from Belgium since there are no available
indexes for bonds and equity from Luxembourg.

                                                      22
mutual funds.22 In addition, the regressions include, alternatively, fixed effects at the

fund, time, and country of origin-time levels. Standard errors are clustered at the

country of origin-time level to control for correlation in injections to funds located in the

same country.23

           The results reported in Table 4 show that injections to both equity and bond

funds fall when the countries of destiny are affected by crises (Column (1)) and in

periods of global crises (Column (2)). On the contrary, injections increase in response to

the lagged returns of the fund (Column (3)), which are presumably observable by the

underlying investors, and in response to increases in the contemporaneous returns in the

country of origin of the fund (Column (4)), which capture local conditions. Interestingly,

among both equity and bond funds, the coefficient on lagged fund returns is lower than

that for country of origin returns. One can interpret this difference as suggesting that

wealth effects are stronger than substitution effects (across funds). A decline in local

conditions does not itself lead investors to increase their investments in international

funds to take advantage of equity return differentials or “carry-trade” effects (in cases

when these declines are associated with low interest rates). Nonetheless, controlling for

the conditions in the country of origin, more money flows into (or less money gets out

of) the better performing funds.




22
     Sirri and Tufano (1998) include a longer set of lags of injections and fund returns in their specification.
We also estimated a version including up to three lags of both variables obtaining similar results.
23
     Clustering estimations by time yields very similar results to using clusters by country of origin-time.

                                                        23
       The regression in Column (5) includes all the previous variables simultaneously

and shows similar coefficients than those obtained in the single-variable regressions,

except for the impact of country crisis on equity funds. This indicates that while in

some cases the country-crisis variable is capturing the variation coming from periods of

global turmoil, the potential correlation between global crises and returns at the fund

and country level is not behind the significant results obtained in the previous columns.

       Quantitatively, a global crisis reduces injections to equity funds by about 1

percentage point. This is much larger than the average monthly injection of about 0.1

percentage points, and 20% of the interquartile range of variation of injections over

average assets (5 percentage points). Similarly, a 10% decline in fund returns also

reduces injections by 1 percentage point. Since crises and fund returns are negatively

correlated, the joint impact of crises is larger. Finally, a 10% decline in the returns of

the country of origin (domicile) of the fund reduces injections by 2 percentage points.

The quantitative importance of these variables for bond funds is higher. For instance, a

global crisis reduces injections to bond funds by 3 percentage points. Although the

average injection over average assets for these funds is also higher (1.3% instead of 0.1%

for equity funds) the interquartile range of variation is similar than in equity funds

(5%). Thus, because of greater coefficients, injections to bond funds react more strongly

to returns and crises in the target countries and the country of origin.

       The regressions in Columns (6) and (7) add time and country of origin-time fixed

effects to the regression in Column (5), respectively. In both cases, and among equity



                                            24
and bond funds, the impact of country crisis declines and becomes statistically

insignificant (the global crisis variable is dropped from the regression in both cases

because it varies only with time). This confirms that the identification of the coefficient

in Column (1) comes mainly from a common, time-varying component, and not from

the idiosyncratic incidence of crises in individual countries. Lagged fund returns and

country returns remain statistically significant, except when including country of origin-

time fixed effects for bond funds, where the coefficient for these returns retains the

magnitude but becomes marginally significant (with a p-value of 0.11).

        The results above show that the underlying investors respond to local and

international conditions when deciding whether to inject or withdraw money from

mutual funds. Fund managers must then choose how to allocate or liquidate positions in

response to these injections/redemptions and the realized returns of their investments. It

is this response (or lack thereof) that ultimately determines the net inflows/outflows to

the countries where each fund invests.

        To empirically study the behavior of fund managers, we start with the following

identity that relates the country portfolio weights of a fund in two subsequent periods

                                                                                       (3)
                                                       ,

where       is the portfolio weight of fund    in country   at time ,      and     are the

gross returns of the investments of the fund in country     and across its whole portfolio,

respectively. Finally,    is the net flow of money from fund      to country     at time ,

expressed as a fraction of the fund’s initial assets in the country        , and     is the


                                              25
injection/redemption of funds into (out of) fund            by its underlying investors, expressed

as a fraction of the initial assets of the fund           .24

          The expression in Equation (3) simply states that the weight of a country in a

fund portfolio at the end of time           depends on the country’s initial portfolio weight, the

return of the fund’s investment in the country, the return of the whole fund portfolio,

the fund’s new net inflows into and out of the country, and the fund’s

injections/redemptions. Intuitively, in absence of any type of flows (by the fund across

countries or to the fund), the portfolio weight of a country would increase (decrease)

only if the country assets have a higher (lower) return than those of other countries in

the fund portfolio. Henceforth, we will refer to the counterfactual country portfolio

weight in absence of any new flows or injections,                     /   as the buy-and-hold weight.

The presence of injections adds another layer of variation in relative weights because

they would require the fund to allocate new money across countries or to liquidate

positions that may result in changes in portfolio weights. Furthermore, the flows to

different countries do not need to be linked to injections; even in the absence of the

latter, managers might decide to change country weights by reallocating positions across

countries. While Equation (3) is an identity, it does not imply any specific behavior for

country portfolio weights at time               because funds have the liberty, in principle, to

relocate funds across countries as they see fit (through variations in                ) to achieve a

given portfolio composition.


24
     As explained in Section 2, for data availability reasons we assume that the returns of all funds i
investing in country j are identical; namely,         across funds.

                                                    26
          The discussion above shows that Equation (3) is a useful starting point to

analyze the behavior of portfolio weights. Log-linearizing that equation around a state

with gross returns equal to one and zero injections, one obtains the following expression

                                                                                ,                   (4)

where           is the log of         , lowercase        represents the corresponding net returns

associated with the gross returns described above, and                         and       are the main

components of a second order approximation error.25 This expression clearly shows that

in the absence of relative flows                    there is complete pass-through from relative

returns              into weights (to a first order log approximation).

          We allow the relative flows (which are at the complete discretion of fund

managers) to depend on lagged weights, relative returns, and the incidence of crises as

follows,

                                  δ          η                γ                     .               (5)

      is a dummy variable that takes the value one if country               experiences a crisis at time

 ,       is a country of destiny-fund fixed effect, and           is an error term. , , and         are

parameters that capture the sensitivity of relative flows to lagged weights, relative

returns, and crises, and the rest of the notation is the same as above. The inclusion of

relative returns as determinants of relative flows is standard in the literature (e.g. Hau

and Rey, 2008). We augment this dependence of flows on country performance by



25
     We separate the two components because the      term that contains expressions on       and    may
become especially important when these variables significantly deviate from the approximation point. It
may be, therefore, useful to control for them in a non-parametric manner.

                                                    27
including the crisis indicator. Finally, the presence of lagged weights captures the

possibility that flows respond to deviations of those weights from some desired target

level.

           Replacing Equation (5) back in Equation (4), we obtain the following empirical

specification for the evolution of fund portfolio weights,

                                                                                      ,                   (6)

where           1     ,      1      , and the rest of the notation is the same as above. This is

an estimable equation that allows us to study the determinants of a fund’s country

portfolio allocations and, replacing the estimated parameters back in Equation (5), the

determinants of its relative flows.26,27

           Table 5 reports estimates of Equation (6) for equity funds (Panel A) and bond

funds (Panel B). The regression includes country weights in the target region of a fund

(i.e., in countries within the main scope of investment), and excludes cash weights,

which are analyzed separately. The first five columns report the main parameters of


26
     Note that the model described by Equation (6) corresponds to a dynamic panel and that omitting the
fund-country fixed effect, or cleaning it by taking differences will result in inconsistent parameters,
especially for the lagged weights (Arellano and Bond, 1991). Estimating the fixed effects using the least
squares dummy variable estimator is still asymptotically biased, but the bias is of the order of 1/T, where
T is the time-series length of the typical fund. Since T is relatively large (50 observations for the median
fund), this bias is small. Including and estimating the fixed effects is important.
27
     Although it is possible that the process for log weights has a unit root and that standard t-stats cannot
be reliably used, standard panel unit root tests (Im-Pesharan) reject the hypothesis of a unit root in log
weights. Second, as we report below, we also estimate specifications where the dependent variable is the
difference between log current weights and the buy-and-hold benchmark. These differences should be
stationary under both the null of a unit root and the alternative. Finally, as we describe next, we estimate
the specification at lower frequencies (semi-annual and annual) that make much more likely for weights to
differ from past weights.

                                                       28
Equation (6) including different combinations of fixed effects that capture the different

sources of variation of the data. The results in Column (1) include no fixed effects, while

the results in Column (2) include fund and time fixed effects that decompose                            on its

two dimensions. The results in Column (2) show that the coefficients are very similar to

those without fixed effects and that these sources of variation do not have much

explanatory power.28 In the two columns, the coefficient on both lagged weights and

relative returns are significantly positive, meaning that weights are serially correlated

and positively correlated with relative returns.

           The conclusions from the first two columns of Table 5 are not robust to the

inclusion of other sets of fixed effects capturing shocks of higher dimensions. Columns

(3), (4), and (5) include, alternatively and jointly, fund-time fixed effects and country of

destiny-fund fixed effects. The results in Column (3), which include fund-time fixed

effects, exhibit a significant increase in the coefficient for relative returns. They indicate

that the low coefficient on relative returns documented in the initial columns is largely

due to fund-level, time-varying shocks, such as those to injections and fund returns that

are part of the approximation error in Equation (4).29 When including the country of



28
     Results controlling for shocks to the fund at the country of origin level (unreported) are also similar to
those obtained without fixed effects and to those obtained with fund and time fixed effects, indicating
that shocks at the level of country of origin do not play an important role in the dispersion of portfolio
allocations.
29
     For instance, in the nonlinear version of the identity (Equation (3)) the impact of fund returns on
weights depends, among other things, on its injections. If these injections are large, weights would be
mainly driven by these injections and respond relatively less to returns. Furthermore, from an
econometric standpoint, these fixed effects also control for time variation in the within-fund (across-

                                                       29
destiny-fund fixed effects (Column (4)), the coefficient on lagged weight declines

significantly relative to the other columns. This is consistent with the existence of some

stable “target” component of weights per country for each fund.

           Including only the two sets of fixed effects that have some impact on the

coefficients (country of destiny-fund and fund-time fixed effects), the regressions in

Column (5) show that at the monthly level there is an important, albeit incomplete,

degree of pass-through of relative returns to weights. Managers do not undo to an

important extent the short-term impact of relative returns on their positions, and let

them erode as a result of low returns. Using Equation (5) to uncover the behavior of

relative flows, we find that they are weakly negatively related to relative returns at a

monthly frequency.30

           The regression in Column (6) further investigates the pro-cyclicality of fund

allocations by including a country-crisis dummy, as in Equation (6), to test if funds

react especially to crises periods. The results show that funds decrease their exposure to

countries that experience crises. A crisis results in a 2% decline in the weights assigned

to the affected country, on top of the decline implied by the relative returns. The strong

negative relation between portfolio weights and country crises implies that fund flows

also respond negatively to them. Thus, while relative flows are neutral or mildly


countries) dispersion of weights (captured in the average log weight), and identifies the importance of
relative returns using only within-fund, across-countries variation in returns and allocations.
30
     For the readers interested directly in the parameters of the flow Equation (5), Appendix Table 8 reports
the same regressions shown in Table 5 but using relative flows (the difference between log weights, log
lagged weights, and net relative returns) as dependent variable. The conclusions from this exercise remain
the same.

                                                      30
contrarian during normal times, as shown in Column (6), they are strongly pro-cyclical

during crises.

       It is important, however, to be cautious about interpreting the contrarian

behavior of relative flows during normal times as implying that funds wish to increase

their exposure to underperforming countries. To reach that conclusion, one requires a

model of the relation between relative flows and desired weights. Appendix 3 presents a

simple but very flexible partial adjustment model of this relation, and shows that under

reasonable assumptions, the results reported above are consistent with desired weights

that are positively related to relative returns. The intuition for this apparent

contradiction is that in the model relative flows depend on the difference between the

fund’s desired and initial (buy-and-hold) weights. If desired weights are higher (lower)

than buy-and-hold weights, money flows into (out of) a country. Since a decline in

relative returns has a direct one-to-one pass-through impact on the buy-and-hold

portfolio weights, if desired weights decline less than one-to-one with relative returns,

relative flows would tend to move in a contrarian manner (even when desired weights

decline with a fall in returns).

       The last two columns of Table 5 repeat the specification in Column (6) using

data aggregated at different frequencies. The results show that the importance of pass-

through declines at lower frequencies, as funds have more time to adjust their positions

after changes in relative prices. The same is valid for the response of flows which are

more negatively related to relative returns as the frequency of data is reduced.



                                           31
Nonetheless, the negative relation between weights, flows, and crises is present at all

frequencies.

          The results for bond funds (Table 5, Panel B) are broadly similar to those for

equity funds, but while the coefficients move in the same manner when various fixed

effects are added, the pass-through of returns on weights is much smaller than among

equity funds, implying that the underlying relative flows respond to returns in a

contrarian fashion.31 Quantitatively, a decline of 10 percentage points in a country’s

relative returns reduces its weight on about 6%. The response of weights and flows to

crises is negative but statistically insignificant. Bond funds seem to behave in a more

contrarian way than equity funds. This behavior may result from a lack of ability to

quickly liquidate bonds of countries suffering strong reversals, because of the lower

liquidity of some bond markets. Thus, in the short run bond funds may be forced to

liquidate positions in countries that do relatively better in order to meet redemptions,

but as they can slowly accommodate their positions they react pro-cyclically to return

differentials. Another possible explanation is that the unobserved benchmarks followed

by bond funds do not react as fast as those of equity funds to relative country returns.

Finally, as we show below, these findings may also be explained by higher precautionary

holdings of cash by bond funds than by equity funds.

          We conducted a series of robustness checks on the results of the basic

specifications reported in Table 5 without finding significant changes in our results.


31
     Note that this does not necessarily imply a contrarian response of total country flows because relative
flows are measured relative to the injections to the fund, which we know react negatively to bad news.

                                                      32
Among these checks we estimated the model using only funds with at least three years

of data, we added more lags of log weights and relative returns (up to three), we

considered countries both inside and outside the relevant region, and we estimated the

model separately for global equity funds and regional equity funds. In all cases, the

qualitative and quantitative results (available upon request) are similar to those

reported in Table 5.

      The log transformation used above and the regressions reported in Table 5

discard the information contained in the zero weight countries. It is not obvious if these

zeroes should be included or not because some cases may correspond to countries that

are out of the scope of investment of a fund for reasons we do not observe (prospectus

or underlying unobserved benchmark). To check the concern that the zeroes may

contain useful information while minimizing the probability of zeroes that are related to

the scope of the fund, we re-estimate the regressions in levels including only the zeroes

corresponding to countries that are in the region or market segment declared as part of

the scope of the fund. To maintain consistency with the equation in logs, we include as

explanatory variables the level of the buy-and-hold weight and the country’s relative

returns expressed as the ratio of the gross returns of the country and the portfolio. The

results, shown in Table 6, are qualitatively consistent with those obtained with the

specification in levels, despite significantly increasing the number of observations (from

460,000 to 740,000): weights decline when relative returns fall and when a crisis hits a

country. Quantitatively, the implied results are larger than in the log specifications. In



                                           33
equity funds, a 10% decline in relative returns would reduce weights by 1 percentage

point, in addition to the pure pass-through effect. This is about 20% of the average

weight (5%). The impact of a crisis is also larger: it results in a 10 percentage point

decline in weights.

       Both equity and bond funds maintain a fraction of their assets in cash. This cash

may be used as a buffer to park money before and after buying and selling assets, meet

redemptions, and strategically take advantage of sudden investment opportunities. The

regressions in Table 7 characterize the behavior of the cash weights in logs. In

unreported results, we also ran the same regression for cash in levels, obtaining similar

results. The specifications are analogous to those reported above, with gross cash

returns assumed to equal one so that relative returns correspond to minus fund net

returns. Since cash weights vary only in the fund-time dimension, we limit the set of

fixed effects included.

       The results in Table 7 show that a decline in equity fund returns results in an

increase in cash. In other words, equity funds accumulate extra cash in bad times and

reduce these positions in good times. Quantitatively, a 10% decline in the return of the

fund results in a 7% increase in cash. The results also show a significantly lower pass-

through on cash weights, with coefficients on log lagged cash weights much smaller than

one. The results in Column (3), which include time fixed effects, show that most of the

positive relation between cash weights and cash relative returns results from variations

in global conditions. After controlling for those fixed effects, the coefficient on relative



                                            34
returns, while still positive, becomes smaller than that of lagged weights and not

significant. The regression in Column (4), without time fixed effects, shows that the

variables capturing the prevalence of country and global crises are associated with both

an increase in cash and a decline in the coefficients for relative returns, confirming that,

to an important extent, the relevance of relative returns comes from global conditions.

A fund experiencing a crisis in one of its target countries increases cash by 10% of the

share of that country in its portfolio, and a fund experiencing a global crisis increases

cash by 16%. Columns (5) and (6), focusing on the results at different frequencies, show

again a smaller and vanishing degree of pass-through, indicating that at lower

frequencies cash weights tend to converge to a target level that is not driven by price

fluctuations. However, even at this level of aggregation country and global crises can

explain some of the variation in cash weights.

       Interestingly, the response of cash weights to returns is much different in bond

funds. Among these funds, cash moves in opposite direction to returns, even though

pass-through would suggest a positive response. Bond funds seem to accumulate cash

when fund returns are high (low relative returns). Why is this effect dominant only for

bond funds? This result may be due to the stronger response of injections to returns

among bond funds (Table 4): a high return results in injections that are temporarily

parked in cash. Similarly, a bad fund return may require a decline in cash while the

fund meets redemptions. Another explanation is that, since bond funds hold more cash

on average, they are better able to respond to injections/redemptions through variations



                                            35
in cash without having to liquidate assets or relocate money across countries. This is

only a proximate explanation because, of course, the level of cash held by bond funds is

an endogenous choice. Nonetheless, one can rationalize both the level and cyclical

fluctuations in cash if the bond markets where international funds invest are less liquid

than the corresponding equity markets, so that funds cannot quickly adjust positions to

meet redemptions without taking large losses through fire-sale prices, which may lead

them to hoard more cash. These results can also explain the weaker response of country

weights to relative returns among bond funds in the short run: a decline in country

returns prompts bond funds to liquidate cash to meet redemptions, dampening the

impact of this decline on the country weights. Results in levels including the zero cash

weights are qualitatively similar to those in logs (unreported).



5. Gross and Net Country Flows: The Role of Investors and Managers

We next quantify the relative importance of the underlying investors and managers in

explaining the gross and net capital flows by mutual funds to different countries. “Gross

flows” are the growth rate of total assets invested by mutual funds in a country

(including returns of past investments). “Net flows” are inflows/outflows of money

(gross flows minus the return in each country).32




32
     Note that this is a specific definition of gross and net flows that fits well with the discussion on this
paper, but the literature has employed the terms with many other ways. For our computations, we use
the growth rates of assets between two consecutive periods in a country using only the funds that have
investments in that country in both periods. That is, we do not include entry-exit in the calculations. The

                                                      36
        The assets held by mutual funds in country        trivially correspond to the sum of

the assets held in that country by each one of the funds that invest in it,              ∑     .

Taking log differences we obtain the following decomposition for the growth rate of total

assets in a country (gross flows)

                                     ∑              ∑           ,                        (7)

where        denotes the growth rate of total mutual fund assets in country          at time ,

           ⁄      is the share of total country    assets represented by fund ,          is the

growth of the weight of country      in the portfolio of fund       between   and   1 and, and

    is the growth in total assets of fund   within the same interval.

        Equation (7) states that gross flows of money from mutual funds to a country

may increase because funds increase the weight of that country in their portfolios, or

because the total assets of the funds investing in the country are increasing. The

economic interpretation of these two components as capturing the contribution of fund

managers versus that of the underlying investors require to take a stance on the scope of

activities within the realm of decision of each of these two sets of market participants.

Assuming that changes in weights are the managers’ choice and the growth rate of fund

assets is exogenously determined, one may interpret the first component as

corresponding to the managers’ decision and the second component to that of the

underlying investors. This is one of the decompositions we estimate below.




reason is that we do not know whether entry-exit in our sample corresponds to real entry-exit or
variations in data coverage.

                                              37
       The other main decomposition we use works with net flows to a country (growth

in total assets net of returns,   ) by isolating the contribution of the growth in weights

net of returns (relative flows) and injections to net flows, in the following manner,




                                                               .                        (8)

       A nice feature of the decomposition in Equation (8) is that both terms have a

very clear economic interpretation. The first term is the change in weights net of

relative returns, which corresponds to relative flows of managers to a country, and the

second corresponds to injections/redemptions into the fund. The flows of fund money to

country    increase either because the fund manager is investing relatively more money

into the country or because the fund has injections by the underlying investors that are

proportionally allocated to all countries. For additional information including two other

decompositions see Appendix 4.

       The results of the decompositions in Equations (7) and (8) are reported in two

separate panels of Table 8 and offer a good picture of the role of managers and investors

in explaining gross and net flows of capital to countries. Each panel reports two sets of

results: the average contribution of each of the two components to the level and

variance of each type of flow.

       To illustrate what Table 8 reports, take the example of gross flows in Panel A.

The calculation for the left side of the panel (the “shares”) is as follows: for each

country and time we compute the share of each component (growth in weights and



                                            38
growth in fund assets) in the growth in the country’s gross assets. We then compute for

each country the average over time of each of these components, and finally take their

average across all countries in each of the groupings in the rows.33 The right side of each

panel (“variance decomposition”) reports a standard variance decomposition exercise,

where we assess the share of the total variance of gross flows that can be attributed to

each component. Again, we first conduct the variance decomposition at the country

level and then average across countries to reach the reported estimates. Since the two

terms are not orthogonal, we follow Klenow and Rodriguez-Claire (2005) and impute the

covariance term equally to each component (see Section 3).

          Table 8, Panel A shows that both components of Equation (7) have roughly a

similar impact on the level and fluctuations in gross assets (around a 40%-60% split

depending on the decomposition). That is, the growth of weights and the growth of fund

assets are not very different in explaining the gross flows into countries, although the

contribution of the former is largely due to fluctuations in relative returns that are

correlated with the movement in gross flows. After controlling for this effect, managers

explain 30% of the variation (Appendix 4). In sum, Panel A shows that variations in

fund assets, resulting at least partly from the behavior of the underlying investors,

explain an important share of the level and variability of gross flows. If one considers

changes in weights due to variations in returns part of manager’s choices, managers



33
     We use both a geographical grouping (Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America) and another one
(developed, emerging, and non-emerging developing countries) taken from MSCI. Non-emerging
developing countries are the ones considered frontier markets by MSCI.

                                                  39
explain about 60% of the variance of gross flows. If not, they still explain a nontrivial,

but smaller share.

       Table 8, Panel B shows the decomposition of net flows corresponding to Equation

(8). The results are clearly different from those for gross flows. In this case, the first

component, associated with manager’s behavior, explains a larger share of the level and

variance of these flows. Net flows are more closely linked to managerial discretion than

gross flows since they abstract from the effect of returns on the growth of asset holdings.

For all countries, the growth rate of adjusted weights explains 88% of the level of net

flows and 85% of their variance. Namely, the term associated with total injections

explains 12% and 15% of the level and variance of net flows, respectively. The pattern is

very similar across groups of countries.

       In summary, Table 8 shows that both managers and the underlying investors

play a significant role in explaining the level and fluctuations of international gross and

net flows but the relative importance of each of them varies with the type of flow. For

gross flows, managers explain a share of the level and variance of flows of around 50%,

when not adjusting for returns and depending on the specific decomposition and region.

For net flows, however, the bulk of the level and variance of flows (between 77% and

88%) can be explained by manager’s behavior. Managerial discretion, measured as

deviations of country allocations from buy-and-hold allocations, is very important in

explaining the flows of new money to countries.




                                            40
       Table 9 shows the same decompositions as in Table 8 for all countries but for

different groups of funds. In each case, the gross and net flows to a country correspond

only to the flows coming from that subset of funds. The table also shows decompositions

at different frequencies: semi-annual and annual instead of monthly. Not surprisingly,

the growth of total weights, capturing manager’s behavior, explains always a much

larger fraction of the level and volatility of gross flows for active funds than for passive

funds. For instance, Table 9, Panel A shows that the growth of weights accounts for

49% and 58% of the level and variance of gross flows for active funds, versus 22% and

32% for passive funds, respectively. Panel B shows that the difference between active

and passive funds in the contribution of manager’s behavior to net flows is even larger:

87% of the level and variance for active funds, and 15% of the level and 31% of the

variance for passive funds, respectively. Namely, the gross and net flows of capital from

passive funds to countries respond mainly to the behavior of the underlying investors.

Regarding the difference between bond and equity funds, manager’s behavior seems to

play a slightly larger role among bond funds, for both gross and net flows. Regarding

the differences between monthly, semi-annual, and annual frequencies, Table 9 shows a

clear pattern. For both levels and variances of gross and net flows, the role of manager’s

behavior declines with the increase in the length of the period of analysis. Although as

seen in Section 4, the ability of managers to change country weights with respect to a

buy-and-hold benchmark increases with time, it is also the case that the underlying




                                            41
investors can react further to fund performance, country conditions, or other shocks. At

lower frequencies, the investor side seems to become relatively more important.

      In addition to providing a quantitative assessment of the relative importance of

manager’s and underlying investor’s choices for mutual fund capital flows to target

countries, the decompositions above, together with our previous estimations, allow us to

obtain some back-of-the-envelope calculations of the impact of various shocks on capital

flows. Let us start with Equation (7) for gross flows. From Table 4 we know that a 10%

decline in (lagged) fund returns reduces injections by about 1 percentage point. Thus, if

all funds investing in a country experience such a decline in returns, gross flows will

decline in 1 percentage point through its impact on the total assets of these funds (the

second term in Equation (7)). This is close to the median gross flows across countries

(about 2%) and indicates that there may be important contagion effects through the

injections of the underlying investors. Similarly, a 10% decline in the returns of the

country where the funds are located will reduce injections to these funds by 2

percentage points. If funds located in the country experiencing the decline are important

for a target country, the decline in gross flows will be significant. From Table 6 we also

find that a decline in the relative return of a country has almost a one-to-one impact on

the growth of weights at a monthly frequency. Keeping fund returns constant, a 10%

decline in relative returns results in a 10% decline in the weight of that country in

mutual fund portfolios and may induce a similar decline in gross flows. A country crisis




                                           42
also has an important effect, reducing the growth of weights by almost 2%, with a

corresponding decline in gross flows.

      A similar set of calculations can be conducted to estimate the impact of various

shocks on net (mutual fund) capital flows to a country using Equation (8). Changes in

fund injections have the same direct impact on net flows than in gross flows, so a 10%

decline in last period returns may reduce net inflows by 1 percentage point, or a 10%

decline in the returns in the country of origin of the funds may contract inflows by 2

percentage points. Relative returns also matter. As discussed above, Table 5 shows that

a 10% decline in relative returns results in a 0.5 percentage point increase in relative

flows, which is considerable relative to the (unweighted) average growth of net flows in

the sample (minus 1.5%). However, if this relative return decline is accompanied by a

low fund performance or by low returns in the country of origin of funds that induce

large redemptions, the consequences for net capital flows may still be severe (3 to 4

percentage point decline).



6. Conclusions

This paper has shown that mutual funds help transmit crises across countries and that

their behavior is driven by both the underlying investors and managers. The global

crisis was no exception, when there were large reallocations across countries and regions.

In particular, the paper has shown that investors react to shocks by pulling out of funds

that invest in countries undergoing crises and during global crisis times. In addition,



                                           43
investors put more capital into funds that have shown to do relatively well and when

conditions in their country of origin improve. This pro-cyclical reaction of investors is

matched with a similar behavior by fund managers, who face not only shocks from

investors injecting and redeeming capital but also from valuation changes in the

countries in which they invest. Managers react to these shocks by allowing weights to

adjust almost pari passu with returns and partly by moving allocations out of countries

experiencing crises. This adjustment of managers takes place over time, with the pass-

through from returns to weights diminishing at lower frequencies. During crises,

managers of equity funds also tend to accumulate more cash. All these patterns are

consistent with how investors and managers behaved during the global crises, when

there was retrenchment from emerging economies and Europe and a reallocation

towards the U.S.

       The findings in this paper have important implications for the theoretical

literature and policy discussions. They suggest that, in a world where investors

discipline managers through injections and redemptions and there are large shocks,

managers of open-ended funds might have difficulties taking advantage of long-term

arbitrage opportunities and reacting counter-cyclically, for example by buying assets

internationally at fire-sale prices. Therefore, the evidence is not consistent with

international deep-pocket investors (mutual funds in this case) playing a stabilizing role.

To the contrary, these investors appear fickle.




                                            44
      Regarding the difference between debt and equity, the paper shows that the

results are not unique to demandable debt, where the need to get out first is more

imperative. The pro-cyclicality occurs even in equity funds, for which prices adjust

instantaneously, suggesting that limited information by investors, and/or other factors,

need to be playing an important role. While in equity funds cash is used pro-cyclically,

being accumulated during crises, in bond funds cash is used more as a buffer, reducing

the impact of redemptions on manager reallocations. This could suggest that managers

have more difficulty buying and selling assets in markets that might be more illiquid,

and thus use more cash to withstand the shocks they face. The results also suggest that,

when there is a shock in a country where funds invest, equity funds tend to amplify the

shock by acting pro-cyclically, while bond funds might help transmit shocks across

countries by acting in relative terms counter-cyclically in that country, generating

contagion effects. However, when the shock hits the country of origin where funds are

domiciled, both bond and equity funds reduce their investments abroad, implying that

wealth effects might be significant. These wealth effects tend to dominate the

substitution effects across countries and constitute a mechanism of cross-country crisis

transmission.

      The evidence also shows that weights are not constant over time. In fact, they

fluctuate substantially with shocks. In other words, it is not the case that investors

drive all the action and managers act as passive agents, allocating the injections they

receive into countries according to some approximate fixed weights. While changes in



                                          45
weights might partly reflect monthly changes in the benchmark indexes (changing with

returns), the findings also suggest that adjustment costs might play a role in manager

behavior. Valuation changes pass-through to portfolios weights almost entirely in the

short run; only over time they get adjusted and somewhat reverse to pre-shock levels.

These adjustment costs could take place because it is difficult for managers to adjust

immediately to the shocks they receive and react to them in the short run by buying or

selling assets in certain countries (perhaps liquid ones), before adjusting the portfolio

elsewhere. These effects are more pronounced during crisis times, since in relative terms

during normal times managers reallocate their portfolio towards countries that get

negative shocks. For example, equity fund flows are slightly counter-cyclical during

normal times and pro-cyclical during crises. These differences are consistent with

adjustment costs being larger during crises and shed light on the heterogeneity of

behavior of equity funds over time. The evidence could also indicate to some extent that

the managers’ target or desired weights themselves change over time and fluctuate with

returns.

       The findings in this paper have important implications for the policy discussion

as well. In particular, some of the proposals after the global crisis suggest a shift from

banks to a mutual fund model to avoid runs and contagion effects. This paper shows

that this shift will not necessarily solve the problem that banks entail and that runs and

contagion are possible even in equity funds. The findings also suggest that idiosyncratic

risk and market discipline play only a limited role during crises and, thus, regulation



                                           46
based on those pillars (such as Basel II) would not entirely isolate the financial system

from crises. Furthermore, to the extent that open-ended structures constrain long-term

arbitrage, there could be socially excessive open-ending and it might be desirable to

have more closed-end funds. However, open-ended funds provide more room for

investors to monitor managers and avoid moral hazard problems, implying a difficult

trade-off between monitoring and long-term investments (Stein, 2005). Another area for

possible policy action is the potential for mutual funds to become a source of instability

in domestic markets, pushing prices away from fundamental values. Recent work

suggests that this might be the case (Jotikasthira et al., 2009). Finally, the findings in

this paper imply that shocks to the supply side of funds are hard to dismiss. The actions

by different players within institutions interact and get magnified, plus foreign investors

(in this case mutual funds) play no stabilizing role by buying at fire-sale prices. This has

important policy lessons in terms of liquidity provision and moral hazard. To the extent

that shocks come from the supply side of funds, providing liquidity at times of crisis

might help stabilize markets and countries. If instead crises were country specific with

investors expecting unreasonable rates of returns, providing financing at times of crisis

might fuel moral hazard.

This figure presents the evolution of the average portfolio weights invested in different regions by equity funds during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Only countries with stock market price index data are
considered to compute the weights. Regions are aggregated according to the EPFR Global classification. Only funds that have complete coverage for the period under study (Jan. 2007 - Dec. 2009) are considered. The grey
bars indicate times of stock market turmoil or the fall of financial institutions. In chronological order, they represent: the nationalization of Northern Rock (Sep. 2007), the Bear Stearns collapse (Mar. 2008), the Lehman
Brothers collapse (Sep. 2008), and the AIG near-collapse (Mar. 2009).

This figure presents the evolution of the average portfolio weights invested in different regions by bond funds during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Only countries with bond market price index data are
considered to compute the weights. Regions are aggregated according to the EPFR Global classification. Only funds that have complete coverage for the period under study (Jan. 2007 - Dec. 2009) are considered. The grey
bars indicate times of stock market turmoil or the fall of financial institutions. In chronological order, they represent: the nationalization of Northern Rock (Sep. 2007), the Bear Stearns collapse (Mar. 2008), the Lehman
Brothers collapse (Sep. 2008), and the AIG near-collapse (Mar. 2009).

This figure presents the evolution of the average mutual fund portfolio cash weights during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Regions are aggregated
according to the EPFR Global classification. Only funds that have complete coverage for the period under study (Jan. 2007 - Dec. 2009) are considered. The
grey bars indicate times of stock market turmoil or the fall of financial institutions. In chronological order, they represent: the nationalization of Northern
Rock (Sep. 2007), the Bear Stearns collapse (Mar. 2008), the Lehman Brothers collapse (Sep. 2008), and the AIG near-collapse (Mar. 2009).

                                                       Mutual Fund Summary Statistics

This table presents summary statistics on equity and bond mutual funds from the EPFR Global database. Panel A presents statistics across the
whole sample. Column (1) presents the number of funds in each category. Column (2) presents the number of monthly observations among all
funds within each category. Columns (3) and (4) present the first and last date, respectively, for which there are data available in each category.
Column (5) presents the median number of monthly reports within funds. Panel B presents the number of funds and observations by different
partitions. Funds are divided by strategy, target region, and according to the country in which the fund is based. The strategy classification
between active and passive is based on their stated investment behavior.

                                Growth Rate of Assets, Returns, and Injections: Summary Statistics
This table presents descriptive statistics of the growth rate of total assets, rates of return, and injections over initial assets for mutual funds, and
the variance decomposition of the growth rate of assets. Panel A presents the mean, standard deviation, and variance decomposition for equity
funds, and Panel B for bond funds. Columns (1) - (3) present the mean growth rate of assets, returns, and injections over initial assets. The
reported values are obtained by calculating first the mean within funds and then obtaining the mean across funds. Column (4) is obtained by
calculating the standard deviation within funds and then the mean across funds for each fund type. Columns (5) and (6) are obtained by
calculating the variance within funds for the fund returns and injections over initial assets, and calculating their contribution to the variance of
the growth rate of assets. Since the two terms are not orthogonal, the covariance term is imputed equally to each component.

                             Variance Decomposition of the Growth Rate of Assets around the Global Financial Crisis
This figure reports the variance decomposition of the growth rate of assets around the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Panel A and B report this decomposition for
equity funds and bond funds, respectively. Injections are obtained at the fund level as the difference between the total net assets (TNAs) and lagged TNAs multiplied by
returns. Columns (1)-(6) are obtained by computing the variance within funds and then across funds for the respective target region. Since the two terms are not
orthogonal, the covariance term is imputed equally to each component.

This table presents the results of ordinary least squares regressions at a monthly frequency of mutual fund injections over average assets on
different variables. Panel A presents the results for equity funds and Panel B for bond funds. The "country crisis" variable is a dummy that
indicates if a country has a banking, debt, or currency crisis during a given year. The dummy is weighted by the relative contribution of the country
in the portfolio of a fund. The "global crisis" variable is a dummy variable that indicates periods of worldwide crisis (Jul. 1997-Dec. 1997, Aug. 1998-
Dec. 1998, Mar. 2001-Dec. 2001, and Sept. 2008-Jun. 2009). "Country of origin returns" are the returns from indexes in the country where the fund is
based. Injections/average assets, "lagged fund returns," and "country of origin returns" are all expressed as decimals. Fund fixed effects are
included in every case and, alternatively, fixed effects at the time and country of origin-time levels are included. Standard errors are clustered by
country of origin-time. Standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

This table presents the results of ordinary least squares regressions of the log country weights on different variables. Panel A presents the results for equity funds
and Panel B for bond funds. The "country crisis" variable is a dummy that indicates if a country has a banking, debt, or currency crisis during a given year. The
"relative returns" variable is the difference between country net returns and fund net returns, expressed as decimals. Estimations are performed at different
frequencies and include different combinations of fixed effects. Only countries in the target region are considered for each type of fund. Errors are clustered by
country of origin-time. Standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

This table presents the results of ordinary least squares regressions of the country weights on different variables. Panel A presents the results for equity funds and Panel B
for bond funds. The "buy-and-hold weight" variable is the lagged weight multiplied by the ratio of gross country return to gross fund return. The "relative returns"
variable is the difference between country net returns and fund net returns, expressed as decimals. Estimations are performed at the different frequencies and include
different combinations of fixed effects. Only countries in the target region are considered for each type of fund. Errors are clustered by country of origin-time. Standard
errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

                                                        Behavior of Log Cash Weights
This table presents the results of ordinary least squares regressions of the log cash weights on different variables. Panel A presents the results
for equity funds and Panel B for bond funds. The "relative returns" variable is the difference between country net returns and fund net
returns. The "country crisis" variable is a dummy that indicates if a country has a banking, debt, or currency crisis during a given year. The
dummy is weighted by the relative contribution of the country in the portfolio of a fund. The "global crisis" variable is a dummy that
indicates periods of worldwide crisis (Jul. 1997-Dec. 1997, Aug. 1998-Dec. 1998, Mar. 2001-Dec. 2001, and Sept. 2008-Jun. 2009). "Country of
origin returns" are the returns from the indexes of the country where the fund is based. Both "relative returns" and "country of origin returns"
are expressed as decimals. Estimations are performed at different frequencies and include different combinations of fixed effects. Errors are
clustered by country of origin-time. Standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
level, respectively.

                                     Decomposition of Gross and Net Flows by Regions

This table presents the decomposition of gross and net flows into the growth rate of country weights and the growth rate of total mutual
fund assets or injections for different regions. Panel A presents the decomposition for gross flows without adjusting weights for returns,
while Panel B presents the decomposition for net flows adjusting for returns. Shares are calculated as the median share of individual
components for each country, averaged across time, and then averaged across all countries in each region. The variance decomposition is
obtained by taking the variance of each individual component at the country level, and then averaging it across countries. Both gross and
net flows are computed as the sum of the two terms in the decompositions. Since the two terms are not orthogonal, the covariance term is
imputed equally to each component. Outliers are filtered by the share of the component associated with weights in each decomposition.
Only observations within the 10th and 90th percentile of the share of this component are considered.

                        Decomposition of Gross and Net Flows by Type and Frequency

This table presents the decomposition of gross and net flows into the growth rate of country weights and the growth rate of
mutual fund assets or injections for different breakdowns. Panel A presents the decomposition for gross flows without
adjusting weights for returns, while Panel B presents the decomposition for net flows adjusting for returns. Shares are
calculated as the median share of individual components for each country, averaged across time, and then averaged across all
countries in each region. The variance decomposition is obtained by taking the variance of each individual component at the
country level, and then averaging it across countries. Both gross and net flows are computed as the sum of the two terms in the
decompositions. Since the two terms are not orthogonal, the covariance term is imputed equally to each component. Outliers
are filtered by the share of the component associated with weights in each decomposition. Only observations within the 10th
and 90th percentile of the share of this component are considered.

Appendix 1: Where Do Mutual Funds Invest?

Mutual funds specialize along several dimensions. The most important are geographical

regions, market segments (e.g. emerging and developed), and types of assets (equity and

bonds). The specialization of funds largely determines the broad patterns of their asset

allocation, as shown in Appendix Table 2. The table displays the mean portfolio weight

invested in a geographical/market segment region by different types of equity and bond

funds, along the number of funds included in each category. The regional classification

corresponds to that used by EPFR Global (Appendix Table 3). The mean portfolio

weights reported in the table correspond to the average across funds of the mean

regional weight of all funds within a category.

      Not surprisingly, funds invest mainly in the region/market segment they target.

For instance, “Asia ex-Japan” equity funds invest 96% of their portfolio in developed

and emerging Asia. Similarly, Latin America equity funds invest 97% of their portfolio

in Latin America. Nonetheless, most fund types invest around 5% of their assets outside

their target region/segment and in cash. Cash holdings are a small but non-trivial part

of fund portfolios. The holding of liquid assets may be due to the need to meet

redemptions or to keep injections until they are properly allocated. Some funds might

also hold liquidity to be able to invest quickly if opportunities arise (cash-in-the-

market). Perhaps consistently with this latter possibility, active equity and bond funds

hold much more cash than their passive counterparts. Active equity (bond) funds hold




                                            67
3.4% (5.7%) of assets in cash on average, while passive equity (bond) funds hold only

0.5% (2%).

      Funds specialized in multi-regional market segments show some interesting

patters of asset allocation. For instance, global emerging market funds invest mainly in

emerging Asia, followed by Latina America, emerging Europe, and emerging Middle-

East and Africa. Global equity funds invest mainly in developed Europe, North

America, and developed Asia, but within emerging markets follow a similar relative

pattern as global emerging market funds. These rankings suggest that funds invest

across regions in a manner that is roughly consistent with each region’s market size.

These patterns are also observed across the countries included in a region. For instance,

Latin America equity funds invest most of their assets in Brazil, emerging Europe funds

in Russia, and Asia ex-Japan funds in China and India (Appendix Table 4).

      Bond funds and comparable equity funds allocate their portfolios across regions

in roughly the same manner. The main difference is that while emerging Asia is the

principal investment destiny of emerging equity funds, emerging bond funds invest

primarily in Latin America, followed by emerging Europe, and with emerging Asia in a

far third place. This probably reflects the relative size and development of Latin

American sovereign bond markets relative to Asian bond markets, which are, in relative

terms, much more largely concentrated on corporate bonds. Bond funds also hold more

cash on average than equity funds (8.55% of the portfolio for global bond funds

compared to 2.87% of the portfolio for global equity funds).



                                           68
          Although mutual funds invest in regions, countries, and segments in a manner

that is consistent with their specialization, the total net assets (TNAs) they hold in

target countries experience important variations that roughly coincide with the cycles of

international capital flows. Appendix Figure 1 plots the evolution of the median growth

rate of total assets held by equity funds (Panel A) and bond funds (Panel B) in a

typical country.34 It shows periods of expansion that coincide with tranquil times for the

global economy, followed by contractions that roughly match periods of global turmoil.

For instance, Panel A shows a clear expansion at the beginning of the sample period

(1996) until the beginning of the Asian crisis, followed by a short-lived expansion that

collapses during the Russian crisis. It similarly shows the expansion following the 2001

crisis that lasts until the beginning of the global financial crisis. The pattern of asset

evolution for bond funds, reported for the shorter period for which bond fund data are

available, displays an analogous picture. At the regional level, there is more variation in

the growth rate of fund assets on the median country (unreported), but the overall

pattern of expansions and contractions coinciding with regional crises persists.

          Overall, the basic statistics reported in this appendix indicate that the mutual

funds in our sample allocate funds across countries and regions in a manner that is

consistent with their specialization, and also change their total holdings in different

countries in a way that follows periods of global expansions and contractions. These

34
     Growth rates are computed considering only continuing funds (those present both at t and t-1) and as a
share of the average assets between in t and t-1. Then, the median country is obtained considering the
median of growth rates in different countries at a certain point in time.

of global investors.

Appendix 2: How Much Do Country Weights Vary?

To better understand the variation in country weights in fund portfolios, we compute

coefficients of variation (CVs) of different types of funds. These CVs correspond to the

standard deviation of country weights across funds and within funds (over time) relative

in both cases to the corresponding average weight across funds. We normalize the

across-fund and within-fund standard deviations by the same mean value for ease of

comparison. Appendix Table 5 shows the CVs for the funds’ weights across countries

within the target region, in both the target and non-target regions, and in cash. It does

so for funds investing in different geographical areas and market segments. The

classification of target regions is shown in Appendix Table 6 and is taken from MSCI.

We compute the target region as the sum of country weights belonging to the target

region for each type of fund. The non-target region is calculated as 100 minus cash and

target-region weights. The table also shows the CV within the target region, where the

CV is computed first in a country and then aggregated across countries in the target

region, with the median CV across funds being reported.

      Appendix Table 5 shows the result of this exercise. When one focuses on

individual countries within that target region (Column (2)) mutual funds show

substantial variation in their investments, however, there is little variation when the

target region is aggregated (Column (3)). When focusing at the country level, the CVs

in are in various cases larger than one, which means that, for a given country in the

region, the standard deviation of country weights across funds is larger than the



                                           71
corresponding average weight. Within the target region, different funds follow different

investment strategies. Not surprisingly, mutual funds have a much more volatile

allocation in the non-target region compared to their target countries (Column (4)).

Their cash allocation also suffers important variations relative to their average cash

weight (Column (5)).

       Appendix Table 5 shows, moreover, that the variation within funds is smaller

than across funds, suggesting that different strategic allocations are behind differences in

weights across funds. However, fund allocations to countries within the relevant regions

vary substantially over time (Column (2)). The within-fund CVs are again about half of

the across-fund CVs, but of the same order of magnitude than the average weights in

each country. This indicates substantial within-fund variation in country allocations.

Understandably, the variation in country weights is larger than that of the main target

region. Namely, Asia funds switch among countries in Asia more than what they switch

in and out of Asia, since they have to be invested in that region.

       Appendix Table 7 shows similar estimates of the CVs, but partitioning the

sample by active and passive funds and looking at different geographical regions. The

table shows that the CVs are larger for active funds than for passive funds when

considering the within-fund variation. That is, managers of active funds seem to be

more active than those of passive funds. This pattern does not hold for the CVs across

funds, denoting similar differences in strategic allocation across passive and active funds,

due for instance to the tracking of different benchmarks. In sum, the CVs show that



                                            72
weights vary as expected but also that there is substantial variation in weights, that is,

weights do not remain constant across countries and regions, across and within funds.

Of course, these results do not explain what drives the changes in weights; in particular,

to what extent this variation is driven by prices. While prices will tend to affect

weights, they cannot be the sole source of variation since active funds display larger

CVs than passive ones.




                                           73
Appendix 3: Partial Adjustment Model

The parameter estimates of Equation (5) can be interpreted in light of a basic partial

adjustment model. Starting with the identity in Equation (4) and transforming it into

an estimable equation requires an expression for the relative flows. Intuitively, relative

flows depend on the portfolio weight a fund wants to have in a given country at a point

in time and its current portfolio weight on that country. If the former is greater than

the latter, the fund will try to move relatively more money into the country and vice

versa. This intuition can be captured by a simple partial adjustment model,

                                                           ,                           (A1)

where        is the log desired weight in the country and                              is the

log buy-and-hold weight that fund      faces before any flows or injections are realized. The

parameter      captures the fund’s speed of adjustment towards its desired weight. A value

of   equal to one implies that the fund immediately adjusts its weights to its desired

level through movements in relative flows, and a value smaller than one means that

adjustment costs preclude a fund from immediately reaching its target.

         This simple description of flows is completely agnostic about the desired portfolio

weight        , which is likely the outcome of a fund’s optimal portfolio allocation.

However, one can parametrically relate these desired weights to country and fund

characteristics. In particular, we consider the following equation for log desired weights

                                                                   .                    (A2)




                                             74
Although admittedly arbitrary, this specification is also very flexible and embeds several

alternative forms for the desired weights. For instance, if          , , and    are all equal to

zero, and     is different from zero, it implies that a fund’s desired country weights are

roughly constant. On the other hand, if             is different from zero, it means that the

desired weight responds to changes in relative returns. The            variables allow us to test

for the impact of crises on desired weights.

       Replacing Equation (A2) in Equation (A1) we obtain an expression that is

analogous to Equation (5) above. Thus, Equation (5) may be interpreted as a reduced

form representation of this partial adjustment model. Analogously, replacing Equations

(A1) and (A2) in Equation (4) we obtain the following estimable equation

                     1   λ 1                   1        1                                   (A3)
                                                                 ,

After grouping parameters, Equation (A3) is analogous to Equation (6). This

representation makes apparent that the coefficients on lagged weights               and relative

returns     embed both the pure buy-and-hold effect (captured by the 1 embedded in

the coefficients) and the response of relative flows to these variables due to adjustment

costs (the speed of adjustment      ) and the sensitivity of desired weights to lagged

weights and relative returns (   and ).

       Under some identification assumptions, the simple framework described above

allows us to use the parameters estimated from Equation (6) to learn about the

determinants of the behavior of portfolio managers. The presence of lagged weights in

Equation (A2) captures the persistence of some determinants of desired weights that are


                                               75
not captured by the rest of the model. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that           0.

If one assumes that            0, the coefficient on log lagged weights provides direct

information on the speed of adjustment. The smaller the coefficient        , the larger is the

implied     and the smaller the adjustment costs (a lower        is associated with greater

adjustment costs). Similarly, finding a coefficient on relative returns,     , different from

one does not provide immediate evidence that portfolio managers adjust their desired

weights       in response to returns, because it may just come from the presence of costs

of adjusting portfolio weights (     1     when        0).

       Under the mild assumption that             0, what really provides information about

the relation between returns and desired weights is the difference between the

coefficients estimated for relative returns and log lagged weights, which corresponds to

          . In this case, a coefficient on relative returns larger than the coefficient for

lagged weights means that          is also positive and that desired weights and, hence,

relative flows, increase with relative returns (inducing a momentum component in the

behavior of relative flows).

       The results described above for the preferred specifications including fund-time

and country of destiny-fund fixed effects yield coefficients for relative returns that are

larger than those for lagged weights (Table 5, Columns 5 and 6). This suggests that

desired portfolio weights are positively correlated with a country’s relative return.

Namely, funds would like to reduce their portfolio weights in a country with negative

relative returns. However, to the extent that the impact of relative returns on desired



                                             76
weights is less than one-to-one (     1 in Equation (A2)), the pass through from relative

returns to buy-and-hold weights (        ) dominates and the fund increases its relative

flows to that country. Intuitively, what is going on is that desired weights are declining

less than the direct decline resulting from relative returns. This may paradoxically result

in relative flows that are negatively associated with relative returns.

Appendix 4: Two Other Decompositions of Gross and Net Flows

To obtain other decompositions of gross and net flows, we start with Equation (7) for

gross flows:      ∑             ∑           . Note that the first term may grow because of

increases in country returns, since a country weight can also be expressed as

               . Whether one should attribute that increase to a manager decision is

open to debate and depends on what “passive benchmark” one has in mind (the

counterfactual weight under a “passive” strategy). Attributing the whole growth in

weights to managers is akin to having the past period’s weight as the passive

benchmark. One way of tackling this issue, which is equivalent to considering a different

benchmark, is to re-arrange Equation (7) in a way that removes changes in relative

returns from the first term,

                      ∑                           ∑                       ,

                          ∑                           ∑               ,               (A4)

where the second step uses the fact that                  . In this decomposition, the first

component corresponds to the growth in weights that is not related to returns and

depends only on relative flows from fund     to country ,          . This way of measuring

the contribution of managers implicitly assumes a buy-and-hold strategy as the passive

benchmark and only considers deviations from buy-and-hold weights as the

responsibility of the managers. The second component has no clear economic

interpretation and embeds the other two forces that drive the growth in total assets:

injections and the return of the country.


                                             78
       From Equation (8), net flows to a country (growth in total assets net of returns)

can be similarly decomposed as follows to isolate the contribution of total changes in

weights:

                              ∑            ∑                     .                  (A5)

The first term in Equation (A5) allows us to separate the contribution of the total

growth in weights to net flows, but in this case the second term embeds the contribution

of injections net of relative returns.

       Results using Equation (A4) are displayed in Appendix Table 9, Panel A. The

results suggest that the growth rate of weights net of returns explains a smaller share of

both the level and variance of the growth rate of assets (22% and 32% respectively)

when compared to the growth rate of weights reported in Table 8, Panel A. This

pattern suggests that the trend of gross flows is slightly dominated by the growth of

fund assets, but that most fluctuations around that trend come from the growth in

weights. The only exception is non-emerging developing countries, where the growth in

weights also explains a large share of the growth in gross assets. This indicates that

these countries have benefited from net reallocation vis-à-vis other regions.

       Appendix Table 9, Panel B shows the results for the decomposition of Equation

(A5). In this case, the growth of weights explains on average 78% of the level of net

flows and 77% of their variance. A comparison with the results in Table 8, Panel B

shows that the role of manager behavior is larger when it is associated with changes in

weights adjusted by relative returns (equivalent to relative flows) than when considering

the total growth of weights. Net flows are more closely associated, at least on a monthly

                                            79
frequency, with relative flows allocated by managers across countries than with

movements in returns.

                           Growth Rate of Total Assets for the Median Country
This figure presents the growth rate of the total amount of assets for the median country for equity
and bond funds in Panels A and B. Growth rates are obtained as a share of the average amount of
assets between t and t-1, considering only funds available both at t and t-1. The median country is
obtained using the median of the growth rates for different countries in each month. Shaded areas
indicate times of global turmoil. Panel C shows summary statistics.

average for each type of fund is marked in bold.

                                Coefficients of Variation in Mutual Funds
This table reports the coefficients of variation (CVs) in the target region, non-target region, and cash by funds
investing in different areas of the world. The target region is the sum of country weights of countries that belong to
that region in each fund type. The non-target region is 100, minus cash, minus the target region. Column (2)
reports the CVs within the target region. The CVs within the target region are first calculated for each country, and
then the median across countries is calculated for the target region. The means for the CVs in Columns (3)-(5) are
obtained by calculating means of weights within funds, and then obtaining the average across funds. To calculate
the coefficients across funds, the standard deviation is calculated across funds after obtaining the mean within
funds. For the within funds coefficients, the standard deviation and the CVs are calculated within funds, and then
averaged across funds.

                                                   Coefficients of Variation in Mutual Funds by Investment Strategy
This table reports the coefficients of variation (CVs) by type of fund in each geographical region and cash. All the CVs are computed with the same mean. This mean is calculated first
within funds, and then across funds. The CVs across funds are obtained by first calculating the standard deviation within funds and then across funds. The CVs within funds are obtained
by calculating the standard deviation and the CVs within funds, and then averaging across funds.

                                                                                                                Coefficients of Variation

This table presents the results of ordinary least squares regressions of the difference of log country weights and log buy-and-hold weights on different variables.
Panel A presents the results for equity funds and Panel B for bond funds. The "country crisis" variable is a dummy that indicates if a country has a banking, debt,
or currency crisis during a given year. The "relative returns" variable is the difference between country net returns and fund net returns, expressed as decimals.
Estimations are performed at different frequencies and include different combinations of fixed effects. Only countries in the target region are considered for each
type of fund. Errors are clustered by country of origin-time. Standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and
1% level, respectively.

                                   Decomposition of Gross and Net Flows by Regions

This table presents the decomposition of gross and net flows into the growth rate of country weights and other terms for different
regions. Panel A presents the decomposition of gross flows adjusting the weights for returns, while Panel B presents the decomposition
of net flows without adjusting for returns. Shares are calculated as the median share of individual components for each country,
averaged across time, and then averaged across all countries in each region. The variance decomposition is obtained by taking the
variance of each individual component at the country level, and then averaging it across countries. Both gross and net flows are
computed as the sum of the two terms in the decompositions. Since the two terms are not orthogonal, the covariance term is imputed
equally to each component. Outliers are filtered by the share of the component associated with weights in each decomposition. Only
observations within the 10th and 90th percentile of the share of this component are considered.
