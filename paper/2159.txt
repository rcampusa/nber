               Infant-Industry Protection Reconsidered:
             The Case of Informational Barriers to Entry



                                  ABSTRACT



       In industries with imperfect consumer information, the lack of a

  reputation puts latecomers at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis established

  firms. We consider whether the existence of such informational barriers to

  entry provides a valid reason for temporarily protecting infant producers of

  experience goods and services. Our model incorporates both moral hazard in an

  individual firm's choice of quality and adverse selection among potential

  entrants into the industry. We find that infant-industry protection often

  exacerbates the welfare loss associated with these market imperfections.

I.   INTRODUCTION

     The skepticism and occasional critiques of certain international economists

notwithstanding, the infant-industry argument remains a well-respected legitimi-

zation of temporary protection for emerging sectors in developing countries, and

even elsewhere. The argument presumes the existence of barriers to entry, which

inhibit or prevent the growth of a new local industry in circumstances where the

home country would seem to enjoy long-run comparative cost advantage in perform-

ing a particular activity. If the failure of the industry to come into existence

or to expand to a degree consistent with underlying cost conditions can be traced

to an external effect among producers, and if the prior emergence of a competing

foreign sector, contributes to the inability of the local industry to establish

itself, then it would seem that temporary, entry-promoting protection is justi-

fied on social welfare grounds.

     Traditionally, proponents of the infant-industry argument have pointed to

dynamic scale economies stemming from learning-curve effects and from the need

for development of a base of applicable skills among the sectoral labor force as

the relevant barriers to entry into industrial activities.' More recently,

industrial organization theorists have noted (making reference, however, to the

seminal work of Bain (1956)) that imperfect information can serve as a barrier to

entry when consumers cannot readily observe all of the attributes of a good prior

to purchase, and when they must, therefore, rely on reputation as an indication

of product quality. Schmalensee (1982), Farrell (1986), and Bagwell (1985) have

developed models in which early entrants enjoy a competitive advantage relative

to latecomers merely as a consequence of their having entered sooner.   In. these

models, the industry mavericks already have developed their reputations among



     'See, for example, Clemhout and Wan (1970) and the critical discussion in
Corden (1974, chapter 9).

consumers when later potential competitors contemplate entry.   'MetootT brands

offering similar quality products at similar or even lower costs to those of

established brands often are not able to penetrate the market, in cases where the

initial entrants, facing no corresponding competition, were able to do so.

     The argument that informational barriers might preclude efficient entry

would seem to have relevance for certain progressive industries in the modern,

manufacturing sector. Many innovative products are technically sophisticated, so

that some consumers may be ill-equipped to assess their attributes. Some less

developed countries may have comparative advantage in producing various of these

goods based on relative factor-cost comparisons. But the LDC producers may find

it difficult to enter the (local or international) market in competition with the

initial, foreign developers of the products, whose names and reputations are

likely to be well-known to consumers by the time that domestic entry is

technologically feasible.

     The argument may have even more force when applied to international trade in

services. Recently, there has been much discussion of appropriate trade policy

for services, and many commentators have noted the seeming reluctance of the less

developed countries to enter into negotiations aimed at liberalizing trade in

this sector.2 An infant-industry argument based on learning-by-doing and

decreasing costs over time may not apply to many of the service industries (see

Hindlay and Smith (1984)). But consider a characteristic shared by most

services, namely that production is customized to the requirements of each

particular consumer. Once a service has been produced for a specific customer,

the provider is unlikely to be able to remarket that same service to an

alternative buyer in the event that the initial one is dissatisfied. This means



     2For a discussion of the LDC position on liberalization of services trade,
see Bhagwati (1986).
                                       -3-




that the consumer and the supplier must enter into a purchase contract before the

service actually has been performed, and therefore at a time when the buyer will

not be in a position to inspect the quality of the final output. It follows that

reputations will be especially important in the markets for services. Absent

protection, potential local entrants into service industries may find it diffi-

cult or impossible to compete with well-established international concerns.

     The above discussion raises the important question of whether the existence

of informational barriers to entry provides a valid reason for temporarily

protecting infant producers of experience goods and services in countries that

are followers rather than leaders in innovative industries.3 In what follows we

argue, perhaps surprisingly in light of the evident market failure described by

Schmalensee, Farrell, and Bagwell, that the answer is "no". We base our argument

on a fully specified model of endogenous entry, quality choice, and information

transmission. Our model combines elements of those of Farrell (1986) and Bagwell

(1985), incorporating both moral hazard in a firm's choice of quality and adverse

selection among potential entrants into the industry. We pay special attention

to the process of expectations formation, in keeping with the recent literature

on the role of reputations in markets with incomplete consumer information.

     Our conclusions contrast sharply with those from a similarly focused study

by Mayer (1984). Mayer argued that export subsidization is warranted when actual

consumption experiences are required for (foreign) consumers to learn about

(domestic) products' qualities. The difference in findings can be attributed to

the fact that Mayer posited an ad hoc "product familiarization" process whereby

demand for home goods varies positively with cumulative past consumption; whereas

we incorporate expectations formation and consumer learning about the brands that



     3Nelson (1970) introduced the term "experience goods" to denote products
whose qualities can be fully judged only after they have been consumed.
                                       -4-




they have experienced explicitly into our analysis. Our message is reminiscent

of that of Baldwin (1969), who took a closer look at the microfoundations of

dynamic scale economies and found that infant-industry protection often could not

correct the market distortions that the proponents of such policy described.

     The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we specify a two-period

model of an infant domestic industry facing competition from an established

foreign sector. In this section, all potential domestic firms face a similar

capacity constraint, and it is not profitable for the more efficient among them

to signal (via price) their higher quality. We study the efficacy of both

temporary (first-period) and permanent protection under alternative assumptions

about consumers' expectations. In Section III, we allow for the possibility of

signalling via first-period output choice. We reconsider the welfare effects of

a temporary or permanent import tariff in the context of a separating

equilibrium. Our findings are summarized in a brief, concluding section.



II. INTANT-INDUSTRY PROTECTION WHEN SIGNALLING VIA OUTPUTS IS NOT POSSIBLE

     A. A Model4

     Initially, a well-established foreign sector supplies the domestic market

for an experience good or service. The attributes of the products sold by the

various foreign companies are known to domestic consumers from their past

consumption experience. The representative individual among a continuum of

domestic consumers demands exactly one unit of the good or service in each

period, with total demand equal to N. Perfect competition among the foreign

firms drives the surplus offered by each to a common level, U'-t.., where t.

is the specific tariff applicable to imports in period j.



     4Our model draws on the work of Farrell (1986), who considers competition
between a single (strategic) incumbent and a single potential entrant.
                                           -5-




       At the outset of period 1, a set of potential domestic producers indexed by

0 has acquired the technology needed to enter the industry. At this time, if a

firm of type 0 decides to enter, it chooses once-and-for-all its level of

quality, q(O), which, however, is not immediately observable by domestic

consumers. Firms are limited to qualities equal to or exceeding some q0;

consumers are assumed to be able to distinguish products of less than this

minimum, threshold level. A consumer who purchases the product of any domestic

firm in period 1 will learn that firm's quality before the start of the second

and final period. Thus, period 1 represents the infancy of the home industry,

when foreign products are known but local products are not, whereas period 2 is

the phase of mature competition, with domestic firms already having established

reputations among their clientele.

       We assume that each domestic firm can produce at most one unit of output in

each period.5 A firm of type 0 choosing quality q has a per-period variable

production cost of Oc(q). The cumulative distribution of 0's among the set of

potential entrants is denoted by F(0), with marginal density function f(0)

and f(-) > 0     on support [0 mm
                                .   , 0max ]. With   this specification, each firm

faces moral hazard in its choice of quality, while the heterogeneity across firms

in the cost of providing quality introduces adverse selection into the industry

equilibrium.

       Consumers value quality at rate y. A consumer having purchased domestic

brand 0 in period 1 and thereby learned its quality can enjoy second-period

surplus yq(0) -    z(0)   if he buys from the same firm again, where z(0) is that



     5mis assumption is made mostly for expositional convenience. We shall
comment below on its significance, contrasting our results with those that would
obtain if each firm had upward sloping marginal costs, but outputs were not
observable by consumers. If outputs could vary and were observable by consumers,
then firms might use quantity as a signal of quality, as we discuss in Section
III.

firm's second-period price. Thus, a firm of type 0 can                   maintain its customer
base    in the second period by setting z(O) =            yq(0)   -   U' + t2.   We assume for

simplicity that any firm that chooses to produce minimum quality cannot

profitably remain active once product qualities are known.6 We will refer to

such firms as "fly—by-night," while firms that produce above minimum quality are

termed    "reputable."
        In the first period, no domestic firm will find it profitable to signal its
intention to produce high-quality merchandise. All active firms will have a
common output level, namely one unit. So the only variable potentially available

as a signal is price. But higher prices cannot signal quality, since all firms

would then raise their prices; and there can be no benefit to a reputable firm

from choosing a low price to signal quality, since the only time that such an

investment could possibly be recouped is in the second period, and then

information is in any event complete. It follows that all domestic firms will

charge the same price, p, in the first-period equilibrium, and consumers will be

willing to buy local goods only if expected surplus equals or exceeds U -
                                                                                            t1.
        Consider now the decision problem facing a firm of type 0. This firm must

decide whether to enter the industry, and if so, what quality to produce and what

price to charge in the first period. Let us take the first-period price as given

for the moment. Then first-period profits from entering at quality q are n1(0)

= p -   Oc(q).     In the second period, if the firm has been reputable, it earns

n2(O) = max      {O, yq -   U" +        - Oc(q)};   otherwise, it earns zero. We assume that
                                   t2
the firm   weights    second-period profits by 6 when comparing these to first-period

profits. Note that 6 can exceed one, even with positive discounting, if the




     6None of our results depends in any way on the exit of producers of
minimum-quality products from the market.

"second" period actually represents a series of identical periods that occur

after reputations have been formed.

     A reputable firm must earn positive profits in the second period, or else it

would have no incentive to choose q > q0. The optimal quality for a firm of type

0, if it chooses to be reputable, is found by maximizing jt(0) =           n1(0) + o2(o).
The first-order condition implies



          ôy = (1 + ô)Oc'(q)    ,                                                        (1)


yielding discounted profits



                = p + ô(yq(0) - U" + t2) - (1 + ô)Oc(q(0))           ,                   (2)


where q(0) solves equation (1). Alternatively, the firm can choose a
                                                       F

                                                                               Oc(q0).
     We plot    and      in Figure 1. Note that both are monotonically decreasing

the incentive to establish a reputation declines with 0. This reflects the fact

that the marginal cost of supplying greater quality is lowest when 0 is small.

For a range of the most efficient potential entrants, the optimal strategy

generally involves choosing q = q(O) > q0. For some 0, the profits from being

reputable are equal to those from being fly-by-night. If, at this value of 0,

R(0) > 0 (as drawn), then the type of the marginal reputable firm, 0R, is given

where qR = q(8R)         In this case, potential entrants with intermediate values of

o in the range (0R, 0F1           also will enter the market as fly-by-nights. The

     Alternatively, if profits are negative at the point where the two curves

cross, then the marginal firm is a reputable one. In this case                      is given by

the zero-profit condition,



            + 6(yqR -     U   +
                                  t)     = (1 + o)ORc(qR)       ,                          (3b)


and there are no fly-by-night firms active in the market (i.e., 0F = 0R)

     Finally, equilibrium first-period prices must be determined. These will

depend on how consumers form their beliefs about the quality of domestic output.

We entertain two alternative assumptions about expectations. First, we specify

that (equilibrium) expectations are rational, as in Farrell (1986), and that

out-of—equilibrium beliefs satisfy a "reasonableness" constraint. We also

investigate the implications for infant-industry protection of exogenous expecta-

tions on the part of domestic consumers, as in Schinalansee (1982).

     With rational expectations, consumers calculate the average quality of

domestic products available on the market, and expect to receive this quality on

average when they buy from a local firm. Let qe be the expected average quality

of a domestic product and q be the actual average quality. Then rational

expectations imply qe = q          and

     71n the earlier literature on equilibrium in markets with imperfect consumer
information, Shapiro (1983) assumed that consumers suspected the worst about new
entrants, while Allen (1984) allowed the consumers sufficient information to
                                         -9-




     Consumers willingly purchase domestic products in the first period whenever

p < yq - U    + t1.   Indeed, if this weak inequality holds as a strict inequality,

then all consumers will prefer domestic goods. Such a situation could be consis-

tent with a rational expectations equilibrium, if consumers were to hold

sufficiently pessimistic beliefs about what would be the quality offered by a

firm charging more than the going price. Then, no domestic firm would be able to

raise its price in response to excess demand. However, we would argue that many

of these beliefs about out-of-equilibrium behavior are not "reasonable." A

consumer seeing a deviant price, d might reasonably be agnostic about which of

the firms that could make a profit at         has actually produced the good in

question. But consumers should rule out the possibility that the product offered

at price      originates from a firm that would make losses charging that price and

choosing its optimal quality. If consumers calculate expected quality out of

equilibrium using a formula similar to (4), but with          there replaced by the
                                          d
index   of the marginal entrant at price p ,    then any firm experiencing excess
                                                          .




demand at a candidate equilibrium price can always deviate by raising its price

slightly and still make sales. The unique sequential equilibrium satisfying our

restriction on out-of-equilibrium beliefs has




           pyq-U+t1 .                                                             (5a)


     Consumers may lack the information on the cost function, c(), and on the

distribution of 0's in the population of potential entrants necessary to calcu-

late the average quality consistent with equilibrium. In such an event, a rule




calculate the incentives for the provision of quality consistent with the
equilibrium.

 of   thumb might be used instead. We are interested in the extent to which our

 conclusions about infant-industry protection rest on the strong informational

 requirements of a rational expectations equilibrium. So we will investigate as

well a simple alternative: consumers initially hold some arbitrary (and perhaps

skeptical) belief about the average quality of a local good or service, qe = q

With these beliefs and firms pricing to maximize profits, the equilibrium

first—period price clears the market8, i.e.,



              py-U +t1                    .
                                                                                                       (5b)


       This completes the description of the equilibrium. We turn now to the

welfare analysis of temporary protection.



       B. Temporary Protection

       The infant industry argument typically endorses temporary protection until

such a time as the domestic industry achieves equal footing with its foreign

rivals. In our model, this corresponds to a policy with t1 > 0                                and t2    0.

       We take domestic welfare, W, to be the sum of consumer surplus, CS, produc-

er surplus, PS, and government revenue, GR. These are given by



       Cs =   F(O')(y       -

Next we substitute into (6) for dq/dt1 calculated from (4), which yields

       Consider first the case of rational expectations. If the marginal firm is a

fly-by-night, dOR/dt1 = 0 (from 3a)) and dOF/dt1 > 0.                                  Thus, the right-hand

side of (7) is negative for any positive t1. If, instead, the marginal firm is

reputable, so that                 =            then the right-hand side of (7) reduces to

_f(OR)[t1 +      (q   -                            which again is negative for t1 > 0.               In either

event, temporary infant-industry protection reduces welfare in a rational

expectations equilibrium.

       Although protection promotes further entry, it does not correct the distor-

tions associated with the imperfect consumer information. The rise in the

first—period price caused by the tariff benefits the various domestic firms

equally, and to an extent that is independent of the qualities that they choose.

In particular, the relative incentive that firms have to behave reputably remains

the same.9 This can be seen, for example, from equation (3a), where we find that




     9If firms had general cost functions with rising marginal costs, then the
benefit each would enjoy from the tariff would be proportional to its output
level. Since the marginal cost of high-quality goods exceeds that of
                                      —12—




a change in the first-period price has no effect on the margin between reputable

and fly-by-night firms.

     Entry in itself adds no producer surplus beyond the implicit subsidy in the

tariff, because the marginal firm earns zero profits. This leaves only the

effect of protection on consumer surplus (net of tariff revenue) to be consid-

ered. Consumers with rational expectations pay a price that leaves them

indifferent between importing and buying the average domestic product. Since the

marginal entrant always provides lower quality than does the average domestic

firm, the entrant's product provides negative social surplus. In other words,

while temporary protection does not alleviate the moral hazard problem, it
                                                                       10
actually exacerbates the distortion stemming from adverse selection.

     Next, we consider the case of exogenous expectations, with qe =     q.
Surprisingly, the analysis is quite similar. If the marginal firm   is      a fly—by-

night, then again d0'/dt1 = 0, and since we must have q > q0 for entry to occur,

any positive first-period tariff rate yields lower welfare than does free trade.



minimumquality goods at any level of output, it is likely that the firm with
index 0 would produce more as a fly-by-night than it would as a reputable firm.
Against this is the fact that the effective price itRreceives (over the two
periods) for above minimum-quality output, [p ÷ oz(e )]/(1 ÷ ó), might exceed the
priceRit receives for minimum-quality output, p. If indeed the optimal output
for 0 as a fly-by-night were greater than its optimal output as a reputable
fkrm, a tariff would actually lower the incentive for reputable behavior. Then
o would fall, which then is an additional channel through which protection would
reduce domestic welfare.

     10If outputs could vary, as they would if cost functions were instead
Oc(q,x), then there would be a further effect of protection on welfare, in
addition to that already noted in footnote 9. That is, firms with above average
quality might expand their outputs by more or less than those with below average
quality. In this regard, there are offsetting considerations present in our
model. First, the firms producing the highest quality products are also the ones
that are most efficient, so their marginal costs might be expected to rise less
steeply than for the others. But the fly-by-nights might also expand output
relatively greatly, since their quality level is significantly lower. This would
be the case if c      were positive. An argument for protection based on output
expansion by exisag firms would require that the former effect dominates the
latter; but we see no reason to believe that this would generally be the case.
                                         -13-



The only circumstance under which temporary protection can be beneficial arises

if expectations are very pessimistic, so that entry is quite difficult, and firms

that would otherwise choose to be reputable are excluded from the market. With

the marginal firm being a reputable one, a small first-period tariff raises

welfare if and only if qR > q   .   Temporary protection is warranted only when the
quality of the worst domestic product available on the market exceeds the quality

expected by consumers to be the average among domestic goods. Evidently, our

conclusions about the harmful effects of temporary protection in markets plagued

by moral hazard and adverse selection problems are not very sensitive to the

specification of the way in which consumers form their expectations about product

quality.



     C. Permanent Protection

     Proponents of the infant-industry argument do not often advocate permanent

protection of the new sectors. It is believed that protection from imports will

no longer be "needed" once the industry reaches its maturity. In our model,

permanent protection suffers the additional disadvantage of being time inconsis-

tent. Once the second period arrives, the government will have no incentive to

continue any protection that it provided in the first period. However, we will

now argue that if the government can somehow commit itself to a policy of perma-

nent protection of the infant industry, such a policy might actually enhance

domestic welfare in situations where temporary protection would do just the

opposite.

     The point can be seen most easily by considering the effect of protection

provided only in the second period. Such protection benefits only those firms

that remain active then, namely the firms that choose to be reputable. By

offering a reward that can only be collected by reputable firms, the government
                                           -14-




alters the incentives for producing above-minimum quality and thereby partially

alleviates the moral hazard problem.

     Formally, we calculate for the case of rational expectations




                   =
                       -t2f(O1)   —     + F(O')y


                   =
                       f(0R)[y(qR_q0)    -t2]
                                                   +    f(0F)y(q     -
                                                                             )             (8)


If the marginal firm is a fly-by-night, then dO'/dt2 =        0. But the first term in
(8) is positive for small t2, since dGR/dt2 > 0 and qR >                         A second-period
                                                                   q0.
tariff does not affect the total number of firms that initially enters the

market, but more of those that do enter opt to establish reputations for high

quality. Consequently, average quality rises in the first period, yielding

higher social welfare.

     The result is different if the marginal firm in the market, absent pro-

tection, is a reputable one. Then dq/dt2 =             - q)dGR/dt2       <   0.    Second-period

protection causes more firms to enter, and the new entrants behave reputably.

But these new firms offer lower quality than any of the original participants in

the market, so average quality falls. It follows that second-period protection

is detrimental to domestic welfare in this case.

     What then of permanent protection at a constant rate t? Clearly such

protection must be harmful when the marginal firm under free trade has q >
                                                                                            q0.
But in the case where the marginal firm is a fly-by-night, the beneficial effect

of second-period protection in correcting the moral hazard problem can outweigh

the deleterious effect of the first-period tariff, which induces more fly-by-

night entry. The condition for a small permanent tariff to increase domestic

welfare is



                    R R
                 f(O )(q - q0)
                                            F-
                                          f(O )(q - q0)
                       R
                                      -
                                                 I \      >0
               (l+ó)c(q )   - c(q0)


This condition is most likely to be satisfied when there are more firms at the

margin of being reputable than there are at the zero-profit margin, and when the

marginal reputable firm provides above-average quality.



III. INFANT-INDUSTRY PROTECTION IN A SIGNALLING EQUILIBRIuM

     A. Separating Equilibrium in a Model with Signalling

     In the model of the previous section, the more efficient firms were not able

to signal their greater quality incentives to the uninformed consumers. In this

section, we modify the model to allow for potential signalling. When signalling

is successful, consumers can infer qualities from their observation of some other

variables chosen by the firms. In the resulting separating equilibrium, first-

period prices reflect the qualities actually provided. As we shall see, the

effects of tariffs in such circumstances are rather different from those that

obtain when signalling is not possible.

    We alter the model in two ways, one substantive and the other merely for

simplification. First, we suppose that firms can select their capacity levels,

x(0), by investing in capital equipment. Capital is assumed to be durable and

can be used to produce output of any quality. Thus, x might reflect the size of

a manufacturing firm's factory or the number of professionals a service provider

maintains on its (quasi-fixed) payroll. A firm of type 0 with installed capacity

x can produce up to x units of a good or service of quality q at constant
                                                   -16—




variable cost Oc(q). All firms face the same cost of capital, k(x), with k' >

O   and k" > 0.

       Second, we limit the set of possible quality choices to two: qH and qL,

with qH > qL        As before, we assume that a product with characteristics qL

cannot profitably be sold by even the most efficient firm to consumers who know

or suspect its quality.             This means that, in a fully separating equilibrium,

fly-by-night firms do not make any sales.

      With these new assumptions, capacity (or output) can serve as a signal of

quality. A firm that plans to be reputable has greater incentive to install

durable capacity, which it can use for two periods, than does a fly-by-night

firm, which must amortize its equipment in a single period. By sinking a large

fixed investment, a potential entrant partially commits itself to remaining

active in the market. Consumers may come to associate high quality with firms

that have made large capital investments, while those with little commitment to

the market will be suspected of being fly-by-nights.

       Suppose that consumers' expectations are formed as follows:




                            qH          if      x>x
                    qe=
                            qL          j       x<x

Consumers buy only from firms that they believe will offer high-quality products.

They are willing to pay a first-period price of p = yq11 - U                          +
                                                                                          t1
                                                                                                   and a

second-period price (as before) of z = yqH -                    + t2.    Thus, a firm of type 0

that chooses q = qH        and x >      x    can enjoy profits ltR(e) = (1+ô)[yq11                  -   U"    -

                                -   k(x).    Alternatively, such a firm could choose qL but

(falsely) signal high quality and thereby earn TLF(o) = [yq11
                                                                                  -    U       +
                                                                                                   t1
                                                                                                        -
                                                                                                             Oc(qL)]x

     The most efficient firms might not be constrained by the need to install

capacity at least equal to x to signal their reputable intentions. Their profits

are maximized at x(O) > x, given by the first-order condition



     (l+ó){yq11 -          U*   -
                                        Oc(qH)J + t1 + ôt =   k'(x)   .                         (9)


We let O denote the index of the marginal firm for whom the signalling

constraint is just binding, i.e. , x(OS) =

     Firms with intermediate efficiency parameters in the range 0                          (QS0R]
enter the market by installing capacities x(O) =                      x,   which exceed the levels that

they would choose under full information.1' The associated loss of profits is

the cost to them of having to signal their intention to produce quality qH• The

marginal firm earns zero profits, so

                                        ORc(qH)] + (t1 + ôt2) - k(x)          0 .               (10)


     Finally, it must be the case that all those firms that enter the market

actually prefer to provide high quality rather than low quality, and that those

          It   .   .                .                  .
          is interesting to compare this property of our signalling equilibrium
                                                                                .     .

with that which would obtain under an alternative cost and information structure.
Suppose there was no durable capacity to serve as a commitment to the market
(i.e., no sunk costs), but that production in each period required a fixfid cost
and a rising marginal cost, with themarginal cost of goods of quality q
exceeding that of goods of quality q at any given level of output. Suppose
further that word-of-mouth information flows were sufficient to allow reputable
firms to expand their sales to the extent they would wish to do so, once their
reputations had been established. Then absent signalling considerations,
fly-by-night firms would generally choose output levels greater than those
selected by reputable firms, and the latter could signal quality by remaining
smaller in the first period than would otherwise be optimal. It seems consistent
with casual empirical observation that large firms are believed to be reputable
in industries with large sunk costs (e.g., soft drinks, laundry detergents),
since these firms have much to lose from running down their reputations.
                                                        -18-



that do not enter could not make positive profits at either quality level. We

note that d[T(O)-7t'(O)]/d0 <                 0, so that if the marginal firm has 7TR(OR) >
ltF(o)     so too will those that are more efficient. Also, dTtR(0)/dO < 0                                  and

dltF(O)/dO <      0,   so that those potential entrants that are less efficient than the

firm of type           cannot earn positive profits.

        We obtain our final equilibrium condition by placing a restriction on

out-of-equilibrium beliefs. If, in a candidate equilibrium, 1(R(QR) were

strictly greater than it (0 ),

solution to these equations has x(Omin) >                          x,    then these values comprise the

unique equilibrium satisfying our constraint on out-of-equilibrium beliefs. In

particular, no pooling equilibrium can exist under these circumstances. If,

separating, rational expectations equilibria is that which has the smallest
signalling requirement, x.

alternatively, x(O) < x, then there might also exist a pooling equilibrium,

with some fly-by-night firms entering the market, all active firms producing the

same output, and consumers rationally expecting a level of quality equal to the

average among domestic firms. Since the pooling equilibrium that might arise in

this case is qualitatively the same as that analyzed in Section II, we will

concentrate here on the separating equilibrium that obtains when (10), (11), and

possibly (9) apply.



     B. Temporary and Permanent Tariffs

    As before, we take social welfare to be the sum of consumer surplus,

producer surplus, and government revenue. These now are given by

        Consider first temporary protection, with dc =                      and t2    = 0.      From (11)
                                                                      dt1
we see that dOR/dt1 = 0.           Then (10) implies dx/dt1 =          2/[k'()            -
                                                                                              k(x)]   >   0.
With infant-industry protection, firms must install more capacity to signal their

intention to choose qH The extra cost of doing so dissipates the subsidy

implicit in the tariff. In the new equilibrium, the same number of firms enter,

but all firms operate at greater scale.

     What then are the welfare implications of first-period protection? The

first term in (12) is zero at free trade, but negative for any positive t1. This

term represents the distortion associated with any excess output by the most

efficient firms. The second term reflects the welfare cost of any output expan-

sion by the firms that must inflate their capital investments to signal quality.

The term in the second integral is negative for any t1 >                      0,    since for these

firms      >   x(O)       implies (16)[yqH - U"     -

                                                                                              ot2).   But we

have noted already that dx/dt1 >          0.   Protection raises the cost of signalling,

thereby exacerbating the social loss from the imperfect consumer information. It

follows that temporary protection necessarily reduces welfare in a separating
                13
equilibrium.




     13Referring to our discussion in footnote 11, protection would also lower
welfare in situations where low levels of output were used to signal quality.
Then an increase in t would require reputable firms to further cut their outputs
below the first-best level in order to signal their reputable intentions. We

     We model permanent protection by setting t1               t2 =   t   and dc =   dt.
Differentiating (11), we find immediately that dOR/dt =               o/{(l+o)c(qH)_c(qL)j   >


0. Permanent protection improves the profit opportunities in the market, thereby

causing more firms to enter. Next we differentiate (10), and substitute for

dOR/dt, which gives

Evidently, an increase in the rate of permanent protection increases the critical

level of capacity that signals reputable intentions.

     The welfare effects of an increase in permanent protection are derived using

(12). Away from free trade, both the expansion in the output of the most effi-

cient firms and the entry into the market of additional (reputable) firms imply a

loss of social welfare. Both sorts of extra output require resources whose

opportunity cost exceeds their marginal social product in the infant industry.

And, like first-period protection, a permanent tariff augments the social cost of

signalling. We conclude therefore, in contrast with our findings for the no-

signalling case, that permanent protection always reduces welfare in a

separating equilibrium.

     In a signalling equilibrium, the less efficient, low-quality producers

impose an externality on those that seek to distinguish themselves as having the

incentive to offer high quality. This externality arises from the mere potential

presence of the former group in the market. The externality implies an excess

burden for those that signal, since a signal can only be effective if it is

costly.   Protection of any kind (and indeed any output subsidy) increases the

profitability of the less efficient producers and makes them more of a threat to

enter the market. It thereby raises the cost to the efficient producers of

separating themselves out. Thus, entry-promoting protection is bound to be

harmful in a signalling equilibrium.



IV. CONCLUSION

     We have investigated the case for infant-industry tariff protection in

situations where information serves as a barrier to entry. Our starting point

has been a model in which a well-established foreign sector competes in the

domestic market for an experience good or service with a cost-efficient but

initially unknown set of potential domestic entrants. In the infancy of the

domestic industry, consumers must form expectations about the attributes of

domestic products, recognizing both the moral hazard in an individual seller's

choice of quality and the adverse selection that arises when various potential

entrants have access to different technologies of production. Thus, domestic

firms suffer a temporary competitive disadvantage owing to their lack of

reputations.

    We found that temporary tariff protection to promote entry generally lowers

domestic welfare. When domestic firms are unable to signal their qualities, a

temporary tariff does not alter the incentive each firm   has   to provide high-

quality products, but the marginal entry induced by such a tariff generally

reduces consumer surplus (and must do so if consumers have rational expecta-

tions). In other words, infant-industry protection does not alleviate the moral

hazard problem in such cases, and actually exacerbates that caused by adverse

selection. When domestic firms are in fact able to signal their reputable
                                      -23-



intentions via their choice of a high level of capital investment, a temporary

tariff increases the social cost of signalling.

     Our results concerning permanent protection were mixed. We noted first that

a policy of permanent protection generally is time inconsistent; that is, once

the mature phase of industry competition arrives, the government has an incentive

to terminate any protection from the infancy phase. However, if the government

can somehow commit itself to continue protection, then there might be benefit

from a permanent tariff, depending upon industry circumstances. For example,

when firms cannot signal quality and when the marginal entrant produces minimum

quality, a permanent tariff might raise domestic welfare, because the second-

period tariff rewards only those firms that behave reputably in the first period.

We found, however, that if quality signalling is possible, a permanent tariff

like a temporary tariff is harmful, because it increases the level of excess

capacity investment needed to signal high quality.

     Our negative findings about the efficacy of protection do not imply that the

market works well in the situations that we have described, or that other forms

of government intervention would not be desirable. Rather, we have shown that

trade policy (or output subsidies more generally) do not correct the distortions

that arise when consumers are imperfectly informed. A temporary output subsidy

rewards reputable firms and fly-by-nights equally, and does not alter the incen-

tives that firms face in choosing among these strategies. Furthermore, even when

information is a barrier to entry, the marginal firms that enter in response to

an output subsidy may well lower the average quality of domestic products avail-

able on the market. These considerations suggest that appropriate policy should

seek to reward firms that invest in their reputations, without encouraging entry

or expansion by others. We leave to future research the task of identifying such

policies.
