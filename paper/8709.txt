Do Low-Income Housing Subsidies Increase Housing Consumption?

                                             ABSTRACT


        A necessary condition for justifying a policy such as publicly provided or subsidized low-income
housing is that it has a real effect on recipients’ outcomes. In this paper, we examine one aspect of the
real effect of public or subsidized housing -- does it increase the housing stock? If subsidized housing
raises the quantity of occupied housing per capita, either more people are finding housing or they are
being housed less densely. On the other hand, if public or subsidized housing merely crowds out
equivalent-quality low-income housing that otherwise would have been provided by the private sector,
the housing policy may have little real effect on housing consumption. Using Census place-level data
from the decennial census and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, we ask whether
places with more public and subsidized housing also have more total housing, after accounting for
housing demand. We find that government-financed units raise the total number of units in a Census
place, although on average three government-subsidized units displace two units that would otherwise
have been provided by the private market. There is less crowd out in more populous markets, and more
crowd out in places where there is less excess demand for public housing, as measured by the number
of government-financed units per eligible person. Tenant-based housing programs, such as Section 8
Certificates and Vouchers, seem to be more effective than project-based programs at targeting subsidized
housing units to people who otherwise would not have their own.

        Through various levels of government, the U.S. spends a considerable sum subsidizing housing,

as much as $25 billion in budget outlays on an annualized basis. [Quigley (2000)] These subsidies

include both direct provision of housing services through public housing, and voucher programs that aim

to shoulder a portion of the cost of privately provided housing, such as Section 8 housing assistance.

The implicit rationale underlying both of these programs is that, in the absence of government

intervention, poor people would consume inadequate amounts of housing, either because the market

would deliver too little that was sufficiently affordable or poor people would choose to consume too

much other goods. [Olsen (2001)]

        In spite of the large expenditures on these programs, it is far from obvious whether they have

any effect on whether families have their own housing units. It is possible, instead, that these programs

simply transfer resources to families that would be housed even in the programs’ absence. If so, one

might regard the programs as wasteful and ineffectual, although such a conclusion would not necessarily

follow as subsidies might allow households to occupy better housing units. In this paper we ask whether

low-income housing subsidies satisfy a simple sufficient condition for effectuality: do they increase the

number of families housed in their own units or do they simply crowd-out privately-provided low-

income housing? In particular, if subsidized housing raises the quantity of occupied housing units per

capita, either more people are finding housing or they are being housed less densely.

        Using cross-sectional data on total housing, subsidized housing, and population (and other

demand shifters) in 22,901 Census designated places, we find neither complete crowd out, nor that

subsidized housing is all net new. We estimate that an additional subsidized unit raises the total number

of units in a place by between 0.25 and 0.375 units. Lending credibility to the estimates, we find that




                                                     1
crowd out is smaller in markets with more excess demand for the existing public and subsidized housing

stock, measured as the number of families eligible for subsidized housing per existing unit.

        The impact of either public or subsidized housing on the long-run housing stock depends on the

way that the housing is allocated to families. If a public unit or a voucher for use toward a privately

supplied unit is awarded to a family that would otherwise not have purchased its own housing services,

then the unit will be a net addition to housing consumed and no crowd out will occur. Remaining

demand for private housing will not decline and in the case of a voucher an additional private unit will be

built to replace the one rented by the subsidized family, presuming the long run supply of low income

housing is elastic. On the other hand, if the public or subsidized unit is awarded to a family that would

have purchased housing services in the absence of the program, then the program may have little effect

on the quantity of housing consumed. Indeed, consistent with their reported goals, voucher and

certificate-based programs seem to be doing a better job of targeting families who would not otherwise

consume their own unit. An additional housing unit provided through this mechanism yields 0.7 units of

net new housing while project-based housing generates less than 0.3 units of net new housing. If the

goal of low-income housing programs is to house families that would otherwise not have their own units,

then resources should be targeted to places with more eligible families relative to the existing stock of

government-financed units or distributed through programs with sufficient flexibility to allocate the

subsidies to the neediest families.

        Our inquiry is related to two strands of existing research. First, this is one of many studies of

whether government programs crowd out private activity. To name but a few, other recent studies on

this basic topic include Cutler and Gruber (1996), on whether public insurance crowds out private

insurance, and Berry and Waldfogel (1999), on whether public radio broadcasting crowds out


                                                     2
commercial broadcasting. Two studies by Murray (1983, 1999) examine how public housing crowd

outs housing construction and the private housing stock.1 Susin (forthcoming) finds that rent vouchers

lead to substantially higher rents for unsubsidized low-income units. He attributes this result to higher

voucher-driven demand in the low-income segment of the housing market combined with a low elasticity

of supply of such housing. A low supply elasticity would imply that voucher units would substantially

crowd out privately-provided low-income units, although Susin does not test that proposition and does

not look at housing quantities. The second strand of research relating to this study is the literature on the

value of housing subsidies to their recipients. Studies such as Olsen (2000), Barton and Olsen (1983),

Murray (1978), and Currie and Yelowitz (2000) attempt to measure various benefits of subsidized

housing at the family level. The focus of our study is instead on market-level equilibrium. Using cross

sectional data that we presume describe a long run equilibrium, we ask how the equilibrium in the

private housing market responds to the extent of subsidized housing in a market.2

         This paper proceeds in four sections. First, we review the basic low-income housing subsidies

and lay out a simple framework for analyzing their effect. Second, we describe the data used in the

study. Third, we present evidence on the impact of public and subsidized housing on overall housing

consumption. A brief conclusion follows.

  Murray (1999) estimates a vector autoregression on 27 years of the stock of public and private housing units. He
concludes that public housing units added to the total housing stock but moderate income subsidies did not.
Murray (1983) estimates a time series model on housing starts.

  Since it takes some time for the private housing market to fully respond, we believe an equilibrium analysis, rather
than a time series analysis, is most appropriate.

I. Background and Mechanisms

1. Program Background

         Housing subsidy programs fall into two basic categories: project-based and tenant-based.

Project-based programs, such as public housing and Section 236, supply public housing units. Tenant-

based programs, such as the Section 8 certificate and voucher program, give recipients a form of

assistance to pay for some or all of the rent for a private unit. While in many ways quite different, these

programs share the essential feature that program administrators ration access to the program’s housing.

That is, certain criteria must be met to be eligible for public housing, but not all eligible families receive

public housing, and the most poorly housed families do not necessarily receive priority for public

housing. The key question for how both programs affect housing market equilibrium is whether the

families awarded housing under the programs would have dwelt in their own units in the absence of the

programs.

         Public housing is not necessarily free housing. A family that meets the eligibility criteria still

needs to pay some rent, with an amount typically defined as a percent of family income. The primary

programs through which HUD provides public or subsidized housing all require such a tenant

contribution.3 The first program is Public and Indian Housing. Beginning in 1937, HUD has paid the

construction costs, and more recently the operating costs not covered by tenant rents, of public housing

projects run by Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) or Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs). Tenants

currently are required to pay 30 percent of their incomes as rent.

housing.

         Section 8 new construction and rehabilitation, in place from 1974 to 1983, subsidized private

developers to build new public housing or convert existing buildings into public housing. In addition,

tenants’ rent was subsidized by HUD with HUD covering the differential in rents between what the

tenant is required to pay and the fair market rent in the area.4 As of 1983, no additional units were

funded under this program, though funding was continued for existing obligations.5

         Over the last two decades, low income housing policy has shifted from public provision of

housing (public housing) toward a reliance on tenant-based assistance, such as vouchers.6 Public

housing in the US was constructed mainly in the 1960s and 1970s. As Poterba (1994) documents, new

public housing starts slowed from 24,000 units in 1980 to a trickle in the late 1980s (2,000 to 3,000

per year during 1985-1987). Project based assistance continues to comprise the majority of public

housing units, but the growth in tenant-based assistance is much more rapid.

         The Section 8 Housing Assistance Program is HUD’s current tenant-based assistance program.

Eligible participants receive either certificates or vouchers good for the difference between HUD’s

assessment of fair market rent and 30 percent of their income. Under the certificate program, the

tenants must locate a unit that meets minimum quality standards and does not rent for more than the fair

market rent. They pay their share and the HUD certificate covers the remainder. The voucher program

does not place a cap on the market rent of the unit. The tenants simply receive a voucher for the

difference between the fair market rent and the tenant’s contribution; if the tenant chooses to rent a

  There is one big exception to this statement: the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit provides a tax subsidy to private
developers if they make their units available to a sufficient number of low-income families. This form of assistance is
expected to grow. [Olsen (2001)]


                                                           5
more expensive unit they can pay the difference out of pocket. If they choose a less expensive unit,

their contribution is reduced.

        Table 1 provides a summary of the size of various programs targeted at low-income families in

1996. A total of eight basic programs provided 4.81 million housing units, or 4.2 percent of the nearly

116 million housing units in the U.S.7 By far the largest programs are Section 8 Certificates & Vouchers

(1.34 million units) and Public Housing (1.33 million units). The Section 8 New & Substantial

Rehabilitation program provides 0.88 million units. Other public housing programs include Section 236

(0.45 million units), the low income housing tax credit (0.33 million units), Section 8 Moderate

Rehabilitation (0.11 million units), Indian Housing (0.07 million units) and miscellaneous other programs

providing a total of 0.29 million units.

        To receive a public or subsidized unit, one must satisfy a fairly complicated set of eligibility

criteria and also be selected from within the pool of eligible applicants. The primary restriction on

eligibility is income. A family of four can earn no more than 80 percent of their area’s median income to

be eligible.8 In recent years, Congress has enacted preferences for “very low income” families: to be so

classified, a family of four must have an income less than 50 percent of the median.9 Choosing which

families from the large pool of eligibles would receive public housing is up to each of the approximately

3400 local public housing authorities though preference is typically given to the elderly, people living in

“substandard” housing, and those paying more than 50 percent of their income as rent. [Olsen (2001)]

  In addition there are now some preferences for families with incomes below 30 percent of the median, though these
rules were not in effect during the time period covered by our data.

2. Policy Mechanism

        At face the programs that operate through increasing the supply of housing (such as public and

Indian housing, as well as some parts of Section 8) would appear to affect the housing market differently

than the programs such as Section 8 Certificates and Vouchers, that operate on the demand side. Yet,

all of these programs share an important feature: administrators choose how to allocate housing to

eligibles, leaving the remainder of the (private) market to equilibrate.10 The process of allocating housing

units (or vouchers, as we shall see below) provides the demand management that determines the

equilibrium impact of the program.

        It is instructive to consider the effects of the two basic kinds of housing programs using simple

supply and demand analysis. We first consider publicly provided housing. Publicly provided units are

public supply. When they are built they shift aggregate housing supply out. If prices adjust so that

markets clear, then the number of units consumed will initially rise by the number of public units made

available. How the public units are allocated, however, determines whether in the long run they raise

housing consumption. Suppose that each new public housing unit is allocated to a family that was

formerly unable to purchase housing and was sharing a unit with another family. Then the public housing

policy provides new demand and supply. The unit occupied by the recipient family represents a

transaction that would otherwise not have occurred. This transaction, however, has no effect on the

private market. Because the family would not have purchased housing in the private market, private

demand is not reduced. Because the new supply is rationed only to families with no private demand, the




10
  For the purpose of this exposition, it is easiest to view privately owned units that are rented using section 8
certificates or vouchers as public housing. One can view the future stream of section 8 payments that the landlord
will receive as the means by which the housing is purchased for the virtual public stock.


                                                         7
public supply has no effect on the private market. Put another way, the public unit would raise the total

housing stock by one unit. No crowd out would occur.

         Had the public unit been allocated to an inframarginal family – one purchasing private housing

without the program, the program would reduce demand for private housing. With such a rationing

scheme, the equilibrium impact of the public housing unit would be a reduction by one in the number of

private units. Put another way, the public housing unit would not raise the number of units in the housing

stock. Crowd out would be complete.11

         While voucher programs do not provide public supply, their potential effect on demand is the

same. A certificate or voucher can be awarded to a family that would have purchased private housing

in the absence of the program, or it can be awarded to a family that would not have purchased such

housing. In the former case, demand for housing where landlords do not accept vouchers falls by the

number of voucher units allocated. Vouchers do not raise the number of units in the stock, and crowd

out is complete. In the latter case, demand for non-voucher housing is unaffected. In the long run

vouchers provide new demand, and the private market responds with additional private units.

         Thus far, our exposition has assumed that the long run supply of privately-provided low income

housing is perfectly elastic and thus the quantity of low-income housing adjusts to public subsidies but

not the price. If the housing supply curve is upward-sloping in the long run, the degree of crowd out,

when measured in terms of units, would be smaller. A new public unit allocated to a family not already

consuming a unit would still lead to one unit net addition to the housing stock, and no effect on private

demand. But suppose the public unit were instead allocated to a family that already had a private unit.

11
 In the short run, constructing public housing units would increase the aggregate housing supply in a market.
However, the resulting lower house prices would lead to fewer additional units being constructed than otherwise
would have. If the public housing units were of a higher quality than the private housing they displaced, the overall


                                                          8
This would reduce the private demand for units by one, and the supply of private housing would

ultimately fall, but not by a full unit; and the new equilibrium would also entail lower rents. Similarly, a

voucher given to an already-housed family would have no net effect on the aggregate number of housing

units. A voucher allocated to an unhoused family would lead to a partial, but not one-for-one, increase

in the number of units, along with a new equilibrium with higher rents.

        Recent research [Susin (forthcoming)] presents evidence that the long-run housing supply

elasticity is low. While we cannot resolve the housing supply elasticity question in this paper, two points

are in order. First, the possibility of inelastic supply shrinks the possible effect of subsidies on housing

consumption and thus makes any effect more difficult to identify. Second, a low supply elasticity implies

that housing consumption should respond differentially to vouchers vs. public housing. If supply is

inelastic, then voucher policies which directly stimulate only demand should have smaller effects on

quantity than public housing programs which (unless they are accompanied by demolition) stimulate both

supply and demand. As we will see in the empirical section, vouchers have bigger effects on

consumption than public housing, consistent with relatively elastic long run supply.

        Our schematic description leaves out a few important features of the housing market. First, we

are focusing on units. Even if a public housing program has no effect on the number of units in the stock,

it may affect the quality of units consumed. Second, a public housing program may affect where

recipients choose to live in potentially beneficial ways. [Katz et al (2001)] Finally, we are abstracting

from the income transfer portion of the program. Rent subsidies, even to people who would have

rented their own unit in the absence of the program, is one way of transferring income to the needy.

Public or subsidized housing may provide a way for families with high rent burdens to reduce the


quality of low income housing could increase without any apparent change in the number of units.


                                                        9
proportion of their incomes they devote to housing, even if they are already housed. In addition, if

public housing is suitably stigmatized it may be an optimal way of identifying valid recipients of public

assistance. [Nichols and Zeckhauser (1982)]




II. Data

         The ideal unit of observation for our study would be a market area. That is, we are trying to

ascertain the impact of public housing on total housing. A narrow geographic unit, for example a census

tract, would be inappropriate as a unit of observation for our study because the private housing built in

the adjustment to the new equilibrium following the introduction of subsidized housing would likely be

outside the tract. The data we employ for this study is a cross section of 22,901 Census designated

places. Places are political units such as cities and towns.12 By using places, we are implicitly assuming

that the private market adjustment to the low-income housing programs occurs inside of the political

jurisdictions where the subsidized housing is located. As we document below, much of the public and

subsidized housing is located in large, urban places, suggesting that our treatment of places as markets is

reasonable.

         Our basic cross section matches data on total housing stock, population, and other demand

determinants in each Census place from the 1990 decennial Census with data on the number of public

and subsidized housing units, also by Census place, for 1996 from HUD’s “A Picture of Subsidized

Households – 1996.” The HUD data set reports project- and housing authority-level data that we

aggregated up to the Census place level. While the timing of the matches between the public housing


12
   We exclude places with a ratio of public and subsidized units per capita greater or equal to 0.5, as well as places
with 1.1 or more total housing units per capita. These restrictions keep places such as resort communities, with many




                                                         10
and the Census data is imperfect, it is the best we could obtain. 13 In addition, we have earlier 1977

HUD data, as well as 1980 Census data which we use to create instruments, as we outline below.

        Table 2 reports the means and standard deviations of some of the data we use most frequently,

weighted by the population of the Census place. On average, about 2.7 people live in each housing unit

(1/0.376). There is less than one public or subsidized housing unit for every 50 people in the U.S. (a

ratio of 0.018), of which 72 percent (0.013/0.018) is project-based housing and 28 percent is tenant-

based. The “pressure” variable indicates that, on average, there are three times as many “eligible”

recipients of public or subsidized housing than there are units. About 13 percent of the population in all

these Census places are over 65 years of age and approximately 14 percent are Black.

        Public housing is disproportionately concentrated in large places. As table 3 shows, 93.5

percent of public and subsidized housing is located in the top 25 percent of markets, while these

markets contain 88.1 percent of total housing and 88.6 percent of the population. The top percentile of

places contains just over half the public and subsidized housing in the U.S. The same places contain just

over a third of the population and total housing units. Indeed, the top 20 markets, listed in table 4,

together include 22 percent of public and subsidized housing. New York City alone has a quarter of a

million public or subsidized units, about 7.5 percent of the national total.




housing units but few permanent residents, out of the sample.

13
  Although HUD maintains a data set on public housing in 1993 (See http://www.huduser.org/data/data.html for
information on Family Data on Public and Indian Housing (1993)), that data source contains information only on
projects, not certificate and voucher programs. According to HUD employees, it appears that historic public and
subsidized housing data was not archived. Thus it is impossible to go back and construct data on the quantities of
public and subsidized housing in, say, 1990.


                                                        11
III. Empirical Strategy and Results

         Our empirical approach is to ask whether markets with more public housing have more total

housing units, after accounting for other potential determinants of the number of housing units. If places

with more public housing units do not have more total housing units than they would have in the absence

of public housing, we can conclude that public housing does not increase the housing stock and must

have crowded out private provision of low-income housing. If places with more public housing units

have a greater number of total housing units, all else equal, some public housing must be net new. We

recognize the possibility that public and subsidizing housing units may be endogenous, so we also

employ an instrumental variables strategy that we describe below.

         To measure the impact of low-income housing policy on the private housing market equilibrium,

we first regress the quantity of public and subsidized housing in a place on the total quantity of housing in

the place. Because the places differ enormously in size, we run the regressions in per capita terms,

weighting using population. This cross sectional strategy assumes private housing markets are in

equilibrium. That is, the private housing stock must have fully adjusted to the presence of public

housing. If public housing has been constructed or vouchers funded recently, the private market may

not have had time to respond, biasing our results.14 For example, in the short run, building a public unit

must increase the housing stock by one unit since no private units have been removed from the housing

stock. Similarly, allocating a new voucher would have no effect on total housing in the short run since

private developers would not yet have had the opportunity or time to build anew. These outcomes




14
  The private market response may be fairly rapid. If public housing is constructed, private housing units do not
have to fall down for the market to reach equilibrium. If there is population growth, developers simply can construct
less new supply than otherwise would have been the case.


                                                         12
would make public housing look very efficient and vouchers look like they had no effect on housing

consumption, even if in the long run the private housing market would have fully responded.15

         To surmount this potential problem, we use the total occupied housing stock per capita as our

left-hand-side variable. If a new public housing unit is allocated to someone who would have consumed

a housing unit anyway, it will have no effect on the aggregate occupied housing stock. However, if it

induces someone to move away from sharing a unit to living on their own, it will increase the number of

occupied units. Similarly, we use occupied public and subsidized housing units per capita as our

independent variable.16 Using the total housing stock, rather than just occupied, yields very similar

results.17

         The results are reported in table 5. Specification one includes the distribution of race, the

distribution of age across 12 categories, the distribution of family income across 25 categories, and the

median family income as controls. The second specification adds state fixed effects to control for

possible unobserved heterogeneity. The crowd-out effects are then identified from differences in public

housing in places within the same state. The coefficient on total public and subsidized housing per capita

varies from around 0.27 to about 0.37, and is large relative to its standard error. We can clearly reject

both that the coefficient is zero and that it is one. Thus, the full sample estimates are inconsistent with

both full and zero crowd out, suggesting instead that three additional public or subsidized units add one

unit to the aggregate stock, crowding out about two private units. The controls explain a significant

fraction of the cross-sectional variance in occupied housing units per capita, almost 80 percent.

15
   In fact, Murray (1999) finds the aforementioned pattern, suggesting that his time series analysis may be picking up
a short-run effect.
16
   HUD reports occupancy rates only for public housing. HUD points out that the other forms of housing assistance
are more-or-less fully occupied and reports the data accordingly. Whether we use occupied or total public housing is
inconsequential.



                                                         13
        Because public housing is skewed toward large places, we re-estimate the equations for each

quartile of places, ranked by population. Columns one and two of table 6 replicate the specifications in

table 5 and report just the coefficient on occupied public and subsidized housing for several size

categories of Census places. A pattern that emerges in the table is that crowding out is less in larger

places. In the bottom quartile, each public or subsidized unit adds only 0.06 of a unit to the long-run

housing stock. But for places with an above the median population, crowd out is between 0.8 and 0.6

private units for each public unit. Since population is skewed, with many people in the top few percent

of Census places, the largest cities may drive the results in columns 1 and 2. Specification 3, rather than

weighting each place by population, weights each Census place equally. This emphasizes where in the

population distribution the results are coming from. The results are very similar to the weighted

regression suggesting that our model is well-specified.18




1. Crowd Out and the Pressure on Public and Subsidized Housing

        Since public housing crowds out privately provided low income housing only to the degree that

the recipients of the subsidy did not really need it to obtain a unit, one might expect that public housing

will be more efficient in places where there is more excess demand for it. That is, we expect the extent

of crowd-out that our approach measures to be smaller in markets with greater pressure on the public

and subsidized housing supply. (Finding this pattern will also lend additional credence to our estimation

approach).



17
  The standard errors are comparable and the point estimates on the public housing variable varies by about 0.10.
18
  Since we have data on public housing in 1977 – tenant-based programs did not yet exist – we could run an
analogous set of regressions for crowd out in 1980. When we do so, the results are economically and statistically
similar.


                                                        14
         We proxy for the level of demand pressure for public housing with the number of eligible

recipients relative to the existing public housing supply.19 According to public and subsidized housing

eligibility rules, a family of four is eligible only if its income falls short of 50 percent of the local family

median income.20 Using Census data on the number of families in each of the 25 income cells, we

compute rough numbers of eligible families per Census place. We then calculate an index which is the

number of total public and subsidized units per eligible family. For markets where this index is small, the

pressure on public housing is greater. We allow the extent of crowd out to differ across places

according to the amount of pressure on public housing by adding an interaction of public and subsidized

housing per capita with the index.21 A higher value of the index indicates less pressure on public and

subsidized housing. Because we expect more crowding out where there is less pressure on the

government-supported low-income housing stock, we expect a negative coefficient on the interaction

term.

         Table 7 reports the estimated coefficients on public and subsidized housing per capita, demand

“pressure” on public housing, and the interaction of the two. The specifications mirror those in table 5.

The coefficients on public housing per capita vary between about 0.38 and 0.51, and the coefficients on

the interaction term are uniformly negative. All are very precisely estimated.22 The middle three rows of

the table report estimates of the effect adding one more unit of public and subsidized housing would


19
   One could imagine using the length of the waiting list or the local eligibility rules for this purpose. However,
waiting lists are poorly measured and are capped and eligibility rules vary by public housing authority and are
difficult to obtain. [Olsen (2001)]
20
   As our discussion of the rules above indicates, some families with up to 80 percent of local median income may
also be eligible, although spots for such families are limited.
21
   Among the 10,049 places with public housing, the values of the index at various points of the distribution are
.0081301 (5th percentile), .0931011 (25th percentile), .2822478 (median), 0.5106383 (75th percentile),
0.7647059 (90th percentile), and 0.9714286 (95th percentile). The mean value of the index is 0.3715442.
22
   We also estimated the regressions underlying table 7 using only places with public housing, and results were
virtually identical.


                                                          15
have on total housing, evaluated at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the distribution of the pressure

index (among the 10,049 places with public housing). Focusing on specification (2), we see that in

places with little public housing per eligible family (high pressure), an additional public or subsidized unit

raises total housing by 0.49 units. At a place with the median value of the index, the effect falls to 0.47.

In places with relatively plentiful public housing relative to the eligible population, the effect drops to

0.44. These estimates show that public housing has a greater effect on total housing - and therefore

whether families occupy their own housing units - in places with relatively little public housing. We

interpret this to mean that in places with relatively more public housing, the marginal recipient family

would have been more likely to occupy a (private) unit in the absence of the housing policy.




2. Project-based versus tenant-based assistance

    While to this point we have treated project-based and tenant-based assistance as having similar

effects on the private housing stock, that need not be the case. Since U.S. policy is moving away from

project-based public housing towards more tenant-based assistance [Quigley (2000)], it would be

worthwhile to determine whether vouchers and certificates lead to more or less net new housing than do

project-based public housing programs.

        Separately identifying the crowd-out effects of project- and tenant-based programs could also

shed additional light on the believability of our results. A priori, one would not necessarily expect any

differential crowd-out effect between the two types of programs. If there are differences in eligibility,

however, the program that is more targeted towards families that otherwise would not be housed should

exhibit less crowd-out. Olsen (2001) claims that vouchers and certificates are given to more needy

recipients than project-based housing since administrators want to avoid concentrations of poverty in


                                                      16
housing projects.23 If this claim is true, we should see tenant-based programs generating more net new

housing than public housing. On the other hand, if the housing markets were not truly in equilibrium or

long-run supply were not fully elastic, we would expect to find that public housing creates more net new

housing since it actually constructs new units. Certificates and vouchers would have little-to-no effect on

the total housing stock since they are merely reallocating an existing unit.

         Table 8 tests these hypotheses and finds support for the first one, that tenant-based housing is

more likely to go to people who would not otherwise have had their own housing units. The

specifications are the same as in table 5, with even-numbered columns including state fixed effects. In

the first panel, we estimate the effect of project-based public housing on the total stock of housing

units.24 An additional unit of occupied public housing is estimated to increase the total occupied housing

stock by only 0.21 to 0.33 units, crowding out 0.7 to 0.8 private units. In the second panel, an

additional unit of tenant-based assistance increases the occupied housing stock by more than 0.7 units,

crowding out less than one-third of a private housing unit.

         The third panel of table 8 includes both project-based public housing per capita and tenant-

based housing per capita as explanatory variables in case the quantities of project- and tenant-based

units in a Census place are related. Once again, we find evidence that tenant-based housing crowds out

less private housing than project-based public housing does. An additional unit of project-based

housing is estimated to increase the total occupied housing stock by just 0.16 to 0.29 units, while one




23
   In addition, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program allows landlords to charge 30 percent of the maximum
eligible income – 50 percent of the local median – as rent, pricing out all but the highest income eligible families.
24
   Project-based housing is defined as Public and Indian housing, Section 236, Section 8 new construction and
substantial rehabilitation, and the low-income housing tax credit. Tenant-based housing is Section 8 certificates and
vouchers and “other.”


                                                         17
more unit of tenant-based housing would increase the occupied housing stock by approximately 0.65

units.25




3. Instrumental Variables

           Our empirical strategy thus far allows inference about the effect of public and subsidized housing

on total housing if the variation in total public housing were exogenous. If public and subsidized housing

is located in markets for reasons related to unobserved determinants of total housing, then ordinary least

squares (and other such approaches) will yield biased estimates of the effect of public and subsidized

housing on the private housing market equilibrium.26

           As we pointed out earlier, almost all public housing in the US was built prior to the late 1980s.

It seems likely that public housing, when first erected, was placed in its locations for reasons related to

the demand for housing. However, if the reasons for locating public housing change over time (i.e. so

that if public housing were built today from scratch, its distribution across markets would be different),

then it will be reasonable to view the quantities of public housing as exogenous.

           The quantity of section 8 certificates and vouchers is another matter, since it did not exist in the

late 1970s. However, the budget rules that determine the funding for each locality, and thus the number

of public housing units or vouchers it can provide, is set by statute. The current budgeting rules start

25
   One should resist the temptation to extrapolate from these results that all housing programs should be tenant-
based. If the differences between them are simply due to program administrators giving the vouchers to the most
needy recipients, moving the public housing recipients into the voucher program will merely increase the amount of
crowd-out due to the voucher program. It could also be that since tenant-based housing assistance is not as
historically determined, it is allocated more to the places with the greatest need and thus is more efficient. That
would argue for moving away from the existing project-based housing and turning towards the more flexible voucher
system.
26
   Another potential source of bias is that people may move to where there is more public housing. Painter (1997)
finds little within-metro area moving in response to local disparities in the length of waiting lists. However, he does
not provide evidence on moving across metropolitan areas to obtain public housing. Such mobility would imply that



                                                          18
with the level of appropriations allocated by Congress for a given year. From that, anything previously

agreed to or that needs ongoing spending must be paid. Second, HUD pays for anything Congress

specially asks for. Finally, the remainder is divided among allocation areas according a score that is

determined by the area’s proportion of the national total of: (a) the renter population (20 percent), (b)

renters in poverty (20 percent), (c) rental occupancy that is more than 1.01 persons/room (10 percent),

(d) the number of rental units needed to raise market vacancy rate to normal levels (10 percent), (e)

number of rental units built before 1940 occupied by impoverished (20 percent), (f) other measurable

conditions (20 percent). That division is constrained by rules that HUD cannot spend less than 0.5

percent on any single state and cannot spend less than 25 percent in nonmetropolitan areas.

        Of these rules, we deem a portion of rule (e) to be reasonably exogenous. Accordingly, we will

instrument with the number of rental units in the Census place built before 1940. Presumably the

number of impoverished may be endogenous so we leave that portion of the budget rule out of our

instrument set.

        We reestimate our base specifications, first employing both instruments: the number of public

housing units per capita in 1977-1980 and the number of housing units per capita built prior to 1940.

Then we try instrumenting with each separately. The results are reported in table 9, with the first stage

regressions shown in appendix table A. Once again, the specifications mirror those in table 5.

        Instrumenting seems to increase the measured crowd-out relative to table 5. The estimated

coefficient on the total occupied public and subsidized units drops by 75 percent (from its value in table

5) to 0.067 (0.024). This implies that an additional public unit has almost no effect on the total housing

stock. When we add state fixed effects, the coefficient increases from its table 5 value of 0.37 to 0.48,


we underestimate the effect of subsidized housing on net new housing units.


                                                       19
implying less crowd-out. The next two panels, which include each instrument separately, suggest why

state fixed effects change the estimates so much. Columns 3 and 4 show that instrumenting with the

1977 public housing units per capita leads to a finding of complete or almost-complete crowd out

(0.026 net new units when we estimate without state dummies and 0.211 net new units when the state

controls are included.) Column 5, where we instrument with the number of housing units per capita built

before 1940, finds the same effect: one new public unit leads to 0.18 (0.04) net new units overall. The

results obtained in column 6, including state dummies, show an implausibly large effect of public and

subsidized housing on total housing. We surmise that this arises because the pre-1940 housing stock,

while it varies across states reflecting historical state-by-state settlement patterns, does not vary

substantially within states. This curious result explains which the column 2 coefficient exceeds its

analogue in table 5.

        While our instruments are not enormously successful, our IV results provide support for our

basic OLS and fixed effects estimates showing that low-income housing subsidies increase housing

consumption. For two reasons, we believe that the IV results provide a lower-bound on the true net

effect of housing subsidies on aggregate housing units. First, especially in columns (3) and (4), our

instrument mainly reflects the amount of public housing in an area. Because vouchers may not be

allocated in the same manner as public housing is distributed, the IV estimates are best compared to the

estimates of the effect of project-level assistance on total housing, which we document in table 8 to be

much smaller than the effect of tenant-level assistance. Viewed that way, the IV estimates are not so

different from the OLS results, although they are still smaller. Second, a plausible kind of possible

endogeneity in our 1980 public housing unit instrument will tend to drive our IV results toward zero.

Suppose that public housing units were allocated in greater amounts where they were most necessary,


                                                     20
for example in places where there are too few units per capita. If the need for public housing were

persistent enough that the 1977 distribution were not completely exogenous in the 1990s, there would

be more public housing in places with less private-market housing, which would appear in these

estimates as larger crowd-out, or little net program effect on total housing units.




IV. Conclusion

        A simple but natural test for public housing programs is whether they allow families that would

otherwise not have, to occupy their own housing units. Given equilibrium housing market responses to

government programs, it is by no means obvious that programs that place families into their own housing

units will raise the total number of families occupying units. The effect of such programs depends

crucially on whether recipient families would have occupied their own units in the absence of the

programs.

        We provide a simple evaluation of this question. We ask whether places with more public and

subsidized housing also have more total housing, after accounting for housing demand. We find that

government-financed units raise the total number of units, although on average three government-

subsidized units displace two units that would otherwise have been provided by the private market.

There is less crowd out in more populous markets, and less crowd out in places where excess demand

for public housing is higher because there are fewer government-financed units per eligible person.

Tenant-based housing programs seem to be more efficient at providing housing units to people who

otherwise would not have their own. These results remain even with sensible instruments.

        We take these results to be an indication of a positive real effect of low-income housing

subsidies. Because we observe an aggregate increase in the number of units, the programs do not


                                                     21
merely redistribute the same housing among the population. These results are also sufficient (though not

necessary) for the program to have a real economic impact. Alternative effects of public and subsidized

housing programs would make our results more difficult to find – such as subsidies affecting equilibrium

rents rather than quantities of housing consumed – and often further support our conclusion of a real

benefit. For example, subsidized housing may also improve the quality of housing consumed and, since it

is also an income transfer, it may raise non-housing consumption.

        However, much work remains. Public provision of housing is typically quite costly. [Olsen

(2000)] In addition, Susin (forthcoming) points out that if vouchers lead to higher market rents, on net

the programs might transfer income from tenants to landlords. The rudimentary measure of housing

consumption we examine here, the number of units consumed, is insufficient to determine whether public

housing programs are the most efficient way of subsidizing low income housing or targeting low-income

families for financial assistance. All of the factors mentioned above would need to be weighed when

determining whether the government should provide a private good, such as housing.

Notes: Left-hand-side variable is total occupied housing per capita. Standard errors are in parentheses.
There are 22,630 observations, each is a Census-designated place. Regressions are weighted by
population. Public housing “Pressure” is the number of public housing units divided by the number of
people that have less than 50 percent of the median family income. All regressions include controls for
the age, racial, and income distributions, and the median family income. Specification (2) adds state
dummies.
