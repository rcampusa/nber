                                            ABSTRACT

Using hedge fund indices representing eight different styles, we find strong evidence of contagion
within the hedge fund sector: controlling for a number of risk factors, the average probability that a
hedge fund style index has extreme poor performance (lower 10% tail) increases from 2% to 21%
as the number of other hedge fund style indices with extreme poor performance increases from zero
to seven. We investigate how changes in funding and asset liquidity intensify this contagion, and find
that the likelihood of contagion is high when prime brokerage firms have poor performance (which
would be expected to affect hedge fund funding liquidity adversely) and when stock market liquidity
(a proxy for asset liquidity) is low. Finally, we examine whether extreme poor performance in the
stock, bond, and currency markets is more likely when contagion in the hedge fund sector is high.
We find no evidence that contagion in the hedge fund sector is associated with extreme poor performance
in the stock and bond markets, but find significant evidence that performance in the currency market
is worse when hedge fund contagion is high, consistent with the effects of an unwinding of carry trades.

    Figure 1 shows that, strikingly, many hedge fund indices performed extremely poorly on the same

dates even though the indices correspond to very different hedge fund styles. Why would a hedge fund

index of long-short equity funds perform poorly when an index of distressed securities funds has poor

performance? It could be that this simultaneous occurrence of poor returns across hedge fund styles is

just due to bad luck. Alternatively, poor returns for one type of hedge fund may make it more likely that

other types of hedge funds have poor returns. The finance and economics literatures often use the term

contagion to describe a situation where, to borrow the language of Bekaert, Harvey, and Ng (2005), there

is excess correlation and poor performance spreads across countries, asset classes, or investment

strategies for reasons not related to correlations in fundamentals.1

    In this paper, we investigate whether hedge fund styles suffer from contagion, in the sense that

extremely poor returns on traditional asset classes or on other hedge fund styles lead to extremely poor

returns for a hedge fund style that cannot be explained by normal correlation or by traditional hedge fund

risk factors. We find no systematic evidence of contagion from the main markets to individual hedge

fund indices, but we provide strong evidence of contagion across hedge fund styles. We show that this

hedge fund contagion is most severe when asset and funding liquidity are low. Next, we investigate

whether greater hedge fund contagion is associated with extremely poor performance in the traditional

asset classes. We find evidence that hedge fund contagion is associated with extremely poor performance

of the currency markets (which is consistent with an unwinding of carry trades), but not of the stock and

bond markets.

    Whether hedge fund styles suffer from contagion is an important issue for investors, risk managers,

and regulators. For investors, if contagion is present, linear measures of dependence such as correlation

do not capture the dependence in extremely poor returns, so that the diversification benefits associated




1
 The contagion literature has its origins in the international finance literature that focuses on emerging market and
currency crises. As discussed by Dornbush, Park, and Claessens (2000), there are many definitions of contagion.




                                                         2
with investing in different hedge fund styles are likely overstated when based on historical correlations.2

During periods of contagion, correlations are unusually high compared to historical correlations since

poor returns occur across assets regardless of their historical correlations – a phenomenon that Chan,

Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2005) call phase-locking and that Duffie, Eckner, Horel, and Saita (2006) call

frailty. With contagion, therefore, risk management models that rely on historical correlations can fail

dramatically because they understate risk during periods of contagion. Finally, the existence of hedge

fund contagion raises concerns about hedge funds creating systemic risk. If contagion is not present, the

probability that different hedge fund styles will perform extremely poorly at the same time is low, and

therefore, it is unlikely that the hedge fund sector as a whole would suddenly become financially fragile.3

However, if there is contagion, extremely poor performance could be pervasive across the whole hedge

fund sector, which could seriously endanger banks and investment banks with exposure to hedge funds.

This issue becomes even more important if the contagion is not confined to the hedge fund sector, but

spreads from the hedge fund sector to the main financial markets.

    A small number of papers investigate contagion-related issues for hedge funds. Chan, Getmansky,

Haas, and Lo (2005) analyze the systemic risk of hedge funds using regression models that allow for

nonlinearities in the relation between hedge fund returns and main market returns as well as regression

models that allow for regime shifts. Their analysis reveals a positive correlation between bank returns

(measured using a broad-based bank index from CRSP) and hedge fund returns after controlling for a

nonlinear relation between the S&P 500 return and hedge fund returns. They suggest as an explanation for

this finding the use of hedge fund strategies by banks’ proprietary trading desks.                 Khandani and Lo

(2007) investigate the factors that led to large losses in long/short equity funds (i.e., quant funds) during

August 2007 and hypothesize that these losses were caused by a rapid unwinding of trades on a

proprietary-trading desk or large hedge fund due to losses in unrelated strategies. Their paper therefore

2
  In addition, studies have shown that hedge fund returns do not follow a normal distribution, that they tend to be
heavily skewed, and that their correlations with some risk factors are not stationary. It is well-known that correlation
is a poor measure of dependence under such conditions (see, e.g., Embrechts, McNeil, and Straumann, 2002).
3
   If returns follow a multivariate normal distribution, the joint probability of returns being in the tails of the
distribution becomes vanishingly small as the size of the tail threshold increases (see Longin and Solnik (2001)).

provides an example where hedge fund contagion results from forced liquidations in funds that are active

in different styles. Billio, Getmansky, and Pelizzon (2007) examine hedge fund risk exposures in a

regime-switching model. They show that when volatility is high the four strategies they examine have

exposure to proxies for liquidity and credit risk. Finally, Adrian and Brunnermeier (2008) use quantile

regressions to document the increase in a measure of the risk of hedge funds, i.e., value-at-risk (VaR),

conditional on other hedge fund styles experiencing financial distress. They explain within-sector hedge

fund VaR contagion using various factors including volatility, credit spreads, repo spreads, and returns on

the main markets.

    To investigate contagion, we use monthly hedge fund index return data from HFR (Hedge Fund

Research) for eight different hedge fund styles.4 We focus on the lower 10% return tail events (i.e., the

bottom 10% of the entire time series of returns).5 Using the logit regression methodology to estimate

contagion (see Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1996) and Bae, Karolyi, and Stulz (2003)), we estimate

how the probability of an extreme negative return for a hedge fund style index (i.e., a “tail event”) is

related to the occurrence of an extreme negative return on the main market indices – stock market,

currency, and fixed income – and to the number of other hedge fund style indices that have negative tail

events. We use as independent variables the returns of the main markets and the hedge fund style indices

to allow for the impact of correlation on the likelihood of occurrence of extreme negative returns, as well

as a number of other control variables. To account for contagion from the main markets, we use indicator

variables for the occurrence of extreme negative returns in these markets, and to account for contagion

across hedge funds we use a variable called COUNT, which ranges in value from zero to seven and is

defined as the number of other hedge fund styles that have negative tail events in a given month. In

interpreting our results, a positive and significant coefficient on any of the main market indicator

variables or on the COUNT variable is evidence of contagion.

4
  In addition, we perform robustness tests using published indices from CSFB/Tremont (www.hedgeindex.com).
Results using these alternate indices are consistent with the results we document.
5
  Because hedge fund indices exhibit autocorrelation, we standardize the hedge fund returns (and all other variables
used in the paper) using AR-GARCH models to control for autocorrelation and volatility clustering. The residuals
from these models are then used in our analyses. For further detail on the standardization, see the Data section.




                                                         4
    We perform eight regressions, one for each hedge fund style. We find no consistent evidence of

contagion from the main markets to the hedge fund style indices, but find strong evidence of contagion

within the hedge fund sector. Specifically, the coefficient on the COUNT variable is positive and

significant at the 10% level or better in six of the eight regressions, indicating a high level of contagion

between hedge fund styles. The economic significance of this contagion is large. If all the explanatory

variables are set to their mean values except for COUNT, the average probability that a style index has a

return in the lower 10% tail increases from 1.8% to 20.9% as COUNT increases from zero to seven.

    After documenting the existence of contagion between hedge fund styles, we investigate its possible

causes. An obvious concern is that the indices we use misclassify funds. Such misclassification would

not likely explain contagion, however – it would simply explain greater correlation. To further address

this concern, we perform robustness tests of all our results using a different set of hedge fund indices from

CSFB/Tremont and find consistent results. The second possible explanation is related to the well-known

result from hedge fund research (Fung and Hsieh (1997, 1999, 2001, 2004), Mitchell and Pulvino (2001),

and Agarwal and Naik (2004)) that hedge fund returns have option-like properties, so it could be that our

finding of contagion within the hedge fund sector is spurious and caused by nonlinearities in hedge fund

returns. Hence, we perform additional regressions controlling for non-linear factors and for volatility in

the main markets, and find that our results remain unaffected.

    After rejecting these explanations for our findings, we turn to economic explanations of contagion.

Khandani and Lo (2007) highlight a natural mechanism of contagion for hedge fund styles, namely that

some funds are active across multiple styles (multi-strategy funds), so that poor performance in one style

leads them to liquidate positions in other styles, thereby putting pressure on prices in these styles and

possibly creating mark-to-market losses for funds specialized in these styles if liquidity is low.6 For the

mechanism they highlight to be strong, it would seem that asset liquidity must be low – i.e., it is not

possible to sell financial assets quickly without a discount. Further, a fund that performs poorly in one

6
  It is important to note that we exclude multi-strategy funds for the obvious reason that using these funds in an
analysis cannot capture contagion across hedge fund styles, since by definition, these funds use a number of
different trading styles. Therefore, we focus on single-strategy hedge fund styles.




                                                        5
strategy will have to liquidate across strategies only to the extent that it faces funding constraints, so that

the transmission mechanism also requires limited funding liquidity.

    The role of asset liquidity and funding liquidity as amplifying contagion mechanisms is modeled by

Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2008). They provide a theoretical model in which asset liquidity and funding

liquidity interact. An adverse shock to asset liquidity reduces the ability of financial intermediaries to

finance their asset holdings due to higher margin requirements resulting from the decrease in asset

liquidity. Hedge fund losses in one style can reduce both funding liquidity and asset liquidity for hedge

funds of all styles. Losses in hedge funds reduce their ability to provide liquidity to the markets, which

leads to lower asset liquidity. Lower asset liquidity reduces the credit available to hedge funds and forces

them to reduce their leverage, but the resulting liquidations lead to mark-to-market losses and hence

further reductions in credit availability.

    Reductions in funding liquidity for the hedge fund sector can occur for reasons that have nothing to

do with hedge funds, for example because of regulatory tightening or an unexpected increase in risk in

financial markets, but they can also result from hedge fund losses. A sharp reduction in funding liquidity

can lead to liquidations across the hedge fund sector, a reduction in asset liquidity, and mark-to-market

losses that cannot be explained by traditional risk factors for hedge fund returns. For a reduction in

funding liquidity to take place because of poor returns in a hedge fund style, the losses in one hedge fund

style must directly affect the providers of funding to hedge funds and/or affect their willingness to lend to

hedge funds. Prime brokers are direct lenders to hedge funds. Shocks to the capital of prime brokers

forces them to contract lending to hedge funds, thereby reducing funding liquidity for these funds. To

capture the impact of shocks to funding liquidity for hedge funds, we therefore create a prime broker

stock index, PBI, as our main proxy for funding liquidity. To evaluate the role of asset liquidity as a

channel of contagion, we use Amihud’s (2002) stock market liquidity variable.                This measure is

calculated as the average of the daily ratio of absolute stock return to dollar volume across stocks. It may

be interpreted as the daily price response associated with one dollar of trading volume, and thus, is a

rough measure of price impact.




                                                      6
    Our proxies for low liquidity are associated with increased contagion. For example, in periods when

asset liquidity is low (as proxied by Amihud’s measure), an average of 3.14 hedge fund styles have

extreme negative returns, as compared with 0.70 hedge fund styles when asset liquidity is not low.

Results are similar for the PBI index, our proxy for low funding liquidity. Even more impressively, in

periods when both asset liquidity and funding liquidity are low, the average number of hedge fund styles

with extreme negative returns goes to 4.33, as compared with 0.70 hedge fund styles when both asset

liquidity and funding liquidity are not low. This strong relation between asset and funding liquidity and

the number of styles with extreme negative returns is still present in a Poisson regression framework

where we control for determinants of hedge fund style returns.7

    Finally, given the strong contagion within the hedge fund sector, the last section of the paper explores

whether hedge fund contagion is associated with extremely poor performance in the main markets. Using

logit regressions, we find evidence of poor performance in the currency market, but not in the stock and

bond markets, when hedge fund contagion is high. This finding is related to recent work on the impact of

carry trades on the currency market. We show that extreme dollar depreciation is associated with poor

hedge fund returns. Research on carry trades suggests that the unwinding of these trades is associated

with appreciation of the yen and other currencies (relative to the dollar) in which hedge funds borrow

with these trades.8 Plantin and Shin (2008) develop a model where the unwinding of carry trades is

associated with de-leveraging of hedge funds because of a reduction in funding liquidity. While this

research is consistent with the contagion we document, our empirical work cannot distinguish between

unwinding caused by currency movements versus currency movements caused by unwinding.

    The paper is organized as follows. In Section I we describe the data for the hedge fund index returns

and the explanatory variables. Section II uses HFR monthly hedge fund indices and documents contagion

in extremely poor returns within the hedge fund sector.            Section III examines possible economic

  Chan, Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2005) show that hedge fund returns are correlated with bank returns. The funding
tail dependence we uncover between the PBI index and hedge fund style returns holds up in regressions which
control for the level of bank returns, so that it is a distinct phenomenon from the one they describe.

explanations for contagion using proxies for funding illiquidity and asset illiquidity. Section IV examines

whether hedge fund contagion is associated with extremely poor performance in the main markets. We

attempt to interpret our results and conclude in Section V.




I. Data

     The hedge fund style returns are the monthly style index returns provided by Hedge Fund Research

(HFR). The returns are net of fees and are equally-weighted averages of fund returns. The indices include

both domestic and offshore funds. This data extends from January 1990 to August 2007 for a total of 212

monthly observations.       The indices consist of eight single strategy indices: Convertible Arbitrage,

Distressed Securities, Equity Hedge, Equity Market Neutral, Event Driven, Global Macro, Merger

Arbitrage, and Relative Value Arbitrage.9 They include over 1,600 funds, with no required minimum

track record or asset size. Additionally, these indices are not investible; that is, they include funds that are

closed to new investors. To address backfilling and survivorship bias, when a fund is added to an index,

the index is not recomputed with past returns of that fund. Similarly, when a fund is dropped from an

index, past returns of the index are left unchanged.10

     In our study, we investigate contagion between the main financial markets and eight hedge fund

styles as well as within the hedge fund sector across the eight hedge fund styles. The main financial

markets are the stock market, the fixed-income market, and the currency market. We use the return of the

Russell 3000 index to proxy for the return of the stock market, the return on the Lehman Brothers bond

index (LB bond index hereafter) to proxy for the return of the fixed-income market, and the change in the

10
   As noted earlier, we perform robustness tests for all our analyses using the published CSFB/Tremont hedge fund
indices (www.hedgeindex.com). One possible issue with the HFR data is that the indices are equally-weighted with
no size requirement, so they might give too much weight to small funds. By contrast, the published CSFB/Tremont
indices have a minimum $50 million size requirement and are value-weighted. However, because of survivorship
bias, the CSFB/Tremont indices only cover the period beginning in 1994. The results for tests using these alternative
indices are generally consistent with the HFR results.

trade-weighted US dollar exchange index published by the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve

System (FRB dollar index in what follows) to proxy for the return of the currency market.11

     Table I provides summary statistics and correlations for the hedge fund indices and broad markets.

The data indicate relatively high positive unconditional correlations between the eight hedge fund indices.

Additionally, the correlations with the Russell 3000 index are large and positive for all of the hedge fund

indices. The correlations with the FRB dollar index (the currency index) are low or negative, and

correlations with the LB Bond index are all positive, although generally not statistically significant.

     Six of the eight hedge fund indices exhibit autocorrelation as shown in Panel 2, and the Ljung-Box

tests reject the hypothesis of no autocorrelation for the first six lags for these indices. These results are

generally consistent with Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov (2004) and others in prior literature. Finally, the

normality tests as shown in Panel 3 are rejected for seven of the eight indices. These results are consistent

with Embrechts, McNeil, and Straumann (2002).

     Since hedge fund returns are autocorrelated, we standardize the hedge fund returns (and all other

variables used in the paper) using AR-GARCH models to control for autocorrelation and volatility

clustering. The residuals from these models are then used in our analyses.12 The approach of filtering a

time-series with a GARCH process and using the residuals in the analysis has been proposed in the risk

management literature in applications of conditional extreme value theory (EVT) for financial time-series.

In particular, McNeil, Frey, and Embrechts (2005) suggest using GARCH models to obtain a time-series

for which extreme observations are not clustered and, hence, are suitable to estimate the tail distribution

based on Generalized Pareto Distributions (GDP). Our filtering procedures of the original series with AR-

GARCH processes can be viewed in light of these EVT applications where we remove clustering of

extreme events that are due to periods of heightened volatilities.

     The relatively high correlations we observe among hedge fund indices and between hedge fund

indices and market indices indicate the importance of controlling for correlation in our contagion tests to

   Ljung-Box tests on these residuals indicate that using AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) processes is sufficient to remove the
autocorrelation except for the equity market neutral style where we use an ARMA(2,2)-GARCH(1,1) model.

ensure that we do not mistake for contagion the normal workings of correlation. With our definition of

contagion, normal correlation between hedge fund indices and between hedge fund indices and market

indices does not represent contagion. We control for the relationship between hedge fund returns and

market returns in our tests by including the returns on the main market factors as well as the returns on the

other hedge fund indices as explanatory variables. Thus, our approach is carefully constructed to test for

contagion over and above the linear relationship implied by these relatively high correlations.



II. Tests of contagion using HFR index data

         Our data encompasses a number of market crises including the Asian and Mexican currency

crises and the failure of Long Term Capital Management. We use a lower 10% cutoff of the overall

distribution of returns to identify “extreme” or “tail” negative returns. With such a cutoff, we have 21

“tail” observations for each style.     Had we chosen a 5% cutoff instead, we would have only ten

observations per style.



II.1. Existing approaches

     There is a large literature on contagion in emerging markets.13 A major part of this literature focuses

on testing whether correlations increase in troubled periods. This approach has been controversial. We

avoid this approach for three reasons. First, as Baig and Goldfajn (2002) and Forbes and Rigobon (2002)

argue, there are statistical difficulties involved in testing changes in correlations across different regimes.

Second, using correlations is problematic in this type of test, as correlations are linear measures of

association that are not appropriate to investigate behavior during extreme market conditions, while the

approach we use specifically focuses on nonlinearities in return distributions. Third, correlations are

particularly ill-suited for evaluating contagion for hedge funds because these funds often pursue strategies

with non-linear payoffs.

(2004).




                                                      10
     An alternative approach would be to employ extreme value theory (EVT) as in Longin and Solnik

(2001). Such an approach is implemented using monthly hedge fund indices by Geman and Kharoubi

(2003) and Bacmann and Gawron (2004). Geman and Kharoubi (2003) find that, though above-threshold

correlations between hedge fund returns and the S&P 500 index go asymptotically to zero for positive

returns as the threshold increases, this is not the case for negative returns. Bacmann and Gawron (2004)

find no asymptotic dependence of hedge funds and bonds, but find some dependence of hedge funds and

stocks which disappears when August 1998 is removed from the sample. While EVT and the use of

copulas makes it possible to examine tail dependence without using correlations, such an approach

requires the choice of a copula function and can easily give too much weight to extremely rare

observations. Further, it does not permit explicit conditioning on additional risk factors and, hence, makes

it difficult to explore the determinants of contagion.

     The third approach involves allowing explicitly for nonlinearities and for different return distributions

in troubled times. Chan, Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2005) follow this approach in a study of the systemic

risk of hedge funds.14 They use models that include non-linear exposures to various markets such as

squared and cubed returns on the S&P 500 index and also apply regime-switching models to hedge fund

returns. We allow for nonlinearities in exposures to risk factors as well.               However, we do not

parameterize the tail dependencies for the same reason that we do not use copulas: our approach makes it

less likely that we will give too much weight to rare observations.

     The last approach uses quantile regressions. Adrian and Brunnermeier (2008) use this approach to

document that hedge funds’ value-at-risk (VaR) increases conditional on other styles being in distress and

predictable spillover effects into the banking sector. Their result measures risk contagion rather than

returns contagion as it shows how the VaR for an index is affected by conditions in other hedge fund

styles and main markets.




14
  Billio, Getmansky, and Pelizzon (2007) also use regime-switching models to study the systemic risk of hedge
funds.




                                                         11
    We use a logit model to test for contagion from main markets to hedge funds and within the hedge

fund industry, following Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1996) and Bae, Karolyi, and Stulz (2003).

This model allows conditioning on additional risk factors and does not parameterize the tail dependencies.

II.2. Contagion between monthly hedge fund and market indices, and between hedge fund indices

    We wish to identify the extent to which hedge fund indices are subject to contagion. The dependent

variable in our basic regression specification is an indicator variable set to one if the hedge fund index

under study has a return in the bottom 10% of all returns for that index, and zero otherwise. Independent

variables include the three main market indices: the Russell 3000, the LB bond index, and the FRB dollar

index. Additionally included are returns on the other seven hedge fund indices, measured as an equally-

weighted index of these indices. We also include indicator variables for extreme returns in the main

market indices (set to one if the return for that month is in the bottom 10% of all returns for the index). A

positive and significant coefficient on a market indicator variable is interpreted as evidence of contagion

from the main markets. Finally, we create the “COUNT” variable. The COUNT variable is the aggregated

indicator variable for the other seven hedge fund indices, and is set to 0 if none of the other indices has an

extreme return for the month, one if one of the other indices has an extreme return for the month, and so

on up to a maximum value of seven when all seven of the other indices have extreme returns for the

month. A positive and significant coefficient on this variable indicates contagion within the hedge fund

sector. Figure 2 shows the COUNT variable over time. As expected, COUNT is at its maximum at the

time of the Long Term Capital crisis and at the start of the more recent subprime crisis. Finally, our tests

are robust to including separately the returns and indicator variables for the other hedge fund indices

(rather than our more parsimonious approach which aggregates this data.)

    Results are presented in Table II. Focusing first on the continuous variables, there are no distinctive

patterns in the coefficients on equities, bonds, or currencies, indicating no consistent relationship between

10% tail returns in hedge funds and the performance of broad markets. The coefficients on the equally-

weighted hedge fund index are also insignificant.       For the indicator variables, the coefficients on the

main markets are mostly insignificant and yield inconsistent signs. Of the 24 indicator variables, 15 are




                                                     12
negative, of which three are statistically significant, and nine are positive, of which three are statistically

significant. These results provide no evidence of systematic contagion between the main markets and

hedge funds. By contrast, the results for the COUNT variable provide strong evidence of contagion

within the hedge fund industry. Seven of the eight coefficients on the COUNT variable are positive and

of these seven, six are statistically significant at least at the 10% probability level. Importantly, this

evidence is obtained when controlling for the equally-weighted returns of the other hedge fund styles

indices, so that we fully allow correlation to play its role.

     Since Fung and Hsieh (1997), it is well-known that hedge funds pursue strategies with highly non-

linear payoffs.15   It could therefore be the case that strategies with non-linear payoffs explain the

occurrence of extreme returns for hedge fund styles, and that the contagion we find is simply due to the

fact that non-linear strategies employed by hedge funds have correlated payoffs when the underlying

assets have extreme returns. In this case, the trading strategies of hedge funds would explain the

contagion we observe. To control for these non-linearities, we follow Fung and Hsieh (2001 and 2004)

and control for additional risk factors using asset-based factors that are designed to mimic the returns of

certain types of hedge fund strategies. Five of these factors are from Fung and Hsieh (2001). These

factors are modeled as “Primitive Trend-Following Strategies” (PFTS), or “lookback straddles.” Simply

stated, a lookback straddle strategy assumes that an investor owns both a lookback call option, which

gives an investor the right to buy an asset at its lowest price over the life of the option and a lookback put

option, which gives an investor the right to sell an asset at its highest price over the life of the option.

Fung and Hsieh construct lookback straddles on bonds, currencies, commodities, short-term interest rates,

and equities. 16

     We also use three additional asset-based factors, as suggested by Fung and Hsieh (2004). These are a

size-spread factor, calculated as the Wilshire Small Cap 1750 minus Wilshire Large Cap 750 monthly

return, a bond factor, calculated as the change in the 10-year treasury constant maturity yield from month-

end to month-end, and a credit spread factor, calculated as the change in the monthly spread of Moody's

Baa yield less the 10-year treasury constant maturity yield from month-end to month-end.17 Finally,

because it is likely that volatility in the main market indices we use could be related to extreme returns in

our dependent variables, we include a measure of monthly volatility extracted from the univariate

GARCH models for each of the main market factors used in Table II. We also include the return on the

3-month Treasury bill, and the negative portion of the S&P index return to proxy for a put option.

     Table III adds these factors to the regressions from Table II. A problem that occurs with the inclusion

of these additional factors is that the regressions sometimes fail to converge due to quasi-separability.

Quasi-separation is not an uncommon problem in applications of discrete dependent variable models and

is more likely to occur in settings with discrete explanatory variables, particularly in samples that are

small relative to the number of explanatory variables. The issue is that if quasi-separation occurs, the

maximum likelihood estimation procedure gives non-unique infinite parameter estimates with an

unbounded dispersion matrix.18

     Therefore, to test our hypotheses and control for these additional factors, we use a stepwise regression

approach for each of the eight style regressions. Starting with the null model containing only the constant

term, successive models are created, each using one more regressor than the prior model. The potential

regressors are selected from the list of all explanatory variables excluding the COUNT variable. To

choose which regressor to add to the model in this “forward step”, each of the potential regressors is

tested by separately including it in the current model. The regressor with the largest impact (based on a

Lagrange multiplier test) is then included. After this new regressor is added, the statistical significance

of each of the explanatory variables currently in the model is evaluated by calculating a Wald test for each

of them. If a variable does not meet a (conservative) significance threshold p-value of 0.2 for the Wald

   Quasi-separation occurs if there exists a parameter vector in the logit regression model that “almost” perfectly
describes the binary response variable. Hence, in the maximization procedure, the log likelihood function value
diminishes to a non-zero constant. For a concise exposition on quasi-separation see Albert and Anderson (1984).




                                                         14
test, the variable is removed. This “backward step” elimination process is repeated until all explanatory

variables remaining in the model have a (Wald test) level of significance of at least 0.2. This iterative

forward and backward procedure is then repeated for each potential regressor not yet included in the

model. The process terminates if no further regressor can be added to the model, or if the regressor just

entered into the model is the only regressor removed in the subsequent backward elimination.

    The main benefit from this procedure is that quasi-separation is not an issue since the process starts

with the null model. Further, for each hedge fund style, it produces a parsimonious model containing the

most relevant explanatory variables for that style. After we have identified the “best” model for each

style, we then include the COUNT variable. Thus, although the explanatory variables, carefully chosen

through the stepwise process, are different for each of the eight hedge fund indices, we include the

COUNT variable in all eight regressions so that we may test for contagion.

    The results of Table III indicate that, despite the addition of many control variables to our regressions,

all the coefficients on the COUNT variable are positive, and 5 of 8 are statistically significant at the 10%

level or better, so that we still have strong evidence of contagion across hedge fund styles. Further, our

conclusion that there is no systematic evidence of contagion between main markets and hedge fund styles

does not change.

    We now evaluate the economic significance of this contagion. The average return of a particular style

is strongly related to the number of other styles that experience extremely poor returns. The difference in

average returns for each style index when all other styles experience an extreme negative return compared

to the average return when none of the other styles experiences an extreme return ranges from –1.80% to -

7.15%. Using the estimates of Table III, and setting all the explanatory variables at their means except

for COUNT, the average (median) probability that a style index has a return in the lower 10% tail

increases from 1.77% (1.49%) to 20.90% (18.04%) as COUNT increases from zero to seven. This result

is shown graphically, by index, in Figure 3. This Figure shows the probability of an extreme return for

each hedge fund style index as the COUNT variable increases from zero to seven. The probability of an

extreme return increases for all style indices as the COUNT variable increases. The increase is especially




                                                     15
dramatic for the Distressed Securities, Equity Hedge, Equity Market Neutral, and the Global Macro

styles. It is smaller for the Convertible Arbitrage, the Event Driven, the Merger Arbitrage, and the

Relative Value styles.

    Since we use hedge fund index data, a concern with our results is that hedge funds are misclassified in

indices. In this case, we would find that performance of indices is similar because some hedge funds

pursue the same strategies even though they are classified into different styles. However, while this

explanation could lead to an increase in correlations across hedge fund indices, there is no reason to

believe that this problem would cause contagion. In addition, as noted earlier, we repeat all our analyses

using the CSFB/Tremont hedge fund indices. The results are consistent with those obtained using the

HFR database. Hence, we reject this explanation.

    In this section, we find no consistent evidence of contagion between hedge funds and the main

markets, but significant evidence of contagion between hedge fund styles. In the next section, we

investigate possible channels through which this contagion takes place.



III. Contagion Channels

        Why would the poor performance of a hedge fund style affect adversely the performance of

another, different, hedge fund style? Why would hedge fund styles experience poor returns

simultaneously which cannot be explained by correlations across hedge fund styles? We discussed in the

introduction the role of liquidations for multi-strategy funds emphasized by Khandani and Lo (2007), as

well as the roles of funding and asset liquidity. In this section, we explore how funding and asset liquidity

affect hedge fund contagion. Funding liquidity refers to the ease with which a trader can obtain funding.

If funding liquidity shrinks, levered hedge funds have to reduce their leverage. As hedge funds reduce

leverage, they provide less liquidity to the markets. As a consequence, these reductions in leverage

adversely affect the prices of the assets they sell because the hedge fund sector is providing less liquidity.

As prices fall because of price pressure, hedge funds have to liquidate more assets because of mark-to-




                                                     16
market losses. These losses lead to more liquidations, which put more pressure on prices. This view of

mechanisms of contagion follows directly from Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2008).

     We now consider why losses in one hedge fund style could lead to a reduction in funding liquidity

and hence lead to losses in other hedge fund styles. For a reduction in funding liquidity to take place, it

must be that the losses in one hedge fund style either affect directly the providers of funding to hedge

funds and/or affect the willingness of these providers to lend to hedge funds. The main providers of

funding to hedge funds are their prime brokers. Hedge fund losses in one style can lead to losses for

prime brokers for at least two reasons. First, prime brokers, like banks more generally, pursue proprietary

trading strategies similar to those pursued by hedge funds. Chan, Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2005)

emphasize this phenomenon in the context of banks and use it to explain the nonlinear dependence

between hedge fund returns and bank returns that they observe. Sometimes, therefore, one would expect

prime brokers to have implemented the same trades as those that led to hedge fund losses.19 Second,

losses by hedge funds can become losses for prime brokers both because hedge funds are debtors of prime

brokers (although this effect may be limited by extensive collateralization of trades), and because losses

by hedge funds that reduce their level of trading diminish the income of prime brokers. As prime brokers

suffer losses, they must decrease their lending, which leads to a contraction of funding liquidity for hedge

funds.

     We use several proxies to test the funding liquidity and asset liquidity channels of hedge fund

contagion. Our first proxy is a prime broker stock index (PBI). We expect large decreases in PBI to be

associated with a decrease of funding liquidity for hedge funds. The index consists of 11 prime brokerage

firms: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, UBS AG, Bank of America, Citigroup, Merrill

Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of New York Mellon. The first three

of these firms represent about 58% of the total prime brokerage industry based on a 2006 survey by



19
  An example of this channel is the loss of $480 million reported by Morgan Stanley from proprietary strategies in
August 2007 when quantitative hedge funds also experienced large losses. See “Quants’ tail of woes,” by Jayne
Jung, in Risk, October, 2008.

Lipper Hedge World.20 In addition, the remaining eight prime brokers are cited as dominant players in

the industry in several sources and also in discussions with industry participants.21 We construct an

equally-weighted index of the returns of the 11 brokers during the sample period. Some prime brokers

were not publicly traded for the entire period, so they are included for the dates for which stock prices

could be obtained. We used CRSP to gather the stock price data through 12/31/2006, and Yahoo!

Finance to gather the data for 2007. All returns are adjusted for splits and dividends.

     Our second proxy is the Datastream bank stock index (BANK). This index is an equally weighted

index of the stock returns of large banks provided by Datastream.           It includes primarily national

commercial and regional banks; the only companies common to both the Datastream index and the Prime

Broker Index are Bank of America and Citigroup. Since hedge funds use prime brokers as their primary

source of lending, and since prime broker trading desks employ hedge fund strategies, we expect the

prime broker index to be a better proxy for both asset and funding liquidity for hedge funds than the bank

index. In their study of risk contagion, Adrian and Brunnermeier (2008) use a more narrow investment

bank index consisting of Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns and Lehman

Brothers and show that certain hedge fund styles predict an increase in value-at-risk in the investment

banking sector. By contrast, we focus on the impact that poor performance among prime brokers (as a

proxy for funding and asset liquidity) has on poor performance in hedge funds. As noted earlier, Chan,

Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2005) use a more broad-based bank index consisting of the monthly return of

an equally weighted portfolio of bank stocks in CRSP, but do not allow for a nonlinear effect of bank

returns. Thus, their banking index includes prime brokers, commercial banks, and other banks. When

banks perform poorly, they provide less credit, some of which goes to hedge funds. We therefore expect

funding liquidity for hedge funds to worsen as banks perform poorly.

     We also use two other proxies for funding liquidity. First, we use as a measure of tightness in the

credit market the BAA-AAA credit spread. Second, we use the volume in the repo market. Low volume

in the repo market could indicate a reduction in funding liquidity; for example, Kambhu (2006) finds a

relationship between hedge fund distress and low repo market volume, and Adrian and Fleming (2005)

argue that while not perfect, net repo volume reflects dealer leverage. Volume in the repo market is the

difference between overnight repo and reverse overnight repo volume.22 This variable is available only at

the weekly frequency. We average the weekly observations for each month to get a monthly net volume

measure, and then calculate the relative change in that measure to use as our independent variable.

     As discussed in the introduction, liquidations by hedge funds will have a larger impact on hedge

funds when asset liquidity is low. As hedge funds must sell holdings, they will liquidate even more assets

if markets are illiquid because the liquidations push the asset prices down. We employ as a proxy for asset

liquidity the liquidity measure of Amihud (2002).23 This variable measures the daily price response

associated with one dollar of trading volume, and serves as a rough measure of price impact. Although

this measure is calculated for the stock market, the literature suggests that reduced liquidity in the stock

market is associated with reduced liquidity in other markets.24 Asset liquidity can also be a channel of

contagion because hedge funds often provide liquidity to the markets. As these hedge funds perform

poorly, their difficulties lead to a withdrawal of liquidity from the markets, leading other hedge funds to

decrease their positions because of the decrease in liquidity and to experience mark-to-market losses

because of price pressure.



22
   We thank John Kambhu of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for providing the data.
23
   Amihud’s (2002) measure is calculated as follows: For each ordinary common stock on CRSP with listing on
NYSE and positive share volume we calculate a daily measure of Absolute return/dollar volume from January 1,
1989 to December 31, 2007. We then calculate a monthly raw market-wide liquidity measure as the market cap
weighted average of all individual daily measures but exclude the top and bottom 1% following Amihud (2002) to
remove outliers. Then we normalize the raw measure as in Acharya and Pedersen (2005) by multiplying it by the
lagged ratio of CRSP market cap/CRSP market cap at December, 1989 to create a stationary series, and from this
series we calculate the relative change in market wide liquidity. Finally, we control for the impact of changes in the
tick-size when the NYSE switched from 1/8 to 1/16 on June 24, 1997 and from 1/16 to $0.01 on January 29, 2001
and use as our final measure of the change in market-wide liquidity the residuals from a regression of the change in
liquidity on the two tick-size change dummy variables.
24
   See, for example, Chordia, Sarkar, and Subramanyam (2005).




                                                         19
     Finally, hedge fund outflows are used as a channel of contagion. If poor performance of hedge funds

leads investors to request withdrawal of their funds, we expect that the hedge funds will liquidate assets in

anticipation of withdrawals. These liquidations would lead to price pressure and mark-to-market losses if

they are substantial. Since we do not have access to the HFR individual fund database, we calculate

monthly net fund flows for hedge fund styles using the CSFB/Tremont hedge fund database for the entire

period. These net fund flows are calculated for each hedge fund separately, and aggregated by fund style.

We then calculate the monthly percentage change in net fund flows for the entire style index.25 We

consider both contemporaneous and one month ahead net fund flows. Typically, hedge funds do not allow

investors to redeem within a month, so that next month’s flows may contain redemptions requested

during the current month. The obvious difficulty with interpreting flow variables is that large net outflows

may result from poor returns.

     Thus, we have six measures proxying for contagion channels: a prime broker index (PBI), and bank

index (BANK), Amihud’s (2002) illiquidity measure (STKLIQ), a credit spread index (CRSPRD), a

measure of changes in repo volume (REPO), and contemporaneous and one month ahead net flows

(FLOWt and FLOWt+1) (where t stands for time in months).26 Table IV presents summary statistics for

these variables. For all variables, the number of observations is 212, the same as for the hedge fund

indices, with the exception of the percent change in repo volume, which is only available since August

1994, for 157 observations.        Most variables have significant dispersion between the 25th and 75th

percentiles, and all variables have excess kurtosis. The correlations between the variables are generally

low or even negative, with the exception of the correlation between the prime broker index and the bank

index, which is 0.82. This correlation is not too surprising, since all the firms in these indices are in the



25
   The matching process from the CSFB/Tremont database to the HFR style indices is not one-to-one, due to
different methodologies for classifying styles. To overcome this issue, we read the style descriptions from both
CSFB/Tremont and HFR and use judgment to match as closely as possible. Additionally, as noted earlier, the
CSFB/Tremont database has survivorship bias problems prior to 1994. However, we expect that this bias would
cause aggregate outflows to be understated, not overstated, and thus, is a conservative measure of true fund
outflows.
26
   We also use first difference in the repo spread over the 3 month T-bill rate and find similar results. Further, we
separately use TED spreads as a measure of illiquidity and find that it does not provide explanatory power.

financial services industry. However, our results below indicate that there are important differences in the

explanatory power of these two indices.

    Our first tests are presented in Table V. Here, we create a new contagion variable COUNT8 that

ranges in value from zero to eight. It is set to zero if no hedge fund index has a 10% tail return during a

month, one if one hedge fund index has a 10% tail return during a month, and so on, up to a maximum

value of eight when all eight hedge fund indices have an extreme negative return. In addition, we create

liquidity proxy dummy variables for each of the proxies, set to one if the proxy variable has a realization

in the lowest decile of liquidity and zero otherwise. Hence, PBI, FLOWt , FLOWt+1, BANK, and REPO are

set to one if their realizations are in the bottom 10% of all respective values, and STKLIQ and CRSPRD

are set to one if their realizations are in the top 10% of all respective values. We calculate the mean value

of the COUNT8 variable conditional on the realization (zero or one) of each liquidity proxy dummy

variable, and perform t-tests for differences in means. A higher average for COUNT8 when the liquidity

dummy variable is one implies that more hedge funds styles perform poorly when liquidity is low, i.e.,

contagion is exacerbated when that measure of liquidity is low.

    The results in Table V indicate that three liquidity proxies, PBI, BANK, and STKLIQ, are strongly

related to contagion. The results are consistent with the predictions of Brunnermeier and Pedersen’s

(2008) model of funding and asset liquidity crises. For example, when PBI returns are in the bottom

decile, an average of almost three hedge funds have extremely poor realizations in returns, compared to

0.59 hedge funds when PBI returns are not in the bottom decile. The other liquidity proxies are less

helpful in predicting COUNT8. As further evidence of the importance of asset and funding liquidity, the

COUNT8 variable has a mean of 4.33 in the joint presence of poor asset liquidity (in the form of a top

decile value of Amihud’s measure) and of poor funding liquidity (in the form of a bottom decile value of

the prime broker index return), and 0.70 otherwise. This evidence shows that hedge fund styles perform

poorly when both funding liquidity and asset liquidity are poor at the same time, confirming the

individual importance of these contagion channels.




                                                     21
III.2. The Poisson regression approach

     The univariate results for the COUNT8 variable, though striking, could be explained by correlation

rather than by contagion, since we do not control for other risk factors. In this section, we use a Poisson

regression model to show that this is not the case. This model is a generalized linear model with a "log"

link function and Poisson distributed errors.27 The model attributes to a count response variable Y a

Poisson distribution whose expected value depends on predictor variables x in the following way: logE[Yt

| xt] = βxt where xt is a vector of regressors during a given time period t, and Yt is the observed event count

(COUNT8) during the time period t.

     If Y are independent observations with corresponding values x of the predictor variable, then β can

be estimated by maximum likelihood if the number of distinct x values is at least 2. The Poisson

regression is particularly appropriate when analyzing “count” data for rare events that occur during a

period of time t, and thus, is appropriate for our study as the contagion events we model are rare events by

construction. Some other benefits of using the Poisson regression are that it handles the integer property

of observed event counts directly and works well when the number of possible outcomes is small, both of

which apply to our data.28

     To examine the impact that the contagion channel variables have on hedge fund contagion,

continuous and indicator measures of the six liquidity proxy variables are separately included in the

regressions with COUNT8 as the dependent variable (for the FLOW proxy, both contemporaneous and

next-month flows are included). The liquidity dummy variables for each of the proxies are set to one if

the proxy variable has a realization in the lowest quartile of liquidity and zero otherwise. Note that this


27
   We thank Bill Greene for suggesting the Poisson model. Much of the following discussion follows Hausman,
Hall, and Griliches (1984).
28
   The Poisson regression has been used occasionally in finance applications; some examples include Hausmann,
Hall, and Griliches (1984) who apply Poisson regressions to analyze the relationship between R&D and patent
applications, and Hermalin and Weisbach (1988) and Lerner (1995), both of whom use a Poisson regression to
model the addition and departure of board members after CEO turnover.




                                                      22
differs from the analysis in Table V, where the indicator variables use decile realizations. Using decile

indicator variables in the multivariate setting creates multicollinearity problems in the regressions, so we

must resort to using quartile indicator variables for these tests. A positive and significant coefficient on

the contagion channel variable indicates that variable is associated with increased hedge fund contagion.

Finally, all the control variables from Table III are included in the regressions, but are not reported for

brevity.

    The basic Poisson probability specification is:

                                                       e − exp( βxt ) exp( β i xt ) nt
                                Pr (Yt = nt | xt ) =                                            (1)
                                                                      nt !

In our monthly analysis, Y is COUNT8, t the month, and nt ∈ {0, … ,8} based on the realization of the

COUNT8 variable during month t. The mean value of Y, exp(βxt), depends on a vector of explanatory

variables xt, where the exponential function guarantees non-negativity. Maximum likelihood with a log-

likelihood function is used to estimate the model, and our goodness of fit measure is McFadden’s (1974)

pseudo-R2.

    Results are presented in Table VI. Following McCullagh (1983) and McCullagh and Nelder (1989),

we allow for overdispersion to overcome the shortcoming that the mean and variance in the standard

Poisson approach must be the same, and estimate the parameters and standard errors using a quasi-

likelihood function framework. All variables except the indicator variables have been standardized using

an AR-GARCH process to remove autocorrelation and volatility clustering.

    There are seven regression specifications; the first six include the liquidity proxies separately, while

the final specification includes all the proxies. Because the contagion channel dummy variables are set to

one when markets are illiquid, a positive and significant coefficient on the dummy variable indicates that

this variable increases the likelihood of contagion within the hedge fund industry. The results of Table

VI indicate that four of the liquidity proxies: PBI, STKLIQ, FLOWt+1, and CRSPRD are statistically

significant in explaining contagion within the hedge fund industry. Both PBI and STKLIQ are statistically

significant at the 1% level, FLOWt+1 is significant at the 5% level, and CRSPRD is significant at the 6%

level. These results are generally consistent with the univariate tests in Table V with the exception that

once the additional control variable are included, the BANK index is no longer significant in explaining

contagion. In addition, the multivariate results for FLOWt+1 and CRSPRD are stronger than for the

univariate results. These consistent results indicate that the same proxy variables are relevant, whether

we use a 10% or 25% cutoff for illiquidity.

    The regression that includes all the liquidity proxy variables indicates that the most significant proxy

is asset liquidity, as proxied by STKLIQ, followed by funding liquidity, as proxied by PBI. CRSPRD and

FLOWt+1 are no longer significant at traditional levels when all six proxies are included (although both

are significant at about the 11% level). Taken together, the results from Tables V and VI are strongly

consistent with the “phase locking” behavior described by Chan, Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2005) and the

liquidity spirals modeled by Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2008). Finally, as a robustness check, we repeat

these analyses using the CSFB/Tremont indices. These results are consistent with the results for the HFR

indices. Together, these results provide strong evidence that funding and asset liquidity are channels

through which contagion takes place.



IV. Contagion between Hedge Funds and Main Markets

        Thus far, we have documented the existence of contagion within the hedge fund industry and

explored the possible determinants of this contagion.       In addition, our tests found no evidence of

contagion between main markets and hedge fund styles (testing each hedge fund index separately).

However, we have not yet examined whether contagion within the hedge fund industry is associated with

extreme poor performance in the main markets. Establishing whether there is such a relation is important

to assess the systemic risk posed by contagion within the hedge fund sector.

        Using a logit regression approach, we investigate whether hedge fund contagion is associated

with poor performance in the main markets. For each of the three main markets: stocks, bonds, and

currencies, we perform regressions where the dependent variable is an indicator variable set to one if that

market has an extreme negative return (10% tail event) and zero otherwise. The explanatory variables




                                                    24
include the return on the 3-month T-bill, a measure of volatility on each of the main markets (as described

in Section II), the continuous return on each of the three main markets, the equally-weighted return on the

eight hedge fund indices, and the COUNT8 variable (described in Section III). A positive and significant

coefficient on the COUNT8 variable indicates that hedge fund contagion is associated with poor

performance in the main market index being tested.

        Table VII presents results. There is no evidence of an association between hedge fund contagion

and poor performance in either the stock or bond markets. However, there is strong evidence of a

relationship for the currency market. Such an association could occur because of the importance of carry

trades as a mechanism of financing for hedge funds. As emphasized by Plantain and Shin (2008), hedge

funds can directly borrow in low interest rate currencies or indirectly borrow from banks that in turn

finance themselves in low interest rate currencies.

        We perform additional analyses in Table VIII. In these tests, we include all the explanatory

variables from Table VII, and separately add the contagion channel variables from Table VI.           We are

interested in two questions: First, does including the contagion channel variables change our result that

hedge fund contagion is associated with poor performance in the currency market? And second, do the

contagion channel variables provide explanatory power for extreme returns in the main markets? Results

in Table VIII indicate that the answer to the first question is negative. Regardless of the contagion

channel variable included, the evidence of an association between hedge fund contagion and poor

performance of the currency market remains. For the second question, there is some evidence that the

contagion channel variables help to explain extreme poor performance in bond and currency markets.

        For the bond market, poor returns in the bank index (BANK) are associated with poor returns in

the bond index. This result is probably related to the fact that banks’ assets typically have longer durations

than their liabilities, so that they suffer from unexpected interest rate increases which also affect the bond

index adversely. For the currency market, asset illiquidity (STKLIQ) is associated with poor returns in the

currency market. This result implies a connection between stock market liquidity and performance of the

currency market.




                                                      25
        Finally, as a robustness check, we repeat these analyses using the CSFB/Tremont indices. These

results are consistent with the results for the HFR indices; there is no correlation between hedge fund

contagion and poor performance in the stock and bond markets, but such association exists with currency

markets.



V. Implications and Conclusions

    In this paper, we use logit and Poisson regression models to study contagion within the hedge fund

industry as well as between hedge funds and the main markets. Specifically, we examine the co-incidence

of extreme poor returns between hedge fund indices and broad markets, and also between hedge fund

indices, taking carefully into account the known determinants of hedge fund returns.

    We find no systematic evidence of contagion between broad markets and individual hedge fund styles

after accounting for correlation between market factors and hedge fund returns. By contrast, we find

extremely strong and consistent evidence of contagion between hedge fund styles. Importantly, our

evidence of hedge fund style contagion is economically significant since the probability that a hedge fund

style will have a negative tail return is an order of magnitude higher when several other hedge fund styles

have negative tail returns.

    We investigate the channels through which contagion takes place. The framework of Brunnermeier

and Pedersen (2008) provides a roadmap for this investigation. The idea is that poor hedge fund

performance in one style can weaken the financial intermediaries that provide credit to hedge funds and

hence lead to a reduction in the credit extended to hedge funds and an increase in the cost of the credit

extended, so that hedge funds in other styles have to reduce their leverage and liquidate assets. The hedge

funds in these styles are hurt by the price impact effect of the asset liquidations, which forces them to

liquidate more assets. Liquidations of hedge funds withdraw liquidity from the main markets, leading to a

reduction in asset liquidity, which worsens the impact of asset liquidations and increases the mark-to-

market losses of hedge funds, forcing them to liquidate more assets because of increased funding

constraints. We use proxies for funding liquidity and asset liquidity to investigate the channels through




                                                    26
which hedge fund contagion takes place. Our strongest contagion channels are the prime broker channel

and the stock market liquidity channel, showing that both funding liquidity and asset liquidity appear to

be important hedge fund contagion channels.

    Finally, we examine whether contagion in the hedge fund industry is associated with poor

performance in the main markets. We find no evidence that hedge fund contagion is associated with poor

performance in stock and bond markets, but significant evidence that it is associated with poor

performance in the currency markets. We view this evidence as consistent with the arguments advanced

for the importance of the carry trade for hedge fund funding and of how poor performance in hedge funds

can lead to unwinding of carry trades. However, further research exploring this mechanism more directly

is needed.

                 Table II: Contagion of extreme events for HFR monthly hedge fund indices

   The event of an extreme monthly negative return in each hedge fund style is separately modeled as the outcome of a binary
   variable and estimated as a Logit regression. A monthly return is classified as extreme and the dependent variable is set to
   1 if it belongs to the bottom 10% of all returns of that style. The independent variables are described in Section II.2. The
   market contagion variables are set to 1 if the market of interest has an extreme poor return (bottom 10%) for the month.
   The COUNT variable takes a value from 0 to 7 and measures the number of other hedge fund indices that have bottom 10%
   tail returns for the month. Below the coefficients are the t-values in parentheses. R2 MAX is the scaled coefficient of
   determination suggested by Nagelkerke (1991). Coefficients with ***, **, and * are statistically significant at the 1%, 5%,

        Table III: Contagion of Extreme Events for HFR Monthly Hedge Fund Indices Controlling for
                                       Non-linear and Other Factors

      The event of an extreme monthly negative return in each hedge fund style is separately modeled as the outcome of a binary variable and
      estimated as a Logit regression. A monthly return is classified as extreme and the dependent variable is set to 1 if it belongs to the
      bottom 10% of all returns of that style. The independent variables are described in Section II.2. The market contagion variables are set to
      1 if the market of interest has an extreme poor return (bottom 10%) for the month. The COUNT variable takes a value from 0 to 7 and
      measures the number of other hedge fund indices that have bottom 10% tail returns for the month. A stepwise regression is used to
      generate a parsimonious model before COUNT is added. See Section II.2 for more detail. Below the coefficients are the t-values in
      parentheses. R2 MAX is the scaled coefficient of determination suggested by Nagelkerke (1991). Coefficients with ***, **, and * are
      statistically significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Summary statistics for monthly data on six funding and asset liquidity variables used in the paper are described below. The variables include: the monthly percent change in the BAA-AAA rated
bond credit spread, the percent change in the Amihud (2002) liquidity measure, the monthly percent change in repo volume, the monthly percent change in hedge fund flows as a percentage of assets
(contemporaneous), the monthly returns from the Datastream bank index, and the monthly returns from the prime broker index. Further description of these variables is in Section III. The number of
observations is 212. Correlations between the variables are reported below the summary statistics. Bold correlation results indicate significance at the 5% level.

                              Table V: Conditional Means of COUNT8 Variable

For each liquidity indicator variable (Prime Broker Index (PBI), Datastream Bank Index (BANK), Amihud’s Liquidity
Measure (STKLIQ), BAA-AAA Credit Spread (CRSPRD), Changes in Repo Volume (REPO), and flows from other hedge
funds, both contemporaneous and one month forward (FLOWt and FLOWt+1)), we calculate means of the COUNT8
contagion variable at both realizations (0 and 1) of the indicator variable. See Section IV for detail on the construction of
the liquidity indicator variables. A value of 1 in an indicator variable implies a high level of illiquidity. The value of
COUNT8 ranges from 0 to 8. It is set to 0 if no hedge fund index has a 10% negative tail return on a given date, 1 if one
hedge fund index has a negative return, and so on up to a value of 8. t-tests for differences in means, using the
Satterthwaite method to adjust for unequal variance, are reported in italics. Differences in means with ***, **, and * are
statistically significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

                              Table VI: Contagion Regressions Including Liquidity Proxies

The co-occurrence of extreme monthly negative returns in hedge fund style indices is modeled as the outcome of a variable
(COUNT8) that takes the values of 0 to 8 and is estimated as a Poisson regression. A value of 0 indicates that no hedge fund
style index has an extreme negative return during a given month, a value of 1 indicates that 1 hedge fund style index has an
extreme negative return during a given month, and so on up to a maximum value of 8. A monthly return is classified as extreme
if it belongs to the bottom 10% of all returns of that style. The independent control variables are described in Section II.2, and
include all the variables in Table III, and are excluded below for brevity. In addition, the regressions also include the continuous
and indicator values for the liquidity variables, Prime Broker Index (PBI), Bank Index (BANK), Amihud’s (2002) Liquidity
Measure (STKLIQ), BAA-AAA Credit Spread (CRSPRD), Changes in Repo Volume (REPO), and flows from other hedge
funds, both contemporaneous and one month in the future (FLOWt and FLOWt+1). The liquidity indicator variables are set to 1
when liquidity is in the lowest quartile. t-values are shown below the coefficients in parentheses. The pseudo R2 is McFadden's
likelihood ratio index. Coefficients with ***, **, and * are statistically significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

The event of an extreme monthly negative return in a main market (stock, bond, and currency) is
separately modeled as the outcome of a binary variable and estimated as a Logit regression. A
monthly return is classified as extreme and the dependent variable is set to 1 if it belongs to the bottom
10% of all returns of that style. The independent variables are described in Section III. The COUNT8
variable takes a value from 0 to 8 and measures the number of hedge fund indices that have bottom
10% tail returns for the month. Below the coefficients are the t-values in parentheses. R2 MAX is the
                                                                                         *** **

            Table VIII: Channel Variables and Contagion of Extreme Events from Hedge Funds to Main
                                                   Markets
The event of an extreme monthly negative return in a main market (stock, bond, and currency) is separately modeled as the outcome of a
binary variable and estimated as a Logit regression. A monthly return is classified as extreme and the dependent variable is set to 1 if it
belongs to the bottom 10% of all returns of that style. The independent variables are described in Section III. The COUNT8 variable takes a
value from 0 to 8 and measures the number of hedge fund indices that have bottom 10% tail returns for the month. In addition, the
regressions also include the continuous and indicator values for the liquidity variables, Prime Broker Index (PBI), Bank Index (BANK),
Amihud’s (2002) Liquidity Measure (STKLIQ), BAA-AAA Credit Spread (CRSPRD), Changes in Repo Volume (REPO), and flows from
other hedge funds, both contemporaneous and one month in the future (FLOWt and FLOWt+1). The liquidity indicator variables are set to 1
when liquidity is in the lowest quartile. For brevity, only coefficients on the COUNT8 and liquidity variables are reported. t-values are
shown below the coefficients in parentheses. R2 MAX is a scaled coefficient of determination suggested by Nagelkerke (1991). Coefficients
with ***, **, and * are statistically significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

                                               Appendix A
This appendix contains descriptions of the eight hedge fund strategies included in the HFR hedge fund
indices. The source of these descriptions is Hedge Fund Research.

Convertible Arbitrage
Convertible Arbitrage involves taking long positions in convertible securities and hedging those positions
by selling short the underlying common stock. A manager will, in an effort to capitalize on relative
pricing inefficiencies, purchase long positions in convertible securities, generally convertible bonds,
convertible preferred stock or warrants, and hedge a portion of the equity risk by selling short the
underlying common stock. Timing may be linked to a specific event relative to the underlying company,
or a belief that a relative mispricing exists between the corresponding securities. Convertible securities
and warrants are priced as a function of the price of the underlying stock, expected future volatility of
returns, risk free interest rates, call provisions, supply and demand for specific issues and, in the case of
convertible bonds, the issue-specific corporate/Treasury yield spread. Thus, there is ample room for
relative misvaluations.

Distressed Securities
Distressed Securities managers invest in, and may sell short, the securities of companies where the
security's price has been, or is expected to be, affected by a distressed situation. Distressed Securities
managers invest primarily in securities and other obligations of companies that are encountering
significant financial or business difficulties, including companies which (i) may be engaged in debt
restructuring or other capital transactions of a similar nature while outside the jurisdiction of Federal
bankruptcy law, (ii) are subject to the provisions of Federal bankruptcy law or (iii) are experiencing poor
operating results as a result of unfavorable operating conditions, over-leveraged capital structure,
catastrophic events, extraordinary write-offs or special competitive or product obsolescence problems.
Managers will seek profit opportunities arising from inefficiencies in the market for such securities and
other obligations.

Negative events, and the subsequent announcement of a proposed restructuring or reorganization to
address the problem, may create a severe market imbalance as some holders attempt to sell their positions
at a time when few investors are willing to purchase the securities or other obligations of the troubled
company. If manager believes that a market imbalance exists and the securities and other obligations of
the troubled company may be purchased at prices below the value of such securities or other obligations
under a reorganization or liquidation analysis, the manager may purchase the securities or other
obligations of the company. Profits in this sector result from the market's lack of understanding of the true
value of the deeply discounted securities. Results are generally not dependent on the direction of the
markets, and have a low to moderate expected volatility.

Equity Hedge
Equity Hedge, also known as long/short equity, combines core long holdings of equities with short sales
of stock or stock index options. Equity hedge portfolios may be anywhere from net long to net short
depending on market conditions. Equity hedge managers generally increase net long exposure in bull
markets and decrease net long exposure or even are net short in a bear market. Generally, the short
exposure is intended to generate an ongoing positive return in addition to acting as a hedge against a
general stock market decline. Stock index put options are also often used as a hedge against market risk.
Profits are made when long positions appreciate and stocks sold short depreciate. Conversely, losses are
incurred when long positions depreciate and/or the value of stocks sold short appreciates. Equity hedge
managers' source of return is similar to that of traditional stock pickers on the upside, but they use short
selling and hedging to attempt to outperform the market on the downside.

Equity Market Neutral
"Equity market neutral" strategies strive to generate consistent returns in both up and down markets by
selecting positions with a total net exposure of zero. Trading Managers will hold a large number of long
equity positions and an equal, or close to equal, dollar amount of offsetting short positions for a total net
exposure close to zero. A zero net exposure is referred to as "dollar neutrality" and is a common
characteristic of all equity market neutral managers. By taking long and short positions in equal amounts,
the equity market neutral manager seeks to neutralize the effect that a systematic change will have on
values of the stock market as a whole.

Some, but not all, equity market neutral managers will extend the concept of neutrality to risk factors or
characteristics such as beta, industry, sector, investment style and market capitalization. In all equity
market neutral portfolios stocks expected to outperform the market are held long, and stocks expected to
under perform the market are sold short. Returns are derived from the long/short spread, or the amount by
which long positions outperform short positions.

Event Driven
Event Driven investment strategies or "corporate life cycle investing" involves investments in
opportunities created by significant transactional events, such as spin-offs, mergers and acquisitions,
industry consolidations, liquidations, reorganizations, bankruptcies, recapitalizations and share buybacks
and other extraordinary corporate transactions. Event Driven trading involves attempting to predict the
outcome of a particular transaction as well as the optimal time at which to commit capital to it. The
uncertainty about the outcome of these events creates investment opportunities for managers who can
correctly anticipate their outcomes. As such, Event Driven trading embraces merger arbitrage, distressed
securities, value-with-a-catalyst, and special situations investing.

Some Event Driven Trading managers will utilize a core strategy and others will opportunistically make
investments across the different types of events. Dedicated merger arbitrage and distressed securities
managers are not included in the Event Driven index. Instruments include long and short common and
preferred stocks, as well as debt securities, warrants, stubs, and options. Trading Managers may also
utilize derivatives such as index put options or put option spreads, to leverage returns and to hedge out
interest rate and/or market risk. The success or failure of this type of strategy usually depends on whether
the Trading Manager accurately predicts the outcome and timing of the transactional event. Event Driven
Trading Managers do not rely on market direction for results; however, major market declines, which
would cause transactions to be repriced or break, may have a negative impact on the strategy.

Macro
Macro strategies attempt to identify extreme price valuations in stock markets, interest rates, foreign
exchange rates and physical commodities, and make leveraged bets on the anticipated price movements in
these markets. To identify extreme price valuations, Trading Managers generally employ a top-down
global approach that concentrates on forecasting how global macroeconomic and political events affect
the valuations of financial instruments. These approaches may be systematic trend following models, or
discretionary. The strategy has a broad investment mandate, with the ability to hold positions in
practically any market with any instrument. Profits are made by correctly anticipating price movements in
global markets and having the flexibility to use any suitable investment approach to take advantage of
extreme price valuations. Trading Managers may use a focused approach or diversify across approaches.
Often, they will pursue a number of base strategies to augment their selective large directional bets.

Merger Arbitrage
Merger Arbitrage, also known as risk arbitrage, involves investing in securities of companies that are the
subject of some form of extraordinary corporate transaction, including acquisition or merger proposals,
exchange offers, cash tender offers and leveraged buy-outs. These transactions will generally involve the
exchange of securities for cash, other securities or a combination of cash and other securities. Typically, a
manager purchases the stock of a company being acquired or merging with another company, and sells
short the stock of the acquiring company. A manager engaged in merger arbitrage transactions will derive
profit (or loss) by realizing the price differential between the price of the securities purchased and the
value ultimately realized when the deal is consummated. The success of this strategy usually is dependent
upon the proposed merger, tender offer or exchange offer being consummated.

When a tender or exchange offer or a proposal for a merger is publicly announced, the offer price or the
value of the securities of the acquiring company to be received is typically greater than the current market
price of the securities of the target company. Normally, the stock of an acquisition target appreciates
while the acquiring company's stock decreases in value. If a manager determines that it is probable that
the transaction will be consummated, it may purchase shares of the target company and in most instances,
sell short the stock of the acquiring company. Managers may employ the use of equity options as a low-
risk alternative to the outright purchase or sale of common stock. Many managers will hedge against
market risk by purchasing S&P put options or put option spreads.

Relative Value Arbitrage
"Relative value arbitrage" is a multiple investment strategy approach. The overall emphasis is on making
"spread trades" which derive returns from the relationship between two related securities rather than from
the direction of the market. Generally, Trading Managers will take offsetting long and short positions in
similar or related securities when their values, which are mathematically or historically interrelated, are
temporarily distorted. Profits are derived when the skewed relationship between the securities returns to
normal. In addition, relative value managers will decide which relative value strategies offer the best
opportunities at any given time and weight that strategy accordingly in their overall portfolio. Relative
value strategies may include forms of fixed income arbitrage, including mortgage-backed arbitrage,
merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, pairs trading, options and warrants trading,
capital structure arbitrage, index rebalancing arbitrage and structured discount convertibles (which are
more commonly known as Regulation D securities) arbitrage.
