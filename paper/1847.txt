     This   paper describes the effects of deregulation on negotiated wage

rates and employment levels of aircraft mechanics in the scheduled

airline industry. Firm—specific data for the incumbent trunk airlines

show relatively small changes in real wage rates since deregulation,

and only recent increases in interfirm wage differentials. Employment

growth rates, on the other hand, have varied widely among the incum-

bents, and between the incumbent trunks and the local service and new—

entrant airlines. The data suggest that deregulation resulted in a

transfer of 5000—7000 maintenance jobs from the incumbent trunks to the

smaller airlines. This shift in employment reduced mechanics' earnings

in the industry by as much as 5 percent.

I. Introduction

     The recent experience of the airline industry provides a

remarkable case study for the analysis of wage and employment outcomes

under trade unions. Since passage of the Airline Deregulation Act in

1978, the industry has witnessed steady erosion in the relative output

of the incumbent trunk airlines, and steady increases in the relative

importance of new entrants and former local service carriers. These

changes have been associated with substantial reductions in employment

at the trunks, and widely publicized contract renegotiations, often

involving wage concessions or two-tiered wage schedules.

     This paper describes the impact of deregulation on the wage rates

and employment of airline mechanics at the former trunk airlines between

1978 and 1984.-" The analysis is necessarily preliminary since many of

the effects of deregulation are ongoing, and mechanics wages are estab-

lished in long term contracts that adjust slowly to external shocks.

Nevertheless, the experience of airline mechanics in the first six years

of deregulation yields a number of insights into the response of trade

unions to an increase in product market competition.

     Among the three major groups of skilled employees in the airline

industry (pilots, flight attendants, mechanics) airline mechanics are

atypical. First, their training and skills are relatively easily trans-

ferred out of the airline industry. Second, the services of mechanics

are relatively easily replaced: many airlines purchase all or part of

their maintenance services from outside contractors. Third. employment

conditions for many mechanics resemble those of industrial workers:

roughly one—half of airline mechanics work at maintenance depots on con-

ventional work schedules. For these reasons, however, airline mechanics
                                     —2—


are most similar to unionized workers elsewhere in the economy.       It is

natural, therefore, to look to the experiences of the mechanics in

attempting to draw general conclusions from the deregulatory experience

of the airline industry.


II. Wages and Employment of Airline Mechanics

        The data for this study consist of annual observations on employ—

ment, wages, and output at eleven of the largest airline firms in the

U.S.: American, Braniff, Continental. Delta, Eastern, Northwest, PanAm,

Transworld, United, USAir, and Western. Mechanics at seven of these

airlines are represented by the Machinists union (lAM). Mechanics at

American and PanAm are represented by the Transport Workers Union (TWU).

while mechanics at Western are represented by the Teamsters (IBT), and

mechanics at Delta are unorganized. The Machinists and Teamsters also

represent mechanics at several smaller airlines and contract maintenance

firms

        a. Wages

        Table 1 presents a wage chronology for ten incumbent trunk airlines

over the period 1968 to l985.' The table contains wage rates for cer-

tified mechanics at the signing date of each new contract. For compara--

tive purposes, the table also presents contract wage rates for certified

aircraft mechanics at Boeing, and average wage rates of maintenance

mechanics and production workers in manufacturing industries.

     A striking feature of the table is the uniformity across airlines

in mechanics' wage rates. This uniformity persisted through two rounds

of contract negotiations after 1978:       the 1978-79 round (in row 6 of
                                  -3—


Table 1), and the 1982—83 round (in row 7 of the Table). Very recently,

wage differentials have opened up in the industry, with significantly

lower wage rates at several of the financially—troubled airlines. Wage

rates at the financially-sound airlines have maintained the pattern of

equality established in the industry prior to deregulation.1

     Several explanations have been offered for the long delay between

passage of the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978 and the breakdown of

pattern wage bargaining for airline mechanics. On one hand, entry of

the new carriers and expansion of the former local-service airlines

occurred slowly after 1978. On the other hand, product market com-

petition and downward pressure on labor costs reached an unprecedented

level during the 1982 recession, when two of the incumbent trunks

(Braniff and Continental) underwent bankruptcy and all the trunks

incurred large operating losses.' Some observers have interpreted the

recent movement away from a uniform industry wage as a permanent struc-

tural change engendered by deregulation. Others have argued that

airline—specific wage concessions reflect the interaction of economic

conditions and a newly competitive product market structure, and that

improving economic conditions will renew pressure for uniform wages

among the carriers. At this stage, however, it is unclear whether wage

dispersion will persist, or whether the industry will return to a more

uniform wage structure.

     Further evidence on the distribution of wage rates within the sche-

duled airline industry is presented in Table 2.   This table presents

wage data for airline mechanics from BLS industry wage surveys conducted
                                    —4—


in 1970, 1975, 1980 and 1984. Average wage rates in the industry are

closely linked to the contract rates reported in Table 1. There is a

downward shift in the industry average wage rate relative to the

contractual rate at United Airlines after 1975. Wage dispersion within

the industry also increased in the most recent survey. The coefficient

of variation of wage rates, presented in the last column of Table 2,

doubled between 1980 and 1984. The 1984 wage distribution shows a small

concentration of wage rates some 20—40 percent below the industry mean

wage, whereas the earlier distributions are unimodal and highly con—

cent rated.

     Tables 1 and 2 also present evidence on time—series variability of

real and relative wage rates of airline mechanics. Outside of the

air transport industry ,   the aircraft and parts industry is a major

employer of aircraft mechanics. The wage chronology for mechanics at

Boeing suggests that wage rates have been very similar in the two indus-

tries. Relative wage rates between the aircraft assembly and scheduled

airline industries did not change between 1978 and 1983. The same con-

clusion emerges from a comparison of mechanics' wage rates and average

wage rates of maintenance mechanics or production workers in manufac-

turing. Relative to either rate, airline mechanics' wages have been

more or less constant since the 1969 round of contract negotiations.

Relative to the Consumer Price Index, airline mechanics' average wage

rates have been approximately constant since 1975.

     The similarity between contract provisions at the major airlines

extends to most aspects of compensation, including pensions, vacations,
                                     —5—


and health plans. In addition, the major airlines that have not nego-

tiated wage concessions since 1982 (American, Northwest, United, USAir)

have all introduced two—tiered wage schedules.V    Two—tiered schedules

have also recently spread among the smaller unionized carriers in the



     The pattern of the wage data in Table 1 contrasts sharply

with the pattern of the firm—specific employment data in Table 3.

While wages remained relatively constant across firms from 1966 to 1983,

employment growth varied substantially. Between 1970 and 1978, for

example, mechanics' employment fell about 10 percent at American,

Continental, and Transworld. while employment fell about 20 percent

at United. During the same period, employment grew or remained approxi-

mately constant at the other airlines. In spite of this variation

across firms in employment demand, airline mechanics were remarkably

successful in maintaining a homogeneous wage structure. There is no

indication that mechanics historically adjusted contractual wage rates in

response to firm—specific factors.

     The implication of this homogeneous industry wage structure is that

a firm—by—firm analysis of wage determination for airline mechanics is

likely to be misleading. Several authors have recently estimated models

in which unions determine wages at the firm level subject to the con-

straint imposed by the firms labor demand funct.ion.-0" While such a

model may turn out to be useful in describing post-1983 wage develop-

ments in the industry, it gives few insights into the homogeneous wage

structure that prevailed in the industry before 1983.

     b. Employment

     Table 3 summarizes employment levels and growth rates between 1970

and 1984 at 11 major airlines and in the industry as a whole. In

1970, the trunk airlines accounted for 93 percent of total industry

employment. Between 1970 and 1978, maintenance employment at the trunks

fell by about 12 percent. During the same period employment at the

local service airlines increased by 70 percent, causing the share of

employment at the trunks to fall to 87 percent in 1978. This trend per—

sisted after 1978, with some increase in the relative growth rate of

maintenance employment at the non-trunk airlines. In 1984, the incum--

bent trunks' share of industry employment was 80 percent.

     To place these trends in perspective, Table 4 provides an overview

of flight activity in the industry. The relative pattern of growth

rates in employment and output is similar, although industry output grew

during the last decade while employment fell. Consequently, measured

output per maintenance employee has increased. Much of this increase in

output per worker, particularly at the smaller airlines, is attributable

to changes in type of aircraft and route flown. Since 1978. the non—

trunk airlines have increased the length of their routes and size of

their aircraft, and in many cases have switched from turboprop to jet-

engine aircraft. These changes have been associated with rapid

increases in ton—miles and seat--miles per departure and per emp1oyee."

     Although output and employment shares of the incumbent trunks have

both declined sharply since 1970, the drop in output share occurred

after 1978 while the drop in employment share started earlier.   In 1984,
                                   —7.-




the trunks' employment share exceeded their output share by 6 percent.

In part this may reflect the contracting—out of maintenance services by

the smaller airlines—-often to the trunks themselves.- On balance,

however, the output and employment data suggest that most of the rela-

tive decline in maintenance employment at the trunks is attributable to

the decline in their relative output. This hypothesis is tested in the

next section using data from four major trunk airlines: American,

Eastern, Transworld, and United.


III. Changes in Productivity of Maintenance Employees

     Between 1978 and 1984, the combined output of the four largest

incumbent trunk airlines (American, Eastern, Transworld, and United)

increased by 14 percent. During the same period, their combined mainte-

nance employment fell 10 percent. Although some of this improved pro-

ductivity represents a longer—term trend, it is interesting to ask

whether deregulation contributed to the rate of' growth of maintenance

productivity at the incumbent airlines, Several recent changes asso-

ciated with deregulation may have lead to an increase in trend produc-

tivity growth after 1978. These include the shift toward hub-based

routing systems, which permit more centralized line service maintenance.

and negotiated changes in work rules and staffing requirements.

     In order to investigate the rate of growth of maintenance produc-

tivity, I fit a variety of employment functions for mechanics at the

four major trunks.— These functions express current maintenance

employment in terms of airline—specific constants and trends, as well as

lagged employment and current flight activity. The inclusion of lagged
                                  -8—


employment captures the idea that employment adjusts slowly to output

fluctuations. Flight activity is modelled in two alternative ways.      In

the first case. I represent airline output by departures, and control

for the composition of aircraft and routes by including measures of

seats per aircraft and flight length. In the second case, I control

for aircraft and route composition by including a measure of ton—miles

per departure. The latter specification permits maintenance employment

to depend on arbitrary combinations of output as measured by departures

or available ton—miles.

     A preliminary investigation revealed no systematic wage effects on

employment levels at the four airlines. In view of the stability of

real wage rates over time, however, and in the absence of data on prices

of substitutes for mechanics' services, it is not surprising that the

estimated wage effects are small and imprecise.   I therefore concentrate

on the link between employment and output, and changes in output per

worker over time.

     The estimated employment demand functions are presented in Table 5.

The employment functions are fitted as a four—equation seemingly—

unrelated regression, with equaUty restrictions on the coefficients of

lagged employment and output. Test results presented in row 7 of

Table 5 indicate substantial conformity with the hypothesis of constant

returns to scale in maintenance activities, after controlling for

partial—adjustment.--" This restriction is therefore imposed on the

estimated employment functions in Table 5.

     The first two columns of the table present employment functions
                                   -9—


with no allowance for changes in productivity growth after 1978. The

overall fit of the employment function is similar for the two speci-

fications, and there is no strong basis to choose between them. The

estimated coefficients suggest that a 10 percent increase in output

brings about a 6—7 percent increase in employment within the year, and

a proportional change in employment within three years.

     The implied decompositions of employment changes between 1978 and

1984 are presented in Table 6.   For each airline, two decompositions are

presented, depending on the choice of output specification. The decom-

positions show a declining demand for maintenance employment at all four

airlines attributable to secular productivity growth. The productivity

component is relatively large at United Airlines, and is roughly similar

between the two specifications for all the airlines except Transworld.

Productivity effect are partially offset by increases in the size of

aircraft and length of flight, or alternatively by increases in ton—

miles per departure. Changes in employment attributable to changes in

output are large and negative at Transworld and United, and relatively

small at American and Eastern.

     Columns (3) and (4) of Table 5 present employment functions that

permit airline—specific shifts in the rate of growth of maintenance pro-

ductivity after 1978. The trend shifts are imprecisely measured, and

the hypothesis that they are jointly equal to zero is easily accepted at

conventional significance 1evels.—' The estimates differ somewhat

between the two specifications, although they suggest that the largest

increase in trend productivity growth occurred at United. The point
                                  -10--



estimates of the change in productivity at United imply that maintenance

employment was approximately 20 percent lower in 1984 than it would have

been in the absence of a shift in trend, although the estimated cumula-

tive effect is imprecise, and insignificantly different from zero by

conventional standards)-" Apart from the distinction between secular

and post—1978 productivity trends, the decompositions of employment

changes associated with the specifications in columns (3) and (4) are

very similar to those presented in Table 6.

     Finally, the last two columns of Table 5 present employment func-

tions estimated under the hypothesis of a uniform shift in trend produc-

tivity growth at all four airlines. Again, the estimated trend shifts

are imprecise and differ somewhat depending on specification.

Controlling for flight length and aircraft size, the estimated shift in

productivity growth is .7 percent per year, implying a cumulative effect

in 1984 of about 6 percent. Controlling for ton-miles the estimated

shift is slightly larger, implying a cumulative effect of about 10 per-

cent in 1984. These estimates suggest that maintenance employment at

the four largest trunks in 1984 was 5--b percent lower than would have

been predicted on the basis of pre-deregulatory trends. Because of the

short time period since deregulation, however, it is difficult to obtain

a precise estimate of the trend change in 1978, and the data are statis-

tically consistent with no change in productivity growth rates.

     The estimates in Table 5 and the decompositions in Table 6 suggest

two conclusions. First, if deregulation has caused an increase in pro-

ductivity growth rates, the effect has been relatively small. Second,
                                   —11--



 the major components of employment change for the four largest trunk

 airlines are declining departure activity (for Transworld and United)

 and secular productivity growth. These effects have been partially off-

 set by increases in aircraft size and flight length, with relatively

 small net changes in employment at two of the trunks (American and

Eastern).

      On the basis of these conclusions, it is possible to estimate the

effect of deregulation on maintenance employment at the incumbent trunks

by calculating their relative output losses since 1978. Between 1978

and 1984, the growth rates of departures and ton—miles for the industry

as a whole exceeded their respective rates at the trunks by 17 and 18

percent. Assuming a unitary elasticity between employment and out-

put, as suggested by the estimates in Table 5, employment would have

been 15-20 percent higher at the trunks in 1984 if they had retained

their pre—deregulatory share of industry output. If, in addition,

deregulation increased the rate of growth of maintenance productivity as

suggested by the point estimates in Table 5, then employment would have

been at most 20-30 percent higher at the trunks in the absence of dere—

gulat ton

     Combining these estimates with an estimate of the wage gap between

the incumbent trunks and the smaller airlines yields an estimate of the

effect of deregulation on the earnings of mechanics in the airline

industry. Evidence from industry wage surveys and union contracts at the

smaller airlines suggests that the wage gap between the incumbent trunks

and other airlines is relatively small: perhaps no more than 25 percent.
                                  —12—


This gap is consistent with the difference between new—hire rates and

established rates in two-tiered contracts recently introduced at many of

the trunks, and with the magnitude of wage concessions recently negoti-

ated at several of the trunks.   It also represents the historical gap

between mechanics' wage rates at the incumbent trunks and average hourly

earnings of maintenance mechanics in manufacturing industries. Assuming

a maximum 25 percent wage differential, employment losses at the trunks

attributable to deregulation have reduced total earnings of maintenance

workers in the industry by approximately 5 percent.


Summary and Conclusions

     Deregulation of the airline industry has had a strong impact on the

level of flight activity and the profitability of the incumbent trunk

airlines.'' For airline mechanics at these airlines, however, the main

effect of deregulation has been to reduce employment. While contracts

at several of the trunks cut wages at the end of 1983, mechanics' real

and relative wage rates were remarkably stable in the first five years

of deregulation. Wage stability across firms and over time is consis-

tent with the behavior of mechanics' wages prior to deregulation. Data

from 1970 to 1978 indicate that wages were historically insensitive to

firm—specific employment conditions. This pattern persisted after 1978,

with only recent evidence of a breakdown in the homogeneous industry

wage structure.

     Reductions in maintenance employment at the incumbent trunks since

1978 can be attributed to several different factors including secular

productivity growth and changes in output. An analysis of the
                                  —13—


employment—output relationship reveals small but imprecisely measured

increases in the rate of growth of productivity following deregulation.

An analysis of output shares, on the other hand, reveals a 10 percentage

point drop in the share of flight activity at the incumbent trunks since

1978. This loss in output share is equivalent to a 15-20 percent reduc-

tion in maintenance employment at the incumbent trunks, or a transfer of

5000—7000 maintenance jobs from the incumbent trunks to the smaller

airlines. Because the wage gap between the incumbent trunks and the

other airlines in the industry is small, the effect of this transfer on

the earnings of mechanics in the industry is small——at most 5 percent.

     In contrast to this effect for airline mechanics, the affect of de-

regulation on pilots' earnings may have been 1arger.-2" Compared to

mechanics, however, historical differentials between pilots' earnings at

the incumbent trunks were relatively large. By the same token, pilots

have relatively few employment opportunities outside the airline

industry. This raises an important hypothesis for further research: is

the effect of product market deregulation on wages or earnings related

to the historical structure of wages in the industry or the gap between

wage rates for similar workers in other industries? The experience of

the airline mechanics suggests that the impact is small when inter—firm

and inter—industry wage differentials are small. More detailed com-

parisons between pilots, flight attendants, and mechanics could provide

useful evidence on this hypothesis.

     —"There is a growing literature on the effect of deregulation on

industrial relations in the airline industry. See in particular the

papers by Hendriks, Feuilie and Szerszen (1980), Northrup (1983), and

Capelli (1985). Cordes, Goldfarb and Johnson (1984) describe the likely

effect of job loss compensation provisions of the Airline Deregulation

Act. Bailey, Graham and Kaplan (1985) give an overview of deregula-

tion's effect on the industry as a whole.

     "Based on 1984 employment figures for 92 percent of maintenance

workers in the industry, the JAM represents 63 percent of airline mecha-

nics, the TWU represents 22 percent of mechanics, and the IBT represents

5 percent of mechanics.

Developments and the Bureau of National Affair's Daily Labor Report.

     'The pattern of wages in Table 1 extends to many of the smaller

unionized carriers in the industry. For example, the mechanics' wage

rate was 16.25 in September 1983 in the Ozark Airlines--Airline

Mechanics Fraternal Association contract; 15.91 in April 1983 in the

Piedmont Airlines—JAM contract; 15.59 in September 1983 in the Pacific

Southwest Airlines—IBT contract; and 15.91 in June 1983 in the

 Republic Airlines—lAM contract. Concessionary contracts were subse-

 quently signed at Pacific Southwest and Republic, while Ozark and

 Piedmont have retained wage parity with the more profitable trunk

 airlines.

        For the   economy as a whole, the 1982 recession was deeper but

 shorter-lived than the 1973-74 recession. In the airline industry,

 sales as measured by revenue passenger miles were more or less constant

between 1973 and 1975, and between 1980 and 1982 (compared with an

average annual growth rate of revenue passenger miles of 6.4 percent per

year over the 1971—84 period). Real average passenger fares fell about

5 percent between 1974 and 1975, and about 10 percent between 1981 and

1982.

        According to 1980 Census data, 52 percent of aircraft mechanics

are employed in the air transportation industry, of which roughly two-

thirds are employed in the certified airline industry. Some 20 percent

of aircraft mechanics are employed in the aircraft and parts industry,

while another 20 percent are employed in the military.

        The schedule at American Airlines, for example, provides approxi-

mately 25 percent lower discounted earnings for new hires during their

first 12 years with the firm than for incumbent workers with similar

qualifications. Two-tiered schedules were introduced in the February

1983 contract at American; in the July 1984 contract at United; in the

April 1985 contract at USAIr; and in the July 1985 contract at

Northwest.

     Two—tiered wage schedules were introduced in April 1982 at
                                    —16—


Piedmont; in June 1982 at Ozark; and in June 1983 at Repub].ic.

     The employment data in Table 3 is taken from Schedule P—lO of the

Form 41 reports filed by the airlines with the Civil Aeronautics Board.

The figures represent fourth quarter employment in 1970 and year—end

employment in 1978 and 1984 for maintenance and related workers. A com-

parison of maintenance employment with employment of mechanics and

inspectors recorded in the industry wage surveys suggests that some

70—80 percent of maintenance employees are mechanics or inspectors.

    "See for example Dertouzos and Pencavel (1981) or Pencavel (1984).

             example, Piedmont Airlines increased their available ton—

miles and available seat miles at a rate of approximately 28 percent per

year from 1978 to 1984. Over the same period, maintenance employment

and scheduled departures grew at only 8 percent per year. The increase

in capacity came from the replacement of turbo-prop aircraft by two—and

three—engine jet aircraft, and associated increases in seats per air-

craft (from 86 in 1978 to 126 in 1984) and flight length (from 181 miles

in 1978 to 347 miles in 1984).

    'Peop1es Express, for example, employs none of its own airline

mechanics.

             choice of the four major trunks is somewhat arbitrary. Most

of the other incumbent trunks were affected by mergers, forced reorgani-

zation. or prolonged strikes in the period 1970—84.

     Tests for coefficient equality were insignificant at 20 percent

               a first—order autoregressive model with a coefficient of A

on the lagged dependent variable, the effect of a change in trend of 5

percent at some reference period yields a cumulative effect of

5(t +    (t-l)A   +   (t-2)X2   +   ..       A1)    t periods later. Over a six year

interval, the cumulative effect is 7.26 if A = 0.2 and 85 if

A =    0.3.   A rough estimate of the standard error for the cumulative

effect can be obtained by multiplying the standard error of the esti-

mated trend shift (6) by the appropriate cumulative factor.

       --Industry scheduled departures were 50403000 in 1978 and 5616OOO

in 1984. Scheduled departures                at the 11 incumbent trunks were 3509000
in    1978 and 3195000 in 1984.

               example, Delta Airlines earned operating losses for the

first time in its history in 1982. Braniff, Continental, Eastern and

Western, which all earned positive operating profits from 1970 to 1978.

earned large operating losses from 1980—1983. By comparison, USAIr

earned significantly higher operating profits after 1978 than before.

     "According to BLS industry wage surveys administered in 1975,

1980, and 1984, average gross monthly earnings of captains and the

corresponding coefficients of variation of captains' earnings were $4314

and .15 in 1975; $6877 and .19 in 1980; and $8154 and .29 in 1984. In

1967 dollars, these average earnings levels were $2676 in 1975, $2786

in 1980, and $2621 in 1984.

Not e:   Regressions include unrestricted airline—specific constants, unrestricted airline—specifIc
         trends, and dummy variables for strikes at Transworld (1973) and United (1975, 1979).
         Coefficients on lagged employment, departures, and available ton-miles are restricted to be
         equal across airlines. The sum of the coefficients on lagged employment and departures is
         restricted to unity. The probability values of the test for this restriction are reported I
         row 7.
