Foreign Affiliate Sales and Trade in Both Goods and Services

JEL No. F1

                                              ABSTRACT

Because of the differing forms that international agreements on trade in goods and trade in services
take in the GATT (1994) and the GATS there is an incompatibility between measures of world trade
in goods and services. Measures of goods trade reflecting GATT (1994) are restricted to trade that
crosses borders. Service trade, however, under GATS mode 3 (commercial presence) includes both
cross border delivery and foreign affiliate sales within borders. As a result, present comparisons of
services and goods trade, as in WTO (2007), are unsatisfactory. One can further argue that our perceptions
of the degree of integration in the global economy are likely ill formed, and for comparability the trade
component of affiliate sales in goods should be included in goods trade or affiliate sales should be
removed from service trade data.

Here, we make modifications to reported goods and services trade for specific countries where this
is possible by using data on affiliate sales in both goods and services to produce more consistently
measured cross country estimates of trade flows. This allows us to compare combined total goods
and services trade both over time and across countries, as well as growth rates of trade, trade imbalances
and the relative size of trade in goods and services. We use three different statistical bases for measures.
One of them is the present mixed GATT and GATS basis; another is trade including foreign affiliate
sales, and a final one excludes foreign affiliate sales. Perceptions both on the combined size of country
goods and services trade as well as their relative size change a lot using these three measures. We finally
draw conclusions and offer policy implications.

1. Introduction

    As integration of global economy deepens and more cross border

multinational activity occurs, traditional cross-border trade statistics do not

fully capture all of the forms of trade involved. In the services area, this is

acknowledged to be the case for commercial presence service activities (for

example, banking services provided by, say, a U.S. owned bank in country X to

intermediate between residents of country X), but is also the case with goods

related activities (McDonalds may sell hamburgers in Germany using German

meat and buns, but uses US knowhow, branding and organization).

    In recent years, some international organizations (UNCTAD, WTO, IMF,

OECD, etc) and countries (US, Japan, Germany, UK, etc) have begun to focus

on foreign affiliate service activities, and they regularly collect and issue service

related statistics capturing these, called foreign affiliate trade statistics (FATS).

The FATS makes it possible to obtain a reasonably accurate picture of the

commercial presence component of trade in services. But one can argue that

trade in goods should also include a portion of foreign affiliate sales (FAS) as it

also forms part of goods trade similar to commercial presence in services.

Seemingly, accounting for commercial presence in services data but excluding it

from goods trade only reflects the difference between GATT (1994) for goods

and the GATS for services, not any meaningful economic logic.

   The paper explores both the statistical importance of FAS in both trade in

services and goods and how our perceptions of the role of trade in the world

                                          2
economy may be altered by different treatments of FAS. If the argument is

accepted that FAS should either be partially included in goods trade to achieve

consistency across the separate sets of goods and services trade data or

alternatively removed from services trade data, then adjustments to available

data are needed. Some countries’ services trade data (most notably U.S., Japan,

and Germany) already include both deliveries of services across borders and

sales by foreign affiliates from commercial presence. And data on FAS in goods

is available from information on foreign affiliate activity from the OECD

database. For consistent accounting and comparison of goods and service trade,

either commercial presence should be accounted for in goods trade data or

services data should have it removed.

   We use data for USA, Japan, Germany, Finland and Czech Republic only to

produce initial estimates of more consistent goods and services trade data. For

these countries, the underlying information needed is available for their

cross-border trade in both services and FAS, while for others it is not. We do not

label this as fully consistent goods and services as the basis for foreign affiliate

transactions differs between goods and services, but we suggest what we report

is more consistent data. In addition, we are able to use these data to assess how

perceptions of the role and size of trade in the world economy might be affected

by such adjustments. We focus on the size of country total trade in goods and

services, the growth rate of trade, trade imbalances and the relative size of trade

in goods and services.


                                         3
    We explore the implications for each of the use of different consistent

statistical measures using both the present mixed GATT and GATS basis, as

well as consistently including or excluding FAS in both goods and services trade.

We find that perceptions of the importance of trade in the dimensions above

using three different measures change sharply, as FAS have become an

important part of both trade in goods and services. If we either add or remove

foreign affiliate sales to traditional cross-border trade in both goods and services,

perceptions of the trade situation change substantially for each country. This

size of trade increases sharply, imbalances can change in sign, and growth rates

change.

    Earlier literature has noted the potential importance of foreign affiliate

sales in goods. This includes Zeile (1993), GAO (2005), Hausmann and Sturzenegger

(2006). However, outside of these papers, we find no other discussion of this issue,

and none which explores, as here, the use of data on commercial presence for

trade in goods in ways which mirror that in services.

    The paper is organized as follows. Part 2 discusses background to the

treatment of FAS in service and goods trade data. In part 3, we present our

procedures for calculating FAS trade data for the group of countries with

available data. Part 4 presents results for recalculations of country total trade,

the growth rate of trade, trade imbalances, and the relative size of goods and

services trade on different statistical bases. A final section offers our conclusions.

2. Foreign Affiliate Sales and Trade Statistics

    Traditionally, trade in goods is recorded as the physical movement of goods

across borders and import and export data on trade in goods are obtained from

customs clearance data. But for services, this treatment cannot capture all

modes of service delivery covered by the WTO General Agreement on Trade in

Services (GATS) since data on GATS mode 3(commercial presence) is missing

under such an approach. At present, for several countries commercial presence

trade in services via foreign affiliate sales data may or may not be included.

Importantly, it is included for such large economies as the US and Germany. The

result is the use of different bases both across goods and services and across

countries for the two sets of trade data. Data on the growth rates of goods and

services trade using current conventional measures are shown in Figures 1-3.

                           [Figures 1-3 around Here]

    It is the growth in both types of trade and the potentially distorted

perceptions that follow that makes this issue important. For many advanced

economies, services contribute more than 70% of GDP and employment (OECD,

2005b). Many developing countries are now embarked on a path of

industrialization with a growing role for services. This has been accompanied by

discussion of new trade liberalization in services and in 1994 the initiation of

GATS in the WTO. International trade has grown faster than global GDP in

recent decades. With this growth, service’s contribution to the global economy

has also grown.

                                       5
    Existing measures of trade in services are based on classifications used in

GATS and these involve four modes of service delivery, i.e., cross-border supply,

consumption abroad, commercial presence and presence of natural persons.

Table 1 reports the statistical coverage for the four GATS modes of services

trade. GATS treatment of services thus captures more trade related activities for

services than is true of GATT based measures of trade in goods.

    Statistics based on modes of service delivery pose challenges for data

collection and statistical methodology (Lipsey, 2006), and by extension, the

comparability of trade in goods and trade in services which we emphasize here.

Services are often regarded as different from goods and largely non-tradable and

having the characteristics of intangibility, non-storability, proximity and

simultaneity of production and consumption. But for core services (banking,

insurance, transportation, retailing, wholesaling), their intermediation role

across time, space, and risk is key.

                              [Table 1 around Here]

    An inter-agency task force headed by the UN statistics division with

participation for international organizations including OECD, IMF, UNCTAD,

WTO and Eurostat was formed in 2002 to meet the need for a more accurate

picture of the size of trade in services and published the “Manual of Statistics of

International Trade in Service” (UN, 2002 and 2010; Arkell, 2002). This manual

recommends that data on trade in services should include both “detailed

presentation of trade in services data on balance of payments basis”, and “the


                                         6
compilation of statistics covering the overall activities of overseas affiliates and

others”. The former lead to the adoption of separate EBOPS (Extended Balance

of Payments in Service) data for trade in services, and the latter to the separate

compilation of foreign affiliate trade statistics (FATS). The idea was that

EBOPS and FATS data could then cover almost all service delivery through the

four GATS modes.

    Foreign affiliate trade statistics (FATS) (also known as transnational

corporation (TNC) data) cover the service operations of foreign direct

investment-based enterprises. FATS data include sales, expenditures, profits,

value-added, exports and imports, employment and inter and intra firm trade.

Also, FATS is divided into an inward and outward component. Inward FATS

reflect the operations of foreign-owned firms (in the FDI sense, of a minimum of

10% of book value) in the local economy or country. Outward FATS reflect the

operations of firms abroad which are owned by a firm in the home-country

(owned in the FDI sense, of involving a minimum of 10% of book value). So far,

UNCTAD, OECD, EUROSTAT collect and publish FATS data. Progressively

more countries are publishing this data, including the US, Canada, Japan,

France, Germany, UK, Italy, and Finland.

    FATS data provide a basis for measuring commercial presence and hence

total trade in services. The justification of including FAS in service trade is

based partly on service features, but also because FDI is considered to be a

channel for the delivery of services (OECD, 2001 and 2005a; Eurostat, 2007).


                                         7
The argument is that the development of modern technology, especially

information and telecommunication technology, has weakened the claimed

distinguishing features of services since more and more services are becoming

tradable. Also, deregulation of cross border investment and the search for more

efficient use of global resources has spurred the growth of sales of goods through

relocated production. Foreign investment has thus become an alternative to

cross-border trade in the delivery of goods to consumers, especially for large

developed countries such as U.S. and Japan (GAO, 2005).

    Thus, in order to accurately assess the significance of trade in both goods

and services in the modern global economy one must seemingly inevitably

include some treatment of foreign affiliate trade in both portions of the trade

data. Present WTO GATT and GATS based procedures only produce FAS data

in services, which creates a statistical inconsistency when included in services

data. Ideally, trade in both goods and services should be collected either on a

conventional BOP basis or on a combined BOP and FATS basis. The presently

available combination of BOP goods and FATS services trade according to

GATS seems potentially misleading for comparative purposes insofar as trade in

goods is under reported.




                                        8
3. A Methodology for Calculating Both Cross-Border and FAS

Measures of Trade in Both Goods and Services

    To obtain data on FAS in goods trade, the natural approach is to mimic

services data. But even data on trade in services using EBOPS and FATS

encounter consistency problems. First, BOP data is based on a residency basis,

while FATS data is based on the location of direct investment. This difference

can cause miscalculation of trade in certain cases and can lead to

mismeasurement in overall service trade if EBOPS and FATS are simply

combined (Eurostat, 2007). Second, data on cross-border service flows are

classified by type of service, treating both sales and purchases alike, whereas

data on sales of services through affiliates are classified on the basis of primary

industry of affiliates, measuring only affiliates’ sales, but without their purchases.

Since it is difficult to collect data on specific types of services sold by affiliates

(thus far, these data have not been collected by any country), this can make

service-by-service comparisons between EBOPS and FATS difficult (Arkell,

2002). Furthermore, the recording of sales without purchases through affiliates

does not provide a complete picture of service activities and their economic

impacts (Bensidoun and Deniz, 2008).

    Similar issues arise with trade in goods if one attempts to add foreign

affiliate sales to current cross-border trade data. By way of example, if

McDonalds sells their hamburgers in Germany and use Germany meat and flour,

the knowhow, branding and organization are of US origin. If we add all

                                          9
Macdonald’s foreign affiliate sales to US cross-border trade data, this will

exaggerate the FAS component of trade, but to exclude it totally also seems

inappropriate.

    To construct FAS data seemingly implies using a weighting scheme to avoid

exaggerating FAS, and we later use alternative weights based on foreign affiliate

sales, value added value, and profits. We first give sales a 0.5 weight in

calculating FAS in trade in goods and compare the results to available data. To

combine goods data with data on services, we obtain FATS data from OECD

statistics, EU statistics, a pilot survey item of Eurostat, the UNCTAD

FDI/FATS database, and the US BEA database. Cross-border EBOPS data can

be easily obtained from the UN or WTO database.

    In the calculations of goods trade including FAS we report later, we use

specific countries’ industrial division foreign affiliate activities data from an

OECD database (OECD, 2010), since OECD’s inward and outward foreign

affiliate activity data are reported by industry sector division on a UN

international standard industrial classification basis (ISIC Rev.3). This allows us

to use data for both the goods and services parts of this data according to an

ISIC classification.

    The procedure we use is to first collect specific countries’ industrial data of

foreign affiliate sales, value added and profit from the OECD database. Then,

according to ISIC codes, we add all of the goods trade related industries data

together as FAS of goods, and then add all of the services trade related


                                        10
industries data together as FAS of services. Table 2 lists the detailed

classification division we use in doing this. OECD foreign affiliate activities data

use specific national currencies as their reporting units, so we use average yearly

exchange rates to convert all this data to US dollars.

                              [Table 2 around Here]

    We take one country’s outward foreign affiliate activities as its foreign

affiliate exports, and inward foreign affiliate activities as its foreign affiliate

imports. We use four different activities to represent alternative measures of

exports and imports in value terms in different calculations. These are sales

(equal to turnover in the database), value added, profits (equal to gross

operating surplus in the database), and sales with a 0.5 weight. Generally, the

value of sales does not accurately measure FAS. As we mention above, all

production of US McDonalds’ hamburgers in Germany are not of US origin, and

if we use the whole sales value as US FAS it exaggerates. To take account of this,

we also use value added, profits and sales as proxies for FAS. Value added

eliminates intermediate costs, and so reduces host countries’ cost contributions

to FAS. Profit represents the net income of multinational enterprises after all

costs of production, and it shows multinational firms’ returns which may be

related to FAS.

    The FAS weight we use to represent host country contributions to such sales

is 0.5 of total sales. However, we also make calculations using full FAS on the

grounds that for some countries component imports from third countries are


                                         11
involved, which in turn are produced by affiliates of host country counterparts.

Foreign affiliate exports of goods are thus alternatively taken as equal to 0.5

times total outward affiliate sales, full total outward affiliate sales, value added

or profits of outward FDI activities in goods industry (ISIC, Rev.3 industry

01-45). Imports equal similar inward activities for goods industries. Table 3

summaries these treatments we use in alternative calculations.

                              [Table 3 around Here]

    After obtaining cross-border and FAS goods and services trade data, we

then focus on how four perceptions of the role of trade in individual national

economies are affected. These are the size of total goods and services trade, the

trade growth rate, trade imbalances and the relative size of trade in goods and

services. We contrast the perceptions of each of these for the individual countries

we have data for using three different statistical bases; the current mixed GATT

and GATS basis, a FAS inclusive basis and a FAS exclusive basis. The GATT

and GATS basis denotes the calculations of goods trade under GATT rules and

services trade under GATS rules that appear in WTO reports. The FAS

inclusive basis denotes both goods and services trade including FAS. The FAS

exclusive basis denotes both goods and services trade without FAS data.




                                         12
4. Some Specific Results of Important Trade Topics with FAS

    We use data for five countries (USA, Japan, Germany, Finland and Czech

Republic) as individual country cases to calculate total goods and services trade,

trade growth rates, trade imbalances and the relative size of trade in goods and

services using different bases. The choice of these countries reflects data

availability. Tables 4 to 11 report the results.

                            [Tables 4–11 around Here]

    Several striking features emerge from these tables. First, total trade in

goods and services by country changes substantially if we use different statistical

bases. For the US, if we take sales as FAS, total trade inclusive of FAS is nearly

3 times that on a FAS exclusive value. If we use value added and profit as FAS,

FAS inclusive total trade is nearly 1.5 times that on a FAS exclusive basis. This

is reflective of the feature that the US has substantial multinational activity

abroad which can substitute for exports.

    Japan, Germany, Finland and Czech Republic also have large numbers for

FAS and thus experience similar effects on measures of their trade. Their FAS

inclusive value of total trade is more than 2 times of FAS exclusive trade if we

use sales as FAS. Japan has large multinational enterprises in key industries such

as auto and electronics. Germany also has many multinational enterprises

operating abroad. Finland’s FAS reflects foreign investment by metal, forest and

electronic industries of which NOKIA is a key element. The Czech Republic has

been a recipient of large inflows of foreign investment following its entry into EU,

                                         13
which has greatly increased its inward FAS. These calculations thus suggest that

FAS in goods are potentially a large part of total trade, and trade itself globally

may be much larger than currently thought.

    Second, using these measures annual growth rates of total trade in goods

and services in different countries under different statistical bases may all be

higher than a GATT/GATS basis would suggest. In the US, the average trade

growth rate from 2004 to 2007 under different bases varies between 11.7% and

12.9%; higher than economic growth. Japan’s average trade growth rate varies

between 10.8% and 12.1% under different bases. Germany, Finland and Czech

Republic have comparatively higher average growth rates, separately about

14.3%, 17.4% and 24.7%. Finland and Czech Republic have especially more

rapid trade growth rate because of their small size and export-oriented economic

development strategy. These features all reflect more rapid FAS growth than is

the case for conventionally measured cross border trade in goods.

    Third, the relative size of trade in goods and services changes a lot under

different bases for each of the countries we consider. For the US, if we take sales

as FAS, the average relative size on a FAS inclusive basis is 1.43; but this is 3.68

using a FAS exclusive basis; and 0.66 for a GATT and GATS basis. These large

differences change if we use value added or profits as FAS, but do not change as

much as the size of trade. In Japan, Germany and Czech Republic, a FAS basis

is larger than cross-border trade, and the relative size of trade in goods and

services is sharply different under different statistical bases. Big changes also


                                         14
occur for Finland. Thus if we measure goods and services trade on a GATT and

GATS basis as at present, we may miss much of the trade involved.

    Lastly, imbalances in trade are different under the different bases. For the

US, the size changes when we use sales as FAS. The average FAS exclusive

balance is a deficit of $-698 billion, but the average FAS inclusive balance is a

surplus of $477 billion, and the average GATT and GATS basis balance is a

smaller deficit of $-356 billion. If we use value added and profits as FAS, the

total FAS value decreases. All of the measures under different bases become

trade deficits but the amounts are different also. Although the US has a large

trade deficit in cross-border trade, its FAS moves trade measures into a surplus

and sharply reduces the total imbalance.

    These features of the recalculated goods and services trade data all reflect

the deepening international division of labor which has prompted US and other

OECD firms to invest and operate abroad in recent years. The Japanese,

German and Finnish average trade balance from 2003 to 2007 increases

respectively by more than 20 times, 4.8 times and 11.9 times when we add FAS

to cross-border trade since these three countries have large foreign direct

investments and large foreign affiliate sales. The Czech Republic is a special case

since its average trade balance is a surplus of $2.2 billion on a FAS exclusive

basis, but after adding FAS the trade situation changes to a deficit of -$150.6

billion if we use sales as FAS. The reason is the substantial inflow of foreign

investment into the Czech Republic from 2000 following its accession to the EU.


                                        15
5. Implications and Concluding Remarks

    As both integration of world economy and trade liberalization proceed,

multinational firms organize more of their production, sales and services abroad.

As a result, foreign affiliate activities become a progressively more important

part of the international economy. Trade data collected on a current account

basis takes a residency-based view of trade, that is, it measures the physical flow

of goods and services across a nation’s borders, regardless of the nationality or

the ownership of parties on either side of the transaction. In the 1940s when

GATT based measurements of trade were formalized and national trade and

balance of payments accounting methodologies were created, few companies had

operations outside the home country. Imports were goods produced by foreign

companies, exports by domestic ones.

    To fully capture commercial presence and more accurately calculate trade

flows, international organizations and countries have begun to collect and

publish foreign affiliate activities sales data. Such data opens the way to

calculate commercial presence trade data. Here we argue that trade in goods as

well as services should include a FAS part, and, if only trade in services has an

added FAS part as at present, we cannot compare goods and services trade

because of the statistical inconsistency.

    It is finally worth noting that global trade imbalances are an important area

of global debate impacted by this statistical issue, in turn affecting potential

contemporary G20 dialogue and cooperation. Many of the G20 countries

                                        16
including US, China, Japan seek to reduce trade imbalances, but if we take

account of the FAS, the imbalance situation changes sharply. Presently

measured global imbalances in cross-border trade may thus misrepresent the real

situation and raises the issue of whether global G20 efforts are only stabilizing

inaccurate statistics, not the real global economy. According to our calculations,

the US may actually have a trade surplus or a small deficit and Japan, Germany

and Finland may have much larger trade surpluses than at present. It may thus

be useful for G20 countries to be aware of these measurement issues.

    As economic integration further accelerates in the years ahead, trade

statistical methods will need even more to change accordingly. Traditional

cross-border trade has gradually been substituted by foreign direct investment

over the last few decades, because of production segmentation and further

international division of labor following increased multinational firms

production and operations abroad. Additionally, they now have separate parts of

their production abroad firms though outsourcing. We suggest here that

statistical recording of international trade now also needs to respond, and we are

able to make some initial calculations to reflect this. They in turn affect (and in

some cases sharply) our perceptions on the size, role, and speed of change of

trade.
