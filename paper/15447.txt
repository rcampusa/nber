Evidence of Regulatory Arbitrage in Cross-Border Mergers of Banks in the EU

                                              ABSTRACT

Banks are in the business of taking calculated risks. Expanding the geographic footprint of an organization’s
profit-making activities changes the geographic pattern of its exposure to loss in ways that are hard
for regulators and supervisors to observe. This paper tests and confirms the hypothesis that differences
in the character of safety-net benefits that are available to banks in individual EU countries help to
explain the nature of cross-border merger activity. If they wish to protect taxpayers from potentially
destabilizing regulatory arbitrage, central bankers need to develop statistical procedures for assessing
supervisory strength and weakness in partner countries. We believe that the methods and models used
here can help in this task.

        Risk is the salt and sugar of finance. When stock markets are calm, investors reward

banking organizations that manage to increase their size, complexity, leverage, or maturity

mismatch. This is partly because safety nets subsidize aggressive risk taking in good times

and the accounting frameworks used by banks and government officials do not make anyone

directly accountable for reporting or controlling these subsidies until and unless markets sour.

        In the wake of the most recent financial crisis, the European System of Central Banks

(ESCB) is striving to identify and to eliminate inconsistencies and gaps in the EU’s

regulatory framework (Lannoo, 2009). This paper shows that, in the years leading up to the

crisis, differences across countries in rules and enforcement allowed cross-border mergers by

EU banks to expand their access to safety-net subsidies. As long as the problem of

establishing a fair and efficient system for fiscal burden sharing remains intractable

(Goodhart and Schoenmaker, 2006), financial stability requires that home and host authorities

assess the safety-net consequences of cross-border mergers. We believe the methods and

models deployed in this paper provide the ESCB with a good place to start.

   I.       The Need to Reassess the Benefits and Costs of Cross-Country Banking Mergers

        How, why, and for whom individual mergers and acquisitions generate net economic

benefits becomes an increasingly important policy issue as industries globalize and

consolidate. For nonfinancial firms, analysis focuses on two overlapping possibilities:

postmerger improvements in efficiency (which benefit firms and customers alike) and

increases in market power (which benefit firms at the expense of their less-footloose

customers).

        In the financial sector, the existence of safety-net subsidies introduces two further

sources for concern: opportunity costs generated by individual-country policies of entry or

exit resistance and the possibility that the merger or acquisition represents a form of

regulatory arbitrage. When policymakers resist the exit or foreign takeovers of inefficient



                                                                                                3
domestic institutions, they subsidize particular firms and increase their market power.

Opportunities for regulatory arbitrage occur when, by changing the geographic footprint of

their activities, financial institutions (and some of their counterparties) can shift poorly

monitored risk exposures to taxpayers in one or another country on advantageous terms

(Kane, 2000; Carbo, Kane, and Rodriguez, 2008; Campa and Hernando, 2008). In the

absence of explicit procedures for assessing and redressing supervisory failings across

countries, such transactions threaten to increase the fragility of financial systems around the

world.

         Evidence regarding the ex ante efficiency, market, and regulatory effects of cross-

border banking combinations comes mainly from event studies. Researchers first use one or

more forms of market-model regression to identify significant shifts in parametric measures

of either value or risk-taking at partner banks during or after merger events. When significant

parameter shifts are observed, the estimated shift is regressed on various characteristics of

one or the other merger partner and on structural characteristics of the markets, economies, or

regulatory systems within which these firms operate (Amihud, DeLong, and Saunders, 2002;

Buch and DeLong, 2008). Perhaps because the second stage of such studies has limited

power to reject the hypotheses of no effect, these papers conclude that regulatory arbitrage

has posed little problem for EU authorities. Based on a sample of 214 transactions, the first

paper determined that EU banks making cross-border acquisitions in the years 1985-1998 did

not change their risk exposures “in any significant way.” Looking at data for 81 EU cross-

border mergers announced during the years 1998-2002, the second paper opines that the

supervisory structures of parent countries influence an institution’s total risk, but do not

“greatly influence the systematic risk [i.e., the market or beta risk] of the merged bank” and

that banks from “countries with strong supervision” were not trying to escape regulatory




                                                                                                  4
discipline in their home countries or to extract safety-net benefits by extending their

operations into countries where supervision is weaker.

       Although these results are comforting, they are not fully convincing. They leave open

some critical loose ends. First, neither paper directly estimates or controls for differences in

safety-net benefits across countries. Second, while both papers incorporate indirect measures

based on differences across countries in the scope of regulatory and supervisory powers, the

models used do not and cannot control for variation in enforcement. Enforcement varies with

the intensity with which authorities monitor individual-bank risk exposures and with the

manner in which exercise their supervisory authority when excessive leverage or other forms

of inappropriate risk-taking is observed. Vallascas and Hagendorff (2009) show that bidder

banks in Europe managed to increase their exposure to default risk. Third, the possibility that

merger partners differ from other banks with respect to the second-stage regressors (i.e., the

issue of sample-selection bias) is not explored.

       To address these concerns, this paper examines whether and how EU banks that

engage in cross-border mergers (CBM banks) differ from other EU banks with respect to the

safety-net benefits they extract or how effectively risk-shifting controls restrain their

incremental risk-taking. Carbo, Kane, and Rodriguez (2008) synthetically estimate

differences in safety-net benefits and in supervisory effectiveness for EU-15 countries

excluding Greece. These estimates use Hovakimian and Kane’s (2000) adaptation of the two-

equation model of capital discipline and safety-net control devised by Duan, Moreau, and

Sealey (1992).

       Applying an improved maximum-likelihood method of estimation (Duan 1994; Duan

and Simonato, 2002) to the same model and the same 1993-2004 Bancscope dataset, this

paper shows that -- both within and across countries -- significant differences exist in risk-

taking and access to safety-net subsidies between CBM and other commercial banks. The



                                                                                                   5
new method yields smaller, but similar differences between banks that Carbo, Kane and

Rodriguez (2008) designate as “country-champion banks” and other banks in the sample. In

this paper, we label these champion banks as too difficult to fail and unwind (TDFU) on the

grounds that they are large and complex enough to compete in international markets and

politically and administratively difficult to force into receivership.1 On average across

countries, CBM and TDFU banks are more leveraged and extract larger safety-net subsidies

than other EU banks. More importantly, after CBM institutions complete a cross-border

merger, even though their accounts show less leverage, their incremental access to safety-net

benefits increases substantially -- presumably because they can game cross-country

differences in regulatory systems to mask off-balance-sheet activity or to increase portfolio

risk. Postmerger effects turn out to be greater at acquirers than at targets. These findings

prove robust to introducing a companion Heckman equation to select CBM banks.

             The crucial policy implication of our study is that cross-border mergers and

individual-country exit resistance contributed to the current global financial turmoil by

undermining the effectiveness of capital requirements and other supervisory controls on risk-

shifting in EU countries. EU taxpayers, consumers of financial services, and commercial and

savings banks competing with CBM institutions must ultimately pay for the bill for this

supervisory failure. If the goal of policy is to reduce the risk of failure for financial

institutios, then regulators need to develop procedures for screening the adverse

consequences that mergers and acquisitions might impose on individual-country and partner

safety nets.



       II.      Modeling Safety-Net Benefits as a Function of Asset Volatility and Capital
                Controls2

    These banks are listed in an appendix to Carbo, Kane, and Rodriguez (2008).
2
    This section presents an abbreviated version of the explanation found in Carbo, Kane, and Rodriguez (2008).


                                                                                                                  6
       Risk-shifting occurs when creditors or guarantors are exposed to loss without

receiving adequate compensation. This section describes the model we use to estimate

effective capital controls and risk-shifting benefits at individual banks. This model linearizes

Merton’s model of deposit insurance (1977, 1978). Merton portrays safety-net access as an

option that allows bank owners to put the bank to safety-net managers for the face value of

the bank’s debt. However, we follow Ronn and Verma (1986) in scaling down the price at

which examination lags and political pressures allow authorities to enforce their takeover

rights. The variable IPP expresses the fair premium for safety-net support per Euro (or per

pound) of debt as an increasing function of a bank’s asset risk (σv) and leverage. Leverage is

measured as the ratio of the face value of an institution’s debt (B) to the estimated market

value of its assets (V).

       The contribution of Duan, Moreau, and Sealey (1992) is to recognize that market and

regulatory disciplines prevents B/V from being chosen independently of σv. To control risk-

shifting, counterparties and regulators may be expected to require B/V to fall when and as σv

increases. Conveniently treating σv as the model’s exogenous regressor leads to the following

reduced-form equations for B/V and IPP:

       B/V = α0 + α1σv + ε1 ,                                (1)

       IPP = β0 + β1σv + ε2 .                                (2)

       Equation (1) expresses the idea that regulators and creditors constrain banks to a

mutually acceptable set of perceived leverage and volatility pairs. If safety-net managers

could observe σv and control B/V perfectly, they would set B/V so that IPP equaled the value

of the sum of explicit and implicit premiums they could impose on the bank. The slope

coefficients in (1) and (2) may be interpreted as follows:

               d (B / V )
        α1 ≡              ,                                  (3)
                 dσ v




                                                                                                   7
                  ∂IPP   ∂IPP
           β1 ≡        +           α 1 = γ 1 + γ 2α 1 .       (4)
                  ∂σ v ∂ ( B / V )

       By themselves, the positive partial derivatives that are shown in equation (4) tell us

how much value bank stockholders could extract from the safety net if managers were free to

make unconstrained adjustments in volatility and leverage, respectively. However, in

practice, safety-net officials and important private counterparties insist on having at least

some power to monitor and constrain bank risk taking.

       Given the external discipline a bank faces, the sign of β1 in equation (2) indicates

whether, in a country’s particular contracting environment, increases in asset volatility can

increase the value of the implicit and explicit access to government credit support that is

imbedded in the bank’s stock price. To neutralize risk-shifting incentives at the margin,

disciplinary penalties that induce a decline in B/V must be large enough to offset fully

whatever increase in IPP would otherwise be generated by choosing a higher σv. Empirically,

as long as the total derivative β1 is positive, risk-shifting incentives are not completely

neutralized.

       Thus, for market and regulatory pressure to discipline and potentially to neutralize

incremental risk-shifting incentives, two conditions must be met:

       Bank capital increases with volatility:                α1 < 0,

       Guarantee values do not rise with volatility:          β1 ≤ 0.

       None of the three variables featured in our equations is directly observable. However,

Marcus and Shaked (1984) show how to use option-based models of deposit insurance to

track these variables synthetically. The first step in the Marcus-Shaked procedure is to obtain

tracking values for V and σv by numerical methods. These values are then used to estimate

IPP as the value of a put option on bank assets (the so-called “default put.” A key step is to

use Îto’s lemma to transform σv into σE, the instantaneous standard deviation of equity

returns.


                                                                                                 8
   III.      A Preliminary Look at the Focal Variables

          To identify cross-border merging banks, we use the Thompson One-Banker M&A

database for the European Union. This source permits us to identify target and acquirer

banks. We further require that the selected mergers be registered as completed deals in the

European Central Bank registry of banks. Balance-sheet and income statement data for the

merging banks come from the Bankscope database.

          Table 1 compares mean values for B/V, IPP, and σv for other banks in a country with

those for CBM banks. Because no Danish or Finnish bank engaged in a cross-border merger

during 1993-2004, these countries join Greece in dropping out of our analysis.

          Except for Spain and Germany, CBM banks extract from country EU safety nets

higher mean benefits than other banks do. Leverage is higher for CBM banks in three-fourths

of the cases, while increases and decreases in asset volatility divide almost equally.

          Table 2 shows for all banks and for CBM banks separately that leverage, fair

premiums, and asset volatility differ significantly between most country pairs. This supports

the hypothesis that selectively extending a bank’s operations into another EU country creates

an opportunity for lowering a firm’s overall regulatory burden. For example, a bank can book

risk exposures on which a home country enforces a high effective capital requirement in

subsidiaries located in countries that treat these particular exposures less onerously.

          Tables 3 and 4 aggregate the data globally. Table 3 shows that the link between

leverage ratios and risk-taking is on average more closely policed at TDFU and CBM banks

than for other banks. Without such policing (i.e., if α1 were ≥ 0), equation (4) shows that the

correlation between B/V and IPP could not be negative. Table 4 establishes that on average

CBM banks achieve slightly and insignificantly higher leverage and safety-net benefits than

TDFU banks do, while other banks trail significantly in both respects. It also shows that, after

a cross-border merger, leverage and safety-net benefits increase substantially.


                                                                                                  9
   IV.      Evidence that Cross-Border Mergers Offer Partner Institutions Incremental
            Regulatory Relief and Safety-Net Benefits

         Our next array of tables explore a series of difference-on-difference regression

equations in which errors are clustered at the individual-bank level. The first column of

Table 5 shows that across the 12 sample countries, accounting capital is subject to less and

less discipline as asset size increases. However, although the leverage decisions of CBM

banks receive more discipline, the second column shows that this discipline is not strong

enough to prevent them from extracting incremental safety-net benefits. At the margin, CBM

banks find ways to expand their portfolio risk that extract safety-net subsidies.

         Table 6 contrasts CBM banks’ pre-merger and post-merger experience, suppressing

the size term. It shows that, although accounting capital is policed roughly twice as closely

after a cross-border merger, CBM banks’ incremental access to safety-net benefits doubles.

Wald tests confirm that these differences are highly significant.

         Table 7 indicates that discipline and benefits accrue differently at target and acquiring

banks. Although acquiring banks (who presumably initiate cross-border deals) face

significantly more capital discipline, they extract significantly more safety-net benefit at the

margin than targets do. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the pursuit of

safety-net benefits helps to motivate cross-border merger activity.



   V.       Controlling for the Effects of Selection Bias

         A growing empirical literature seeks to predict individual firms’ propensity to engage

in merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in a time-series, cross-section framework.

Among other things, this literature emphasizes the role of size and relative profit performance

as motives for banks to combine. This leads us to hypothesize that targets or acquirers might

be especially large and, when a cross-border deal is initiated, might be seeking to counteract



                                                                                                10
regulatory efforts to reduce safety-net benefits. In Table 8, the negative sign that ΔIPP

receives in predicting year-by-year cross-border activity among CBM banks confirms the

hypothesis that -- as the Regulatory Dialectic (Kane, 2000 and 2009) would predict --

declines in the size of incremental safety-net benefits tend to call forth a benefit-restoring

response from CBM banks. This suggests the usefulness of modeling a bank’s willingness to

combine with a cross-border partner in any year in a two-equation framework. We do this by

introducing the Mills odds ratio from time-series or cross-section Heckman selection

equations as a regressor in our baseline models. This ratio lets separate from the influence of

asset size and other potential M&A determinants the effects of a bank’s leverage and access

to safety-net benefits on a bank’s decision to participate in a cross-border deal.

       Hernando, Nieto, and Wall (2008) survey the literature on bank takeovers. An

overarching theme of this research is that acquisitions should transfer control of assets from

poorly managed targets to better managed acquirers. We amend this sentiment to underscore

the possibility that unexploited opportunities for improved management of safety-net benefits

may be a key concern. Ahern and Weston (2007) stress that firms that engage in successful

merger and acquisition (M&A) programs do so over many years as a way of confronting

various challenges posed by their economic environments. Carletti, Hartmann, and Ongena

(2007) stress that such challenges include differences in the transparency and effectiveness of

prudential and competition controls on M&A activities. To account for environmental

differences, the expanded versions of equations (1) and (2) reported in this section

incorporate country fixed effects.

       Table 8 reports year-by-year and pooled equations for selecting CBM banks

(acquirers and targets) from our full sample of EU-12 banks. The year-by-year decline in

sample size reflects the rapid pace of consolidation in the EU-12 financial sector. The nine

included regressors combine the values of IPP and B/V with seven other variables that have



                                                                                                 11
proved significant in previous studies of bank takeovers in the EU. Measures of safety-net

benefits, leverage, asset size, tangible capitalization, intangible capital, and nondeposit debt

prove highly significant in most years. High values of IPP, size, nondeposit debt, and

intangible assets consistently encourage CBM activity, while leverage and tangible capital

restrain it. In contrast to studies that examine within-country mergers, measures of operating

inefficiency, liquidity, and ownership concentration are never significant.

       Coefficients of the significant variables move over time, but they usually remain

within two standard errors of the values obtained in the pooled run. Appealing to Occam’s

Razor (i.e., invoking the econometric norm of parsimony), we use the pooled selection

equation to investigate and correct for sample-selection bias that might have crept into

simpler models of IPP and B/V.

       An approved way to account for the potential endogeneity of any classificatory

variable is to adopt Heckman’s procedure (1976, 1978). This introduces into our previous

models a variable Heckman calls “Lambda.” This variable is also known as Mill’s inverse

odds ratio (“Mills ratio”). It measure the covariance between the error terms of the single-

equation regression for an endogenous variable with the residuals from the selection

equation. In our tables, the coefficient assigned to the Mills ratio measures how “surprising”

it is to learn that a particular bank is either engaging in a cross-border merger or (in Tables 11

and 13) acquiring a bank in another country.

       In Table 9, Lambda proves significantly negative in both panels. This indicates that

incremental leverage and safety-net benefits are algebraically larger, the less surprising it

seems for a particular bank to be engaging in a cross-border M&A. Compared to the

estimates shown in Table 5, other coefficients move up or down by only one or two points at

the third decimal place.




                                                                                                12
        Table 7 indicates that safety-net benefits increase significantly more at acquirers than

at targets. Within the class of CBM banks, Table 10 reports year-by-year and pooled

equations for selecting acquirers from targets. Sample sizes are small, but grow over time.

Again, our findings contrast with the literature on strictly domestic M&As in that leverage,

size, inefficiency, nondeposit debt, and ownership concentration are never significant.

Instead, safety-net benefits, intangible capital, and liquidity prove to be positive predictors for

being an acquirer. The magnitude and significance of IPP and liquidity become especially

large from 2000 on. Other things equal, tangible capitalization exerts a hard-to-interpret

negative influence on the acquisition decision.

        Table 11 expands on the experiment reported in Table 7. It introduces the Mills ratio

that emerges from using the pooled equation in Table 10. While other coefficients are not

much affected, the more likely (i.e., the less surprising) it is for a particular bank to be the

acquirer, the less incremental capital discipline it faces and the more safety-net benefits it can

extract. We interpret this to mean that investors and creditors recognize that EU banks with

an established cross-border acquisition program are adept at creating value through

regulatory arbitrage.

        Allowing for sample-selection bias, Tables 12 and 13 report the outcomes of two final

regression experiments. Table 12 investigates whether and how risk-shifting behavior at

CBM banks varies before and after a cross-border merger. The coefficient of the Mills ratio is

always negative, but becomes much larger and more significant after the transaction than it

was before. Unsurprising combinations attract less capital and supervisory discipline than

surprising ones. Although, other things equal, postmerger discipline grows with the size of

the resulting conglomerate, incremental benefits from expanding asset risk increase as well.

        Table 13 contrasts the behavior of leverage and safety-net benefits at acquirers and

targets prior to the cross-border transaction using Heckman’s two-equation framework. Other



                                                                                                   13
things equal, target-bank access to incremental safety-net benefits (i.e., the coefficient of ∆σv)

is twice that of acquirers. Taken together with our other results, this suggests that CBM

acquirers identify targets that possess unexploited opportunities for extracting safety-net

benefits.



   VI.      Summary Implications

         This paper confirms two complementary and worrisome hypotheses about the

purposes that led EU banks to undertake cross-border M&A activity during our 1993-2004

sample period. Regression evidence suggests first that these banks were not responding to

opportunities for increasing their operating efficiency, at least as measured conventionally by

their expense ratios. Instead, statistical analysis indicates that these banks were responding

principally to opportunities for shifting risk onto EU safety nets. What makes this form of

arbitrage hard to supervise is that in the short run a merger’s safety-net benefits tend to

generate stock-price increases consistent with an apparent strengthening of the combined

enterprise. However, over time, policies that do not adequately monitor and discipline

merger-created safety-net benefits end up subsidizing risk–taking and dangerously increasing

the fragility of a country’s banking system by making it more vulnerable to disruptive

movements in the prices of important bank assets. The existing framework for supervising

cross-border M&A activity at EU banks failed to monitor and control the ways in which

merger-related regulatory arbitrage shifted risk onto national safety nets. Not just in the EU

but throughout our globalizing economy, efforts to re-work cross-country supervisory

arrangements deserve great priority. Our methods and models generate a metric that

authorities can use to determine the extent to which safety-net benefits attach to merger deals.

   -   IPP, “fair” insurance premium, defined as the per-period flow of safety-net benefits that
       bank stockholders enjoy.
   -   B/V, leverage, measured as the ratio of the book value (B) of deposits and other debt to
       the market value of a bank’s assets (V).
   -   σV:, volatility, defined as the standard deviation of the return on bank assets.
   -   B, total debt: computed as the difference between the book values of total assets and
       common equity.
   -   E, the market value of a bank’s equity: computed as the end-of-period stock-market
       capitalization.
