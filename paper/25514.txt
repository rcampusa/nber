                                          ABSTRACT

The rise of social media has provoked both optimism about potential societal benefits and
concern about harms such as addiction, depression, and political polarization. In a randomized
experiment, we find that deactivating Facebook for the four weeks before the 2018 US midterm
election (i) reduced online activity, while increasing offline activities such as watching TV alone
and socializing with family and friends; (ii) reduced both factual news knowledge and political
polarization; (iii) increased subjective well-being; and (iv) caused a large persistent reduction in
post-experiment Facebook use. Deactivation reduced post-experiment valuations of Facebook,
suggesting that traditional metrics may overstate consumer surplus.

1        Introduction
Social media have had profound impacts on the modern world. Facebook, which remains by far
the largest social media company, has 2.3 billion monthly active users worldwide (Facebook 2018).
As of 2016, the average user was spending 50 minutes per day on Facebook and its sister platforms
Instagram and Messenger (Facebook 2016). There may be no technology since television that has
so dramatically reshaped the way people get information and spend their time.
        Speculation about social media’s welfare impact has followed a familiar trajectory, with early
optimism about potential benefits giving way to widespread concern about possible harms. At a
basic level, social media dramatically reduce the cost of connecting, communicating, and sharing
information with others. Given that interpersonal connections are among the most important
drivers of happiness and well-being (Myers 2000; Reis, Collins, and Berscheid 2000; Argyle 2001;
Chopik 2017), this could be expected to bring widespread improvements to individual welfare.
Many have also pointed to wider social benefits, from facilitating protest and resistance in autocratic
countries, to encouraging activism and political participation in established democracies (Howard
et al. 2011; Kirkpatrick 2011).
        More recent discussion has focused on an array of possible negative impacts. At the individual
level, many have pointed to negative correlations between intensive social media use and both
subjective well-being and mental health.1 Adverse outcomes such as suicide and depression appear
to have risen sharply over the same period that the use of smartphones and social media has
expanded.2 Alter (2018) and Newport (2019), along with other academics and prominent Silicon
Valley executives in the “time well-spent” movement, argue that digital media devices and social
media apps are harmful and addictive. At the broader social level, concern has focused particularly
on a range of negative political externalities. Social media may create ideological “echo chambers”
among like-minded friend groups, thereby increasing political polarization (Sunstein 2001, 2017;
Settle 2018). Furthermore, social media are the primary channel through which misinformation
spreads online (Allcott and Gentzkow 2017), and there is concern that coordinated disinformation
campaigns can affect elections in the US and abroad.
        In this paper, we report on a large-scale randomized evaluation of the welfare impacts of Face-
book, focusing on US users in the run-up to the November 2018 midterm elections. We recruited a
sample of 2,743 users through Facebook display ads, and elicited their willingness-to-accept (WTA)
to deactivate their Facebook accounts for a period of four weeks ending just after the election. We
then randomly assigned the 61 percent of these subjects with WTA less than $102 to either a Treat-
ment group that was paid to deactivate, or a Control group that was not. We verified compliance

with deactivation by regularly checking participants’ public profile pages. We measured a suite
of outcomes using text messages, surveys, emails, direct measurement of Facebook and Twitter
activity, and administrative voting records. Less than two percent of the sample failed to complete
the endline survey, and the Treatment group’s compliance with deactivation exceeded 90 percent.
   Our study offers the largest-scale experimental evidence available to date on the way Facebook
affects a range of individual and social welfare measures. We evaluate the extent to which time on
Facebook substitutes for alternative online and offline activities, with particular attention to crowd
out of news consumption and face-to-face social interactions. We study Facebook’s broader political
externalities via measures of news knowledge, awareness of misinformation, political engagement,
and political polarization. We study the impact on individual utility via measures of subjective well-
being, captured through both surveys and text messages. Finally, we analyze the extent to which
forces like addiction, learning, and projection bias may cause sub-optimal consumption choices, by
looking at how usage and valuation of Facebook change after the experiment.
   Our first set of results focuses on substitution patterns. A key mechanism for effects on indi-
vidual well-being would be if social media use crowds out face-to-face social interactions and thus
deepens loneliness and depression (Twenge 2017). A key mechanism for political externalities would
be if social media crowds out consumption of higher-quality news and information sources. We find
evidence consistent with the first of these but not the second. Deactivating Facebook freed up 60
minutes per day for the average person in our Treatment group. The Treatment group actually
spent less time on both non-Facebook social media and other online activities, while devoting more
time to a range of offline activities such as watching television alone and spending time with friends
and family. The Treatment group did not change its consumption of any other online or offline
news sources and reported spending 15 percent less time consuming news.
   Our second set of results focuses on political externalities, proxied by news knowledge, political
engagement, and political polarization. Consistent with the reported reduction in news consump-
tion, we find that Facebook deactivation significantly reduced news knowledge and attention to
politics. The Treatment group was less likely to say they follow news about politics or the Pres-
ident, and less able to correctly answer factual questions about recent news events. Our overall
index of news knowledge fell by 0.19 standard deviations. There is no detectable effect on political
engagement, as measured by voter turnout in the midterm election and the likelihood of clicking
on email links to support political causes. Deactivation significantly reduced polarization of views
on policy issues and a measure of exposure to polarizing news. Deactivation did not statistically
significantly reduce affective polarization (i.e. negative feelings about the other political party) or
polarization in factual beliefs about current events, although the coefficient estimates also point in
that direction. Our overall index of political polarization fell by 0.16 standard deviations. As a
point of comparison, prior work has found that a different index of political polarization rose by
0.38 standard deviations between 1996 and 2018 (Boxell 2018).


                                                  3
       Our third set of results looks at subjective well-being. Deactivation caused small but significant
improvements in well-being, and in particular in self-reported happiness, life satisfaction, depres-
sion, and anxiety. Effects on subjective well-being as measured by responses to brief daily text
messages are positive but not significant. Our overall index of subjective well-being improved by
0.09 standard deviations. As a point of comparison, this is about 25-40 percent of the effect of
psychological interventions including self-help therapy, group training, and individual therapy, as
reported in a meta-analysis by Bolier et al. (2013). These results are consistent with prior studies
suggesting that Facebook may have adverse effects on mental health. However, we also show that
the magnitudes of our causal effects are far smaller than those we would have estimated using the
correlational approach of much prior literature. We find little evidence to support the hypothesis
suggested by prior work that Facebook might be more beneficial for “active” users—for example,
users who regularly comment on pictures and posts from friends and family instead of just scrolling
through their news feeds.3
       Our fourth set of results considers whether deactivation affected people’s demand for Facebook
after the study was over, as well as their opinions about Facebook’s role in society. As the experi-
ment ended, participants reported planning to use Facebook much less in the future. Several weeks
later, the Treatment group’s reported usage of the Facebook mobile app was about 11 minutes (22
percent) lower than in Control. The Treatment group was more likely to click on a post-experiment
email providing information about tools to limit social media usage, and five percent of the Treat-
ment group still had their accounts deactivated nine weeks after the experiment ended. Our overall
index of post-experiment Facebook use is 0.61 standard deviations lower in Treatment than in Con-
trol. In response to open-answer questions several weeks after the experiment ended, the Treatment
group was more likely to report that they were using Facebook less, had uninstalled the Facebook
app from their phones, and were using the platform more judiciously. Reduced post-experiment use
aligns with our finding that deactivation improved subjective well-being, and it is also consistent
with the hypotheses that Facebook is habit forming in the sense of Becker and Murphy (1988) or
that people learned that they enjoy life without Facebook more than they had anticipated.
       Deactivation caused people to appreciate Facebook’s both positive and negative impacts on their
lives. Consistent with our results on news knowledge, the Treatment group was more likely to agree
that Facebook helps people to follow the news. About 80 percent of the Treatment group agreed
that deactivation was good for them, but they were also more likely to think that people would
miss Facebook if they used it less. In free response questions, the Treatment group wrote more text
about how Facebook has both positive and negative impacts on their lives. The opposing effects
on these specific metrics cancel out, so our overall index of opinions about Facebook is unaffected.
       Our work also speaks to an adjacent set of questions around how to measure the economic
   3
    Correlation studies on active vs. passive Facebook use include Burke, Marlow, and Lento (2010), Burke, Kraut,
and Marlow (2011), Burke and Kraut (2014), and Krasnova et al. (2013), and randomized experiments include Deters
and Mehl (2012) and Verduyn et al. (2015).


                                                       4
gains from free online services such as search and media.4 In standard models with consumers who
correctly optimize their allocation of time and money, researchers can approximate the consumer
surplus from these services by measuring time use or monetary valuations, as in Brynjolfsson and Oh
(2012), Brynjolfsson, Eggers, and Gannamaneni (2018), Corrigan et al. (2018), and others. But if
users do not understand the ways in which social media could be addictive or make them unhappy,
these standard approaches could overstate consumer surplus gains. Sagioglu and Greitemeyer
(2014) provide suggestive evidence: while their participants predicted that spending 20 minutes on
Facebook would make them feel better, it actually caused them to feel worse. Organizations such
as Time to Log Off argue that a 30-day “digital detox” would help people align their social media
usage with their own best interest.
       To quantify the possibility that deactivation might help the Treatment group to understand
ways in which their use had made them unhappy, we elicited willingness-to-accept at three separate
points, using incentive-compatible Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (1964, “BDM”) mechanisms. First,
on October 11th, we elicited WTA to deactivate Facebook for weeks 1-4 of the experiment, between
October 12th and November 8th. We immediately told participants the amount that they had
been offered to deactivate ($102 for the Treatment group, $0 for Control), and thus whether they
were expected to deactivate over that period. We then immediately elicited WTA to deactivate
Facebook for the next four weeks after November 8th, i.e. weeks 5-8. When November 8th arrived,
we then re-elicited WTA to deactivate for weeks 5-8. The Treatment group’s change in valuation
for weeks 5-8 reflects a time effect plus the effect of deactivating Facebook. The Control group’s
parallel valuation change reflects only a time effect. Thus, the difference between how Treatment
vs. Control change their WTAs for deactivation for weeks 5-8 reflects projection bias, learning, or
other unanticipated experience effects from deactivation.5
       After weighting our sample to match the average US Facebook user on observables, the median
and mean willingness-to-accept to deactivate Facebook for weeks 1-4 were $100 and $180, respec-
tively. These valuations are larger than most estimates in related work by Brynjolfsson, Eggers,
and Gannamaneni (2018), Corrigan et al. (2018), Mosquera et al. (2018), and Sunstein (2019). A
standard consumer surplus calculation would aggregate the mean valuation across the estimated
172 million US Facebook users, giving $31 billion in consumer surplus from four weeks of Face-
book. However, consistent with our other results that deactivation reduced demand for Facebook,
deactivation caused WTA for weeks 5-8 to drop by up to 14 percent. This suggests that traditional
consumer surplus metrics overstate the true welfare gains from social media, though a calculation
that adjusts for the downward WTA revision would still imply that Facebook generates enormous

     This measurement connects to the literature on habit formation and projection bias, including Acland and Levy
(2015), Becker and Murphy (1988), Becker, Grossman, and Murphy (1991), Busse et al. (2015), Charness and Gneezy
(2009), Conlin, O’Donoghue, and Vogelsang (2007), Fujiwara, Meng, and Vogl (2016), Gruber and Köszegi (2001),
Hussam et al. (2016), Loewenstein, O’Donoghue, and Rabin (2003), and Simonsohn (2010).

flows of consumer surplus.
       What do our results imply about the overall net welfare impact of Facebook? On the one hand,
Facebook deactivation increased subjective well-being, and 80 percent of the Treatment group
reported that deactivation was good for them. On the other hand, participants were unwilling to
give up Facebook unless offered fairly large amounts of money—even after they had deactivated
for four weeks, which should have allowed at least some learning or “detox” from addiction. It
is not entirely clear whether one should prioritize the survey measures or monetary valuations as
normative measures of consumer welfare. Benjamin et al. (2012) suggest that subjective well-being
measures like ours are not a complete measure of what people are trying to maximize when they
make decisions, but Bohm, Lindén, and Sonnegård (1997), Mazar, Koszegi, and Ariely (2014),
and other studies make clear that monetary valuations are not closely held and can be easily
manipulated. We think of these tensions as fodder for future research.
       Our results should be interpreted with caution, for several reasons. First, effects could differ
with the duration, time period, or scale of deactivation. A longer period without Facebook might
have less impact on news knowledge as people find alternative news sources, and either more or less
impact on subjective well-being. Effects might be different for our pre-election deactivation than
for deactivation in other periods. Furthermore, the effects of deactivating a large share of Facebook
users would likely be different due to network effects, so our parameters are most relevant for
individuals independently determining their own Facebook use. Second, our sample is not fully
representative. Our participants are relatively young, well-educated, and left-leaning compared to
the average Facebook user; we included only people who reported using Facebook more than 15
minutes per day; and people willing to participate in our experiment may also differ in unobservable
ways. Third, many of our outcome variables are self-reported, adding scope for both measurement
error and experimenter demand effects. However, Section 5.6 finds no evidence of demand effects,
and our non-self-reported outcomes paint a similar picture to the survey responses.
       The causal impacts of social media have been of great interest to researchers in economics,
psychology, and other fields. We are aware of 12 existing randomized impact evaluations of Face-
book.6 The most closely related is the important paper by Mosquera et al. (2018), which was made
public the month before ours. They also use Facebook deactivation to study news knowledge and
well-being, finding results broadly consistent with those reported here. Appendix Table A1 details
these experiments in comparison to ours. Our deactivation period is substantially longer and our
sample size an order of magnitude larger than most prior experimental work, including Mosquera
   6
    These studies sit within a broader media effects literature that uses experimental and quasi-experimental methods
to quantify the effects of media technologies such as television, media providers such as Fox News, and content such
as political advertising (Bartels 1993; Besley and Burgess 2001; DellaVigna and Kaplan 2007; Enikolopov, Petrova,
and Zhuravskaya 2011; Gentzkow 2006; Gerber and Green 2000; Gerber et al. 2011; Gerber, Karlan, and Bergan
2009; Huber and Arceneaux 2007; Martin and Yurukoglu 2017; Olken 2009; and Spenkuch and Toniatti 2016); for

et al. (2018). We measure impacts on a relatively comprehensive range of outcomes, and we are
the only one of these randomized trials to have submitted a pre-analysis plan. Given the effect
sizes and residual variance in our sample, we would have been unlikely to have sufficient power to
detect any effects if limited to the sample sizes in previous experiments. Our work also relates to
quasi-experimental estimates of social media effects by Muller and Schwarz (2018) and Enikolopov,
Makarin, and Petrova (2018).

egy. Section 5 presents the impact evaluation, and Section 6 discusses measurement of the consumer
surplus generated by Facebook.


2     Experimental Design
2.1   Experiment Overview
Figure 1 summarizes our experimental design and timeline. We timed the experiment so that the
main period of Facebook deactivation would end shortly after the 2018 US midterm elections, which
took place on November 6th. The experiment has eight parts: recruitment, pre-screen, baseline
survey, midline survey, endline survey, post-endline survey, post-endline emails, and daily text
messages.
    Between September 24th and October 3rd, we recruited participants using Facebook ads. Our
ad said, “Participate in an online research study about internet browsing and earn an easy $30 in
electronic gift cards.” Appendix Figure A1 presents the ad. To minimize sample selection bias, the
ad did not hint at our research questions or suggest that the study was related to social media or
Facebook deactivation. We targeted the ads by demographic cells in an attempt to gather an initial
sample that was approximately representative of Facebook users on gender, age, college completion,
and political ideology. 1,892,191 unique users were shown the ad, of whom 32,201 clicked on it.
This 1.7 percent click-through rate is about twice the average click-through rate on Facebook ads
across all industries (Irvine 2018).
    Clicking on the ad took the participant to a brief pre-screen survey, which included several
background demographic questions and the consent form. 17,335 people passed the pre-screen, by
reporting being a US resident born between the years 1900 and 2000 who uses Facebook more than
15 minutes and no more than 600 minutes per day. Of those people, 7,455 consented to participate
in the study.
    After completing the consent form, participants began the baseline survey.          The baseline
recorded email addresses, additional demographics, and a range of outcome variables. We also
asked for each participant’s name, zip code, Twitter handle, and phone number (“in order for us
to send you text messages during the study”), as well as the URL of their Facebook profile page
(which we would use “solely to observe whether your Facebook account is active”). Finally, we

                                                  7
informed people that we would later ask them to deactivate their accounts for two 24-hour periods,
and confirmed their willingness to do so. (We required all participants regardless of treatment
status to deactivate for these 24-hour periods to minimize selective attrition and to ensure that the
valuations described below reflect value of Facebook access, not the fixed cost of the deactivation
process.)
    In all, 3,910 people finished the baseline survey and were willing to deactivate. Of those, 1,013
were dropped from the experiment because of invalid data (for example, invalid Facebook profile
URLs) or low-quality baseline responses (for example, discrepancies between average daily Facebook
usage reported in the pre-screen vs. baseline survey, completing the survey in less than ten minutes,
no text in short-answer boxes, and other patterns suggesting careless responses). The remaining
2,897 participants had valid baseline data, were included in our stratified randomization, and were
invited to take the midline survey.
    On October 11th, we sent an email invitation to the midline survey. The survey first asked par-
ticipants to deactivate their Facebook accounts for 24 hours and guided them through the process.
The survey clearly explained what deactivation entailed and how we would monitor deactivation.
Facebook allows users to deactivate and reactivate their accounts at any time. We informed partici-
pants that they could continue to use Facebook Messenger while deactivated, and that their profile
and friend network would be unchanged when they reactivated. We emphasized that Facebook
would automatically reactivate their account if they logged into the Facebook website or app, or if
they actively logged into any other app using their Facebook login credentials.7 We informed par-
ticipants that “We will verify whether or not you deactivated your account by pinging the Facebook
URL” that they had provided in the baseline survey.
    The midline survey then used a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism to elicit willingness-
to-accept (WTA) to stay deactivated for four weeks rather than 24 hours.8 We then revealed the
BDM price offer. An additional 154 participants had dropped out before this point of the midline
survey, leaving 2,743 who received their price offer. Participants whose WTA was strictly less than
the price draw were informed that they should deactivate for the full four weeks after midline. Fi-
nally, the midline survey reminded people that we would again ask them to deactivate for 24 hours
   7
     A user’s Facebook account automatically reactivates whenever the user actively logs into any other app using their
Facebook login credentials. However, this does not fully preclude people from using other apps for which they had
used Facebook to log in. People can continue using other apps if they are already logged in, can set up non-Facebook
logins, or can log in with Facebook and then again deactivate their Facebook account.
   8
     The survey explained, “The computer has randomly generated an amount of money to offer you to deactivate
your Facebook account for the next 4 weeks. Before we tell you what the offer is, we will ask you the smallest offer
you would be willing to accept. If the offer the computer generated is above the amount you give, we will ask you
to deactivate for 4 weeks and pay you the offered amount if you do. If the offer is below that amount, we will not
ask you to deactivate.” We then asked several comprehension questions to make sure that participants understood
the mechanism. We did not tell participants the distribution or support of the offer prices, both because we did not
want to artificially truncate the distribution of elicited WTA and because prior studies have found that providing
information on the bounds of the offer price distribution can affect BDM valuations (Bohm, Lindén, and Sonnegård
1997; Mazar, Koszegi, and Ariely 2014).



                                                          8
after the endline survey, and used a second BDM mechanism to elicit WTA to stay deactivated for
the four weeks after endline instead of just 24 hours. We refer to the four weeks after midline as
“weeks 1-4,” and the four weeks after endline as “weeks 5-8.”
       On November 8th, two days after the midterm election, we sent an email invitation to the endline
survey. The endline survey first measured the same outcome variables as the baseline survey. All
questions were identical, with the exception of cases discussed in Section 2.3 below, such as using
updated news knowledge questions and rephrasing questions about the midterm election to be in
the past tense. We then asked all participants to again deactivate their Facebook accounts for the
next 24 hours, and again elicited WTA to stay deactivated for the next four weeks (i.e., weeks 5-8)
instead of the next 24 hours. Participants were told, “With a 50% chance we will require you to
abide by the decision you made 4 weeks ago; with 50% chance we will ignore the decision you made
4 weeks ago and we will require you to abide by the decision you make today.”
       We gathered data from two post-endline emails. On November 20th, we sent an email with
links to information on ways to limit smartphone social media use, and on November 25th, we sent
an email with links to donate to, volunteer for, or sign petitions related to political causes. Clicks
on these emails provide additional non-self-reported measures of interest in reducing social media
use and political engagement. Appendix Figures A2 and A3 present the two emails.
       On December 3rd, we invited participants to a short post-endline survey in which we asked how
many minutes per day they had used the Facebook app on their smartphones in the past seven days.
We asked participants with iPhones to report the Facebook app time reported by their phone’s
Settings app, and we asked other participants to estimate. We also asked several open-answer
questions, such as “How has the way you use Facebook changed, if at all, since participating in this
study?”
       For the approximately six weeks between baseline and endline, we sent daily text message
surveys to measure several aspects of subjective well-being in real time rather than retrospectively.
We rotated three types of questions, measuring happiness, the primary emotion felt over the past
ten minutes, and loneliness. Appendix Figure A4 presents the three questions.
       We verified deactivation by checking each participant’s Facebook profile page URL regularly
at random times. While a user can limit how much content other people can see in their profiles,
they cannot hide their public profile page, and the public profile URL returns a valid response if
and only if their account is active.9 This is thus our measure of deactivation. For all participants,
   9
    By default, Facebook profile URLs end in a unique number, which is the numeric ID for that person in the
Facebook system. Users can update their default URL to be something customized, and they can change their
customized URL as often as they want. In the baseline survey, participants reported their profile URLs, which could
have been either the default or customized version. Shortly after the baseline survey, we checked if each participant’s
Facebook profile URL was valid by pinging it and looking in the page source for the string containing the person’s
numeric ID. If the numeric ID existed, we knew that the URL was valid. After that point, we used participants’
numeric IDs to construct their default numeric URLs, which allowed us to correctly measure deactivation even if they
changed their customized URL.



                                                          9
we verified deactivation approximately once per day for the seven days before midline and all
days between endline and the end of January 2019. Between midline and endline, we verified
deactivation approximately four times per day for people who were supposed to be deactivated
(i.e. the Treatment group) and once every four days for everyone else. During the post-midline
and post-endline 24-hour deactivation periods, we generally verified deactivation within about six
hours of when each participant completed the survey. If participants were not deactivated when
they were supposed to be, our program immediately sent an automated email informing them that
they should again deactivate as soon as possible, along with a survey asking them to explain why
they were not deactivated.
    All participants received $5 per completed survey, paid via gift card immediately upon com-
pletion. All participants were told that they would receive a $15 “completion payment” if they
completed all surveys, responded to 75 percent of text messages, kept their accounts deactivated
for the 24 hours after midline and endline, and, if the deactivation offer price was above their
reported WTA, kept their accounts deactivated for the full period between midline and endline.
The latter requirement (making the completion payment contingent on complying with the BDM’s
deactivation assignment) makes it a strictly dominant (instead of weakly dominant) strategy to
truthfully report valuations in the BDM.10 These payments were in addition to the $102 that the
Treatment group received in exchange for deactivation.

2.2    Randomization
We used the BDM mechanism described above to randomly assign participants to Facebook de-
activation. Figure 1 illustrates the randomization. Participants with valid baseline data were
randomized into three groups that determined the BDM offer price p for deactivation in weeks 1-4
(i.e., the weeks between midline and endline): p = $102 (approximately 33 percent of the sample),
p = $0 (approximately 67 percent), and p drawn from a uniform distribution on [$0, $170] (ap-
proximately 0.2 percent).11 We balanced the p = $102 and p = $0 group assignments within 48
strata defined by age, average daily Facebook use, heavy vs. light news use (those who get news
from Facebook fairly often or very often vs. never, hardly ever, or sometimes), active vs. passive
Facebook use, and Democrat, Republican, or independent party affiliation.
    The effects of Facebook deactivation in weeks 1-4 are identified in the sample of participants
who were allocated to p = $102 or p = $0 and were willing to accept less than $102 to deactivate
  10
     As discussed above, we did not inform participants of the BDM offer price distribution. Thus, more precisely,
truthfully reporting valuations is a strictly dominant strategy only within the support of the offer price distribution
that participants expected us to use.
  11
     We chose $102 because our pilot data correctly suggested that there would be a point mass of WTAs at $100
and that it would maximize statistical power per dollar of cost to set an offer price just high enough to induce those
participants to deactivate. We chose $170 as the top of the uniform distribution because it was the maximum that
we could pay participants without requiring tax-related paperwork.




                                                          10
in weeks 1-4. We call this the “impact evaluation sample.” Within the impact evaluation sample,
we call p = $102 the “Treatment” group, and p = $0 the “Control” group.
   For deactivation in weeks 5-8 (i.e., the four weeks after endline), 0.2 percent of participants were
randomly selected to a BDM offer price drawn randomly from p0 ∈ [0, 170], while the remaining
99.8 percent received offer p0 = 0. We balanced this weeks 5-8 offer price p0 between the weeks 1-4
offer price groups, so two participants who were offered p = $102 and four participants who were
offered p = $0 were assigned to positive weeks 5-8 offers p0 ∈ [0, 170].
   This approach allows us to maintain incentive compatibility in the BDM mechanism, have
balance between Treatment and Control groups, and use a straightforward regression to estimate
treatment effects of post-midline deactivation.

2.3   Outcome Variables
For the impact evaluation, we consider the outcome variables in the nine families described below.
Appendix B presents survey question text and descriptive statistics for each outcome variable and
moderator, grouped by family. We also construct indices that combine the outcome variables within
each family, weighting by the inverse of the covariance between variables at endline, as described
in Anderson (2008). In constructing these indices, we orient the variables so that more positive
values have the same meaning—for example, more positive means “more polarized” in all cases.
Outcomes to be multiplied by -1 are followed by “× (-1)” in Appendix B.1.

Substitute time uses

At baseline and endline, we asked participants how many minutes per day they spent on Facebook
on the average day in the past four weeks. At baseline, we also asked participants to report how
much of their free time on the average day in the past four weeks they spent on various activities,
ranging from using social media apps other than Facebook to spending time with friends and family
in person. At endline, we asked how much time they spent on the same activities, “relative to what
is typical for you.” We phrased the questions in this way in order to more precisely detect changes
in self-reported time use caused by the deactivation.

Social interaction

We have three measures of social interaction. The friends met in person variable is the natural
log of one plus the number of friends seen in person in the last week, as measured by a survey
question that asked participants to “list the first names of as many friends you met in person last
week that you can think of in 1 minute.” Offline activities is the number of offline activities (such
as going out to dinner, spending time with your kids, etc.) that the person did at least once last
week. Diverse interactions is an indicator for whether the respondent interacted with someone who


                                                  11
voted the opposite way in the last presidential election plus an indicator for whether the respondent
interacted with someone from another country in the last week.

Substitute news sources

At baseline, we asked participants how often they got news from different sources over the past four
weeks, including Facebook, cable TV, print, and radio news, borrowing a standard survey question
from the Pew Research Center (2018a). At endline, we again asked how often they got news from
those same sources, “relative to what is typical for you.” For the participants who reported having
a Twitter handle, we gathered data on number of tweets in the four weeks before baseline began
and in the four weeks between midline and endline. This allows a non-self-reported measure of one
kind of potential substitution away from Facebook.12

News knowledge

In order to detect broad changes in news exposure, we asked participants how closely they followed
politics, how closely they followed news about President Trump, and how many minutes per day
they spent watching, reading, or listening to the news (including on social media) over the past
four weeks.
       In order to measure specific news knowledge, we included a 15-question news knowledge quiz.
For each question, we gave a statement from the news in the past four weeks and asked participants
to indicate if they thought the statement was true or false, or whether they were unsure. The order
of the 15 statements was randomized. Seven of the statements were from news stories covered in
the past four weeks in six news websites: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, CNN,
MSNBC, and US News & World Report, such as “The Trump administration set the maximum
number of refugees that can enter the country in 2019 to 30,000.” Three of the headlines were false
modifications of articles from those same six news websites, such as “President Trump spoke at the
funeral of former Arizona Senator John McCain, honoring the late McCain’s wish.” (In reality, it
had been reported that President Trump was not invited to McCain’s funeral.) The news knowledge
variable is the count of true statements rated as true plus the count of false statements rated as
false, plus one-half for every statement about which the respondent was “unsure.” The final five
statements were from fake news stories—rated false by third-party fact-checkers snopes.com and
factcheck.org—that circulated heavily within a four-week period before the survey. The fake news
knowledge variable is the count of fake statements correctly rated as “false” plus one-half for every
statement about which the respondent was unsure. Appendix B.1 presents the full news knowledge
quizzes from both baseline and endline.
  12
    In our pre-analysis plan, we grouped this number of tweets variables in the substitute news sources family, but
one might also think of it as a “substitute time use” because Twitter is not only used to read news.




                                                        12
Political engagement

We have two measures of political engagement. First, we measure whether participants voted
in the 2018 midterm election, by matching participants on name, birth year, and zip code to a
voting database supplied to Stanford by L2, a voting data provider. See Appendix C for details
on the match process. Second, we measure whether participants clicked on any of the links in the
post-endline politics email.

Political polarization

There are a variety of ways to measure political polarization (see, for example, Gentzkow 2016),
and we use both standard and novel measures. First, we included standard “feeling thermometer”
questions capturing how “warm or cold” participants felt toward the Demoratic and Republican
Parties and President Trump over the past four weeks. The party affective polarization variable is
the respondent’s thermometer warmth toward her own party minus her warmth toward the other
party. For this and all other polarization variables, we include independents who lean toward a
party, and we drop independents who do not lean toward either party.
       Second, the Trump affective polarization variable is the thermometer warmth toward President
Trump for Republicans, and minus one times the thermometer warmth toward President Trump
for Democrats. Third, we asked respondents to list recent news events that made them angry at
the Republican or Democratic Party. Party anger is the natural log of one plus the length (in
characters of text) of her response about the other party minus the natural log of one plus the
length of her response about her own party. Fourth, we asked people how often they saw news that
made them better understand the point of view of the Republican Party, and a parallel question
for news about the Democratic Party. Congenial news exposure is the respondent’s answer about
her own political party minus her answer for the other party.
       Fifth, we asked opinions about nine current political issues, such as “To what extent do you think
that free trade agreements between the US and other countries have been a good thing or a bad
thing for the United States?” These nine questions were all adapted from recent Pew Center and
Gallup opinion polls. The issue polarization variable reflects the extent to which the respondent’s
issue opinions align with the average opinion in her own party instead of the other party. Sixth,
belief polarization reflects the extent to which the respondent’s beliefs about current news events
(from the news knowledge quiz described above) align with the average belief in her own party
instead of the other party.13 Finally, vote polarization measures the strength of preferences for the
  13
     Specifically, for each issue or belief question q, we normalize responses by the standard deviation in the Control
group, determine Democrats’ and Republicans’ average responses µD               R                     D     R
                                                                        q and µq , re-center so that µq + µq = 0, and
                   R
re-sign so that µ > 0. Define ỹiq as individual i’s normalized, re-centered, and re-signed response to question q,
multiplied by -1 if i is a Democrat. ỹiq thus reflects the strength of individual i’s agreement with the average view
of her party instead of the other party. For issue polarization, further define σq as the Control group within-person
standard deviation of ỹiq for question q. This measures how much people’s views change between baseline and endline,

Subjective well-being

There is a vast literature on measuring subjective well-being (see, for example, Kahneman et al.
2006), and we use standard measures from the literature. We modified existing scales in two ways.
First, we asked questions in reference to the past four weeks, so as to increase our ability to detect
changes as a result of Facebook deactivation. Second, in some cases we chose a subset of questions
from standard multi-question scales in order to focus on areas of subjective well-being that might
be most affected by Facebook.
    The happiness variable is the average response to two questions from the Subjective Happiness
Scale (Lyubomirsky and Lepper 1999), asking how happy participants were over the past four
weeks and how happy they were compared to their peers. Life satisfaction is the sum of responses
to three questions from the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener et al. 1985), such as the level of
agreement with the statement, “During the past 4 weeks, I was satisfied with my life.” Loneliness
is the Three-Item Loneliness Scale (Hughes et al. 2004). Finally, depressed, anxious, absorbed, and
bored reflect how much of the time during the past four weeks respondents felt each emotion, using
questions from the European Social Survey well-being module (Huppert et al. 2009).
    The daily text messages allowed us to measure the aspects of subjective well-being that are
most important to record in the moment instead of retrospectively. This approach builds on
the Experience Sampling Method of Csikszentmihalyi and Larson (2014) and Stone and Shiffman
(1994). The variable SMS happiness is the answer to the question, “Overall, how happy do you
feel right now on a scale from 1 (not at all happy) to 10 (completely happy)?” The variable SMS
positive emotion is an indicator variable for whether the participant reports a positive emotion
when asked, “What best describes how you felt over the last ten minutes?”, with possible responses
such as “angry,” “worried,” “loving/tender,” etc. Finally, SMS not lonely uses the answer to the
question, “How lonely are you feeling right now on a scale from 1 (not at all lonely) to 10 (very
lonely)?”
and allows us to place higher weight on issues about which views are malleable over P the deactivation period. For
belief polarization, let σq = 1. The issue and belief polarization measures are Yi = q ỹiq σq . Appendix Table A15
shows that the issue polarization results are nearly identical if we set σq = 1.
  14
     Specifically, we asked “In the recent midterm elections, did you vote for the Republican Party’s or for the
Democratic Party’s candidate for Congress in your district? (If you did not vote, please tell us whom you would
have voted for.)” We code vote polarization as 0 for “other/don’t know.” For people who responded that they
had (or would have) voted for the Republican or Democratic candidate, we then asked, “How convinced were you
about whether to vote for the Republican candidate or the Democratic candidate?” In these cases, we code vote
polarization on a scale from -1 (very convinced to vote for the Democratic candidate) to +1 (very convinced to vote
for the Republican candidate), and then multiply by -1 for Democrats.




                                                        14
Post-experiment Facebook use

We have four measures of planned and actual post-experiment Facebook use. First, planned post-
study use change is the extent to which participants plan to use Facebook more or less than they
had before they started the study. (This was included only in the endline survey.) Second, clicked
time limit email is an indicator for whether the respondent clicked any of the links in the post-
endline social media time limit email. Third, speed of reactivation is minus one times the natural
log of one plus the number of days that the participant’s account remained deactivated between
the post-endline 24-hour deactivation period and our most recent measurement on December 17th.
Fourth, Facebook mobile app use is the natural log of one plus the number of minutes per day that
the participant reported using Facebook on their phone in the post-endline survey.

Opinions about Facebook

We asked eight questions eliciting people’s opinions about Facebook, such as “To what extent do
you think Facebook is good or bad for society?” and “To what extent do you think Facebook
makes people more or less politically polarized?” Each of these eight responses was on a ten-point
scale. In the endline survey only, we also asked deactivation bad : “As part of this study, you were
asked to deactivate your Facebook account for [24 hours/4 weeks]. To what extent do you think
that deactivating your account was good or bad for you?” Finally, we also included two open
answer text boxes in which we asked people to write out the most important positive and negative
impacts that Facebook has on their lives. The positive impacts and negative impacts variables are
the natural log of one plus the count of characters in the respective text box.

Secondary outcomes

We also consider the following two outcomes, which we labeled as “secondary” in our pre-analysis
plan. First, we consider the standard generic ballot question. At baseline, we asked “If the elections
for US Congress were being held today, would you vote for the Republican Party’s candidate or the
Democratic Party’s candidate for Congress in your district?” To increase precision, we then asked,
“How convinced are you about whether to vote for the Republican or Democratic candidate?” At
endline, we asked these questions in past tense, about whom the respondent did vote for in the 2018
midterm (or whom the respondent would have voted for had she voted, to avoid potentially selective
non-response). The voted Republican variable is the strength of preferences for the Republican
candidate. We labeled this outcome as secondary because we expected the estimates to be too
imprecise to be of interest.
   Second, we asked people to report whether they had voted (at endline) and planned to vote
(at baseline) in the 2018 midterm. We labeled this as secondary because it is superseded by the
administrative voting data from L2.


                                                 15
         We also gathered contributions to political campaigns from the Federal Election Commission
database. In our pre-analysis plan, we labeled this as secondary because very few Americans
contribute to political campaigns, and we did not expect to be able to detect effects from four
weeks of deactivation. Indeed, only one person in the impact evaluation sample donated to a
political party between the October 2018 midline survey and July 2019. As a result, we deviate
from the pre-analysis plan by dropping this from our analysis.


3         Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 shows sample sizes at each step of our experiment, from the 1.9 million Facebook users
who were shown our ads, to the 1,661 subjects in the impact evaluation sample. Table 2 quantifies
the representativeness of our sample on observables, by comparing the demographics of our impact
evaluation sample to our estimate of the average demographics of adult Facebook users and to the
US adult population. Comparing column 1 to columns 2 and 3, we see that our sample is relatively
high-income, well-educated, female, young, and Democratic, and uses Facebook relatively heavily.15
Appendix Table A14 shows that Treatment and Control are balanced on observables.
         Table 3 documents very high response rates to the endline and post-endline surveys and sub-
jective well-being text messages. Of the 580 people in the Treatment group, only seven failed to
complete the endline survey. Of the 1,081 people in the Control Group, only 17 failed to complete
endline. The average participant responded to 92 percent of daily text messages, well above the
75 percent required in order to receive the completion payment.16 Treatment and Control have
statistically equal response rates to the endline survey and subjective well-being text messages. A
marginally significantly larger share of the Treatment group responded to the post-endline survey;
this is less worrisome because Facebook mobile app use is the only variable from that survey for
which we calculate treatment effects, and we show in Appendix Table A13 that using Lee (2009)
bounds to account for attrition does not change the conclusions. Finally, Table 3 also reports the
high level of compliance with our deactivation treatment: Treatment group participants were deac-
tivated on 90 percent of checks between October 13th (the first day after the 24-hour post-midline
deactivation period) and November 7th (the day before endline), against two percent for Control.
         As described above, if Treatment group members were found to have active accounts, we sent an
email informing them of this and asking them to promptly deactivate, along with a survey asking
    15
     In Appendix Figures A17, A18, A19, and A20, we find that the two demographic variables that we pre-specified
as moderators, age and political party, do not appear to systematically moderate treatment effects. Furthermore,
Figure 9 provides no systematic evidence that the effects vary for people who use Facebook more vs. less heavily
before baseline. This suggests that re-weighting the sample for representativeness on these observables would not
substantively change the estimated effects, although it would increase the standard errors.
  16
     Appendix Figure A26 shows the text message response rate by day (response rates declined slightly over the
course of the experiment) and shows that Treatment and Control response rates are statistically balanced in all days
of the deactivation period.



                                                        16
why they were not deactivated. From these surveys, along with email interactions and formal
qualitative interviews following our summer 2018 pilot study, we conclude that most Treatment
group members who did reactivate fall into one of two groups. The first group consists of a small
number of users who changed their mind about participating in the experiment and reactivated
intentionally. The second group consists of users who briefly reactivated by accident, for example
because they logged in to another app or online service using their Facebook account credentials.
    Appendix Figure A27 shows the cumulative distribution of the share of time deactivated for
the Treatment group, and Appendix Figure A28 shows the distribution of reasons for deactivation
among those for whom this share was less than one. Together, these figures suggest that the small
group of intentional reactivators accounts for the vast majority of Treatment group non-compliance.
Given this, combined with the fact that the Control group was also found to be deactivated for a
small share of weeks 1-4, we will analyze the experiment as a randomized encouragement design.


4     Empirical Strategy
4.1    Pre-Analysis Plan
We submitted our pre-analysis plan on October 12, as this was the final day before the Treatment
and Control groups could have begun to differ. We submitted a slightly updated pre-analysis-plan
on November 7, the day before endline, with only one substantive change: on the basis of data
on reasons for non-compliance described above, we specified that our primary specifications would
use IV estimates instead of intent-to-treat estimates. The pre-analysis plan specified three things.
First, it specified the outcome variables and families of outcome variables as described above,
including which specific variables are included in the index for each family and which outcomes are
“secondary.” Versions of Figures 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 12 appear as figure shells in the pre-analysis
plan, although we changed some variable labels as well as the order in which we present the
families of outcome variables for expositional purposes. Second, the pre-analysis plan specified the
moderators we use when testing for heterogeneous treatment effects, including which moderators
are “secondary.” Third, it specified the two regression specifications and the estimation sample as
described below.

4.2    Empirical Strategy
To estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) of Facebook deactivation, define Yi as some
outcome measured at endline, and Y bi as a vector including the baseline value of the outcome and
the baseline value of the index that includes the outcome.17 Define Di as the percent of deactivation
   17
      Y bi excludes the baseline value of the outcome for outcomes such as clicks on post-endline emails that do not
have a baseline value. Y bi excludes the baseline index when Yi is not included in an index. When Yi is an index, Y bi
is simply the baseline value of the index.


                                                         17
checks between October 13th and November 7th that person i is observed to be deactivated. Define
Ti ∈ {1, 0} as a Treatment group indicator, and νs as the vector of the 48 stratum dummies. We
estimate local average treatment effects of deactivation using the following regression:


                                           Yi = τ Di + ρY bi + νs + εi ,                                          (1)

instrumenting for Di with Ti . In Equation (1), τ measures the local average treatment effect of
deactivation for people induced to deactivate by the promised $102 payment.18
    The base sample for all regressions is the “impact evaluation sample”—again, participants who
were willing to accept less than $102 to deactivate in weeks 1-4 (the four weeks after midline) and
were offered p = $102 or p = $0 to do so. For the political polarization outcomes, the sample
includes only Democrats and Republicans, as well as independents who lean toward one party or
the other. Sample sizes sometimes differ across outcomes due to missing data: for example, the
post-endline survey has higher non-response than the endline survey, and many participants do not
have Twitter accounts.
    We use robust standard errors in all regressions.


5     Impact Evaluation
This section presents treatment effects of Facebook deactivation. The following subsections present
estimates for four groups of outcomes: substitution, news and political outcomes, subjective well-
being, and post-experiment Facebook use and opinions. We then present heterogeneous treatment
effects. Finally, we provide evidence on experimenter demand effects.
    In the body of the paper, we present figures with local average treatment effects and 95 percent
confidence intervals from estimates of Equation (1), with outcome variables Yi normalized so that
the Control group standard deviation equals one. Appendix Tables A10 and A11 provide numerical
regression results for all individual outcome variables in both normalized (standard deviation) units,
as in the figures, and un-normalized (original) units. Appendix Table A12 provides numerical
regression results for all nine summary indices. These appendix tables also provide unadjusted
  18
     Facebook deactivation might have a larger impact for people who use Facebook more. Define Hi as person i’s
average daily hours of Facebook use reported at baseline, winsorized at 120 minutes. We can also estimate the local
average treatment effect of deactivation per hour of daily Facebook use avoided using the following regression:

                                        Yi = τ Di Hi + βHi + ρY bi + νs + εi ,                                     (2)
analogously instrumenting for Di Hi with Ti Hi .
   If effects of deactivation are indeed linear in avoided hours of Facebook use, then Equation (2) could provide more
statistical power than Equation (1). On the other hand, if effects are closer to constant in baseline usage and/or Hi
is measured with error, then Equation (1) will offer more power. In our pre-analysis plan, we specified that we would
make either Equation (1) or Equation (2) our primary specification, depending on which delivered more power. In
reality, the results are very similar. Therefore, we focus on Equation (1) because it is simpler. Appendix E presents
results using Equation (2).

p-values and “sharpened” False Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted p-values following the procedure
of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli (2006), as outlined by Anderson (2008). The unadjusted
p-values are appropriate for readers with a priori interest in one specific outcome. The FDR-
adjusted p-values for the individual outcomes limit the expected proportion of false rejections of
null hypotheses across all individual outcomes reported in the paper, while the FDR-adjusted p-
values for the indices limit the expected proportion of false rejections of null hypotheses across
the nine indices. The sharpened FDR-adjusted p-values are less conservative than the unadjusted
p-values for p-values greater than about 0.15, and more conservative for unadjusted p-values less
than that.

5.1      Substitutes for Facebook
Figure 2 presents treatment effects on substitutes for Facebook: substitute time uses, social interac-
tions, and substitute news sources. Substitution is of interest for two reasons. First, our treatment
entails deactivating Facebook and also re-allocating that time to other activities. Understanding
that re-allocation is thus crucial for conceptually understanding the “treatment.” Second, this sub-
stitution helps to understand mechanisms for key effects. One central mechanism through which
Facebook might affect psychological well-being is by crowding out face-to-face interactions. How-
ever, it’s also possible that when people deactivate, they primarily devote their newly available time
to other solitary pursuits. Furthermore, a central mechanism for possible political externalities is
that social media use crowds out consumption of higher-quality news. However, it’s also possible
that when people deactivate, they simply get less news overall instead of substituting to other news
sources.
       The top group of outcomes in Figure 2 measures self-reported time use. Facebook usage was
reported in minutes. For all other activities, the endline survey asked respondents how much time
they spent on the activity in the last four weeks relative to what is typical for them, on a five-point
scale from “A lot less” to “A lot more.” For all time use outcomes, “Same” is the average answer
in the Control group.
       The first row confirms that the treatment indeed reduced Facebook use as intended. At endline,
the Control group reported that they had used Facebook for an average of 59.53 minutes per day
over the past four weeks, and the local average treatment effect of deactivation is 59.58 minutes
per day.19 As shown on Figure 2, this corresponds to a reduction of 1.59 standard deviations.
       We find that Facebook deactivation reduced time devoted to other online activities. Time using
non-Facebook social media falls by a quarter point on our five-point scale (0.27 SD), and time
on non-social online activities falls by 0.12 points (0.14 SD). Thus, Facebook appears to be a
  19
    Appendix Table A5 reports baseline means of our time use variables. The mean of self-reported Facebook minutes
at baseline is 74.5 minutes per day, and the mean of reported minutes using the Facebook mobile app at baseline is
60 minutes per day.



                                                       19
complement rather than a substitute for other online activities. This makes sense to the extent
that deactivating Facebook makes people less likely to be using their phones or computers in the
first place, and less likely to follow Facebook links that direct to non-Facebook sites (e.g., a news
website or Twitter post). Furthermore, the Treatment group may have avoided logging into other
apps such as Spotify and Tinder because we had informed participants that using Facebook to
actively log into other apps would reactivate Facebook.
   Rows 4-7 of Figure 2 suggest that the 60 minutes freed up by not using Facebook, as well as the
additional minutes from reductions in other online activities, were allocated to both solitary and
social activities offline. Solitary television watching increases by 0.17 points on our scale (0.17 SD),
other solitary offline activities increase by 0.23 points (0.25 SD), and time devoted to spending time
with friends and family increases by 0.14 points (0.16 SD). The substitute time uses index, which
does not include Facebook minutes, shows an increase in overall non-Facebook activities. All of the
online and offline time use effects are highly significant with and without adjustment for multiple
hypothesis testing.
   The middle group of outcomes in Figure 2 contains measures of social interaction. Deactivation
increased the count of offline activities that people reported doing at least once last week by about
0.18 (0.12 SD). Appendix Figure A29 shows that the specific activities with the largest point
estimates are going out to dinner, getting together with friends, and spending time with parents.
The point estimates for the other offline activities we measure (going to the cinema, talking to
friends on the phone, going to a party, going shopping, and spending time with your kids) are all
very close to zero. Notwithstanding the positive effects on offline activities, there are no statistically
significant effects on the number of friends that participants listed as having met in person last week,
or on diverse interactions (whether or not they interacted with someone who voted differently in
the last presidential election or interacted with someone from another country). We find no effects
on the social interaction index, although the point estimate is positive.
   The bottom group of outcomes in Figure 2 measures news consumption. As with the substitute
time uses, the endline survey asked participants how much time they spent getting news from each
source in the last four weeks relative to what is typical for them; “Same” is again the average
answer in the Control group. As expected, Facebook deactivation substantially reduced the extent
to which people said they relied on Facebook as a news source. Consistent with the time use
results, the Treatment group also got substantially less news from non-Facebook social media sites
(0.36 SD). The point estimates for print, radio, and TV news are all positive but statistically
insignificant. Facebook deactivation has a positive but insignificant effect on Twitter use. As we
discuss below in the news knowledge results, deactivation reduced the total time subjects report
spending consuming news by eight minutes per day, or 15 percent of the Control group mean of 52
minutes.
   Overall, these results suggest that Facebook is a substitute for offline activities but a complement


                                                   20
to other online activities. This suggests the possibility that Facebook could reduce subjective
well-being by reducing in-person interactions, but also impose positive political externalities by
increasing news knowledge. Below, we test these possibilities more directly.

5.2    Effects on News and Political Outcomes
Figure 3 presents treatment effects on news and political outcomes: news knowledge, political
engagement, and political polarization. News knowledge and political engagement are of interest
because well-functioning democratic societies fundamentally rely on well-informed voters who ac-
tually show up to the polls to vote. Political polarization is of interest because it is may make
democratic decision making less efficient, and may lead citizens to perceive democratic outcomes
as less legitimate (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012; Iyengar and Westwood 2015).
    Deactivation caused substantial reductions in both self-reported attention to news and directly
measured news knowledge. The top three rows show that deactivation reduced how much people
reported they followed news about politics and about President Trump (by 0.14 and 0.11 SD,
respectively), as well as the average minutes per day spent consuming news (a drop of eight minutes
per day, or 15 percent of the control group mean). Accuracy on our news knowledge quiz fell by
0.12 standard deviations.20 Tangibly, the Control group answered an average of 7.26 out of the 10
news knowledge questions correctly (counting “unsure” as 1/2 correct), and deactivation reduced
this average by 0.14. There is no detectable effect on fake news knowledge, possibly reflecting the
limited reach of even the highly shared fake news items included in our survey. Overall, deactivation
reduced the news knowledge index by about 0.19 standard deviations.
    There are no statistically detectable effects on political engagement. As reported in Appendix
Tables A10 and A11, the point estimates suggest that deactivation increased turnout by three
percentage points according to the administrative data and decreased turnout by three percentage
points according to the self-reported data, and neither estimate is statistically different from zero.
Similarly, the Treatment and Control groups are statistically equally likely to have clicked on any
link in the post-endline politics email. Appendix Figure A35 does show a marginally significant
negative effect on voted Republican, suggesting that deactivation may have reduced support for
Republican congressional candidates. The unadjusted p-value is 0.06, the sharpened FDR-adjusted
p-value is 0.08, and we had labeled this as a “secondary outcome” in our pre-analysis plan.
    Prior research has shown that people tend to be exposed to ideologically congenial news content
in general (Gentzkow and Shapiro 2011) and on Facebook in particular (Bakshy, Messing, and
   20
      Appendix G presents more analysis of the effects on news knowledge, including effects on each individual news
knowledge and fake news knowledge question. All but one of the point estimates for the 10 news knowledge questions is
negative. The news knowledge questions with the largest effects involve correctly responding that Elizabeth Warren’s
DNA test had revealed Native American ancestry and that Jeff Sessions had resigned at President Trump’s request.
There was also a statistically significant difference in knowledge about one fake news story: the Treatment group was
less likely to correctly respond that Cesar Sayoc, the suspect in an act of domestic terrorism directed at critics of
President Trump, was not a registered Democrat.


                                                         21
Adamic 2015). Thus, the above finding that deactivation reduced news exposure naturally suggests
that deactivation might have also reduced political polarization.
       Indeed, deactivation did reduce political polarization. Point estimates are negative for all polar-
ization measures. The largest and most significant individual effect is on congenial news exposure:
deactivation decreased the number of times that people reportedly saw news that made them better
understand the point of view of their own political party relative to the other party. Deactivation
also decreased issue polarization, which Fiorina and Abrams (2008) single out as the “most direct”
way of measuring polarization.21 Appendix Table A10 shows that both of these effects are highly
significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing. The other measures with the largest
point estimates are party anger and party affective polarization, although these individual effects
are not statistically significant. Overall, deactivation reduced the political polarization index by
about 0.16 standard deviations.22
       Figure 4 illustrates how deactivation reduced issue polarization, by plotting the distribution of
“issue opinions” for Democrats and Republicans in Treatment and Control at endline. Our issue
opinions measure exactly parallels the issue polarization variable used in the regressions, except
that we keep opinions on a left-to-right scale, with more negative indicating more agreement with
the average Democratic opinion, and more positive indicating more agreement with the average
Republican opinion. (By contrast, the issue polarization variable multiplies Democrats’ responses
by -1, so that a more positive value reflects more agreement with the average opinion in one’s
political party.) We then normalize issue opinions to have a standard deviation of one in the
Control group. The figure shows that deactivation moves both Democrats and Republicans visibly
toward the center. In the Control group, the issue opinions of the average Democrat and the
average Republican differ by 1.47 standard deviations. In the Treatment group, this difference is
1.35 standard deviations—about eight percent less.
       Are these polarization effects large or small? As one benchmark, we can compare these effects
to the increase in political polarization in the US since 1996, well before the advent of social media.
Using data from the American National Election Studies, Boxell (2018) calculates that the change
in a different index of polarization measures increased by 0.38 standard deviations between 1996
and 2016. The 0.16 standard deviation effect of Facebook deactivation on political polarization in
our sample is about 42 percent as large as this increase.23
  21
      Appendix Figure A30 presents results for each of the issue polarization questions. The issues for which deactiva-
tion caused the largest decrease in polarization were the direction of racial bias in policing and whether the Mueller
investigation is biased.
   22
      Like all of our outcome families, the polarization index includes a range of different outcomes with different
interpretations. Exposure to congenial news is conceptually different from affective polarization and issue polarization.
Appendix Table A16 shows that the effect on the political polarization index is robust to excluding each of the seven
individual component variables in turn, although the point estimate moves toward zero and the unadjusted p-value
rises to 0.09 when omitting congenial news exposure.
   23
      Specifically, Boxell’s polarization index increased by 0.269 units from 1996-2016, and the standard deviation of
Boxell’s polarization index across people in 2016 is 0.710 units, so political polarization increased by 0.269/0.71 ≈



                                                           22
    Overall, these results suggest that Facebook plays a role in helping people stay informed about
current events, but also increases polarization, particularly of views on political issues.

5.3    Effects on Subjective Well-Being
Figure 5 presents estimates of effects on subjective well-being (SWB). These outcomes are of in-
terest because, as discussed in the introduction, many studies show cross-sectional or time-series
correlations between social media use and well-being, and on this basis researchers have speculated
that social media may have serious adverse effects on mental health. The outcomes are re-signed
so that more positive represents better SWB—for example, the “depressed” variable is multiplied
by (-1).
    We find that deactivation indeed significantly increases SWB. All but one of the ten point
estimates are positive. The magnitudes are relatively small overall, with the largest and most
significant effects on life satisfaction (0.12 SD), anxiety (0.10 SD), depression (0.09 SD), and
happiness (0.08 SD).24 All of these effects remain significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis
testing. The text message based measures of happiness are not significantly different from zero,
with positive point estimates ranging from 0.01 SD to 0.06 SD. Deactivation improved our overall
SWB index by 0.09 standard deviations.
    Are these subjective well-being effects large or small? As one benchmark, we can consider the
effect sizes in their original units, focusing on the measures with the largest effects. Happiness is the
average response to two questions (for example, “Over the last 4 weeks, I think I was ...”) on a scale
from 1 (not a very happy person) to 7 (a very happy person). The Control group endline average
is 4.47 out of a possible 7, and deactivation caused an average increase of 0.12. Life satisfaction
is the extent of agreement with three questions (for example, “During the past four weeks, I was
satisfied with my life”) on seven-point Likert scales from “strongly disagree” “Strongly agree.” The
Control group endline average is 12.26 out of a possible 21, and deactivation caused an average
increase of 0.56. Depressed and anxious are responses to the question, “Please tell us how much
of the time during the past four weeks you felt [depressed/anxious],” where 1 is “None or almost
none of the time” and 4 is “All or almost all of the time.” The average responses are 2.99 and 2.60,
respectively, and deactivation caused average increases of 0.08 and 0.09.
    As a second benchmark, a meta-analysis of 39 randomized evaluations finds that positive psy-
0.379 standard deviations over that period. Of course, this benchmarking exercise does not imply that political
polarization in the US would have increased by one-third less in the absence of Facebook, for many reasons. For
example, the treatment effects in our sample from a four-week deactivation are unlikely to generalize to the US
population over Facebook’s 15-year life. Furthermore, some of our polarization measures are unique to our study.
The one measure that appears in both Boxell’s index and our index, party affective polarization, rose by 0.18 standard
deviations between 1996 and 2016. Our point estimate of -0.06 standard deviations is about one-third of this amount,
although this estimate is not statistically different from zero.
  24
     Appendix Figure A34 presents results for the individual questions within the happiness, life satisfaction, and
loneliness scales.



                                                         23
chology interventions (i.e. self-help therapy, group training, and individual therapy) improve sub-
jective well-being (excluding depression) by 0.34 standard deviations and reduce depression by 0.23
standard deviations (Bolier et al. 2013). Thus, deactivating Facebook increased our subjective
well-being index by about 25-40 percent as much as standard psychological interventions.
       As a third benchmark, Appendix Table A17 presents a regression of our baseline SWB index
on key demographics (income, college completion, gender, race, age, and political party). College
completion is conditionally associated with 0.23 standard deviations higher SWB. Thus, the effect
of deactivating Facebook is just over one-third of the conditional difference in subjective well-
being between college grads and everyone else. The table also shows that a $10,000 increase in
income is conditionally associated with a 0.027 standard deviation increase in SWB. Thus, the
effect of deactivating Facebook is equal to the conditional difference in subjective well-being from
about $30,000 additional income. This income equivalent is large because “money doesn’t buy
happiness”: although income is correlated with SWB, the slope of that relationship is not very
steep.
       Appendix Figure A31 presents effects on the SMS outcomes by week of the experiment, to
test whether the effects might have some trend over time. None of the effects on any of the
three outcomes is statistically significant in any of the four weeks. The point estimates do not
systematically increase or decrease over time, and if anything, the point estimates are largest in
the first week. This suggests that the effects of a longer deactivation might not be different.
       We can also compare our SWB effects to what we would have estimated using the kind of
correlational approach taken by many previous non-experimental studies. These studies often have
specific designs and outcomes that don’t map closely to our paper, so it is difficult to directly
compare effect sizes with other papers. We can, however, replicate the empirical strategy of simple
correlation studies in our data, and compare our cross-sectional correlations to the experimental
results. To do this, we regress SWB outcomes at baseline on daily average Facebook use over the
past four weeks as of baseline, divided by the local average treatment effect of deactivation on daily
average Facebook use between midline and endline, so that the coefficients are both in units of
average use per day over the past four weeks.25
       The baseline correlation between our SWB index and Facebook use is about three times larger
than the experimental estimate of the treatment effect of deactivation (about 0.23 SD compared to
0.09 SD), and the point estimates are highly statistically significantly different. Controlling for basic
demographics brings down the non-experimental estimate somewhat, but it remains economically
  25
       Specifically, the non-experimental estimates are from the following regression:

                                                  Yib = τ H̃i + βX i + i ,                                       (3)
   where Yib is participant i’s value of some outcome measured in the baseline survey, X i is a vector of basic demo-
graphic variables (household income, age, and college, male, white, Republican, and Democrat indicators), and H̃i
is baseline average daily Facebook use over the past four weeks (winsorized at 120 minutes per day) divided by the
local average treatment effect on average daily Facebook use between midline and endline.


                                                            24
and statistically larger than our experimental estimate. Appendix Figure A32 presents the full
results for all SWB outcomes.26 These findings are consistent with reverse causality, for example if
people who are lonely or depressed spending more time on Facebook, or with omitted variables, for
example if lower socio-economic status is associated with both heavy use and lower well-being. They
could also reflect a difference between the relatively short-term effects measured in our experiment
and the longer-term effects picked up in the cross-section. However, the lack of a detectable trend
in treatment effects on the text message outcomes over the course of our experiment (as noted
above and seen in Appendix Figure A31) points away from this hypothesis.
       Subjects’ own descriptions in follow-up interviews and free-response questions are consistent
with these quantitative findings, while also highlighting substantial heterogeneity in the effects.
Many participants described deactivation as an unambiguously positive experience. One said in an
interview,

         I was way less stressed. I wasn’t attached to my phone as much as I was before. And I
         found I didn’t really care so much about things that were happening [online] because I
         was more focused on my own life... I felt more content. I think I was in a better mood
         generally. I thought I would miss seeing everyone’s day-to-day activities... I really didn’t
         miss it at all.

A second wrote, “I realized how much time I was wasting. I now have time for other things. I’ve
been reading books and playing the piano, which I used to do daily until the phone took over.”
       A third wrote, “I realized I was using it too much and it wasn’t making me happy. I hate all of
the interactions I had with people in comment sections.”
       Many others highlighted ways in which deactivation was difficult. One said in an interview,

         I was shut off from those [online] conversations, or just from being an observer of what
         people are doing or thinking. . . I didn’t like it at first at all, I felt very cut off from
         people that I like. . . I didn’t like it because I spend a lot of time by myself anyway, I’m
         kind of an introvert, so I use Facebook in a social aspect in a very big way.

Others described the difficulty of not being able to post for special events such as family birthdays
and not being able to participate in online groups.
       Overall, our data suggest that Facebook does indeed have adverse effects on SWB. However, the
magnitude of these effects is moderate and may be smaller than correlation studies would suggest,
and our qualitative interviews suggest that the average effect likely masks substantial heterogeneity.
  26
     One could also do similar experimental vs. non-experimental comparisons for other outcomes, but we have done
this only for SWB because SWB is the focus of the non-experimental literature in this area.




                                                       25
5.4    Post-Experiment Facebook Use and Opinions
Figure 6 presents effects of deactivation on post-experiment demand for Facebook as well as par-
ticipants’ subjective opinions about Facebook. These results are closely related to the findings
on subjective well-being, as we might expect participants who found deactivation increased their
happiness would choose to use Facebook less in the future. They also speak more directly to the
popular debate over whether social media are addictive and harmful. If deactivation reduces post-
experiment Facebook use, this is consistent with standard habit formation models such as Becker
and Murphy (1988), or with learning models in which experiencing deactivation caused people to
learn that they would be better off if they used Facebook less.27
    Deactivation clearly reduced post-experiment demand for Facebook. These effects are very
stark, with by far the largest magnitude of any of our main findings. The effect on reported
intentions to use Facebook as of the endline survey is a reduction of 0.78 standard deviations:
while the average Control group participant planned to reduce future Facebook use by 22 percent,
deactivation caused the Treatment group to plan to reduce Facebook use by an additional 21 percent
relative to Control. In our post-endline survey a month after the experiment ended, we measured
whether people actually followed through on these intentions, by asking people how much time they
had spent on the Facebook mobile app on the average day in the past week. Deactivation reduces
this post-endline Facebook mobile app use by 12 minutes per day, or 0.31 standard deviations.
This is a 23 percent reduction relative to the Control group mean of 53 minutes per day, lining
up almost exactly with the planned reductions reported at endline. However, Appendix Table A13
shows that the reduction is less than half as large (8 percent of the Control group mean) and
not statistically significant (with a t-statistic of -1.16) if we limit the sample to iPhone users who
reported their usage as recorded by their Settings app, thereby excluding participants who were
reporting personal estimates of their usage.
    As a different (and non-self-reported) measure of post-experiment use, we can look at the speed
with which people reactivated their Facebook accounts following the 24-hour post-endline period in
which both Control and Treatment were deactivated. Figure 7 presents the share of our deactivation
checks in which the Treatment and Control groups were deactivated, by day of the experiment.28
By day 35, one week after the end of the experiment, 11 percent of the Treatment group was still
deactivated, compared to three percent of the Control group. By day 91, nine weeks after the end
  27
     Appendix Figure A33 presents histograms of participants’ opinions about Facebook at baseline. People are evenly
divided on whether Facebook is good or bad for themselves and for society and whether Facebook makes people more
or less happy. Consistent with our results, people tend to think that Facebook helps people to follow the news better
and makes people more politically polarized.
  28
     There is a slight dip in deactivation rates for the Treatment group seven days after the deactivation period began.
This was caused by the fact that some participants failed to turn off a default setting in which Facebook reactivates
users’ profiles after seven days of deactivation. For technical reasons, our deactivation checking algorithm checked
the entire Control group once every few days between midline and endline in order to check the Treatment group
four times per day. After endline, we returned to checking all participants approximately once per day.



                                                          26
of the experiment, five percent of the Treatment group was still deactivated, against 2.5 percent
of Control. As Figure 6 shows, the local average treatment effect on the speed of reactivation is a
highly significant 0.59 standard deviations. Overall, deactivation clearly decreased post-experiment
use, reducing the index by 0.61 standard deviations. As introduced above, is consistent with models
of habit formation or learning.
       The bottom group of outcomes in Figure 6 supplement the post-experiment use outcomes by
measuring participants’ qualitative opinions about Facebook. These are re-signed so that more
positive means more positive opinions, so agreement with the statement that “Facebook exposes
people to clickbait or false news stories” and the length of text about Facebook’s negative impacts
are both multiplied by (-1). The results are mixed. Deactivation increases the extent to which
participants think Facebook helps them follow the news better, and it also makes participants agree
more that people would miss Facebook if they stopped using it. On the other hand, participants who
deactivated for four weeks instead of 24 hours were more likely to say that their deactivation was
good for them.29 Deactivation increases both the positive impacts and negative impacts variables,
i.e. it makes people write more about both positive and negative aspects of Facebook. Overall,
deactivation had no statistically significant effect on the Facebook opinions index.
       Figure 8 presents the distributions of Treatment and Control responses to two key questions
reflecting opinions about Facebook. Both Treatment and Control tended to agree that “if people
spent less time on Facebook, they would soon realize that they don’t miss it,” but deactivation
weakened that view. On this figure, the Treatment group’s average response on the scale from -5
to +5 was -1.8, while the Control group’s average response is -2.0. The bottom right panel shows
that both Treatment and Control tended to think that deactivation was good for them, but the
Treatment group is more likely to think that their (longer) deactivation was good for them. On this
figure, the Treatment group’s average response on the scale from -5 to +5 is -2.3, while the Control
group’s average response is -1.9. Remarkably, about 80 percent of the Treatment group thought
that deactivation was at least somewhat good for them, and the modal response was the strongest
possible agreement that deactivation was good (the left-most bar on the histogram). In both panels,
the Treatment group has a wider dispersion of responses, with more people strongly agreeing and
more people strongly disagreeing. This highlights the importance of testing for treatment effect
heterogeneity, which we will do in the next section.
       To give a richer sense of how deactivation affected Facebook use, the post-endline survey in-
cluded a free-response question in which we asked people to write how they had changed their
Facebook use since participating in the study. We then use standard text analysis tools to de-
termine how the Treatment and Control groups responded differently. Specifically, we processed
  29
    One should be cautious in interpreting this effect, as it could result both from a change of opinion about Facebook
and from the difference in length of the deactivation they were evaluating. As we shall see below, the Control group
also tends to believe that deactivation was good for them, but the modal answer was 0 (i.e., neither good nor bad),
suggesting that many people were indifferent to such a short deactivation.



                                                          27
the text by stemming words to their linguistic roots (for example, “changes,” “changing,” and
“changed” all become “chang”), removing common “stop words” (such as “the” and “that”), and
making lists of all one, two, three, and four word phrases that appeared five or more times in the
sample. We then constructed Pearson’s χ2 statistic, which measures the extent of differential usage
rates between Treatment and Control; the phrases with the highest χ2 are especially unbalanced
between the two groups. This parallels Gentzkow and Shapiro’s (2010) approach to determining
which phrases are used more by Republicans vs. Democrats, except we determine which phrases
are used more by Treatment vs. Control.
   The two panels of Table 4 present the 20 highest-χ2 phrases that were more common in Treat-
ment and in Control. The Treatment group was relatively likely to write that they were using
Facebook less or not at all (“use much less,” “not use facebook anymor,” “stop use facebook”) or
more judiciously—the phrase “use news app” is mostly from people saying that they have switched
to getting news from their phone’s news app instead of Facebook. By contrast, while a few of
the Control group’s most common phrases indicate lower use (variants of “more aware much time
spend” and “use facebook slightli less”), the great majority of their relatively common phrases
indicate that their Facebook use has not changed.
   To more deeply understand the ways in which deactivation changed people’s relationship to
Facebook, we partnered with a team of qualitative researchers who analyzed our survey data and
additional participant interviews (Baym, Wagman, and Persaud 2019). They find that many partic-
ipants emphasized that their time off of Facebook led them to use the platform more “consciously,”
aligning their behavior with their desired use. For example, some participants discussed avoiding
their news feed and only looking at their Facebook groups, while others removed the Facebook app
from their phones and only accessed the site using their computers.

5.5     Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
5.5.1    Individual Moderators

In our pre-analysis plan, we specified that we would present separate estimates for subgroups defined
by four primary moderators. Figure 9 presents those estimates. The top panel presents estimates
for heavy users vs. light users—that is, people whose baseline reported Facebook use was above vs.
below median. There is no consistent evidence that the effects are different for people who report
being heavier users, perhaps because Facebook use is measured with noise.
   The second panel presents estimates for heavy news users vs. light news users—that is, those
who get news from Facebook fairly often or very often vs. never, hardly ever, or sometimes. As one
might expect, the estimated effects for news knowledge are larger for people who get more news
from Facebook, but this difference is not statistically significant. The pre-analysis plan specified
that we would limit these tests to only the news and political outcomes in Section 5.2,


                                                 28
   The third panel presents separate estimates for active users vs. passive users. We measure this
using two questions: share of active vs. passive browsing using a question based on the Passive and
Active Facebook Use Measure (Gerson, Plagnol, and Corr 2017), and “what share of your time on
Facebook do you spend interacting one-on-one with people you care about.” Active vs. passive
users are defined as having above- vs. below-median sum of their two responses to these questions.
This moderator is of interest because of a set of papers cited in the introduction suggesting that
passive Facebook use can be harmful to subjective well-being, while active use might be neutral or
beneficial. Perhaps surprisingly, we see no differences in the effects of deactivation on the subjective
well-being index. The pre-analysis plan specified that we would limit these tests to the four families
reported in the figure.
   Finally, the fourth panel presents separate estimates of effects on subjective well-being text
message surveys for text messages sent during the time of day when the respondent reported using
Facebook the most. We see no clear differences in the effects on subjective well-being.
   The pre-analysis plan also specified two secondary moderators: age (for all outcomes) and
political party (limited to the news and political outcomes). We considered these secondary because
we did not have a strong prior that we would be able to detect heterogeneous effects. Appendix
Figure A9 presents estimates of effects on these outcomes. There are no systematic patterns.
   Appendix Figure A9 also includes heterogeneity by above vs. below-median valuation of Face-
book. While we added this moderator only after the pre-analysis plan was submitted, it is impor-
tant because our impact evaluation sample only includes participants with WTA less than $102.
Under the assumption that marginal treatment effects are monotonic in WTA, treatment effect
heterogeneity within our impact evaluation sample would be informative about treatment effects
for the full population. The effects for above- vs. below-median WTA differ statistically for only
one index: the effects on political polarization are driven by above-median WTA participants.
The above-median WTA point estimate is larger and statistically indistinguishable for two indices,
smaller and statistically indistinguishable for four indices, and opposite-signed for the final index.
This provides some support for the view that effect sizes would not be systematically different in
the full Facebook user population including users with higher valuations.
   Appendix Figure A9 presents one additional test of external validity that was suggested by a
referee after the pre-analysis plan was submitted. We construct sample weights that match the
impact evaluation sample to the observable characteristics of Facebook users in Table 2. Appendix
Figure A9 shows that participants with below- vs. above-median sample weights—that is, the
types of people who were especially likely vs. unlikely to participate in the study—do not have
systematically different treatment effects. This provides some further support for the view that
effect sizes would be similar in the full Facebook user population.
   Appendix F presents heterogeneous treatment effects on each individual outcome.




                                                  29
5.5.2      All Possible Moderators

Many factors other than the specific variables we specified above might moderate treatment effects
of Facebook deactivation. To search for additional possible moderators, we test whether any of the
demographics or outcome variable indices collected at baseline might moderate treatment effects
on the key outcomes of interest. We consider six outcomes: the latter five indices (news knowledge,
political polarization, subjective well-being, post-experiment use, and Facebook opinions) plus the
variable deactivation bad, which we add because of the heterogeneity displayed in Figure 8. We
consider 13 potential moderators: all six demographic variables listed in Table 2 (income, years
of education, gender, race, age, and political party affiliation, which is on a seven-point scale
from strongly Democratic to strongly Republican) and the baseline values of all seven relevant
indices.30 We normalize each potential moderator to have a standard deviation of one, and we
denote normalized moderator k by Xik .
       For all outcomes other than deactivation bad, we estimate the following modified version of
Equation (1):


                               Yi = τ Di + αk Di Xik + ζXik + ρY bi + νs + εi ,                                (4)

instrumenting for Di and Di Xik with Ti and Ti Xik . For deactivation bad, we simply estimate
Yi = αk Xik + εi in the Treatment group only; this identifies what types of people in the Treatment
group thought that deactivation was particularly good or bad. In total, we carry out 78 tests in 78
separate regressions: 13 potential moderators for each of the six outcomes.
       There are many ways to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects, including causal forests
Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager (2019) and lasso procedures. We chose this approach because it
delivers easily interpretable estimates.
       Figure 10 presents the interaction coefficients α̂k and 95 percent confidence intervals for each
of the six outcomes. To keep the figures concise, we plot only the five moderators with the largest
absolute values of α̂k , so there are another eight smaller unreported α̂k coefficients for each outcome.
       We highlight three key results. First, deactivation may reduce polarization more (i.e., Facebook
use may increase polarization more) for older people, white people, and men. Second, Facebook
deactivation has less positive effect on subjective well-being for people who have more offline social
interactions and are already more happy at baseline. This suggests that Facebook use may have
the unfortunate effect of reducing SWB more for people with greater social and psychological need.
In our sample, these “higher-need” people also use Facebook more heavily. Third, people may
have some intuition about whether they will like deactivation: people with more positive baseline
opinions about Facebook are less likely to decrease their post-experiment use and less likely to
  30
     There are originally nine indices. We exclude the baseline substitute time uses index because it is not easily
interpretable, and we exclude the baseline post-experiment use index because this only includes Facebook mobile app
use.


                                                        30
think that deactivation was good for them.

5.6        Experimenter Demand Effects
Most of our outcomes are self-reported, and it would have been difficult to further conceal the
intent of the randomized experiment. This raises the possibility of experimenter demand effects,
i.e. that survey responses depend on what participants think the researchers want them to say. To
test for demand effects, the endline survey asked, “Do you think the researchers in this study had
an agenda?” Table 5 presents the possible responses and shares by treatment group.
         For demand effects to arise, participants must believe that the researchers want a particular
pattern of responses. Table 5 shows that 62 percent of both Treatment and Control groups thought
we had no particular agenda or were not sure. This suggests that demand effects would not arise for
a solid majority of our sample. However, demand effects could arise for the remaining 38 percent.
         For experimenter demand effects to bias our treatment effects, either (i) the Treatment and
Control groups must have different beliefs about what the researchers want, or (ii) participants
must sense what treatment group they are in and change their answers to generate the treatment
effect that they think the researchers want (or don’t want). Table 5 shows that possibility (i) is
not true: perceived researcher agenda is closely balanced between Treatment and Control. To test
for possibility (ii), we can estimate treatment effects separately for the subsample that thought
that we “wanted to show that Facebook is bad for people” vs. all other participants. If (ii) is
true, then our results should be different in these two subsamples. Appendix Figure A36 shows
that this is not the case: the effects on outcome indices that look “good” or “bad” for Facebook
(e.g. news knowledge, political polarization, subjective well-being, and post-experiment use) are
not statistically different, and there is no pattern of point estimates to suggest that the results are
generally more “good” or “bad” in one of the two subsamples.
         Of course, these tests are only suggestive. But combined with the fact that the non-self-reported
outcomes paint a similar picture to the self-reports, these tests suggest that demand effects are
unlikely to be a major source of bias in our results.


6         Measuring the Consumer Surplus from Facebook
Quantifying the economic gains from free online services such as search and media is particularly
important given that these services represent an increasingly large share of the global economy. This
measurement has been particularly challenging because the lack of price variation (or any price at
all) makes it impossible to use standard demand estimation to measure consumer surplus.31 In
this section, we present two back-of-the-envelope consumer surplus calculations. First, we employ
    31
   As mentioned in the introduction, see Brynjolfsson and Saunders (2009), Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016),
Nakamura, Samuels, and Soloveichik (2016), Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson (2018), and Syverson (2017).


                                                      31
the standard assumption that willingness-to-accept identifies consumer surplus. Second, we adjust
consumer surplus to account for the possibility that deactivation might help people learn their true
valuation of Facebook. This adjustment highlights the challenges in using willingness-to-accept as
a measure of consumer welfare.

6.1    Standard Consumer Surplus Estimate
In a standard model, willingness-to-accept to abstain from Facebook equals consumer surplus.
Figure 11 presents the histogram of WTA to deactivate Facebook for the four weeks after midline
instead of only the 24 hours after midline. The median is $100, and almost 20 percent had valuations
greater than $500. After winsorizing valuations at $1000, the mean is $203. After re-weighting the
sample to match the observable characteristics of Facebook users in Table 2, the median is still
$100, and the winsorized mean is $180. Multiplying the mean by the estimated 172 million US
Facebook users would imply that 27 days of Facebook generates $31 billion of consumer surplus.
    Our sample’s WTA for Facebook abstention is larger than in most other studies, but not all. In
an online panel weighted for national representativeness, Brynjolfsson, Eggers, and Gannamaneni
(2018) estimate that the mean WTA to not use Facebook for one month is $48, and that the median
WTA to hypothetically stop using social media for one year was $205 in 2016 and $322 in 2017.
In their sample of European college students, Brynjolfsson, Eggers, and Gannamaneni (2018) find
a median WTA of $175 for one month.32 In samples of college students, residents of a college
town, and Amazon MTurk workers, Corrigan et al. (2018) estimate that the mean annualized
WTA to deactivate Facebook ranges from $1,139 to $1,921, depending on the sample and the
length of deactivation. In a sample of college students, Mosquera et al. (2018) estimate that the
median (mean) WTA to not use Facebook for one week is $15 ($25). In an unincentivized (stated
preference) survey of MTurk workers, Sunstein (2019) found a $1 per month median willingness-
to-pay for Facebook and a $59 per month median willingness-to-accept to not use Facebook.
    There are many caveats to using this type of stylized calculation to approximate the consumer
surplus from Facebook. First, we (and Corrigan et al.) required participants to deactivate their
Facebook accounts instead of simply abstaining from logging in. For people who planned to avoid
using other apps with Facebook logins in order to avoid reactivating their Facebook accounts,
WTA overstates the value of Facebook access. Second, participants must believe the experimenter
will in fact enforce deactivation; WTA could naturally be lower for a partially enforced or unen-
forced deactivation compared to an enforced deactivation. In some other studies, the method of
enforcement was either not made clear ex ante, or enforcement was not fully carried out ex post.33
  32
     Appendix Figure A37 compares our demand curve to the Brynjolfsson, Eggers, and Gannamaneni (2018) demand
curves.
  33
     Mosquera et al. told participants that they would “require” that they “not use their Facebook accounts” but did
not give additional details. Brynjolfsson et al.’s WTA elicitation stated that the experimenters “will randomly pick
1 out of every 200 respondents and her/his selection will be fulfilled,” and that they could enforce deactivation by


                                                        32
Third, any survey sample is unlikely to be representative of the Facebook user population on both
observable and unobservable characteristics. For example, we screened out people who reported
using Facebook 15 minutes or less per day, and while we re-weight the average WTAs to match
the average observables of Facebook users (including average daily usage), this re-weighting may
implicitly overstate the WTA of people who don’t use Facebook very much. Fourth, we (and all
other existing studies) estimate people’s Facebook valuations holding their networks fixed. Due
to network externalities, valuations could be quite different if participants’ friends and family also
deactivated. Fifth, one should be careful in annualizing these estimates or comparing WTAs for
different durations of abstention, as our study and several others find that the average per-day
valuation varies with the duration. Sixth, as we will see below, in practice people’s WTA may not
be closely held and could be easily anchored or manipulated, even in incentive compatible elicita-
tions such as ours. Finally, this calculation fails to speak to the possibility that people misperceive
Facebook’s value. We turn to that issue now.

6.2    How Deactivation Affects Valuations
It is often argued that social media users do not correctly perceive the ways in which social media
could be addictive or make them unhappy. If this is the case, people’s willingness-to-accept to ab-
stain from Facebook would overstate “true” consumer surplus. For example, Alter (2018), Newport
(2019), many popular media articles (e.g. Ciaccia 2017; Oremus 2017), and organizations such as
the Center for Humane Technology and Time to Log Off argue that Facebook and other digital
technologies can be harmful and addictive. The Time to Log Off website argues that “everyone
is spending too much time on their screens” and runs “digital detox campaigns.” Sagioglu and
Greitemeyer (2014) document an “affective forecasting error”: people predicted that spending 20
minutes on Facebook would make them feel better, but a treatment group randomly assigned to
20 minutes of Facebook browsing actually reported feeling worse.
    Some of our results are also consistent with this argument. In the baseline survey, two-thirds
of people agreed at least somewhat that “if people spent less time on Facebook, they would soon
realize that they don’t miss it.” As reported earlier, about 80 percent of the Treatment group
thought that deactivation was good for them, and both qualitative and quantitative data suggest
that deactivation caused people to re-think and re-optimize their use.
    The core of this argument is that people’s social media use does not maximize their utility, and
a “digital detox” might help them align social media demand with their own best interests. This
idea is related to several existing economic models. In a model of projection bias (Loewenstein,
O’Donoghue, and Rabin 2003), people might not correctly perceive that social media are habit
forming or that their preferences might otherwise change after a “digital detox.” In an experience
observing subjects’ time of last login, “given your permission.” In practice, the deactivation was mostly not enforced:
of the ten subjects randomly selected for enforcement, one gave permission.


                                                          33
good model, a “digital detox” might help consumers to learn their valuation of social media relative
to other uses of time. Of course, both of these mechanisms could also affect demand after a period
of deactivation, so it is not clear whether the WTA before deactivation or after deactivation is more
normatively relevant.
      To provide evidence on these issues, we elicited WTA at three points, as described earlier. First,
on the midline survey, we elicited WTA to deactivate Facebook in “weeks 1-4” (the four weeks after
midline). We call this WTA w1 . Second, just after telling people their BDM offer price on the
midline survey, and thus whether they were expected to deactivate in weeks 1-4, we elicited WTA
to deactivate in “weeks 5-8” (the four weeks after endline). We call this w2,1 . Third, on the endline
survey, we elicited WTA to deactivate in weeks 5-8, after the Treatment group had experienced
deactivation in weeks 1-4, but the Control group had not. We call this w2,2 .
      The Control group’s change in WTA for weeks 5-8, ∆w2 := w2,2 − w2,1 , captures any unpre-
dicted time effect. The Treatment group’s WTA change ∆w2 reflects both the time effect and
the unexpected change in valuation caused by deactivation. If the time effect is the same in both
groups, then the difference in differences measures the effect of deactivation on valuations due to
projection bias, learning, and similar mechanisms.
      Figure 12 presents the average of WTA in Treatment and Control of w1 , w2,1 , and w2,2 . Recall
that the impact evaluation sample includes only people with w1 < $102, so these averages are less
than the unconditional means discussed above and presented in Figure 11. Because of outliers in
the WTAs for weeks 5-8, we must winsorize WTA. We winsorize at $170 for this figure and our
primary regression estimates, as this is the upper bound of the distribution of BDM offers that we
actually made for deactivation.
      The Treatment group’s valuation for weeks 5-8 jumps substantially relative to its valuation
for weeks 1-4, while the Control group’s valuation for weeks 5-8 does not. We used open-answer
questions in the post-endline survey and qualitative interviews to understand this change. Some
of the large gap may be due to costs of deactivation being convex in the length of deactivation:
some people in the Treatment group wrote that they were much less comfortable deactivating for
eight weeks instead of four, as they would have to make much more extensive arrangements to
communicate with friends, co-workers, and schoolmates during a longer deactivation. However,
participants’ open-answer responses suggest that that the Treatment group’s WTA increase is
also affected by anchoring on the $102 BDM offer that was revealed after the elicitation of w1 but
before the elicitation of w2,1 . Such anchoring is consistent with prior results showing that valuations
elicited using the BDM method can be affected by suggested prices or other anchors (Bohm, Lindén,
and Sonnegård (1997), Mazar, Koszegi, and Ariely (2014)). Thus, we do not believe this increase
is relevant for a consumer welfare calculation, and we do not draw any substantive conclusion from
it.
      Figure 12 also illustrates ∆w2 , the change in valuation of weeks 5-8 between midline and endline.


                                                   34
The Control group’s valuation increases, reflecting an unpredicted time effect. In open-answer
questions, some people wrote that they were less willing to deactivate during the Thanksgiving
holiday, and they may not have foreseen this as of the midline survey on October 11th. By contrast,
the Treatment group’s valuation for weeks 5-8 decreases. Thus, the difference in differences ∆w2
is negative.
       We can estimate the difference in differences using the following regression:


                                         ∆w2,i = γDi + ρw1,i + νs + εi ,                                           (5)

instrumenting for Di with Ti . Table 6 presents results, winsorizing all WTAs at $170 in column
1 and at $1,000 in column 2. Relative to the Control group, the Treatment group reduced its
post-endline valuation by by $14 to $18, or about 14 percent of the Treatment group’s average
w2,1 . This suggests that deactivation eliminated projection bias or facilitated learning that reduced
demand for Facebook by 14 percent. In turn, this suggests that the traditional estimates might
somewhat overstate consumer surplus.
       This result is consistent with our finding in Section 5.4 that deactivation reduced post-experiment
Facebook use. However, because the WTA update ∆w2 is unexpected, it suggests that the results
from Section 5.4 may not be entirely explained by a “rational” habit formation model such as
Becker and Murphy (1988), in which people foresee how consumption affects future marginal util-
ity. Instead, these results suggest that at least some of the reduced Facebook demand caused by
deactivation is driven by unexpected factors such as projection bias and learning.
       One caveat is that the anchoring effect described above could affect our estimate of γ. If
anchoring has the same effects on w2,1 and w2,2 in the Treatment group, then ∆w2 is unaffected,
and our estimate of γ is unbiased. If the anchoring effects decay between midline and endline, this
would bias γ̂ away from zero, meaning that the true γ would be less than our estimate.34 This
would further strengthen our result that the valuation update caused by deactivation equals only
a small share of valuations.
       One interpretation of these results is that they reinforce the standard model calculation that
Facebook generates many billions of dollars in consumer surplus. Another interpretation is that
they further highlight why standard consumer surplus calculations based on elicited valuations can
be problematic.
  34
    An alternative experimental design choice we considered was to elicit w2,1 before revealing the weeks 1-4 offer
price, separately for the case in which the participant would be paid to deactivate for weeks 1-4 and the case in which
the participant would not be paid to deactivate. In this case, however, any anchoring effect would have appeared on
w2,2 but not w2,1 , generating an unambiguous spurious treatment effect on ∆w2 .




                                                          35
7    Conclusion
Our results leave little doubt that Facebook provides large benefits for its users. Even after a four
week “detox,” our participants spent substantial time on Facebook every day and needed to be paid
large amounts of money to give up Facebook. Our results on news consumption and knowledge
suggest that Facebook is an important source of news and information. Our participants’ answers
in free response questions and follow-up interviews make clear the diverse ways in which Facebook
can improve people’s lives, whether as a source of entertainment, a means to organize a charity
or an activist group, or a vital social lifeline for those who are otherwise isolated. Any discussion
of social media’s downsides should not obscure the basic fact that it fulfills deep and widespread
needs.
    Notwithstanding, our results also make clear that the downsides are real. We find that four
weeks without Facebook improves subjective well-being and substantially reduces post-experiment
demand, suggesting that forces such as addiction and projection bias may cause people to use
Facebook more than they otherwise would. We find that while deactivation makes people less
informed, it also makes them less polarized by at least some measures, consistent with the concern
that social media have played some role in the recent rise of polarization in the US. The estimated
magnitudes imply that these negative effects are large enough to be real concerns, but also smaller
in many cases than what one might have expected given prior research and popular discussion.
    The trajectory of views on social media—with early optimism about great benefits giving way
to alarm about possible harms—is a familiar one. Innovations from novels to TV to nuclear energy
have had similar trajectories. Along with the important existing work by other researchers, we
hope that our analysis can help move the discussion from simplistic caricatures to hard evidence,
and provide a sober assessment of the way a new technology affects both individual people and
larger social institutions.

Notes: Column 1 presents average demographics for the impact evaluation sample: participants who were
willing to accept less than $102 to deactivate Facebook for the four weeks after midline and were offered
p = $102 or p = $0 to do so. Column 2 presents our estimate of average demographics of American adults
with a Facebook account. The top five numbers in Column 2 are inferred from a Pew Research Center
(2018f) survey of social media use by demographic group. The bottom number in Column 2 (the average
of 45 minutes of Facebook use per day) is approximated on those basis of sources such as Facebook (2016)
and Molla and Wagner (2018). Column 3 presents average demographics of American adults. The top five
numbers are from the 2017 American Community Survey (United States Census Bureau 2017), and the
Republican and Democrat shares are from the 2016 American National Election Study (American National
Election Studies 2016).

Notes: The post-endline survey included the following question with an open response text box: “How
has the way you use Facebook changed, if at all, since participating in this study?” For all responses, we
stemmed words, filtered out stop words, then constructed all phrases of length l = {1, 2, 3, 4} words. For
each phrase p of length l, we calculated the number of occurrences of that phrase in Treatment and Control
group responses (fplT and fplC ) and the number of occurrences of length-l phrases that are not phrase p in
Treatment and Control responses (f∼plT and f∼plC ). We then constructed Pearson’s χ2 statistic:
                                                                              2
                                                  (fplT f∼plC − fplC f∼plT )
                      χ2 =                                                                     .
                             (fplT   + fplC ) (fplT + f∼plT ) (fplC + f∼plC ) (f∼plT + f∼plC )
This table presents the 20 phrases with the highest χ2 that were most commonly written by the Treatment
and Control groups. The % Treatment and % Control columns present the share of people in the respective
group whose responses included each phrase.

Notes: This figure presents local average treatment effects of Facebook deactivation estimated using Equation
(1). All variables are normalized so that the Control group endline distribution has a standard deviation
of one. Error bars reflect 95 percent confidence intervals. See Section 2.3 for variable definitions. Facebook
minutes is not included in the substitute time uses index, and Facebook news is not included in the substitute
news sources index, so we visually separate these two variables from the other variables in their respective
families. We also visually separate online and offline time uses and news sources, although all online and
offline substitutes enter their respective indexes.

Notes: This figure presents kernel density plots of issue opinions for Democrats and Republicans in Treatment
and Control at endline. Issue opinions are attitudes about nine current political issues on a scale from -5 to
+5, such as “To what extent do you think that free trade agreements between the US and other countries
have been a good thing or a bad thing for the United States.” See Appendix B.1 for a list of all nine issue
questions. To construct the issue opinions measure, for each issue question q, we normalize responses by
the standard deviation in the Control group, determine Democrats’ and Republicans’ average responses µD      q
and µR                       D    R                               R
      q , re-center so that µq + µq = 0, and re-sign so that µ > 0. Define ỹiq as individual i’s normalized,
re-centered, and re-signed response to question q. ỹiq thus reflects the strength of individual i’s agreement
with the average Republican. Define σq as the Control group within-person standard deviation of ỹiq for
question q. This measures how much people’s views change between baseline and endline, and allows us to
place higher weight on issues about
                                 P which views are malleable over the deactivation period. The preliminary
issue opinion measure is Yi =       q ỹiq σq , and the final issue opinion measure plotted in the figure is Yi
divided by the Control group standard deviation.

Notes: This figure presents local average treatment effects of Facebook deactivation estimated using Equation
(1), for subgroups defined by the primary moderators in our pre-analysis plan. All variables are normalized
so that the Control group endline distribution has a standard deviation of one. Error bars reflect 95 percent
confidence intervals. See Section 2.3 for variable definitions.

Notes: This figure presents the moderators of local average treatment effects of Facebook deactivation
estimated using Equation (4). For each of the six outcomes, we present the five moderators with the
largest moderation coefficients α̂k . All outcome variables are normalized so that the Control group endline
distribution has a standard deviation of one, and all moderators are also normalized to have a standard
deviation of one. Error bars reflect 95 percent confidence intervals. See Section 2.3 for variable definitions.

Notes: This figure presents the mean willingness-to-accept (WTA) to deactivate Facebook in Treatment
and Control, for the impact evaluation sample: participants who were willing to accept less than $102 to
deactivate Facebook for the four weeks after midline and were offered p = $102 or p = $0 to do so. The first
pair of bars is the mean WTA for deactivation in weeks 1-4, the four weeks after the midline survey. The
second pair of bars is mean WTA for deactivation in weeks 5-8, the four weeks after the endline survey, as
elicited in the midline survey. The third pair of bars is mean WTA for deactivation in weeks 5-8, as elicited
in the endline survey.

Notes: “N” is the number of people in the main empirical analysis, after attrition. † 1,765 people began
this study, but 151 people were randomized and completed the endline survey. *Instead of analyzing as a
randomized encouragement design, these studies dropped participants who did not comply with the treatment
conditions. **This study had an 12 percent attrition rate in treatment and a 26 percent attrition rate in
control. ***This study elicited WTA to participate in the experiment, which involved a 50 percent chance
of Facebook deactivation plus completing a survey, and a 50 percent chance of only completing a survey.

  Active browsing       People talk about two different ways to use Facebook:
                        “Active” users often post status updates, comment on other people’s walls
                        and pictures, post photos, etc.
                        “Passive” users mostly check out their news feeds and/or other people’s
                        photos and profiles but don’t comment or interact much with others on the
                        site.
                        Which would you say describes your Facebook use best?
                        What share of your time on Facebook do you spend interacting one-on-one
                        with people you care about (for example, commenting on their posts or
                        sending them private messages)?

sample: participants who were willing to accept less than $102 to deactivate Facebook for the four weeks
after midline and were offered p = $102 or p = $0 to do so. These survey outcomes were recorded in the
baseline and midline surveys. See Section 2.3 for variable definitions. Facebook minutes, news minutes, and
Facebook mobile app use are winsorized at 120.

C     Voting Behavior
In order to study the effect of our treatment on voting behavior in the 2018 midterm elections,
we matched the participants in our experiment to a voting database supplied to Stanford by L2, a
voting data provider.
    We performed multiple rounds of merging, relaxing the merging criteria in each round in order
to increase the number of participants matched. Each round of merging was based on a different
combination of variables that included first name, middle initial, last name, birth year, zip code, and
state. Table A6 describes the criteria used in each round of merging and the number of participants
in the impact evaluation sample who were matched for the first time in that round.
    Approximately 93 percent of the matches are one-to-one: a participant in our experiment was
matched to one and only one individual in the L2 database. The remaining seven percent of the
matches are one-to-many: a participant in our experiment was matched to more than one individual
in the L2 database. Whenever the match was one-to-many, we constructed the voting variables by
taking an average of the voting behavior of the multiple individuals in the L2 database that the
participant in our experiment was matched to.
    The overall match rate was 81 percent. Since the L2 database only contains records of registered
voters and since, according to the Census Bureau, the fraction of the total citizen population over
18 who reports not being registered to vote is around 15 percent, an 81 percent match rate is close
to the maximum that might be expected (United States Census Bureau 2018). Match rates are not
statistically different between Treatment and Control, as shown in Table A7.
    Table A8 shows local average treatment effects estimated from the standard regression model
described in Equation (1), estimated off of three different samples. Column 1 includes the subset of
participants in the impact evaluation sample who could be matched to entries in the L2 database.
This is our primary specification reported in Appendix Table A10. Column 2 includes the entire
impact evaluation sample, assuming that participants who could not be matched to entries in the
L2 database did not vote. Finally, column 3 includes the subset of participants in the impact
evaluation sample who could be matched to a unique entry in the L2 database based on the most
strict match criterion—merge round 1 as described in Appendix Table A7. In all three columns,
we cannot reject the null hypothesis that deactivation does not affect voting.
    We also examined the relationship between self-reported voting behavior and voting behavior
according to the L2 database. Appendix Table A9 presents statistics for participants in the impact
evaluation sample who had unique matches in the L2 database. Almost everyone (98 percent) who
voted in the 2018 midterm elections according to the L2 database also reported on the endline
survey that they had voted. Conversely, only 57 percent of the people who did not vote in the 2018
midterm elections according to the L2 database elections reported not having voted. The results
are in line with prior literature showing that around 25-50 percent of non-voters tend to incorrectly

Notes: This table presents treatment effects of Facebook deactivation on post-experiment Facebook mobile
app use in units of minutes per day, as measured in the December 3rd post-endline survey. Columns 1
and 2 include all observations, while columns 3 and 4 limit the sample to iPhone users who reported their
Facebook mobile app usage as recorded by their System app, excluding participants who had reported
personal estimates. Columns 1 and 3 present local average treatment effects estimated using Equation (1),
while columns 2 and 4 present intent-to-treat effects and Lee (2009) bounds that account for attrition.

G     News Knowledge
Appendix Figure A22 presents treatment effects on the probability of correct answers for each
individual news knowledge question. Recall that we code a value of 1 for true statements correctly
rated as true or incorrect statements correctly rated as false, 0.5 for any statement rated as “unsure,”
and 0 for true statements incorrectly rated as false or incorrect statements incorrectly rated as true.
    To unpack these results, Appendix Figures A23, A24, and A25 present local average treatment
effects of Facebook deactivation on indicators for answering true, false or unsure to our sets of
true news, false news, and fake news questions respectively. By true news, we refer to the seven
statements about news events reported by major outlets in which we did not insert factual inaccu-
racies. By false news, we refer to the three statements about news events reported by major news
outlets in which we did insert substantial factual inaccuracies. By fake news, we refer to the five
statements summarizing news articles that were deemed false on fact-checking websites and that
circulated heavily within the four-week period before the survey. At the bottom of each block of
news questions, we present treatment effects on the average across the questions in that block.
    Most of the estimates are not statistically significant at any conventional level. Notwithstand-
ing, the pattern of point estimates for true and false news statements is cohesive: in eight out
of ten questions, deactivation induced people to move away from the correct answer and towards
either the incorrect answer or “unsure” (or both). This paints a richer picture of how Facebook
deactivation might reduce news knowledge: Treatment group participants are more likely to answer
“unsure” and, if they do not answer “unsure” and take a guess as to whether the news event is true
or false, they are more likely to answer incorrectly.
    For the fake news questions, Facebook deactivation appears to have made people more likely
to answer “unsure” instead of “false.” This explains the negative point estimate of the effect
of deactivation on fake news knowledge presented in Figure 3. Although not nearly statistically
significant, one explanation for these point estimates is that Facebook circulates fake news but, at
least for the major fake news stores in our survey, provides corrective information that helps users
to correctly identify these stories as fake.

Notes: This figure presents reasons for failure to deactivate for Treatment group participants. Data were
gathered from an optional survey that we emailed to participants who were not deactivated when they were
supposed to be under the experiment protocols. The survey asked, “Why did your Facebook account get
reactivated? Your answer won’t affect your payment – we’re just trying to figure out what problems people
are having.” Possible responses were, “I logged into my account using the Facebook website or the Facebook
app,” “somebody else logged into my account,” “I used an app (other than the Facebook app or the Facebook
messenger app) that uses my Facebook credentials to log in,” “Other (please specify),” and “I don’t know.”
We coded an individual as having reactivated “on purpose” if they ever clicked the first answer (“I logged
into my account”). We coded an individual as having reactivated “accidentally” if they ever clicked on the
second, third, or fifth answers. We also manually coded text that respondents wrote in the “Other (please
specify)” box as either “on purpose” or “accidental.” The bars display the share of all participants in the
subgroup (including participants who never responded to a survey) who ever responded that they reactivated
on purpose or accidentally.

Notes: This table presents local average treatment effects of Facebook deactivation on issue polarization
estimated using Equation (1). Column 1 presents the specification described in footnote 13 and presented
in the body of the paper. In this primary specification, issue polarization is constructed by weighting each
of the nine issues by σq , the standard deviation of within-person changes on issue q, which allows us to
place higher weight on issues about which views are malleable over the deactivation period. This is how
we had originally analyzed the data. Column 2 presents a robustness check in which issue polarization is
constructed by weighting each issue equally. In both columns, issue polarization is normalized so that the
Control group endline distribution has a standard deviation of one.

Notes: The solid markers present local average treatment effects of Facebook deactivation estimated using
Equation (1). The empty markers present non-experimental estimates from the following regression:

                                              Yib = τ H̃i + βX i + i ,
where Yib is participant i’s value of some outcome measured in the baseline survey, X i is a vector of controls
(household income, age, and college, male, white, Republican, and Democrat indicators), and H̃i is baseline
average daily Facebook use over the past four weeks (winsorized at 120 minutes per day) divided by the
local average treatment effect on average daily Facebook use between midline and endline. This division
makes experimental and non-experimental estimates comparable in the sense that they are both in units of
average use per day over the past four weeks. The empty diamond markers present unconditional correlations
(excluding X i from the regressions), while the empty square markers present estimates conditional on X i .
All variables are normalized so that the Control group endline distribution has a standard deviation of one.
Error bars reflect 95 percent confidence intervals. See Section 2.3 for variable definitions.

Notes: This figure compares our demand curve (based on the distribution of willingness-to-accept to deac-
tivate for the four weeks after midline) to demand curves for one month of Facebook use from Brynjolfsson,
Eggers, and Gannamaneni (2018). “TIOLI” refers to their “take it or leave it” elicitation, whereas “BDM”
refers to their BDM elicitation. For their European student sample, valuations were elicited in Euros; we
transform these to dollars using the exchange rate when the elicitation was carried out in July 2017.
