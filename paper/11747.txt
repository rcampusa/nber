                                            ABSTRACT

As the level of retirement-related assets has grown, so too has public and private interest in so-called
"Socially Responsible Investment" (SRI), an investment strategy that employs criteria other than the
usual financial risk and return factors when selecting firms in which to invest. This study evaluates
whether SRI indexes would alter portfolio risk and return patterns for the new defined contribution
pension plans currently on offer in Japan. We conclude that SRI funds can be included as an option,
albeit with some cost; consequently, mandatory investment in SRI portfolios cannot reasonably be
justified.

                     Socially Responsible Investment in Japanese Pensions

       It is sometimes suggested that socially-targeted investment objectives may overlap with

individual investment strategies for retirement saving products, by mediating the process of

social targeting through individual preferences and the capital market. This study examines the

pros and cons of socially responsible investment (SRI) criteria for pension investors in Japan, to

develop a better understanding of how such criteria might be introduced into investment

strategies for pension plans, and what the implications of SRI rules might be on investment

performance.

       There are many different definitions of SRI both in the West1 and in the growing Asian

funded pension market.2 Defining what constitutes SRI is difficult, since criteria selected to

target “in favor of” or “against” companies are often subjective and vary from one group,

individual, and nation, to another. In addition, formulating benchmarks and evaluating

performance for such socially targeted investments is a complex, involved, and sometimes costly

objective process.

       In the Japanese case, interest in SRI rules is just beginning to evolve, although questions

of corporate governance have a longer history (Hiraki et al 2003). As indicated by recent

amendments to the methods used for investment of Japanese Postal Saving System (JPSS) assets,

fiduciaries are gradually moving JPSS investment allocations away from social targeting toward

1
  For example, the Social Investment Forum (http://www.socialinvest.org/Areas/SRIGuide/)
defines SRI as “[i]ntegrating personal values and societal concerns with investment
decisions …[it]considers both the investor's financial needs and an investment’s impact on
society. With SRI, you can put your money to work to build a better tomorrow while earning
competitive returns today.”

  A discussion of SRI activity in Asia is provided by ASRIA [2002] who argues that “sustainable
and Responsible Investment (SRI), also known as Socially Responsible Investment, is
investment which allows investors to take into account wider concerns, such as social justice,
                                                                                                2




more conventional financial criteria, in part because of concerns that sub-optimal investment

decisions were made in the past [Lincoln, 2001]. Nevertheless, many Japanese intellectuals,

business leaders, and politicians remain convinced that socially targeted investment of some kind

will be important for the future of the nation [Nishimura and Saiko, 2003].

       The pension asset market in Japan is substantial. In March 2005, the Bank of Japan

reported total pension fund assets at JPY 93.6 trillion.3 Since 2001, Japan has been encouraging

the development of defined contribution (DC) plans, and there is currently debate over whether

SRI portfolios should be offered in these plans. While Japan SRI portfolios are quite small, they

are likely to grow rapidly in coming years.       In what follows, therefore, we begin with a

discussion of the introduction of SRI developments in Japan and a comparison between the two

most important SRI indices marketed in Japan, namely Morningstar SRI and FTSE4Good. The

following section compares the performance four hypothetical SRI funds derived from these two

SRI indices with that of standard Japanese stock market indices. Then we discuss our methods to

adjust the survivor bias that might be introduced in backward looking analysis.

       We find that the hypothetical SRI portfolio performance is not significantly different

from that of the corresponding hypothetical market portfolio. Subsequently we turn to the

question of whether an SRI designation contains market information in its own right regardless

of the weights attaching on each SRI stock, and again we use hypothetical portfolios to address

this question in an econometric approach. A final section concludes.




economic development, peace or a healthy environment, as well as conventional financial
considerations.”

Social Responsible Investment in Japan

         Few English-language papers discuss the topic of SRI funds in Japan (c.f. ASRIA ,

[2003], Kawamura [2002, 2004], and Solomon et al. [2004]), and while they are informative on

the newly developing SRI movement in Japan, they offer little in the way of technical analysis of

the performance of Japanese SRI funds. To this, we turn next.

Japanese SRI Indices. There are currently two established SRI indices and around 10 SRI

funds in Japan, most of which are environmentally-focused. The first SRI index was introduced

by Morningstar in May 2003; in September of 2004, FTSE launched its FTSE4Good index for

Japan.      Both indices focus on socially responsible corporations in Japan. Our approach in

addressing SRI performance in Japan is to focus on these two SRI indices, which we compare

against key market indices. Because the indexes were established only recently, we also take a

backward look at the performance of the SRI indices (from Jan 1997 to Feb 2005). The time

period used is, in part, imposed by data availability; but also SRI advocates argue that it is only

in the last few years that SRI principles have been explicitly and consistently adhered to by

responsible firms. For this reason, they argue that a longer time period may in fact confuse the

analysis.

Understanding Japanese SRI Indexes.          Our comparison relies on the components of the

Morningstar-SRIJapan and the FTSE4Good indices as of September 2004. In that month,

Morningstar reported 150 stocks in its SRI index, whereas there were 166 in the newly launched

FTSE4Good set. Taken as a whole, 233 Japanese stocks were included in SRI Japan indices, but

only 83 stocks were common to both indices. As indicated in Table 1, if we regarded these 233

Japanese stocks as the possible universe of socially responsible Japanese corporations, the

FTSE4Good index includes 71% of the SRI stocks, and Morningstar includes 64% of the set.
                                                                                                     4




Table 1 here

       Our further analysis also indicates some rather interesting differences between the two

SRI-Japan indices, both in terms of the companies that are included and also in their weights.

One striking finding is that the two indices differ strongly with regard to the top ten stocks

included (Table 2). The top 10 group represents about 40% and 35% of the index weights for the

FTSE4Good Japan and Morningstar SRI Japan indices, respectively. Most prominently,

FTSE4Good includes the two large motor companies Toyota and Honda, while these are omitted

by Morningstar. Conversely, Morningstar includes the Mizuho Financial Group and Takeda

Chemical, but these are excluded by FTSE4Good.

Table 2 here

       It is also interesting that the weights of the eight stocks that both indices list in their top

10 differ markedly. Thus, Toyota and Honda represent about 15% of the FTSE4Good Japan

index, while Mizuho Financial Group and Takeda account for about 9% of the Morningstar

index. Although both indices used free floating market capitalization as the basis of their index

weights, it is apparent that important differences remain in the top 10 stock rankings for the two

SRI indices. As another example, NTT is ranked first in the Morningstar SRI, representing

5.31% of the portfolio, but that firm ranks only 9th by FTSE4GOOD, representing 2.40% of the

mix.

       Why do these two SRI portfolios differ so substantially? First, the two rating firms report

that they draw from a different underlying stock universe in developing their indices. Elements

in the FTSE4Good Japan list are selected from the FTSEJapan list. By contrast, Morningstar’s

SRI stocks are selected from 3600 listed Japanese companies. Second, the stock screening

processes used by the two SRI groups are unlikely to be identical. This is because FTSE
                                                                                                 5




indicates that it relies more heavily on international SRI conventions, 4 while Morningstar

appears to adhere to more localized criteria.

       In evaluating the performance of these two indexes, we are faced with the problem that

the firms included in the two sets may have been influenced by “cherry-picking:” that is, the

particular firms selected might have been influenced not only by positive screening reports, but

also because of positive past returns. If this were the case, a positive retrospective statistical

relationship between social and financial performance could be contaminated by selection bias.

This problem is difficult to solve. The most persuasive study would have to compare the future

performance of the SRI indices selected years earlier, against future market experiences.

A Retrospective Assessment of Japanese SRI Performance

       In the meanwhile, we believe that a retrospective analysis does provide useful

information. Specifically, we compare the financial performance of several alternative Japanese

SRI portfolios against the major Japanese stock index TOPIX.5 A top 10 constituent portfolio

and a full index portfolio were constructed respectively for Morning Star SRI Japan (MS) and

FTSE4GOOD Japan (F4G) according to their launching weights as of in May 2003 and Sep

2004. The portfolios then were rebalanced monthly using their initial weights constantly.

       Results of the retrospective analysis appear in Figure 1. One striking finding is that all

four SRI portfolios outperformed the TOPIX index over the 98-month sample period (Jan 1997 ~

Dec 2003). Indeed, it is rather remarkable that, while the TOPIX lost about 20% in this span, all

of the alternatively-weighted SRI portfolios achieved positive returns. Figure 1 indicates that

4

Morningstar SRI was developed by the Public Resource Centre and Professor Kanji Tanimoto of
Hitotsubashi University.
                                                                                                 6




FTSE portfolios gained above 60% while Morningstar SRI hypothetical funds achieved over

50% total return in a 8-year recession period.

Figure 1 here

         Of course, higher returns may come with higher risks, so next we ask whether holding a

Japanese SRI portfolio might have reaped higher performance in exchange for risk. Table 3

shows that the SRI portfolios we have devised were generally not significantly more volatile than

the Japanese market indices, at least over the period from 1997-2005. For example, the

annualized monthly volatilities were around 16% and 17% for the two responsible full-index

funds, just slightly below or equal to that of the TOPIX (17%). Further, as the entire stock

market was moving, none of the funds appeared more volatile than the market as a whole, as

indicated by the fact that all the betas of SRI portfolios are below one.

Table 3 here

         To summarize, these results indicate that the Japanese SRI portfolios constructed using a

constant-weighting method with the Morningstar and FTSE4Good set of stocks outperformed the

market averages using TOPIX over the 98 months ending in Feb 2005, without taking on

additional market risk. Yet caveats remain. First, few years of data are available to track SRI

fund performance. Second, it must be recognized that because the SRI indices are quite new in

Japan, retrospective analysis runs the risk of cherry-picking and other bias. Additional years of

data will be required to generate firmer conclusions.

SRI versus Alternative Benchmarks

         Thus far we have used TOPIX as the main Japanese benchmark against which we

compare various hypothetical SRI portfolios derived from two key SRI indices in Japan. But a

5
    TOPIX is selected as a proxy for the Japanese stock market because it is a market-cap weighted
                                                                                                  7




problem with this is that the TOPIX is a dynamically-changing index, whereas our analyses of

SRI stock portfolios are of necessity backward-looking. Thus potential benefits of a hypothetical

SRI portfolio are easily conflated with the benefits of hindsight. We have already mentioned

cherry-picking, but there is also the broader issue that performance of the TOPIX index reflects

corporate failures, mergers, and acquisitions, which a backward-looking approach does not take

into account.

       Accordingly, we seek to correct for this inconsistency by developing a hypothetical

market portfolio of our own for the purpose of comparing it with alternative SRI portfolios. This

market portfolio, for convenience labeled the JMP index, is constructed from the Nikkei 500 and

the FTSE Japan index, 6 augmented to include those Morningstar SRI stocks not included in

either index, for a total of 563 stocks. We then consider these as a ‘universe’ of current Japanese

stocks, from which the SRI stocks may be drawn. Next we construct what we call a “JMP SRI

index” (JMP-SRI), which includes all the stocks in both the Japanese MS SRI and the

FTSE4Good indices. Altogether, 233 SRI stocks are included, almost all of them drawn from the

two market Japan portfolios.

       To construct both portfolios, we use dynamic market capitalization as weights, rebalance

monthly, and, consistent with our earlier analysis, we exclude dividends.7 Both the JMP and

JMP-SRI indices include only stocks which existed in September 2004, and for which at least

two years of data are available. Both are thus subject to symmetric survivor bias. In our



index, although it is not as popular as the NIKKEI225.
6
  The number of stocks within the FTSE Japan index is about 480 over time; as of 15 March
2005 there were 479 stocks included.
7
  In Japan, the size of dividend change has been found to have a strong positive effect on the
magnitude of the excess returns (Kato et al 2002). However, the dividend effects show no
significant differences between the SRI stock group and non-SRI stocks; detailed regression
results available on request.
                                                                                                   8




comparison analysis, we therefore implicitly assume that this bias has similar effects on both

portfolios.

       Figure 2 plots the price performance of the JMP and JMP-SRI funds over our sample

period; for comparison, we also reproduce the TOPIX index line. The results are striking: the

JMP and the JMP-SRI portfolios track each other closely over the sample period, while the

TOPIX return line falls significantly below these two. In other words, the apparently superior

performance of the SRI portfolio detected in the previous section when compared to the TOPIX

evaporates when we use our alternative all-Japan market benchmark.

Figure 2 here

       We also note that the combined SRI portfolio substantially underperformed the various

hypothetical SRI portfolios such as MS150 or F4G166. A possible explanation could be the

different weights attached to various stocks and the rebalancing strategies. The constituent

weights of firms in both SRI index funds are not precisely consistent with their market

capitalization due to liquidity, investability and other possible considerations.8

The Information Value of an SRI Flag in Japan

       Our last finding raises the question of whether new information is provided by knowing

that a firm has been selected to be a member of a SRI portfolio. To investigate this question, we

pool the data across both time and stocks in order to learn whether any information is carried by

an SRI designation on a stock-by-stock basis, regardless of the weights.9

       Accordingly, Model 1 compares stock-by-stock performance with the overall market

represented by the JMP portfolio and asks whether an SRI flag adds statistical explanatory power.

8
 Morningstar adjusts the market capitalization weights on the basis of liquidity considerations,
while FTSE adopts the concept of “investability.”
                                                                                                       9




Specifically, we regress the excess return of each JMP stock over the 98 months for which we

have data, on the monthly excess return of the market and an indicator which indicates whether a

stock has been designated as SRI-admissible in either the MS-SRI or FTSE4Good set. The

hypothesis is that if an SRI flag contained important market information, the flag would be

significant. The regression equation for model 1 is thus given by:

        ri ,t − r f ,t = α + β (rJMP,t − r f ,t ) + γ ⋅ SRI i + u1

where ri ,t − r f ,t is the excess return of ith stock in tth month over the corresponding risk free

return; rJMP,t − r f ,t gives the excess return of our JMP hypothetical portfolio over the risk free

return in tth month; and SRI i is the dummy variable representing the life-time SRI label10 for ith

stock. In a second formulation, we add controls for market cap bias11 and investment style bias12

(Model 2):

        ri ,t − r f ,t = α + β (rJMP ,t − r f ,t ) + γ ⋅ SRI i + ψ ⋅ CAPi ,t + ω ⋅ PBi ,t +u 2

where CAPi ,t represents the market cap of ith stock in tth month; and PBi ,t represents the price to

book value ratio of ith stock in tth month.

       The two models above are designed to reveal the ability of SRI flag to carry additional

alpha. One step further, one might also be interested in finding the potential information of risk.

Model 3 and 4 add to the first two models an additional interaction term (rJMP,t − r f ,t ) × SRI i , so




9
  Large-cap stocks often dominate the overall performance of a portfolio, and therefore the
equally-weighted approach may be a good compromise to control for weighting bias.
10
   We also tried the monthly SRI flags as possible candidates but they are statistically
insignificant.
11
   Small company effects and fund size effects are suggested by Luck et al. [1992], Wood [1992]
and Gregory et al. [1997].
12
   See also Bauer et al. [2002] for more detail on investment style bias in SRI analysis.
                                                                                                   10




that the impact of SRI flag on beta can be studied. Furthermore, a pre- and post- comparison is

also carried out around the time when the first SRI index was launched in May 2003.

       Econometric estimates appear in Table 4. Model 1 indicates that the SRI flag is now not

significantly different from zero for the period prior to the initial launch of the SRI index. After

that, the SRI flag has a negative impact on financial performance. We also expand the regression

models to take account of differences in cap size and price-to-book value ratios. Here we again

find a negative but slightly reduced impact when controlling on market capitalization bias and

growth/value style bias in Model 2. In Models 3 and 4, we evaluate the impact on intercept

(alpha) and also the potential information on the slope (beta). Interestingly, the negative impact

of alpha is no longer statistically significant, but the betas of SRI stocks are now significantly

lower than the average of non SRI stocks.

Table 4 here

       From a statistical perspective, then, we conclude that the SRI flag is not informative

about a stock’s performance before the concept of SRI was officially introduced to Japan; that is,

ex ante, SRI stocks did not perform better. By contrast, the post-launch evidence suggests that

holding a SRI portfolio might involve financial sacrifice13 vis a vis a diversified market portfolio.

This is of course consistent with conventional portfolio theory [Rudd 1981 and Chami et al

2002], although others (for example Evans and Guido [2004]) find no underperformance in a

global context. Other explanations also exist for our results. Bauer, Koedijk and Otten [2005]

and Bauer, Otten and Rad [2005], for example, provide evidence that SRI funds tend to perform

poorly in their early years, when going through what they term a “learning effect” or “catching

up phase”, and subsequently perform much better. As well, returns might be reduced because of
                                                                                                 11




the cost of compliance associated with SRI accreditation. Our results also suggest that Japanese

SRI companies are risk adverse14 in their financial decision making and market performance. A

possible explanation for this is that firms adhering to SRI principles, or striving to meet SRI

criteria, take less risk and have a generally more conservative management style than others.

Conclusions and Implications

       We examine socially responsible investments in Japan, focusing on possible roles for SRI

in pension portfolios. Because the two key indexes in Japan, the Morningstar-SRI Japan and

FTSE4Good Japan indexes, were established only recently, we opt first to take a backward look

at the performance of these indices for the eight years between December 1996 and Feb 2005.

Looking backward, we find that these SRI portfolios outperformed the TOPIX stock market

index over the sample period, quite an accomplishment since the market as a whole lost about

20% over the period. Another interesting finding is that the SRI portfolios we examine were not

significantly more volatile than the TOPIX index. The short time span available for analysis,

however, is a concern, particularly because some of the SRI portfolios underperformed the

market immediately after the introduction of the Morningstar SRI index. When we look forward

over the short period since the establishment of the funds, results suggest a risk-adjusted return

somewhat below the market.

       The implication is that Japanese historical evidence offers no support for the position that

Japanese pension participants would benefit from being required to invest in firms included on

SRI lists. At the same time, we also find no strong reason to preclude Japanese pension

participants from investing part of their pension assets in an SRI-based portfolio if they so desire,

provided participants are made aware of the potential costs of this decision.15 To this end, the

experience of one of the largest US pension plans may be instructive, that of TIAA-CREF, a

$325B (US) retirement system covering faculty and staff in higher educational and research

institutions. This large and influential pension system offers pension participants several

investment choices, among them a Social Choice Account which currently manages more than

$6 billion (US) in assets. Individual employees and retirees may elect to invest in this, or several

other funds, as they see fit.

        SRI funds in Japan are still quite new, but we anticipate that they are likely to grow in

popularity as pension asset pools develop and as individual employees are granted more

influence over their pension asset allocation decisions. Accordingly, our analysis should be of

use in demonstrating how performance measures for socially-targeted investment funds might be

constructed and evaluated in the Japanese context. Additional research is required to evaluate

whether SRI funds should be expected to play a different role in defined benefit versus defined

contribution pensions, and also whether public sector versus corporate pension funds should take

a different stance regarding SRI policies. Further analysis is also required on how pension

supervisors and regulators might respond if socially-targeted investments in pension funds were

to become very popular in Japan. As pension asset pools become increasingly important in

financing the retirement benefits of a growing elderly population, clearer policies will be needed

defining when and how pensions might be permitted to opt for SRI investments.

# Model 1 is an OLS regression of the monthly excess returns of each stock in JMP against the excess returns of
JMP index and a stock-specific SRI flag; Model 2 adds an additional risk control of big/small cap bias and
value/growth style bias; Model 3 adds an interaction term between SRI flag and excess return of JMP; Model 4
combines Models 2 and 3.
* indicates the parameter estimation is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
**Pre refers to the 77 months of the sample period prior to the formal launch of SRI indices in Japan (Jan 1997 to
May 2003); Post stands for the rest of the sample period from June 2003 to Feb 2005 for a total of 21 months.

Sources: Authors’ calculations based on data supplied by the Securities Industry Research Centre of Asia-Pacific (SIRCA) on behalf of Reuters over the 98
month period up to Feb 2005. A top-10 and a full index portfolio were constructed respectively for Morningstar SRI Japan (MS) and FTSE4GOOD Japan
(F4G) according to their launching weights as of May 2003 and Sep 2004. The portfolios were then rebalanced monthly using their initial weights. Some of
the stocks were not listed over the whole period of study, so their weights were shared by other stocks accordingly. JMP stands for a hypothetical portfolio
constructed by the authors as a representation of the Japanese stock investment universe; it contains 563 stocks and is weighted by market cap and
rebalanced monthly. The portfolio comprises all stocks in the NK500 index, the FTSE Japan index, and the Morningstar SRI index as of Sep 2004 (as long
as there were at least 24 monthly return observations over the period). The rationale for the JMP portfolio is to control for survivorship and new company
bias. JMP SRI is the SRI subset of JMP index containing 233 SRI stocks, either from MS150 or F4G166. This combined SRI portfolio was rebalanced
monthly using market capitalization. JMP_E and JMPSRI_E are equally weighted JMP and JMPSRI portfolios. They are included in our study to have a
