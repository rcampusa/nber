                                               ABSTRACT

One justification offered for legacy admissions policies at universities is that that they bind entire families
to the university. Proponents maintain that these policies have a number of benefits, including increased
donations from members of these families. We use a rich set of data from an anonymous selective
research institution to investigate which types of family members have the most important effect upon
donative behavior. We find that the effects of attendance by members of the younger generation (children,
children-in-law, nieces and nephews) are greater than the effects of attendance by the older generations
(parents, parents-in-law, aunts and uncles). Previous research has indicated that, in a variety of contexts,
men and women differ in their altruistic behavior. However, we find that there are no statistically discernible
differences between men and women in the way their donations depends on the alumni status of various
types of relatives. Neither does the gender of the various types of relatives who attended the university
seem to matter. Thus, for example, the impact of having a son attend the university is no different from
the effect of a daughter.

1. Introduction

       It is well-known that some universities give preferences to the children of alumni in the

admissions process. In recent years, this practice has become increasingly controversial. The

Economist [2004], for example, called these legacy preferences “the biggest insult to meritocra-

cy.” Two recent books, (Golden [2006] and Karabel [2005]), documented the history of these

preferences and offered strong condemnations. Articles published on the subject carry provoca-

tive titles like, “The Real Affirmative Action Babies” (Lamb [1993]) and “So Your Dad Went to

Harvard: Now What About the Lower Board Scores of White Legacies?” (Megalli [1995]). The

implication is clear: legacy preferences displace minority or low-income students. Despite the

heated rhetoric, it is unclear whether this is a quantitatively important phenomenon. For example,

simulations by Espenshade and Chung [2005] suggests that the actual number of minority stu-

dents displaced by legacy (and athlete) preferences at elite colleges is small.

       Empirical research in this area has generally focused on the academic performance of

legacy students (Martin and Spenner [2009]), the impact of legacy preferences on the composi-

tion of the student body, and their implications for fairness (Howell and Turner [2004]). An in-

teresting aspect of legacy preferences that has not received much attention is that, while these

preferences are mostly aimed at the children of alumni, “most U.S. universities give at least some

degree of preference to graduates’ [other] relatives, sometimes even a little to grandchildren,

siblings, and nieces or nephews” [Golden 2003] Many universities are quite open about the prac-

tice, and defend it in part because it helps bind entire families to their institutions. The President

of the University of Pennsylvania, Amy Gutmann, articulated this view clearly: “We’re proactive

about it because the alumni are an important part of the mix that sustains us over time,” Gutmann

said. “Our alumni are loyal to us, and we are loyal in return.” Gutmann was also careful to point
                                                                                                2

out that legacy students must meet Penn’s academic standards: “No one gets a free pass” (Heintz

[2007]).

       Other university officials are less circumspect than Gutmann when it comes to the finan-

cial implications of family loyalty. The Dean of Admissions at the University of Pennsylvania

observed, “It fosters more loyalty to Penn, keeps an ongoing interest in Penn among family

members, helps us in our efforts to raise money and continues to create a wonderful family at-

mosphere” (Heintz [2007]). In a similar vein, a member of the Rice University public relations

staff said, “Any development professional will testify that a family's financial commitment is

likely to grow with additional members’ and generations’ common affiliation” (Thomas and

Shepard [2003]). Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel of the American Council on Education,

went as far as to say that “without legacy preference, there would be a significant decrease in

giving from a core body of traditional support — families in which at least a second generation

has gone to the institution” (Golden [2003]).

       Are these financial benefits real? Alumni do increase their giving when their children ap-

proach college age, and increase their giving yet more when their children are admitted (Meer

and Rosen [2009]). But the claims that legacy admissions bond entire families to a university go

well beyond this, with giving affected by the alumni status of other relatives as well. Whether

such a phenomenon actually exists has not received much exploration. Howell and Turner [2004]

mention in passing that models of gift exchange imply that “legacies... make gifts to universities

in exchange for having been favored in the admissions process.” This comment implies that

alumni whose parents attended their school may donate more than those whose parents did not,

although their data do not allow them to explore this conjecture. Lara and Johnson [2008] and

Holmes [2009] each examine donative behavior at small liberal arts schools, and include as an
                                                                                                  3

explanatory variable the number of relatives who attended the college. Both find that, other

things being the same, the probability of making a gift increases with the number of relatives

who attended the college, as does the amount of the gift, conditional on giving. While useful, this

finding leaves open an important question: Do some family relationships matter more than oth-

ers? In particular, are the impacts greatest when the family member is from an earlier generation

(such as a parent, aunt or uncle, or grandparent), the current generation (a sibling or cousin), or

from the succeeding generation (a child, niece, or nephew)?

       This paper uses a unique data set to estimate how alumni contributions to a selective re-

search university are affected by the alumni status of the members of their family. The proprie-

tary data provided by this university, henceforth referred to as Anon U, contain detailed informa-

tion about donations made by alumni as well as a variety of their economic and demographic

characteristics. In particular, we know all members of the alumnus’s family who attended Anon

U, including in-laws. Section 2 describes the data and econometric framework. The results are

presented in Section 3. We find that the type of relative who attended the university has a strong

effect on an alumnus or alumna’s giving behavior, ceteris paribus. In particular, the effects of

attendance by members of the younger generation (children, children-in-law, nieces and ne-

phews) are greater than the effects of attendance by the older generations (parents, parents-in-

law, aunts and uncles). Section 4 discusses the sensitivity of the results to alternative specifica-

tions of the model. The results are robust to the exclusion of outliers and do not differ for male

and female alumni. Section 5 concludes with a summary and suggestions for future research.

2. Data and Econometric Framework

          2.1 Data

          Our primary data source is the administrative archives of Anon U’s Development Office,

which contain information on all alumni donations from 1983 to 2007. The data are proprietary

and sensitive, and individuals’ names were stripped from the records before being made availa-

ble to us. Each individual has his or her relatives’ identification numbers and relation types

listed.

          Our unit of observation is a yearly giving opportunity. For example, if an individual has

been an alumna for 5 years, she accounts for 5 giving opportunities in our analysis, starting in the

first fiscal year after graduation. Multiple gifts for the same purpose in the same year are

summed together. The Development Office data also include information on academic major, the

alumnus’s undergraduate extracurricular activities, post graduate education, occupation, resi-

dence, and whether he or she is married to another graduate of Anon U. Anon U’s Registrar sup-

plemented these data with information on SAT scores, academic honors, ethnicity, type of high

school, summary evaluations made by the Admissions Office during the application process, and

grade point average. The Registrar’s data are available only for the classes of 1972 to 2005, so

we restrict our analysis to this group of individuals.

          As noted above, previous research has documented that the presence of a family member

who attended a university increases an alumnus’s giving to that institution. This is true in our

data as well. For example, among alumni with family members who attended Anon U, the pro-

portion who make a gift in a given year is 0.635, while for those who did not, it is 0.507. The

conditional mean donation is $1114 for those who had a family member attend, and $837 for

those who did not. These tendencies continue to be present even after taking into account other
                                                                                                                      5

variables that might affect giving.1 Our focus, however, is not on the effect of having some rela-

tive(s) who attended the university, but on the comparative impacts of different types of family

relationships. Therefore, our analysis sample includes only alumni who had at least one family

member who attended Anon U.2 This gives us 222,838 observations, representing 13,170 alumni.

We delete 10,300 observations because of missing or unreliable data on covariates. This leaves

212,538 observations on 12,646 alumni. As indicated at the top of Table 1, of these observations,

the proportion associated with a gift is 0.639 (s.d. = 0.480), and the mean gift conditional on

making a gift is $1,114 (s.d. = $27,738).

         An immediate issue is how to characterize the extent to which an alumnus’s family is

connected with Anon U. One possibility is simply to add up the number of family members who

have attended, but this does not allow us to distinguish among the effects of different types of

family relationships. We instead include a series of dichotomous variables each of which takes a

value of one if the alumnus had a relative in that category who attended Anon U: spouse, sibling,

child, parent, cousin, aunt or uncle, great-uncle, grandfather, niece or nephew, parent-in-law,

sibling-in-law, or another in-law.3 An individual is characterized as having a given type of rela-

tive when the relative matriculates at Anon U, rather than when he or she graduates, and relatives

are drawn from members of all graduating classes between 1900 and 2012.4 The means of these

dichotomous variables are reported in Table 1.


1
  In regressions that include the right hand side variables listed in Table 1, the marginal effect of a relative who at-
tended Anon U on the probability of making a donation is 0.101 (s.e. = 0.0043) and the proportional effect on the
amount given, conditional on making a gift, is 0.0429 (s.e. = 0.0139).
2
  More technically, if alumni without relatives were in the sample, then the reference group for each relation would
consist of those with no alumni relatives at all and those with some other type of relative. It would be difficult to
interpret such results.
3
  Anon U began did not begin admitting women until the 1960s. Consequently, we have grandfathers and great-
uncles in our sample, but no grandmothers or great-aunts. The “other in-law” category is relatively small and in-
cludes cousins, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and nieces and nephews-in-law.
4
  Our data indicate whether an individual was ever married to a fellow alumnus of Anon U, but information about
when the marriage took place is spotty In effect, then, the spouse and in-law variables measure whether the individ-
                                                                                                                        6

         Conditional on having any relative who attended Anon U, the mean number of relatives

is 2.2. Conditional on having a relative of a given type who attended Anon U, the modal number

of relatives of that type is one. For example, of the alumni whose siblings attended Anon U, 81

percent of them had only one sibling who did so. The comparable figures for children-in-law and

siblings-in-law were 85 percent and 83 percent, respectively.5

         2.2 Econometric Specification

         Previous empirical work on the determinants of giving suggests that variables can have

different effects on the decision whether or not to donate — the extensive margin — than on the

decision how much to donate, conditional on making a gift — the intensive margin.6 A statistical

model that allows for this possibility is therefore needed. We assume that each alumnus first

chooses whether or not to make a gift and then, conditional on making a gift, decides how much

to donate. Following Huck and Rasul [2007], a natural specification is a hurdle model. In our

context, the first step in the implementation of the hurdle model is to estimate a probit for wheth-

er or not the individual makes a gift. The second step is to use ordinary least squares on the posi-

tive observations to analyze the decision about how much to give.7 An assumption is needed to

make causal inferences from the second-stage estimates, namely, that the second stage is condi-

tionally independent of the first. We discuss this further below.

         It is straightforward to use the estimates from these two steps to calculate unconditional

marginal effects on the mean level of giving; this allows us to characterize the effect of family

relationships on giving taking into account both the impacts on the intensive and extensive mar-

ual ever had that type of relative. Section 4 shows that it is unlikely that this limitation in the data affects our subs-
tantive results.
5
  Not surprisingly, then, when we estimated a model in which each variable was the number of relatives in each cat-
egory, we found that there was little difference in our substantive results.
6
  Thus, for example, it would not be appropriate to use a Tobit model, which imposes the constraint that the margin-
al effect of a given variable on the probability of giving and the marginal effect on the amount given are the same up
to a constant of proportionality.
7
  More precisely, this is the complete dominance hurdle model.
                                                                                                                    7

gins.8 We correct for correlation among the error terms for any given individual with a clustering

procedure in both the probit and OLS models. We also clustered on families rather than individ-

uals and found that this had only a negligible effect on the standard errors.

         An alternative two-step procedure, suggested by Heckman [1979], can also be used to es-

timate the amount of giving, conditional on it being positive. Heckman’s model augments the

OLS equation in the second stage with the inverse Mills ratio. There is some controversy in the

literature with respect to which estimator is superior (Leung and Yu [1996]); hence, a sensible

approach is to estimate the model both ways. We show below that our substantive results are es-

sentially unchanged when we use Heckman’s method.

         As is typically the case, a few relatively large gifts account for a disproportionate amount

of Anon U’s donations. For example, in our analysis sample, the top one percent of gifts in 2007

accounted for 81.6 percent of total giving. These large gifts are critical to the university, so it is

important to determine whether family bonding affects the likelihood of such gifts. We therefore

also use a probit model to estimate the probability that the alumnus is a “class leader” in a given

year, where a class leader is defined as an individual who donated an amount greater than or

equal to the 90th percentile of gifts in his or her class.

         In addition to the family relationship variables in Table 1, we include on the right hand

side a series of variables about each alumnus that has been shown in previous studies to exert an

important influence on alumni giving (Cunningham and Cochi-Ficano [2002], Shulman and Bo-

wen [2001], Lara and Johnson [2008], Holmes [2009]). These include years since graduation,

gender, ethnicity, SAT scores, ranking of the candidate by the admissions office when they ap-


8
 Denote the amount of giving as Y, and the vector of right hand side variables as X. Then the first stage of the esti-
mation gives results for Pr[Y>0|X] and the second stage gives E[Y|X,Y>0]. The unconditional value of giving,
E[Y|X], is Pr[Y>0|X]*E[Y|X,Y>0]. The marginal effects, ∂E[Y|X]/∂X, are straightforward to compute, and standard
errors are obtained using the delta method.
                                                                                                            8

plied to Anon U, course of study, and post-baccalaureate education. The literature also shows

that alumni giving is heavily influenced by the affinity that they develop for their schools as un-

dergraduates. Participation in varsity sports and membership in fraternities are two ways in

which such affinities develop (Clotfelter [2001], Monks [2003]); we include variables relating to

these activities. The model also includes time effects, class effects, and location effects. The year

effects reflect the impacts of the business cycle, the stock market, and so on.9 The year effects

also account for the size of Anon U’s fundraising staff and the amount of its fundraising expendi-

tures, which vary from year to year. The class effects control for common influences on alumni

in the same class, such as the political milieu when they were undergraduates, the presence of

certain professors or administrators, and so on.

        A final econometric issue relates to the fact that our data contain a few very large out-

liers. For example, there are 12 gifts greater than $1 million in our sample. To address this issue,

we use the logarithm of the amount of giving on the left hand side of the OLS equation. As an

additional check to make sure that outliers are not driving our results, we estimate the OLS equa-

tion with the top one percent of the observations eliminated. As shown below, the substantive

results with respect to the impact of different types of relatives are not affected.



3. Results

        Column (1) of Table 2 shows the marginal effects of the family relationship variables on

the probability of making a gift. The numbers in parentheses are standard errors. In addition to

the variables listed in the table, the models include the other right hand side variables mentioned

in the previous section, which are suppressed for brevity.

 Bristol [1991] emphasizes the role of the stock market and Ehrenberg and Smith [2001] document the importance
of macroeconomic conditions.
                                                                                                     9

       The first entry in this column indicates that alumni with a spouse who attended Anon U

are 12.3 percentage points more likely to make a gift in a given year than those who did not. The

next bank of estimates considers relatives who are in the same generation as the alumnus —

siblings, siblings-in-law, and cousins. The magnitudes of the coefficients are small and one can-

not reject the hypothesis that they are zero. Thus, the attendance of relatives in the same genera-

tion at Anon U does not affect the probability of making a gift. The next set of figures looks at

the impact of relatives in the succeeding generation. Here the findings are rather different. If

one’s child attended Anon U, the probability of making a gift increases by 12.9 percentage

points, a child-in-law increases it by 3.99 percentage points, and a niece or nephew increases it

by 7.4 percentage points. The notion that alumni are more likely to make a donation when their

children are accepted by their alma mater is widely believed among fundraisers and has been do-

cumented in previous work (Meer and Rosen [2009]). The novel finding here is that other rela-

tives in the next generation also affect giving, and the pattern of the point estimates seems to

make sense—the matriculation of one’s own child has a bigger impact than either nieces and ne-

phews or children-in-law.

       The next set of estimates examines the impact of relatives in the preceding generation.

Having a parent, parent-in-law or aunt/uncle who attended Anon U increases the likelihood of

giving, but the effects are not as large as for relatives in the succeeding generation. The point es-

timates, which are between 1.7 to 3.7 percentage points, are fairly close to each other. The next

set of numbers, which shows the estimates for grandfathers and great-uncles, indicates that as we

move another generation earlier the effect on the probability of giving becomes so attenuated that

it is statistically not discernible from zero. Finally, the “other in-law” estimate indicates that hav-

ing some other in-law relative increases the probability of giving by 4.4 percentage points. This
                                                                                                                     10

fairly large estimate is difficult to interpret, though, as it represents a relatively small number of

positive observations and a mix of different relative types.

         Taken together, the results in Column (1) suggest that there is something to the family

bonding view described at the outset. The kinds of family members who attended this institution

do affect the likelihood that an alumnus will make a gift. In this context, we think that the sub-

stantial effects for members of the preceding generation are particularly noteworthy. Unlike the

case of one’s own children, it is highly unlikely that that giving to Anon U reflects gratitude for

the fact that they were accepted to the university. Hence, this finding makes the existence of fam-

ily bonding particularly compelling.

         Column (2) shows OLS estimates of the amount given, conditional on making a gift. To

interpret the negative coefficient on the spouse variable, note that half the value of gifts from

married alumni are credited to each individual. Thus, our finding implies that married couples

jointly choose to give less, conditional on giving, even as the results in column (1) show that

they are substantially more likely to make a gift. We conjecture that this finding arises because a

gift to Anon U has public good aspects for couples. Specifically, suppose that a gift generates a

“warm glow” that is nonrival and nonexcludable. In that case, each spouse derives utility from

the other spouse’s gift, and the couple gives less jointly than they would have if they were un-

married. Having a sibling who attended Anon U raises the conditional amount given by about 6.1

percent; otherwise, relatives in the same generation have no statistically significant impact on the

amount given.10 In the succeeding generation, a child who attended is associated with about a 48

percent increase in giving; a child-in-law with a 13 percent increase. The estimate for nieces and

nephews is positive, but not statistically significant. In the preceding generation, the point esti-

10
   Note that because of the presence of a constant in the model, even in the presence of insignificant or negative
coefficients, it can still predict positive values of donations. Indeed, because the left hand side variable is the loga-
rithm of amount given, negative values for the level of giving are ruled out.
                                                                                                  11

mates for parents-in-law and aunts/uncles are positive and relatively close in magnitude, 6.7 and

8.2 percent, respectively. The negative coefficient on the parent variable is not easy to interpret.

It might indicate that there is some kind of substitution of giving between generations of the nuc-

lear family, but we cannot be sure. As was the case for the probability of giving, having grandfa-

thers and great-uncles who attended Anon U exerts no statistically discernible impact on the

amount an alumnus donates.

       Column (3) combines the estimates in Columns (1) and (2) to calculate the overall effect

on the unconditional mean of giving. Unsurprisingly, we find that children, children-in-law, and

nieces and nephews are associated with higher average gifts. Parents-in-law and aunts and uncles

are also associated with significantly higher giving, but for parents, the combination of a higher

propensity to make any gift but a lower gift amount, conditional on giving, results in an insigni-

ficant overall effect on giving. This is consistent with the hypothesis posited above, that individ-

uals substitute their parents’ giving for their own.

       The fourth column of Table 1 shows how each family relationship changes the probabili-

ty that an individual will be a class leader, other things being the same. The results suggest that

having an Anon U spouse increases the probability of being a class leader by 1.1 percentage

points. Thus, while the mean amount given by a married couple is lower than what each person

would have given individually (column (2)), they are more likely to be among the largest givers.

To put this figure in perspective, recall that, by construction, the probability that a random alum-

nus will be a class leader is only 10 percent. Hence, a 1.1 percentage point increase is substantial.

Consistent with the results in Columns (1) and (2), the largest effects are for relatives in the next

generation, with a child having the largest effect (9.8 percentage points) and children-in-law and

nieces/nephews having effects in the 3 to 5 percentage point range. There is not much of an im-
                                                                                                                 12

pact from having relatives in earlier generations who went to Anon U, except for aunts/uncles,

for whom the effect is 1.4 percentage points. Taken together, the results in column (4) do not

lend strong support to the notion that family bonding leads to exceptionally high giving. Alumni

respond positively when members of the next generation in their families attend Anon U, but

coming from a family with a tradition of attending the university does not seem to have an im-

pact along this dimension, other things being the same.



4. Alternative Specifications.

        In order to assess the robustness of our results, we estimated a number of alternative spe-

cifications of our model.

        Permanent income. Unfortunately, our data include no direct information on income, an

important determinant of alumni giving (Shulman and Bowen [2001, p. 404). To assess the con-

sequences, we begin by noting that a number of the variables in our basic specification also

proxy for the individual’s permanent or family income, including gender, ethnicity, college ma-

jor and grade point average, advanced degrees, years since graduation, and location.

        Further, although we lack annual income data, for a large subset of our alumni, we have

information that is closely related to permanent income, occupation and field. We have these va-

riables for 155,571 observations, representing 8,483 alumni.11 The proportion of individuals in

this sample who make a donation is 67.7 percent, somewhat higher than the 63.9 percent figure

for our basic sample. The summary statistics showing the proportions of the samples in the vari-

ous fields are available upon request. The fields of education, finance, health care and law are



11
  Due to lack of reliable data regarding the start- and stop-dates of occupation and field, these variables indicate
whether the alumnus was ever involved in that field or occupation, rather than whether they are involved during the
particular year of observation.
                                                                                                    13

highly represented. We re-estimate our basic models with this subsample including the occupa-

tion and field data in order to see whether our substantive results are sensitive to their inclusion.

       To establish a baseline for this exercise, we estimate our model using only the sample of

alumni for whom we have occupation and position, but without including these variables. These

results are recorded in Table 3a. A comparison of these estimates with those in Table 2 indicates

that the behavioral patterns of the individuals in this subsample do not differ substantially from

those for the sample as a whole. We next augment this model with the occupation and position

variables; these results are in Table 3b. Comparing Tables 3a and 3b, we see that the addition of

the field and occupation variables has no substantive impact on the estimates. We conclude that

it is unlikely that our results with respect to family relationships are being driven by the omission

of income from our set of right hand side variables.

       This discussion of the role of the alumnus’s income raises a related issue—the possible

importance of dynastic income. We have interpreted our results in Tables 2 and 3b, particularly

those relating to impact of having older relatives who attended Anon U, as telling us something

about family bonding. One might argue that they simply reflect (unobserved) dynastic wealth.

Certain families, both within and across generations, have more wealth than others, and hence

have a capacity to give larger gifts. Note, however, that even if this observation is correct, by it-

self it says little about the validity of our estimates. If the concern is that having any relative who

attended Anon U is associated with greater family wealth, then the fact that our sample consists

only of individuals with alumni relatives mitigates this problem. The results may be spurious,

though, if the type of relative is associated with greater family wealth. For instance, having a

parent who attended Anon U may be more correlated with dynastic wealth than having a child

who attended.
                                                                                                  14

       To address this issue, we begin by noting that some of our covariates are likely correlated

with dynastic income as well as individual income, as above. These include race and an indicator

for whether the individual went to a public or private high school. Cunningham and Cochi-

Ficano [2002] point out that SAT scores are closely related to family socioeconomic status as

well. To the extent that such variables account for dynastic income, the issue is moot. To investi-

gate this issue more systematically, we began by deleting the top one percent of total family giv-

ing observations, working on the premise that these are likely to be the families with particularly

high wealth. When we estimated the models in Table 2 with this sample, we found that the re-

sults were basically the same. In the same spirit, we deleted the observations from families with

the one percent highest average gift per family. Again, we found that the results were basically

unchanged. In short, this admittedly rough attempt to see if differences in dynastic wealth are

driving our results shows no evidence that they do.

       Removing outliers. As is the case at most universities, a few large gifts account for a dis-

proportionate share of total donations to Anon U. For example, as noted earlier, the top one per-

cent of positive gifts for general purposes in our sample accounted for 81.6 percent of the total in

2007 This raises the possibility that our results for amounts given are being driven by just a few

observations. Our use of logs for the left hand side variables attenuates the impact of outliers, but

as another check, we re-estimate the models for amounts given with the top one percent of dona-

tions in each category deleted from the sample. The results are in Table 4. When we compare

these results to their counterparts in Table 1, we see that the signs and magnitudes are similar.

Hence, outliers do not appear to be driving our results.

       Gender differences. Previous empirical research on altruism indicates that the behavior of

men and women can differ in substantial ways. (See Andreoni and Vesterlund [2001] and Meer
                                                                                                                     15

and Rosen [2009].) This raises the possibility that the impact of family bonding may be different

for men and women. To address this issue, we interact each of the family relationship variables

with an indicator for whether the alumnus is male. The results are reported in Table 5.12 None of

the interaction terms is statistically significant, and the terms are jointly insignificant. On the ex-

tensive margin, the interaction terms are jointly significant only at p = 0.29, and on the intensive

margin, they are significant at p = 0.63. This is consistent with the notion that the impact of hav-

ing relatives who attended Anon U is no different for men than for women.

         A further question along these lines is whether bonding depends on the gender of the re-

levant relative. For example, is the impact of a cousin relatively greater if the cousin is male or

female? We address this issue by including a set of variables controlling for the proportion of

each type of relative that are male. These results, which are available upon request, indicate that

these controls are neither individually nor jointly significant, and their point estimates are small.

Further, interacting these variables with the indicator for whether the alumnus is male yields no

significant results. We therefore conclude that the gender of relatives who attended or attend

Anon U is irrelevant for the formation of family bonds.

         Indicator for marital status. As noted above, our data do not provide reliable data with re-

spect to the start date of marriages, which means that in a given year, the indicators for the pres-

ence of spouses and in-laws who attended Anon U may be computed with error. To investigate

whether this shortcoming is a concern, we begin by assuming that many marriages have taken

place by the time the alumnus is eight years out of school. Hence, if we estimate our model using

only observations for which alumni are roughly 30 years of age or older, we have eliminated

most of the observations for which an alumnus is not yet married to his or her alumnus spouse.


12
 As noted earlier, in our data, half of any gift donated by an individual is credited to the person’s spouse. Hence, it
makes no sense to interact the gender and spouse variables, so such interactions are not included in this table.
                                                                                                 16

When we estimated our basic models with this truncated data set, we found that the coefficients

on the spouse and in-law variables were quite similar to their counterparts when the entire sam-

ple is used. For instance, the parent-in-law coefficient on the extensive margin was 0.0404 (s.e. =

0.0161), compared to 0.0365 (s.e. = 0.0137) in Table 2, using the full sample. The coefficient for

spouse on the intensive margin was -0.129 (s.e. = 0.0335), compared to -0.110 (s.e. = 0.0262) in

Table 2. While we cannot rule out other interpretations, this finding provides at least some assur-

ance that our results are not an artifact of misclassifications of marital status.

        Alternative econometric specification. An alternative econometric estimator augments the

OLS equation for the amount given with the inverse Mills ratio generated by the first stage probit

(Heckman [1979]). This model explicitly allows for correlation between the errors in the first

and second stage equations. The econometric literature indicates that the desirability of this esti-

mator relative to the hurdle model is unclear. In particular, Leung and Yu [1996] observe that

even if the errors in the true model are correlated, the hurdle model may, under certain circums-

tances, yield better estimates. In any case, it seems sensible to re-estimate the model using

Heckman’s approach to see if the substantive results are affected. They are not. For instance, the

selection model yields an estimate of the effect of having a spouse who also attended Anon U of

46.2 percent on the overall amount of the gift and -12.3 percent on the size of the gift, condition-

al on giving one. The results from our basic specification are 47.5 percent and -11.0 percent, re-

spectively. The other variables are similarly close in magnitude. Hence, our results are robust

with respect to this change in econometric specification.


6. Summary and Conclusions

        A spokeswoman for the University of Michigan laid out the case for legacy admissions in

this way: “When you have families who have a longstanding connection to the university, there
                                                                                                 17

is a level of engagement that’s of great value to the institution; they’re more likely to give time

and services, like recruiting and fund-raising” (Bauza [2003]). We use a rich set of data from an

anonymous selective research institution to examine the notion that legacy admissions bind fami-

lies to universities. Specifically, we investigate which types of family members have the most

important effects in this context. We find that the effects of attendance by members of the

younger generation (children, children-in-law, nieces and nephews) are greater than the effects of

attendance by the older generations (parents, parents-in-law, aunts and uncles, and grandparents).

In short, alumni giving behavior is consistent with the notion that families bond with universities,

but from the standpoint of stimulating giving, different types of family members have rather dif-

ferent effects.

        Our results are based on data from a single selective research university. Consequently,

one must be cautious about assuming that the results would apply to other institutions as well.

That said, our findings suggest that university officials need at least to consider the possibility

that the configuration of family members who have attended the institution can have an impor-

tant effect on giving.

Column (1) shows the incremental effects on the probability of making a gift in a given year, based on a probit model and
using 212,538 observations. Column (2) shows the incremental effects on the amount of the gift, conditional on making a
gift, using ordinary least squares and using observations with a positive gift,, a total of 135,783 observations. Column (3)
combines these, and shows the marginal effects on total giving. Column (4) shows the incremental effect of being a “class
leader” in a given year, where a class leader is defined as an individual who donated an amount greater than or equal to
the 90th percentile of gifts in his or her class. The figures in parentheses are standard errors. Coefficients that are statisti-

The figures in this table show the results when the basic models are estimated using only the sample of alumni for whom
we have information on field and occupation, although the field and occupation variables are not included. Column (1)
shows the incremental effects on the probability of making a gift in a given year, based on a probit model and using
155,546 observations. Column (2) shows the incremental effects on the amount of the gift, conditional on making a gift,
using ordinary least squares and using observations with a positive gift, a total of 105,317 observations. Column (3) com-
bines these, and shows the marginal effects on total giving. Column (4) shows the incremental effect of being a “class

The figures in this table show the results when the basic models are estimated using only the sample of alumni for whom
we have information on field and occupation, and the field and occupation variables are included on the right hand side..
Column (1) shows the incremental effects on the probability of making a gift in a given year, based on a probit model and
using 155,546 observations. Column (2) shows the incremental effects on the amount of the gift, conditional on making
gift, using ordinary least squares and using observations with a positive gift, a total of 105,317 observations. Column (3)
combines these, and shows the marginal effects on total giving. Column (4) shows the incremental effect of being a “class
leader” in a given year, where a class leader is defined as an individual who donated an amount greater than or equal to
the 90th percentile of gifts in his or her class. The figures in parentheses are standard errors. Coefficients that are statisti-
cally significant at the 5% level are marked with **; those significant at the 10% level are marked with *. Standard errors
are adjusted for clustering based on individuals. In addition to the variables listed, the regressions include the variables
listed in the footnote of Table 1. Full results are available on request.

This table augments the basic model with a series of interaction terms. Each of the relationship variables is interacted with
a dichotomous variable that takes a value of one if the alumnus is a male. Column (1) shows the incremental effects on
the probability of making a gift in a given year, based on a probit model and using 212,538 observations. Column (2)
shows the incremental effects on the amount of the gift, conditional on making a gift, using ordinary least squares and
using observations with a positive gift, a total of 135,783 observations. Column (3) combines these, and shows the mar-
ginal effects on total giving. Column (4) shows the incremental effect of being a “class leader” in a given year, where a
class leader is defined as an individual who donated an amount greater than or equal to the 90th percentile of gifts in his or
her class. The figures in parentheses are standard errors. Coefficients that are statistically significant at the 5% level are
marked with **; those significant at the 10% level are marked with *. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering based on
individuals. In addition to the variables listed, the regressions include the variables listed in the footnote of Table 1. Full
results are available on request.
