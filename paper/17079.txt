Disability, Pension Reform and Early Retirement in Germany

JEL No. H55,J14

                                              ABSTRACT

The aim of this paper is to describe for (West) Germany the historical relationship between health
and disability on the one hand and old-age labor force participation or early retirement on the other
hand. We explore how both are linked with various pension reforms. To put the historical developments
into context, the paper first describes the most salient features and reforms of the pension system since
the 1960s. Then we show how mortality, health and labor force participation of the elderly have changed
since the 1970. While mortality (as our main measure of health) has continuously decreased and population
health improved, labor force participation has also decreased, which is counterintuitive. We then look
at a number of specific pension reforms in the 1970s and 1980s and show that increasing or decreasing
the generosity of the pension system has had the expected large effects on old-age labor force participation.
Finally, we explore the possible link between early childhood environment and early retirement by
analyzing the retirement behavior of cohorts born during World War I, a period of harsh living conditions
among the civilian population in Germany. Our data show higher early retirement rates among those
cohorts, presumably because those cohorts still suffer from worse health on average many decades
after their birth.

Disability, Pension Reform and Early Retirement in Germany
Axel Börsch-Supan and Hendrik Jürges


1. Introduction
Disability insurance – the insurance against the loss of the ability to work – is a substantial
part of social security expenditures and an important part of the welfare state regime in all
developed countries (Aarts et al. 1996). Like almost all elements of modern social security
systems, disability insurance faces a trade-off. On the one hand, disability insurance protects
unhealthy people who are not able to work from falling into poverty before they are eligible
for normal retirement benefits. On the other hand, however, disability insurance creates
incentives to exit the labour force early and may act as another pathway to early retirement
without the incidence of a major health loss.

The recipiency rates of disability insurance (DI) benefits vary strikingly across European
countries, see Börsch-Supan and Roth (2010). Germany is in between countries of very high
recipiency rates such as Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands (more than 12%), but with
6.5% of all 50 to 64 year old persons substantially higher than in France (less than 2%). Three
candidate causes of this international variation come to mind: cross-national differences in the
age structure, cross-national differences in health, and cross-national differences in the early
retirement incentives created by the DI system. Based on the 2004 waves of SHARE, ELSA
and HRS, we showed that cross-sectional differences in demographic structure and current
health status cannot explain the cross-national differences in DI recipiency (Börsch-Supan,
2005) although health explains a great deal of the within-country variation (see also
Avendano and Mackenbach, 2010). Using the same data, we showed that adverse health
events in a two-year observation window do not significantly trigger a higher probability of
becoming a DI benefit recipient at the end of this window (Börsch-Supan, 2008). Finally, we
exploited data on childhood and mid-life health only to find that also these health measures,
while capturing a large share of the within-country variation, do not explain the cross-national
differences in DI recipiency (Börsch-Supan and Roth, 2010).

The current paper concentrates on time series variation in health and DI uptake or early
retirement in Germany. It follows the structure of the other papers in this volume and has two
aims:
   To provide historical information on mortality and “health” status measures in each
    country.


                                                                                              2
   To understand the relationship between changes over time in disability program reforms
    particular—as well as other social security programs—on the one hand and DI program
    participation on the other hand.
Section 2 describes the most relevant features of the German pension system and which
reforms the system has undergone since the 1970s. Section 3 shows long-term trends in
mortality, primary diagnoses for DI benefit recipients, and subjective health measures
together with long-term trends in labor force participation. In Section 4 we analyze how
selected reforms of the pension system, in particular introductions of or changes in the
generosity of various early retirement options, have affected the retirement behavior in
Germany. Section 5 tracks early retirement behavior by birth cohorts and shows that cohorts
born during World War I have retired early than cohorts born before or after the war. Section
6 concludes the paper.


2. Regimes of retirement policies in Germany

The German pension system began as a funded disability insurance scheme some 120 years
ago, but was quickly broadened into a general old-age pension system and was transformed
into a pay-as-you-go system in 1957 after about half of the capital stock was lost in two world
wars and a hyperinflation.

As opposed to other countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which
originally adopted a Beveridgian social security system that provided only a base pension,
public pensions in Germany are designed to extend the standard of living that was achieved
during work life also to the time after retirement: Individual pension benefits are therefore
proportional to individual labor income averaged over the entire course of the working life
and feature only few redistributive properties, in particular a minimum pension at the social
assistance level. Benefits in the disability branch are identical to benefits for old-age pensions.
They are, however, calculated as if the working life had extended to the early retirement age.
Subsection 2.1 adds further details to this bird’s eye view of the German pension system, and
subsection 2.2 describes the changes in legislation that will be used to identify the incentives
generated by the system.



2.1 Pathways to retirement in Germany

From the very beginning, the German system has distinguished “old-age pensions” from
“disability pensions”. Old age pensions have an earliest retirement age as fundamental

                                                                                                 3
eligibility criterion, independent of the ability to work, while disability pensions require an
assessment of the inability to do work, independent of age.

In practice, the difference is less clear cut. Disability pensions require a work history of at
least 5 years of contribution, of which 3 years have to be during the last 5 years. The
assessment of the inability to work is typically record-based, i.e., there will be no specific
medical exam but a submission of medical records by a general practitioner or a company
doctor, potentially but rarely audited by a government official.

Old age pensions have various pathways, summarized in Table 1, including an “old-age
disability pension” characterized but a much more lenient medical check.



Table 1: Pathways to old-age pensions

                       Earliest age    Years of contribution       Other

Standard               65              5                           None

Long-term insured      63              35                          Actuarial adjustment

Disabled Workers       60              35                          No actuarial adjustment

Unemployed             60              15 (8 in last 10 years)     At least 52 weeks unemployed

Part-time retirement   60              15 (8 in last 10 years)     2 years part-time

Women                  60              15 (10 after age 40)



In addition, there are several pre-retirement options, such as the “unemployment channel”
where a workers first receives unemployment benefits (possibly augmented by a severance
payment by his former employer) until age 59, then switches to an old-age pension for the
unemployed which is converted to a standard pension after age 65. In the sequel of the paper,
we will refer to “retirement” in a strict sense as receiving an old-age or disability pension, and
not in the sense of exiting the labor force, e.g. via the unemployment channel.

While, in principle, all old-age and disability pathways to retirement generate the same
retirement income, the pathways differ by the eligibility age and the various extra
requirements indicated in table 1. Moreover, disability pensions are attractive because they
feature an upper limit of actuarial adjustments. These are 3.6% per year, but are limited to
10.8% in case of a disability.

                                                                                                4
The choice among these pathways thus has three components which are well-defined and
straightforward to model (earliest retirement age, minimum employment requirement, and
actuarial adjustment) plus “soft” factors such as the lenience of the medical exam and a
possible deal between employer and employee regarding severance pay and a
recommendation by the company doctor which are hard to detect in the usual data sources.



2.2 Regimes of retirement policies in Germany

The system has experienced many changes, and the pathways in Table 1 refer essentially to
the time between 1972 and 2002, during which most of our analysis takes place. There were,
however, several important changes which we will exploit to identify the incentives exerted
by the German pension system. It should be noted that the multitude of pathways is currently
being simplified while the standard retirement age is increased to age 67.

The following brief history of the German pension system distinguishes five phases:1 (1) a
relatively stable phase after the introduction of the pay-as-you-go system until 1972; (2) a
phase of increasing generosity precipitated by the 1972 pension reform; (3) a phase of modest
retrenchment, especially affecting disability benefits in the mid 1980s; (4) a phase of cost
cutting reforms after 1992 leading to a sustainable pension system by 2007; and (5) first signs
that we may actually experience a phase of reform backlash.

Phase 1 (1957 to 1972): Stability. Initially, the pay-as-you-go system introduced in 1957 had
a single eligibility age for old age pension: age 65 for men and age 60 for women
(conditioned on a minimum number of years of service). Earlier retirement was impossible
unless one could prove a disability. Disability rates were very high after World War II and
then declined. As Figure 1 shows, disability insurance was the main entry path into the
German pension system until 1972 for both men and women.



--- about here Figure 1 (Pathways to retirement) ---



Phase 2 (1972 to 1984): Increasing generosity. The 1972 reform was a major change in
policy. It introduced “flexible retirement for the long-term insured” by providing old age
pension benefits at age 63, given that workers had a minimum of 35 years in which they

                                                                                                               5
contributed to the system. These benefits were not actuarially adjusted. Average retirement
age dropped by more than 2 years (Börsch-Supan, 2000), and the “flexible retirement”
pathway partly substituted for the disability pathway into retirement, see Figure 1.

At the same time, the “old-age pension for disabled workers” was introduced, first with a
earliest entry age of 62, then, after 1978, in two steps to age 60.

Between 1984 and 1987, early retirement was further extended by creating a “bridge to
retirement”. The government introduced more generous unemployment insurance benefits for
older workers which were especially attractive in the age rage from 55 to 59 years: up to 32
months of unemployment insurance benefits at 63 or 68 percent of former net wages. These
benefits were neither means tested nor were job-search activities required for those
unemployed who were aged 55 and older. In addition, severance pay became tax advantaged
for the employers. As a result of the “bridge to retirement”, the pathways to retirement
changed again: registered unemployment of elderly (age 55-59) rose – particularly
dramatically between 1991 and 1996 – and the uptake of disability benefits declined (see
Figure 1).



Phase 3 (1984 to 1992): Modest Retrenchment. In 1984, the balance between old-age and
disability pensions was changed by reducing the eligibility requirement for old-age pensions
(at regular retirement age 65) from 15 to 5 contribution years. At the same time, restrictions
on the eligibility for disability pension were strengthened. This included the introduction of a
minimum of three contribution years in last five years and stricter medical examinations.

Phase 4 (1992 to 2007): Sustainability reforms. Threatened by demographic change,
Germany began in the early 1990s a 15-year lasting process of reform steps. These reform
steps were not master-minded; some “happened” due to budget crises and new political
constellations. Seen from hindsight, however, the reform steps follow an astoundingly
consistent red threat.

Step 1: Towards actuarial adjustments (1992). The first step in the long German reform
process was the 1992 reform. It anchored benefits to net rather than to gross wages. This
removed an odd mechanism that would have created a vicious cycle of increasing pension
benefits in response to increasing contribution rates. At the same time, credits for higher
education were abolished and survivor benefits reduced.




                                                                                              6
The second important element in the 1992 reform was the introduction of “actuarial”
adjustments to benefits to retirement age. Actuarial is set in quotes because the adjustments
factors have been set discretionarily at 3.6% for each year of earlier retirement and are not
directly linked to changes in life expectancy. They are about 1.5 percentage points lower than
current life tables and a 3 percent discount rate would imply.2 Nevertheless, their gradual
introduction between 1998 and 2006 reduced incentives to retire early, and retirement age and
labor force participation of older individuals has indeed increased since then, almost
symmetrically to the decline after the 1972 reform (see Börsch-Supan, 1992, for an early
prediction of this effect).

Step 2: Towards a genuine multi-pillar system (2001). The financial situation of the pension
system worsened rather quickly after the 1998 elections that brought the Social Democrats to
power in Germany. As a remarkable irony in politics, the former union leader then secretary
of labor Walter Riester successfully passed a major reform bill through parliament in 2001.3

The Riester reform is a major change of the German public pension system. It changed the
monolithic pay-as-you-go retirement insurance to a genuine multi-pillar system by partially
substituting pay-as-you-go financed pensions with funded pensions. The reform aimed to
achieve three main objectives. First, the reform was to stabilize contribution rates. The Riester
reform law actually states that contribution rates to the public retirement insurance scheme
must stay below 20 percent until 2020 and below 22 percent until 2030 while the net
replacement rate must stay above 67 percent. Failure must precipitate further government
action. Second, a new pillar of supplementary funded pensions was introduced. Contributions
to this pillar are subsidized, either by tax deferral and tax deduction, or by direct subsidies.
These supplementary pensions are, however, not mandatory. Third, benefits of the pay-as-
you-go system were scheduled to be gradually reduced in proportion to the maximum
subsidized contribution to the new supplementary pensions.

Step 3: Towards sustainability (2004). Although praised as a “century reform”, it quickly
became obvious that the cost-cutting measures of the Riester reform would not suffice to meet
the contribution rate targets. A new reform commission, the “Commission for Sustainability




2
  Actuarial computations depend on a discount or interest rate which makes payments made or received at
different points in time commensurable. Usually, a rate of 3 percent is assumed, sometimes 4 or 5 percent. The
German computations rest on a discount rate of about 1 percent.
3
    The 2001 reform is therefore popularly referred to as the Riester reform.

                                                                                                            7
in Financing the German Social Insurance Systems”, was established in November 2002.4 Its
twin objectives were those of the Riester reform: to stabilize contribution rates while at the
same time ensuring appropriate future benefit levels.

The Commission met in 2003 very different circumstances than Riester faced just a few years
earlier. Unexpectedly high unemployment rates and the poor performance of the German
economy with extremely low growth rates precipitated a short-run financial crisis of the
pension system and created a sense of urgency for reform. Moreover, the electorate became
increasingly aware that stabilizing social security contributions and thus limiting the increase
of total labor compensation will be essential for enhancing future growth. This paradigm shift
away from thinking in pension claims toward thinking in financing possibilities had a
noticeable impact on the Commission’s reform proposals.

The Commission proposed an entire reform package (Kommission, 2003). In addition to a
gradual shift of the retirement age in proportion to the expected change of life length after
retirement, the key element of the Commission’s reform proposal was a new pension benefit
indexation formula linking benefits to the system dependency ratio, called “sustainability
formula”.5 It will lead to further decreases in pension benefits vis-à-vis the path planned by
the Riester reform. Most of the Commission proposals, and most significantly the introduction
of the sustainability formula, were quickly passed by the German parliament in May 2004.

In parallel, the government also passed major changes in the unemployment insurance system,
called “Hartz reforms”.6 They dramatically shortened the duration of unemployment benefits,
especially for older individuals, to 18 months (rather than 32 months) and made
unemployment insurance much less attractive as a substitute for early retirement and
disability insurance benefits. This was accompanied by shifting the age limit for “old-age
pensions due to unemployment” to age 63.

Step 4: Towards later retirement ages (2007). The Commission also proposed an increase of
the normal retirement age from 65 to 67 years according to a schedule from 2011 to 2035
reflecting expected future changes in life expectancy. The underlying rationale was to divide
the life time gained in proportion to the current division between life time in work and in
retirement, namely two-to-one. In order to prevent substitution into early retirement and

disability pensions as a result of the increase in the retirement age, the Commission also
proposed to increase the early retirement ages (to the same extent and on the same schedule as
the normal retirement age) and to increase the actuarial adjustments for disabled and long-
term insured workers.

The shift in the retirement age was deemed politically too dangerous and was excluded from
the legislation package in March 2004. The unions heavily opposed this adaptation of
retirement age to life expectancy, using the argument that it would lead to higher
unemployment and take jobs away from the young.

Nevertheless, in yet another ironic move, just two years later, with population aging high on
the political agenda, the then labor secretary Müntefering unilaterally announced an
accelerated increase of the retirement age, being fully effective in 2029. It was legislated in
March 2007. The age limit for “old-age pensions for disabled” was shifted to 65 years, and
the “old-pension for women” effectively phased out.

Phase 5: Reform backlash? The increase of the retirement age irated the left wing and was
watered down by exemptions for those workers who have 45 years of service. This may be the
begin of a period of reform backlash. Under increasing pressure from the newly founded “Left
Party”, the grand coalition government reverted the decision to shorten the duration of
unemployment insurance benefits for older workers which was part of the “Hartz-IV” labor
market reform. Moreover, the government decided in the spring of 2008 to make a two-year
exemption from the sustainability formula to increase pension benefits in 2008 and 2009
when Federal elections will be held. Finally, the issue of “blockwise partial retirement” –
essentially an early retirement device – is back on the agenda. It is too early to judge whether
these changes will end the phase of sustainability reform and begin a phase of reform roll-
backs.


3. Trends in Mortality, Health, DI uptake and labor force participation

We start the empirical analysis of the relationship between health, DI uptake and labor force
participation by showing long-term trends in mortality, other measures of health, and labor
force participation at older ages in Germany, from the 1960s to today. We first document the
substantial increases in life expectancy in the last 50 years. Then we relate those increases (as
proxies for improvements in general health and – by extension – ability to work) to patterns of
labor force participation. All numbers refer to West Germany only, unless stated otherwise.



                                                                                               9
3.1 Trends in Mortality
In this section we describe secular changes in mortality in Germany in the last four decades.
All mortality data used in this study were drawn from the Human Mortality Database
(www.mortality.org). Figure 3.1 shows trends in ages of equal mortality rates from 1957 to
2006. References are given by one year mortality probabilities of 60 and 65 year olds in 1960.
Thus 60 (65) year olds have the mortality of 60 (65) year olds in 1960 by definition. Positive
trends in age of equal mortality rates mean that individuals become older and older when they
reach the mortality probability of a 60 (65) year old in 1960. Presumably, mortality
probabilities are a good proxy for current health, thus rising trends in ages of equal mortality
probability indicate improvements in population health over time.


--- about here Figure 2 (ages of equal mortality) ---


Figure 2 reveals a number of remarkable facts about mortality in Germany. First, mortality
decreases (health improves) substantially between the 1960s and the 2000s. In 2006, a 73 year
old man or woman had the same probability of dying within the next year as a 65 year old in
1960. Second, relatively speaking, men and women have fared equally well. Compared to
1960 mortality levels, neither sex has experienced a larger increase than the other. The time
pattern, however, differs somewhat. Until 1970, men experienced hardly any improvement in
mortality. 60 and 65 year olds in 1970 had practically the same mortality probabilities as 60
and 65 year olds in the late 1950s. For women, we observe an increase of approximately 1.5
years. For both sexes, improvements in health/mortality have gained considerable momentum
in 1970, after which we observe a nearly linear increase in ages of equal mortality. Finally,
most observers will notice seemingly erratic fluctuations around the linear trend in the early
1980s (for reference age 60) and the late 1980s (for reference age 65). These fluctuations
reflect changing mortality patterns among cohorts born during and after World War I. We will
come back to the possible long-term effects of birth during times of war and hunger on health
and disability uptake in Section 5.


In addition to just showing the improvement in longevity in the last 50 years, Figure 2 can
also be used for a simple thought experiment to put current discussions about raising the
mandatory retirement age to 67 in perspective. Let us imagine that – in order to create a
sustainable pension system – the German government had decided in 1960 to link the future
mandatory retirement age to the mortality risk at age 65 for men and 60 for women (the


                                                                                             10
mandatory retirement age in the baseline year). The rationale would be to link the retirement
age not to chronological age but to "functional age", average health or life expectancy.
Figure 2 shows how the mandatory retirement age would have increased in the last five
decades. In 2006, men would have had to work until they were 73 years and 6 months old.
Women would have had to work until they were 69 years and 4 months old.


--- about here Figure 3 (one-year mortality rates 1960 and 2005) ---


Figure 3 gives a different representation of the gains in longevity. It shows one-year mortality
rates by age for men and women in 1960 and 2005. Note that mortality rates are depicted on a
logarithmic scale. The nearly linear increase in log mortality rates between age 45 and age 90
thus reflects an exponential increase in mortality rates by age. Mortality rates of men are
higher at all ages than mortality rates of women. Further, mortality rates at all ages are
substantially smaller in 2005 than 1960. In 1960, a 69-year old man had a probability of dying
within the next year of 5 percent. In 2005, such a mortality rate was reached only at age 76,
representing a gain of 7 years. For women, the respective numbers were 73 and 81,
representing an 8 year gain.


--- about here Figure 4 (ratio of mortality rates) ---


Figure 4 shows relative improvements in mortality rates by age and sex. Note that smaller
numbers indicate larger improvements. Across the whole age range, women have gained more
than men. However, there is hardly any difference in relative changes between age 50 and 63,
where mortality rates have roughly halved since 1960. The biggest relative improvements for
women have been between ages 64 and 85. Mortality rates in 2005 were nearly as small as
one third of the mortality rates in 1960. For men, the ratio of 2005 to 1960 mortality rates is
substantially higher.


Two findings in Figure 4 are relevant for the explanation (or lack of explanation) of trends in
labor force participation at older ages in Germany. First, in the relevant age range, secular
increases in life expectancy (and health) have favored neither sex. Second, the biggest relative
improvements in life expectancy (and health) for men have been exactly at the relevant ages
of 59 to 66.



                                                                                             11
3.2 Trends in other health measures
Although mortality rates are arguably a good measure of health of a specific cohort at some
point in time, it might not be the best proxy for work disability. Death is usually the endpoint
of a longer-lasting disease that might have reduced work capacity of individuals years before
their death. Further, certain diseases and conditions are known to reduce the ability to work in
the labor market without being lethal. Depression and musculoskeletal diseases are two
prominent examples. Moreover, as mortality declines further among cohorts that are still of
working age, the relative importance of non-lethal and lethal conditions for early retirement
behavior and disability uptake may shift dramatically. A weak or missing relationship
between mortality and health does not necessarily imply that health is irrelevant for early
retirement behavior.


--- about here Figure 5 (diagnoses) ---


Figure 5 shows the development of the proportion of primary diagnoses for disability pension
uptake between 1983 and 2008. The importance of cardiovascular diseases has diminished
dramatically. In 1983, 37 percent of all men entered DI with cardiovascular disease as
primary diagnosis. This percentage has dropped to 14 percent in 2008. Among women the
drop was even larger (from 38 percent to 6 percent). During the same period, the relative
importance of mental illness has nearly quadrupled for men and quintupled for women. In
2008, mental illness was by far the most frequent primary diagnosis (31 and 43 percent,
respectively). Detailed statistics by ICD codes reveal that among women, 43 percent of those
retiring early because of mental illness suffered from affective disorders (i.e. depression).
Among men, alcohol-related psychiatric problems play an important role. In 2008, more men
retired early because of alcohol-related psychiatric problems than because of ischemic heart
disease (Deutsche Rentenversicherung 2009). Another noteworthy finding in Figure 5 is the
hump-shaped trend for musculoskeletal diseases (mostly osteoarthritis and back problems).
While being on the increase as primary diagnosis until the early 1990s, reaching primary
diagnosis rates of about one third, musculoskeletal diseases have become much less prevalent
among both men and women and are now at 15 percent. Finally, cancer as primary diagnosis
for DI uptake has nearly doubled between 1983 and 2008, increasing from some 7 percent to
15 percent for both sexes. To summarize, Figure 5 clearly shows that, with the exception of
cancer, non-lethal conditions are important drivers of work disability in Germany. Mental



                                                                                             12
illness and musculoskeletal diseases account for about half of all men and three fifths of all
women retiring on DI.


--- about here Figure 6 and 7 (Health satisfaction and self-rated health) ---


Mortality might thus not in all circumstances be the best proxy for work disability. Figures 6
and 7 show – by age and sex – trends in health satisfaction and self-rated health drawn from
the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Data on satisfaction with health have been
collected annually in the same format since the first wave of the SOEP in 1984. Data on self-
rated health are available only since 1992. With few exceptions, it is hard to see any salient
trends in the data. Health dissatisfaction (defined as rating one's satisfaction with health below
5 on a 0-to-10 scale) and poor health (defined as rating one's health as poor or very poor) are
basically flat. Good health (defined as rating one's health as good or very good) seems to be
increasing among 60 to 64 year old men and women and 55 to 59 year old women. While this
pattern seems largely compatible with the secular increase in life expectancy, the downward
trend in good health among 50 to 54 year old men does not fit the general picture of
improving health status. Moreover, due to sampling variability and other reasons, the data on
health satisfaction and general health appear quite volatile. It is unlikely that these data could
be usefully employed to explain more short-term trends in disability uptake and labor force
participation.


3.3 Trends in labor force participation
Trends in old-age labor force participation rates for men and women are shown in Figure 8.
The thin vertical lines indicate the years of various reforms. Looking first at the trend in labor
force participation among men, it becomes obvious the that largest changes have happened in
the 60 to 64 age range. Labor force participation has dropped from more than 80 percent in
1966 to less than 35 percent in 1980s and 1990s. This was not a long-term process, though.
Between 1973 and 1979, labor force participation dropped from 71 percent to 39 percent. Of
course, this should not come as a surprise. The 1972 reform addressed exactly the age groups
before the official retirement age of 65 years. Since about the year 2000, we observe an
increase in labor force participation in this age group. This is most likely a result of the 1992
reform, which is phased in only slowly and which raised legal retirement ages in almost all
early retirement options (cf. Börsch-Supan, 1992, 2000). Among men aged 50 to 54 and men
aged 55 to 59, Figure 8 shows a steady decline in labor force participation rates between the


                                                                                               13
years 1965 and 2000. Nothing happens on a similar scale as for 60 to 64 year olds and it is
hard to see any connection between the various pension reforms (as indicated by the vertical
lines) and changes in labor force participation at ages 50 to 59.


--- about here Figure 8 ---


Labor force participation of older women clearly follows a secular trend towards higher
participation rates. Between 1960 and 2006, participation rates of women aged 50 to 54
doubled from 38 to 76 percent and participation rates of women aged 55 to 59 nearly doubled
from 33 to 63 percent. Among women aged 60 to 64, we observe a similar pattern as for men
in that age range (although on a lower level). The highest labor force participation rate was
reached in 1966 (24 percent) and dropped to around 12 percent in the 1980s and 1990s.
Again, the largest part of the decline happened as a results of the 1972 reform. In recent years,
however, we see a steep increase in labor force participation due to various changes in the
course of the 1992 reform. Börsch-Supan (2000) shows that this change can be traced to the
introduction of actuarial adjustments enacted with this reform.


3.4 Mortality and labor force participation
Using mortality rates at a specific age as a proxy for health at a specific age, we now compare
long-term trends in mortality and early retirement/DI uptake. We shift perspective by looking
at the mortality and retirement at ages 50 to 59 for German cohorts born between 1906 and
1943. The retirement data are aggregated administrative figures collected by the German
Pension Fund (available at www.fdz-rv.de). For cohorts born between 1906 and 1943, we
know what proportion retired at what age. The data do not show which type of pension was
drawn when individuals retired, but this can be more or less inferred from the retirement age.
Men and women retiring before age 60, which is what we look at in the following, can only
draw DI benefits.


--- about here Figure 9 ---


If long-term trends in disability pension update were driven by long-term trends in health, and
given the vast improvements in life expectancy/health seen above, we should expect to see a
secular decline in early retirement rates. Figure 9 contrasts trends in mortality and early
retirement rates for men and women. 10-year mortality rates at age 50 have gone down from


                                                                                              14
10.3 to 6.5 percent among men and 5.7 to 3.3. percent among women. Again, we observe a
nearly linear decrease with somewhat erratic movement for births around the time of World
War I. In contrast, the long-term changes in early retirement are best described by a "down-
up-down" pattern. First a decline for cohorts born before 1913, then a steep increase for
cohorts born 1913 to 1925, and another decline for cohorts born after 1925. Among men, the
proportion who retired aged 50 to 59 decreased from 18.5 for the 1908 cohort to 16.8 percent
for the 1912 cohort, then shot up to 22.9 percent for the 1925 cohort and decreased to 14.7
percent for the 1943 cohort. Among women, the proportion who retired aged 50 to 59
decreased from 16.4 (1908 cohort) to 12.7 (1912 cohort), surged to 18.8 (1924 cohort), and
then fell to 9.6 percent (1943 cohort).


Whereas the trends before 1913 and after 1925 are in line with the notion that early retirement
behavior is largely driven by health, the increase between 1913 and 1925 clearly isn't. On the
contrary, cohorts were getting healthier and healthier whilst retiring earlier and earlier. As we
show below (section 4.3), trends in labor force participation can at least partly be explained by
changes in eligibility rules for disability pensions.


Another way to show the relationship between age, mortality risk/health and labor force
participation over the years is presented in Figure 10, which shows labor force participation
rates by one-year mortality rates for 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000, and contrasts this with
participation rates by age. Panel A shows that labor force participation rates have decreased at
all ages. The biggest shifts have happened between 1970 and 1980 and in the 60 to 64 age
range (due to the 1972 and 1978 reforms). For instance, in 1970, 62 percent of all 63-year old
men were in the labor force. In 1980, these were 36 percent and 24 percent in 2000. We know
from the earlier analysis that life expectancy has increased substantially at all ages since 1970.
Thus despite better health, more and more men have left the labor market.


To account for both types of changes, reductions in labor force participation and gains in
longevity, at the same time, Panel B shows labor force participation by mortality risk (and
thus mutatis mutandis health levels). For instance, a man facing a one percent mortality risk
had a likelihood of being in the labor force of 91 percent in 1970 but only 57 percent in 2000.
A man facing a two percent mortality rate had a likelihood of being in the labor force of about
80 percent in 1970 and 14 percent in 2000. Thus conditional on health (as measured by



                                                                                               15
mortality risk), old-age labor force participation has dropped dramatically in the three decades
between 1970 and 2000.

4. How specific reforms have affected the retirement age of different cohorts

In this section we illustrate by three examples how changing social security and disability
insurance laws have changed the retirement behavior of German workers. Specifically we
look at the 1972, 1978, and 1984 reforms already described in Section 2. We also look at
retirement behavior from a different angle than before by exploring how reforms have
affected the retirement age of different cohorts. Often reforms take effect sharply and by birth
cohort, i.e. individuals born before a certain cut-off date are not affected by a reform, while all
individuals born after the cut-off date are affected. Straightforward before-after comparisons
of retirement age by cohort thus allow to assess the effect of those reforms. Since the changes
in early retirement rules have such predictable and sharp temporary and permanent effects on
early retirement and DI uptake, it is highly unlikely that sharp health changes happening
simultaneously can explain those effect. As shown in the previous section, mortality rates
have decreased steadily and fairly smoothly.


4.1. The 1972 reform
As shown above, the 1972 reform, which took effect in 1973, increased the generosity of the
German pension system by a substantial margin. The reform had two components: first, the
retirement age of workers with a minimum contribution of 35 years (long-term employed)
was reduced from 65 to 63 (without actuarial reductions). Second, disabled workers could
draw old-age pensions (instead of disability pensions) from age 62 onwards. The eligibility
criteria and the year the reform took effect taken together allow us to identify the cohorts that
have been affected by each reform component and to predict how the retirement age has been
affected.


The last cohort not affected by the reduction of the retirement age for the long-term employed
from 65 to 63 years in 1973 are individuals born in 1908, i.e. those who were already 65 in
1973. The first cohort affected by the reform are those born in 1909 who "suddenly" became
eligible for old-age pensions at age 64 if they contributed for at least 35 years to the pension
system. Cohorts born 1910 and later became eligible at 63. Consequently, we expect to see a

                                                                                                16
sudden jump in proportion of workers retiring at age 64 exactly for the 1909 cohort. This
should only be a transitory phenomenon, as every cohort born later would be given the option
of retiring at age 63 if they had worked long enough.


--- about here Figure 11 (1972 reform) ---


The above prediction is borne out by the Figure 11, which shows for each cohort from 1904 to
1943 the hazard rate of retiring at ages 64, 63, and 62. While the retirement hazard of
workers at age 64 was around 10 percent in the cohorts up to 1908, it jumped to 41 percent for
the 1909 cohort and dropped back to less than 24 percent for the 1910 cohort. In contrast, the
retirement hazard rate at age 63 jumps from 10 percent in the 1909 cohort to 40 percent in the
1910 cohort and even increases to nearly 60 percent for the 1915 cohort.


The second component of the 1972 reform was the introduction of old-age pensions for
disabled workers aged 62. Thus cohorts born from 1911 onwards had been given one more
early retirement option and we should see a permanent jump in retirement hazard rates at age
62. However, this is not what we see in Figure 11. Retirement hazard rates at age 62 start to
increase only from the 1913 cohort onwards until the 1917 cohorts, probably due to the delays
in the medical assessment process. Afterwards the retirement hazard at age 62 decline sharply,
which is due to the next reform we discuss in this section.


4.2 The 1978 reform
In 1978, it was decided to reduce the age limit for old-age pensions for disabled workers from
62 to 60 years (in two steps in 1979 and 1980). Thus, workers born in 1918 fulfilling all
eligibility criteria could draw this pension in 1979 at the age of 61. Workers born in 1919
became first eligible in 1980 also at the age of 61. Finally, workers born 1920 or later could
draw this pension from 1980 onwards at the age of 60. Consequently, we expect to see a
temporary jump in retirement hazards at age 61 for cohorts 1918 and 1919, and a permanent
jump in retirement hazards at age 60 from the 1920 cohort onwards. Again, this expectation is
confirmed by the numbers shown in Figure 12. Retirement hazards at age 61 increase from
around 12 percent for the 1917 cohort to around 20 percent for those born 1918 and 1919 and
then drop back again to 16 percent (and declining) for workers born 1920 or later. The latter
group shows a marked increase in retirement at age 60 (from 13 to 23 percent)



                                                                                           17
--- about here Figure 12 (1978 reform) ---


4.3 The 1984 reform
The 1984 reform, which took effect in 1985, was characterized by restrictions in disability
pension eligibility. To be eligible for disability benefits, workers had to have a minimum of
three contribution years in last five years before they could draw a pension. In effect, this has
ruled out claiming DI for many women who did not work on a regular basis. It is more easy to
illustrate how the 1984 reform has affected retirement behavior by changing the graphical
representation. Figure 13 shows the absolute number of workers entering disability insurance,
by calendar year.


--- about here Figure 13 (1984 reform) ---


It is obvious that the 1984 reform has dramatically changed the number of women retiring on
DI pensions. The number has practically halved from 173,000 in 1984 to 86,000 in 1985 (with
further decreases in 1986). Among men, the number has dropped from 163,000 in 1984 to
129,000 in 1986.


5. Early childhood environment and very early retirement – an illustrative case study

Although the preceding sections have clearly suggested that health is not the main driver
behind long-term trends and major short-term changes in early retirement behavior, in
particular on disability pensions, it would be surprising if health played no role at all in
explaining early retirement. To illustrate possible causal effect of health on retirement, we
draw on the current literature on early childhood conditions and long-term health effects. In
particular, we show how adverse early childhood conditions which presumably affect health
and work capacity in the long run might be responsible for retirement behavior some 50 years
onward. We show this using again the data on cohorts born 1904 to 1943, for which we know
at what age people entered retirement. Within these cohorts are those born during World
War I (1914-1918). In particular the last two years of war (1917 and 1918) have been
characterized by widespread hunger among the civilian population. Our question is, does
being born during wartime (as a health-shock) explain some of the time-series variation in
retirement behavior?


--- about here Figure 14 (WW1 effects) ---

                                                                                              18
Figure 14 shows the proportion of each cohort born 1904 to 1943 retiring below age 55. Since
no other early retirement schemes exist before age 55, these "very early retirees" are
exclusively on disability insurance when they retire. In the cohorts 1904 to 1914, the
proportion of very early retirees is fairly stable at about 12 to 13 percent. For cohorts 1915 to
1918, this proportion increases steadily until it reaches 17.2 percent in 1918 (an increase of
nearly 36 percent ). The first two post-war cohorts show a marked decrease in very early
retirement. Beginning at cohorts born 1921, another wave of very early retirement sets in. At
this point, we can only speculate about the reasons. The picture for women is even clearer.
We observe a continuous decline in very early retirement rates for women born between 1904
and the beginning of World War I. Then very early retirement rates rise by approximately
three percentage points or 29 percent. For the 1920 cohort, retirement rates are back to the
pre-war level of slighly less than 10 percent, before they increase again slowly. However, they
never reach the 1918 levels again.


The purpose of this short section was to illustrate how short-term fluctuations in disability that
are independent of reforms may indeed be explained by health-shocks. However, the key is to
find the "right" health measure. Mortality rates have not proved to be very successful in
explaining early retirement and disability rates. Being born during wartime and times of
hunger may have had long-term effects on health and ability to work, and the effects of World
War I appear to show in the retirement behavior of German cohorts. Although birth cohort is a
very "distant" proxy for health in later adulthood, it has the advantage of being presumably
exogenous to disability pension rules.


5. Conclusion

This paper exploited the history of the German pension system with its phases of increasing
generosity and subsequent retrenchment in form of several "case studies" and low-level
"natural experiments". These reforms suddenly affected many people (mostly by cohort).
Simple before-after comparisons suggest that these reforms had substantial effects on labor
force participation and retirement. Changes in rules had predictable and sharp temporary and
permanent effects on early retirement and DI uptake. Since changes in mortality have
generally been very smooth (with the exception of war and immediate post-war cohorts), it is
highly unlikely that sharp health changes happening simultaneously are plausible alternative
explanations of the effects of institutional change.

                                                                                               19
Specifically, there is hardly any cross-temporal correlation between DI uptake rates (or, more
generally, old-age labor force participation) and available measures of health. We also know
from other studies, such as Börsch-Supan (2005, 2008) that there is hardly any cross-national
correlation between DI uptake rates and measures of health. This result holds notwithstanding
that health does explain within country variation at a specific point in time. Especially mental
illness (e.g. depression) has emerged as a driver for early retirement via the disability
pathway. However, this is largely unrelated to mortality. Hence, in summary, disability
insurance appears to be is mostly a train on its own track and it is largely unrelated to
mortality or measures of health status over time and in a cross-national comparison.
