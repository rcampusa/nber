                                               ABSTRACT

Climate policy spillovers can be either positive or negative since firms change their production processes
in response to climate policies, which may either increase or decrease emissions of other pollutants.
Understanding these ancillary benefits or costs has important implications for climate policy design,
modeling, and benefit-cost analysis. This paper shows how spillovers can be decomposed into output
effects (which have ancillary benefits) and substitution effects (which may have ancillary benefits
or ancillary costs). The ambiguous net effect highlights the importance of polluters' responses to climate
policy. I then test for climate policy spillovers in electricity power generation. The estimates are consistent
with ancillary benefits from climate policy arising primarily from reductions in output (primarily at
older plants) rather than from changes in emissions rates.

1       Introduction

Spillovers from climate policy (also known as ancillary beneﬁts or ancillary costs) have important

implications for policy design, modeling, and beneﬁt-cost analysis. Spillovers arise since climate

policy could lead, for example, to a reduction in particulate matter (PM) emissions as well as CO2

emissions. In this case, the ancillary beneﬁts of reduced PM emissions from the policy should be

included in a beneﬁt-cost analysis and may well lead the beneﬁt-cost analysis to recommend more

stringent climate policies. Unfortunately, spillovers can be either positive or negative since ﬁrms

change production processes in response to climate policies, and these changes may lead either to

an increase or decrease in emissions of other pollutants. After presenting a theoretical description

of spillovers from climate policy, this paper empirically tests for and decomposes climate policy

spillovers in electric power generation.

         Climate policy spillovers have received attention in the estimation of health beneﬁts from

reduced air pollution. This extensive literature, which is recently surveyed in Bell et al. (2008),

varies considerably in its sophistication with regard to air quality modeling and the responses of

polluters to climate policy.1 For example, Cifuentes et al. (2001) simply assumes climate policy

uniformly reduces pollution across all spatial areas. Other studies use much more sophisticated

air quality modeling to estimate the eﬀects of emissions reductions. Bell et al. conclude that

although the various studies are diﬃcult to compare the results provide “strong evidence” that

the short-term ancillary beneﬁts to public health of climate policy are “substantial.”

         Burtraw et al. (2003) focus on the responses to climate policy of electric power generators.2

Using a sophisticated simulation model of electricity supply, the authors show that a carbon tax

would have ancillary health beneﬁts from reduced NOx emissions of about $8 per metric ton of

carbon. Since emissions of SO2 are capped, they note that there are no ancillary health beneﬁts

from SO2 emissions, but they estimate additional beneﬁts from avoided future investment in

emissions control equipment. Groosman et al. (2009) estimate similar eﬀects with a sophisticated

model of pollutant transport.3

      See also European Environment Agency (2004).
    2
      Ancillary beneﬁts have also been studied in transportation, see Walsh (2008) and Mazzi and Dowlatabadi (2007).
    3
      The more conservative estimates in Groosman et al. recognize that emissions of SO2 are capped.
         Ancillary beneﬁts from climate policy have also been studied in agriculture and forestry

where climate policy could beneﬁt soil quality, wildlife habitat, water quality, and landscape aes-

thetics.4 Finally, ancillary beneﬁts have been estimated to be substantial in developing countries

where regulation of pollutants may be less stringent.5


2       The Theory of Spillovers from Climate Policy

Emissions are generally modeled using one of three equivalent approaches: as an input in the

production process, as a joint product which is a “bad,” or as abatement from some hypothetical

level, e.g., business as usual.6 The ﬁrst approach has a number of advantages for modeling spillovers

from climate policy since it is readily adaptable to modeling multiple pollutants and allows for

a broad range of substitution possibilities. Moreover, it allows a simple way to model climate

policies, e.g., a carbon tax or cap and trade, as an increase in the price of CO2 emissions (from a

zero price).

         In this framework, climate policy spillovers are shifts in input demands in response to an

increase in the price of CO2 . Theory shows that input demand may either increase or decrease,

depending on whether the input is a substitute or a complement to CO2 . Additionally, the eﬀects

of climate policy can be decomposed into two eﬀects: an output eﬀect, which generally decreases

the demand for all inputs, and a substitution eﬀect, which depends on whether the inputs are net

substitutes or net complements for CO2 .7 Importantly, demand for pollution inputs that are net

substitutes can still fall with climate policy if the output eﬀect outweighs the substitution eﬀect.8

         To illustrate these principles, consider electricity generation which leads to emissions of

SO2 and NOx as well as CO2 . Suppose climate policy caused dual fuel generating units to switch
    4
     See Feng et al. (2004), Plantinga and Wu (2003), and Pattanayak et al. (2002). Ebakidze and McCarl (2004) point
out that ancillary beneﬁts must be skeptically considered with agricultural oﬀsets since oﬀset emissions reductions
from other sectors might also have ancillary beneﬁts.
   5
     See Dudek et al. (2003) for analysis of ancillary beneﬁts in Russia; Dessus and O’Connor (2003) for analysis of
Chile; and Joh et al. (2001) for analysis of Korea.
   6
     Theory texts illustrate the equivalence of the ﬁrst two approaches by modeling “netputs” rather than “inputs”
and “outputs”. Modeling pollution abatement is less useful here since it requires the deﬁnition of a hypothetical
emissions level, which is unclear when modeling multiple pollutants.
   7
     These eﬀects are equivalent to income and substitution eﬀects from demand theory.
   8
     Decomposing responses into output and substitution eﬀects is also useful since output eﬀects may not be eﬀective
for reducing emissions if regulations are incomplete or ﬁrms have market power. See Holland (2009) for further
discussion of output eﬀects with incomplete regulation.



                                                         2
from fuel oil to natural gas. Since natural gas generally has lower sulphur content than fuel oil,

SO2 and CO2 would be net complements: for a given amount of electricity emissions of SO2 would

be lower in response to climate policy. Since the output eﬀect also serves to reduce SO2 emissions,

climate policy would have ancillary beneﬁts from SO2 . Now suppose that climate policy caused

natural gas-ﬁred generating units to increase their combustion temperature, which reduces CO2

emissions but increases NOx emissions. In this case CO2 and NOx would be net substitutes. Note

however, that since the output eﬀect leads to a reduction in NOx emissions, the overall eﬀect may

still be a reduction in NOx emissions from climate policy if the output eﬀect is stronger than the

substitution eﬀect. Thus, climate policy could have ancillary beneﬁts or ancillary costs.

       Spillovers are illustrated in Figure 1 for the case of electricity production with emissions

of CO2 and NOx . The ﬁrst panel of Figure 1 shows the input demand for CO2 . If marginal

productivity is decreasing (the usual case) then the input demand (equivalently the value of the

marginal product) is downward sloping. The ﬁrm would increase use of an input if the value of the

marginal product were greater than the input cost. Thus at the optimum the value of the marginal

product equals the input cost. In the unregulated equilibrium, this marginal product would be

zero and CO2 emissions would be e0CO2 . If climate policy increases the price of CO2 emissions to

tCO2 , for example through a carbon cap or tax, then CO2 emissions would fall to e1CO2 .

       Panel B of Figure 1 illustrates the spillovers to NOx emissions from climate policy. In

the absence of climate policy, the NOx input demand is illustrated by the downward sloping solid

line and NOx emissions are e0N Ox . The response of NOx emissions to climate policy depends on

two factors: i) whether NOx and CO2 are substitutes or complements and ii) regulations on NOx

emissions. In general NOx and CO2 can be substitutes or complements. If NOx and CO2 are

complements, then climate policy leads to an inward shift in the input demand for NOx , i.e.,

decreases the demand for NOx emissions. On the other hand, if NOx and CO2 are substitutes,

then climate policy increases the demand for NOx emissions.

       Whether or not climate policy changes NOx emissions depends crucially on the environ-

mental regulation of the NOx emissions. Two polar cases illustrate the eﬀects: cap and trade in

NOx v. a NOx tax. If NOx is subject to an emissions cap (as in RECLAIM or in the NOx Budget



                                                3
Program), then climate policy does not change NOx emissions but changes the price of permits in

the NOx market. For example, if NOx and CO2 are complements, then climate policy decreases

demand for NOx emissions. Since emissions are capped, NOx emissions remain at e0N Ox and there

are no spillover beneﬁts, but the NOx price falls from p0N Ox to p2C
                                                                  N Ox .
                                                                         9


        On the other hand, if NOx emissions are subject to price regulation, then NOx emissions

change in response to climate policy. For example, if NOx and CO2 are complements, then climate

policy would decrease demand for NOx emissions and emissions would decrease from e0N Ox to e1C
                                                                                            N Ox .

Alternatively, if NOx and CO2 are substitutes, then climate policy would increase NOx emissions

from e0N Ox to e1S
                N Ox .

        Panel C of Figure 1 shows the eﬀect of climate policy in the electricity market. Since climate

policy increases the marginal cost of electricity production, the equilibrium price of electricity will

rise from p0M W h to p1M W h and the equilibrium production will fall from qM
                                                                            0         1
                                                                              W h to qM W h . This

output eﬀect will serve to reduce emissions of both CO2 and NOx . Note that the output eﬀect

makes it unlikely that NOx and CO2 would be gross substitutes since the substitution eﬀect

(which increases NOx emissions) would need to outweigh the output eﬀect (which decreases NOx

emissions).10

        Appendix 1 illustrates the proper valuation of climate policy spillovers for beneﬁt-cost

analysis. Two results are noteworthy. First, spillovers can aﬀect the optimal carbon price. In

particular, if there are ancillary beneﬁts, then the optimal carbon price would be set higher than

the marginal damages. Second, spillovers should be included in beneﬁt-cost analysis just as other

beneﬁts or costs are included. In fact, from a theoretical standpoint, spillovers are indistinguish-

able from changes in any other input, such as labor. However, care must be taken to evaluate

environmental spillovers according to their damages since market prices are not available.

        Appendix 2 extends the theoretical analysis in this section by deriving theoretical predic-

tions. In particular, both the input demand and conditional input demand must be decreasing in
   9
     Burtraw et al. (2003) note that the falling NOx price may have beneﬁts from avoided future control equipment.
  10
     Regulation under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAAs) may specify a maximum NOx emissions rate. In
this case, the conditional NOx input demand is perfectly inelastic over the regulated range. Note furthermore
that climate policy cannot increase the conditional NOx input demand (or the emissions rate regulation would be
violated). Since the output eﬀect may still serve to reduce NOx emissions, NOx and CO2 cannot be gross substitutes,
i.e., climate policy cannot increase NOx emissions with emissions rate regulation.



                                                        4
the own price and output eﬀects must be negative. These predictions will aid in the identiﬁcation

of empirical models.


3        Estimation Strategy

Spillovers resulting from responses to climate policy cannot be directly estimated in industries

which are not yet subject to climate policy. Moreover, in industries currently subject to climate

policy, it would be diﬃcult to disentangle the eﬀects of climate policy from the eﬀects of other

environmental regulations.

          To overcome these diﬃculties, I exploit the symmetry of input substitution and estimate

the response of CO2 emissions to the change in the price of NOx emissions.11 This has two

advantages. First, NOx emissions have been regulated extensively so it is possible to design an

estimation strategy with variation in NOx regulations. Second, CO2 was not regulated, so there

is no need to disentangle the eﬀects of the NOx regulation from CO2 regulation. To proxy for

changes in NOx prices, I use changes in attainment status under the CAAAs. Regions that fail

to achieve an ambient air quality standard are deemed to be in nonattainment. Designation as

nonattainment under the CAAAs triggers additional regulations, which vary according to each

state’s implementation plan (SIP).12 In this study, attainment status for 1-hour ozone proxies for

the price of NOx , which is a primary ozone precursor. Since California had multiple changes into

and out of attainment, the analysis focuses on California power plants .

          The estimation strategy uses a ﬁxed eﬀects estimator. The basic estimating equation is:

                             ln(Emissit ) = βNonattainit + fi + gi t + νjt + it                                (1)

where Emissit is emissions (of NOx , CO2 , or SO2 ) from generating unit i at time t; Nonattainit

is a dummy variable indicating that unit i is in nonattainment for 1-hour ozone at time t; fi is a

unit-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀect; gi t is a unit-speciﬁc linear trend; νjt is a market-year-month ﬁxed eﬀect

for market j; and it is the error term. To correct for possible serial correlation, the error term,

it , is clustered at the generating unit.
    11
     Exploiting symmetry requires care since it only holds for marginal changes. See Appendix 2 for details on the
symmetry of input substitution.
  12
     For detailed descriptions of the regulatory eﬀects of nonattainment designation under the CAAAs, see Greenstone
(2002).


                                                         5
         The parameter of interest, β, indicates the response of emissions to a change in attainment

status. Since the nonattainment dummy is a proxy for an increase in the price of NOx emissions,

the estimated coeﬃcient captures the own price eﬀect when NOx emissions is the dependent

variable. With CO2 emissions as the dependent variable, the estimated coeﬃcient captures the

spillover. A positive (negative) coeﬃcient indicates that NOx and CO2 are gross substitutes

(complements). The own and spillover conditional (net) eﬀects can be estimated by controlling

for output in [1], and the output eﬀect can be estimated directly when output is the dependent

variable.13

         Most of the potentially confounding variation is controlled for by the ﬁxed eﬀects. The unit-

speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀects capture any diﬀerences in emissions across units due to fuel-mix, generation

technology, generator capacity, installed emissions control equipment, or any other time-invariant

characteristics of the generating units. The unit-speciﬁc linear trends capture any trends at the

unit level, e.g., phasing out of old units. The market-year-month ﬁxed eﬀects are a vector of

indicators for each month of each year for each market, e.g., one indicator is for January 1999 for

the northern California market (NP15) and another indicator is for January 1999 for the southern

market. The market-year-month ﬁxed eﬀects capture all variation over time such as seasonal eﬀects

and changes in relative fuel prices, in labor costs, in capital costs, and in regulations aﬀecting all

generators as well as diﬀerences across the markets. This ﬂexible set of ﬁxed eﬀects captures most

of the potentially confounding eﬀects.

         Given this extensive set of nonparametric controls, model identiﬁcation is based on varia-

tion in the attainment status of generating units over time in the sample. Intuitively, the generating

units with unchanged attainment status would serve as controls for the generators with changed

attainment status (the treated group).14 The estimated eﬀect would be biased if there were unob-

served diﬀerential trends in emissions that were correlated with the change in attainment status.

This threat to identiﬁcation is addressed in two ways. First, the multiple changes into and out
    13
       By estimating ln(Emissit ) = β cNonattainit + β M W h ln(MWhit ) + fi + gi t + νjt + it and ln(MWhit ) =
β  Nonattainit + fi + gi t + νjt + it in addition to [1], all four derivatives in the Slutsky equation in Appendix 2
are estimated separately. However, the identity β = β M W hβ  + β c holds since the sample and all conditioning
variables are identical.
    14
       With change at one time in attainment status, the estimator would be similar to the well-known diﬀerence-in-
diﬀerences estimator.



                                                          6
of attainment in California diminish the potential for bias from unobserved trends. Second, the

model incorporates unit-speciﬁc linear trends to control for any unit-speciﬁc trends, which would

not be captured by the market-year-month ﬁxed eﬀects.

             The estimated spillover eﬀect could also be incorrectly identiﬁed if regulatory authorities

used the additional statutory authority to attempt to reduce emissions of other pollutants. In this

case, changes in attainment status would indicate variations in the prices of both NOx emissions

and other pollutants, and the estimated eﬀect would combine the direct and spillover eﬀects. This

potential confounding is limited by analyzing spillovers on CO2 emissions. During the sample

period, there was still substantive disagreement over whether CO2 was a harmful pollutant and

CO2 was neither listed nor regulated by the EPA as a criteria pollutant. This lack of regulatory

attention to CO2 emissions suggests that the nonattainment indicator is not a proxy for an increase

in the price of CO2 emissions and that the spillover eﬀect is properly identiﬁed.15

             Identiﬁcation is supported further by the testable predictions from theory. In particular,

Appendix 2 shows that own price eﬀects are non-positive for both factor demands and conditional

factor demands and that output eﬀects are non-positive. A nonpositive estimate of β in [1] with

NOx emissions as the dependent variable is consistent with the theoretical predictions. With CO2

emissions as the dependent variable, there are no additional testable implications since cross price

eﬀects can be either negative or positive.


4         Data

This analysis requires data on emissions, generation, attainment status, and other regulations.

Availability of the emissions data limit the sample to the years 1997-2004. Emissions data come

from the hourly U.S. EPA continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) for power plants.

The data are very accurate, include all fossil-fuel ﬁred generators meeting certain requirements,

and have been used in a number of studies.16 The hourly generating-unit-level data are aggregated

to the month for three reasons. First, a number of units report emissions in hours for which they

report no output. Aggregation accurately captures emissions and output while incorporating any
    15
         This argument does not hold for SO2 emissions.
    16
         For example, see Puller (2007), Holland and Mansur (2008).



                                                           7
start-up emissions from generating units. Second, if regulations caused a unit to be run fewer

hours, disaggregated data would not capture this reduction with the proportional (log) estimating

equations. Aggregation captures the zero production hours. Finally, the data is highly serially

correlated. Aggregation reduces the problem of serial correlation.

       Since California had the most variation in attainment status, the primary analysis focuses

on California. Of the twelve counties in California with changes in attainment status, only three

counties have relevant power plants: Contra Costa, San Francisco, and San Diego. After dropping

non-reports and data inconsistencies, the model identiﬁcation is based on changes in attainment

status at 29 of 178 generating units. The data are discussed further in Appendix 3.


5    Estimation Results

The results from estimating equation [1] are presented in Table 1. Each column reports the results

from one of seven regressions. Column (1) reports estimates where ln(NOx ) is the dependent

variable, i.e., the NOx factor demand, and columns (3) and (5) capture the factor demands for

CO2 and SO2 . Columns (2), (4), and (6) estimate the conditional factor demands since they

control for output, i.e., ln(MWh). Column (7) reports estimates from regressing output on the

same set of controls. Panel B additionally controls for other regulations. Throughout, the unit

ﬁxed eﬀects, unit-speciﬁc linear trends, and market-year-month ﬁxed eﬀects are highly signiﬁcant

but are not reported.

       The estimates of the three testable implications, in columns (1), (2) and (7), are all negative.

Thus, the regression results are consistent with the theoretical predictions. Moreover these results

show that approximately half of the estimated 40% reduction in NOx emissions can be attributed

to substitution eﬀects with the remainder being attributable to output eﬀects.

       The pollutant spillover eﬀects are reported in columns (3)-(6). For CO2 , the point esti-

mate indicates that nonattainment designation reduced CO2 emissions by 30%, suggesting gross

complementarity. Controlling for output, the point estimate is very near zero. This suggests that

almost all of the reduction in CO2 emissions can be attributed to output eﬀects. Similarly, the

results for SO2 , columns (5) and (6), also indicate gross complementarity almost entirely due to



                                                  8
output eﬀects. The coeﬃcient for the output eﬀect in column (7) estimates a 30% reduction in

output with nonattainment designation.

          The coeﬃcients on output in (2), (4), and (6) imply emissions elasticities for the three

pollutants of 0.8 to 0.9. These estimates are statistically less than one implying that the emissions

rates (emissions per MWh) are declining in output. However, the limited net eﬀects suggest that

the emissions rates do not vary substantially with changes in prices of other environmental inputs,

i.e., pollutant spillovers do not change emissions rates.

          Panel B includes controls for other regulations. Only three of 28 estimated coeﬃcients

are statistically diﬀerent from zero. Moreover, the four estimated coeﬃcients are only jointly

signiﬁcant in the regression in column (6). Controlling for other regulations reduces the point

estimates in Panel A but does not change the results dramatically.

          Table 2 splits the sample into old and new plants based on the average age of the plant’s

units. These results show that the reductions in Table 1 come primarily from the reductions in

output and emissions at older plants. Since newer plants are less polluting, they use the NOx

input more eﬃciently and thus did not reduce output in response to the change in attainment

status.

          The results are subject to three additional caveats. First, the power of the test is reduced

since electric power generators were likely not the marginal polluter targeted by the change in

attainment status. In particular, the state implementation plans (SIPs) for reducing NOx emis-

sions do not focus on electric power generation. Second, the estimates cannot control for local

economic conditions which may have been correlated with changes in attainment status. Finally,

the symmetry assumption requires care in interpreting the coeﬃcients as spillovers from climate

policy. Although the estimates are valid estimates of spillovers from ozone policy, they are only

locally valid estimates of spillovers from climate policy.


6    Conclusion

Spillovers from climate policy are important for policy design, modeling and beneﬁt-cost analysis.

This paper shows that spillovers arise from output eﬀects (which have ancillary beneﬁts) and



                                                   9
substitution eﬀects (which may have ancillary beneﬁts or ancillary costs). The ambiguous net

eﬀect highlights the importance of polluters’ responses to climate policy.

       The paper then tests for ancillary beneﬁts from climate policy in electricity power gener-

ation. The estimates are consistent with ancillary beneﬁts from climate policy arising primarily

from reductions in output (primarily at older plants) rather than from changes in emissions rates.

Appendix 1: Valuation of spillovers

To illustrate the proper valuation of spillovers from climate policy, suppose that electricity
production requires three inputs, a market input k with market price w, and two non-market,
environmental inputs: CO2 and NOx . Assume that the non-market inputs have (implicit) prices
( tCO2 for CO2 and tN Ox for NOx ) and have environmental damages τCO2 ∗ CO2 and τN Ox ∗
N Ox. Further assume that the electricity production function is given by q = f (k, CO2, N Ox),
consumer surplus is given by U (q), and the electricity market is competitive so the marginal
utility U  (q) equals the market price. The proﬁt maximizing ﬁrm use the inputs such that the
value of the marginal product equals the input price, i.e., such that U  (q)f1 = w, U  (q)f2 = tCO2 ,
and U  (q)f3 = tN Ox where fi is the ith marginal product.
The change in social surplus from a marginal change in the carbon tax is then given by:
                                     d
                                          [U (q) − wk − τCO2 CO2 − τN OxN Ox]
                                  dtCO2
                                       dk                     dCO2                     dN Ox
                    = (U  f1 − w)         + (U  f2 − τCO2 )       + (U  f3 − τN Ox)
                                     dtCO2                    dtCO2                    dtCO2
                                                   dCO2                    dN Ox
                               = (tCO2 − τCO2 )          + (tN Ox − τN Ox)       .                 (2)
                                                   dtCO2                   dtCO2
Equation [2] decomposes the change in social surplus from climate policy into a direct eﬀect and
a spillover eﬀect. There are several things to note about [2]. First, the direct eﬀect is positive
(increases social surplus) if the carbon tax is less than damages. Second, the spillover eﬀect can
be either positive or negative. If the NOx tax is less than damages, the spillover eﬀect is positive
if NOx and CO2 are complements, i.e., if dN     Ox
                                             tCO2 < 0. Conversely, the spillover eﬀect is negative
(reduces social surplus) if NOx and CO2 are substitutes. Third, the spillover eﬀect is zero if
NOx emissions are currently regulated at damages i.e., if tN Ox = τN Ox or if NOx emissions are
capped, i.e., dN Ox
              dtCO2 = 0. This shows that the spillover beneﬁts only arise because of a failure in
the NOx environmental regulations. Finally, note that the optimal carbon tax may not be equal
to carbon damages. In fact, the optimal carbon tax would be higher than carbon damages in
the case where the spillover eﬀects are positive.
For a larger change in the carbon tax, the change in social surplus is given by:

                                   ΔU − wΔk − τCO2 ΔCO2 − τN OxΔN Ox.                              (3)

The ﬁrst term is the change in consumer surplus from climate policy, and the second term is the
change in the market input costs. These two terms, which combined are negative, are generally
considered the abatement cost of the climate policy. The third term is the change in carbon
damages, which is positive. In a beneﬁt-cost analysis, this third term is the beneﬁt of the policy.
The ﬁnal term is the change in NOx damages and is the spillover beneﬁt (or cost) of the climate
policy. Note that it is somewhat arbitrary whether this spillover term is labeled an additional
beneﬁt of the climate policy or is part of the abatement cost of the policy.17
17
     For example, reductions in other input costs could also be considered “spillover beneﬁts”.

Appendix 2: Theoretical results

Let input demands—which are functions of input and output prices and are derived from proﬁt
maximization—be CO2 and N Ox. By Hotelling’s lemma, the input demands are the derivatives
of the proﬁt function. By the symmetry of the Hessian matrix of the proﬁt function, the cross-
derivatives of the input demands are equal. If dN Ox/dpCO2 = dCO2/dpN Ox is greater (less)
than zero, then NOx and CO2 are gross substitutes (complements).
Similarly, let conditional input demands—which are functions of input prices and the output
level and which are derived from cost minimization—be CO2c and N Oxc. By Shepard’s lemma,
the conditional input demands are the derivatives of the cost function. By the symmetry of the
Hessian matrix of the cost function, the cross-derivatives of the conditional input demands are
equal. If dN Oxc /dpCO2 = dCO2c /dpN Ox is greater (less) than zero, then NOx and CO2 net
substitutes (complements).
Since proﬁt maximization implies cost minimization, the factor demands must equal the condi-
tional factor demand where the output level is given by the supply function. Diﬀerentiating these
identities for N Ox and CO2 with respect to pCO2 gives the following “Slutsky” relationships:

                               dCO2    dCO2c dq     dCO2c
                                     =            +                                           (4)
                               dpCO2     dq dpCO2   dpCO2
and
                              dN Ox   dN Oxc dq    dN Oxc
                                    =            +        .                                   (5)
                              dpCO2     dq dpCO2    dpCO2
Equation 4 shows that the total change in NOx emissions resulting from a change in the price of
those emissions can be decomposed into an output and a substitution eﬀect. The output eﬀect,
dCO2c dq
  dq dpCO2 , is the change in emissions that results because the ﬁrm may choose to produce a
diﬀerent level of output (with diﬀerent emissions) under the new input prices. The substitution
eﬀect describes the change in emissions which results from the changing relative prices of inputs
while holding output constant. Intuitively, the substitution eﬀect arises because the cheapest way
of attaining a given output level may require more (diﬀerent) capital or fuel or CO2 emissions
when the relative price of NOx emissions increases.
Similarly, equation 5 decomposes the spillover eﬀect (cross-price eﬀect) into an output eﬀect and
a substitution eﬀect. Note that the cross-price output eﬀect is similar to the own-price output
eﬀect, except for the diﬀerent marginal emissions rate.
Theory imposes some restrictions on the signs of these eﬀects. These restrictions are:
                                                                                     c          c
Proposition 1 Cross price eﬀects are symmetric, i.e., dp  dCO2
                                                            N Ox
                                                                    dN Ox
                                                                 = dp CO2

                                                                               dpN Ox = dpCO2 .
Own price eﬀects are non-positive for both the factor demand and the conditional factor demand,
                          c
      dCO2
e.g., dp CO2
             ≤ 0 and dCO2
                     dpCO2 ≤ 0. Output eﬀects are always non-positive for the own prices, e.g.,
dCO2c dq
  dq dpCO2   ≤ 0. Cross price (substitution and output) eﬀects can be either positive or negative
for both the factor demands and conditional factor demands.

Proof of Proposition 1:
The symmetry of the cross-price eﬀects is derived above. Since the proﬁt function is convex,
its Hessian matrix is positive deﬁnite, so its main diagonal elements must be positive. Since
the factor demands are the additive inverses of the ﬁrst derivatives of the proﬁt functions,
the positive deﬁnite Hessian implies that the own-price eﬀects are negative. Similarly, since

                                              17
  the conditional factor demands are the derivatives of the concave cost function, the own-price
  substitution eﬀects must be negative.
  To show that the own-price output eﬀect must be negative, decompose the output eﬀect into:
                                dCO2c dq     dCO2c dq(P = M C) dM C
                                           =
                                  dq dpCO2     dq     dM C     dpCO2
                                                                                              =M C)
  where M C is the marginal cost. Since quantity decreases when marginal cost increases, dq(PdM C
  is negative. For an inferior input, an increase in the input price can decrease marginal cost. But
  since
                                      dCO2c        d2 c      dM C
                                             =            =
                                        dq      dqdpCO2      dpCO2
  the ﬁrst and last factors must have the same sign even if the input is inferior. Thus the own-price
  output eﬀect is negative.18
  Since the cross-price eﬀects are the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the matrix they can be either negative
  or positive. Moreover, if one of the inputs is an inferior input, then the cross-price output eﬀect
  can be positive. 
  Proposition 1 provides three testable implications for the econometric estimation. Namely, own
  price eﬀects should be non-positive for both the factor demand and the conditional factor de-
  mand, and the own output eﬀect should be non-positive. For estimates that do not conform
  with these predictions, either the model suﬀers some speciﬁcation error or attainment status is
  not a valid proxy for the price of NOx emissions.
  Although cross-price output eﬀects can be positive, the proof of Proposition 1 makes clear that
  they can only be positive in the case of an inferior input. If all inputs are normal, then all output
  eﬀects must be negative. Thus, the only way for two normal inputs to be gross substitutes (i.e.,
  for a regulation to increase emissions of a nontarget pollutant) is for them to be net substitutes
  and for the output eﬀect to be suﬃciently small that it does not outweigh the substitution eﬀect.


  Appendix 3: Data

  The primary level of analysis is the generating unit, which is deﬁned by the EPA and may consist
  of one or more smokestacks, boilers and/or generators. Appendix Table 1 shows the power plants
  and number of units in the three counties with changes in attainment status reporting in the
  CEMS data before and after the change.19 San Diego was declared to be in nonattainment of
  the new 8-hour ozone standard in 2004. The estimation controls for this redesignation. The
  redesignation months of August 1998 and July 2003 are dropped from the sample for all units.20
  Five units report zero emissions and generation throughout the sample. The ﬁve reporting units
  at Hunters Point are aggregated since four units report zero generation but positive emissions.
  Appendix Table 1 reports the average year online of the generators at each power plant. Since
  generators and units are not necessarily the same, the age of each unit cannot be known. The
  18
     This argument follows Nicholson’s well-known text.
  19
     Six counties with changes in attainment status had no power plants during the sample. Santa Clara County had
no power plants when its designation changed in 1999. The Kern and Solano County redesignations were for partial
counties. Kern County had three power plants coming online after 2001 and Solano County had four power plants
coming online after 2002, but these plants were not in redesignated areas.
  20
     The eﬀective dates of the redesignations (Aug. 10, 1998 and July 28, 2003) are from 63 FR 37258-37280 and 68
FR 37976-37978.


                                                       18
  average age (year online) of the generators at plant, which is 1982, thus is a proxy for the age of
  the units. The fourteen units which are always in attainment are somewhat older: average year
  online is 1978; whereas the 139 units which were never in attainment were somewhat newer:
  average year online is 1984. The units which switch attainment status also tend to be somewhat
  older on average. The relevant units in Contra Costa and San Francisco counties, which were
  designated as not in attainment in 1999, are quite a bit older: average year online is 1961. The
  units in San Diego, which was designated to be in attainment in 2004, are slightly older than
  average: average year online is 1978. The unit ﬁxed eﬀects control for these diﬀerences in the
  age of the units.21
  Appendix Table 2 presents summary statistics of the data aggregated to the month and to
  the day. The ﬁrst three rows are for the primary dependent variables: NOx , CO2 , and SO2
  emissions. The monthly means are approximately 20 times the daily means, implying that
  units are generating 20 days per month on average. SO2 emissions are particularly noisy (the
  coeﬃcient of variation is about 15). Most generating units in California are gas-ﬁred and thus
  have negligible SO2 emissions, so the large coeﬃcient of variation is driven by a few units with
  exceptionally high SO2 emissions. The proxy for the price of NOx emissions, nonattainment
  of the 1-hour ozone CAAAs standard, is positive for 86% of the monthly sample and 84% of
  the daily sample. This slight diﬀerence arises because the exclusion of months or days with
  zeroes for the dependent variables puts a diﬀerent weight on each hour. About 30% of the
  observations are from the northern California electricity market (North Path 15). The market-
  year-month ﬁxed eﬀects control for diﬀerences across the two markets. Approximately 45% of
  the observations are of units which were also in nonattainment of the CAAAs’ carbon monoxide
  (CO) standard. The regressions control for these other programs. There is no unit-level variation
  in PM nonattainment, so this control is dropped from the regression, i.e., is perfectly collinear
  with the unit ﬁxed eﬀects. None of the units is aﬀected by the NOx budget program (NBP) or the
  Ozone Transport Commission (OTC). None of the units is aﬀected by the Acid Rain Program
  provisions aﬀecting NOx , although a four units at three plants did choose early election into
  the NOx program.22 All of the units were Phase 2 units under the Acid Rain Program aﬀecting
  SO2 (Title IV of the CAAAs). Since these regulations aﬀected all units beginning in 2000, this
  control is dropped from the regressions, i.e., is perfectly collinear with the market-year-month
  ﬁxed eﬀects.
  Appendix Figures 1 shows average monthly NOx emissions, CO2 emissions, and generation over
  the sample years for four groups of units in California: two control groups (those units either al-
  ways or never in attainment) and two treatment groups (those units declared in nonattainment in
  1999 and those units redesignated as attainment in 2004).23 Panel A shows that average monthly
  NOx emissions from units generally fell over the sample. The monthly averages are mostly above
  the sample mean of 24,000 lbs. since the largest group (those units always in nonattainment)
  contains 139 of the 178 units. Average emissions from the units always in nonattainment only
  declined slightly over the sample, however average emissions of the 14 units always in attain-
  ment declined dramatically between 2000 and 2003. The NOx emissions from the 11 units that
  were redesignated in nonattainment in 1999 also show a steep decline in emissions after 2000.
  Note that these units initially had higher emissions than the controls which were always in at-
  21
     The unit ﬁxed eﬀects cannot control for diﬀerent trends at diﬀerent age units. The unit-speciﬁc linear trends
address this issue. In addition, the sample is split to estimate the model separately for units with diﬀerent average
plant age.
  22
     The three power plants were AES Alamitos, Etiwanda Generating Station, and Riverside Canal Power Company.
The indicators are only positive between 1997 and 1999.
  23
     The two control groups had 14 units and 139 units. The two treatment groups had 11 units and 14 units.


                                                         19
  tainment, but then in 1999 and after had lower emissions. This suggests that the redesignation
  may have lowered emissions at these units. However, the units which were redesignated as in
  attainment in 2004 do not show a noticeable up tick in 2004 as might be expected in response
  to relaxed regulations.
  Similar patterns are evident in the average monthly CO2 emissions and generation shown in
  Panels B & C. In particular, a decline is seen in CO2 emissions and generation from 2001-2003
  for some groups. There does not seem to be as strong a decline over time as shown for the NOx
  emissions. Comparing the CO2 emissions at units always in attainment with those designated
  nonattainment in 1999, we again see lower emissions and generation after 1998 at the units
  which were designated nonattainment. The pattern is not as clear, since these units then have
  higher emissions after 2001. The regressions will estimate whether emissions were higher or lower
  controlling for other confounds.


  Appendix 4: Robustness tests

  Appendix Tables 3-5 present the robustness of the results to diﬀerent speciﬁcations. Appendix
  Table 3 splits the sample into two time periods: before and after 2001. Identiﬁcation of the result
  in Panel A is based on the 1999 redesignation of the San Francisco Bay Area to nonattainment,
  while identiﬁcation in Panel B is based on the redesignation to attainment of San Diego in 2004.
  Following the 1999 redesignation to nonattainment, the Bay Area Air Quality Management
  District was required to submit a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for how it would regain
  attainment. The plan did not require new power plant controls (BA AQMD 2001). Thus, it
  is perhaps not surprising that the results in Panel A do not satisfy the testable predictions
  from theory. The results in Panel B, however, do satisfy the testable predictions and are quite
  similar in sign and magnitude to the main results in Table 1. When San Diego was designated as
  attainment in July 2003, the state was required to ﬁle a maintenance plan to prevent backsliding,
  however, other requirements associated with nonattainment designation for 1-hour ozone were
  relaxed.24
  Appendix Table 4 presents analysis based on diﬀerent levels of aggregation. Panel A presents
  results based on aggregating the data to the plant level. This reduces the number of observations
  by more than half and thus increases the standard errors. In addition, this analysis does not
  control for changes at the plant level, such as additions or retiring of units, which may be
  correlated with attainment designation. The preferred speciﬁcations directly control for these
  changes with the unit ﬁxed eﬀects and additionally control for diﬀerential trends within a plant
  with the unit-speciﬁc linear trends.
  Panel B of Appendix Table 4 presents the results based on aggregating the hourly data to
  the day instead of the month.25 The signs and magnitudes of the results are quite similar to
  the preferred results in Table 1. Additionally, the standard errors are more precise leading to
  statistical signiﬁcance of the gross spillover eﬀects for both CO2 and SO2 as well as a signiﬁcant
  eﬀect on output. These regressions additionally control for a quadratic function of temperature,
  which is statistically signiﬁcant.
  24
     San Diego was designated as in nonattainment of the 8-hour ozone standard in 2004. The main regressions
control for this designation.
  25
     When the dependent variable is daily emissions, a ﬂexible function of daily average temperature controls for
changes in demand for electricity within the month. The market-level temperature controls are not included when
the dependent variable is average monthly emissions since it would be perfectly collinear with the market-year-month
eﬀects.

Appendix Table 5 omits the unit-speciﬁc linear trends from the speciﬁcation. The signs of the
estimates are generally consistent with those in the preferred speciﬁcation; however, the magni-
tudes of the own price eﬀects are somewhat smaller. This speciﬁcation also shows a marginally
signiﬁcant reduction in CO2 emissions and a signiﬁcant reduction in output from nonattainment
designation.
