The Welfare Cost of Uncertainty in Policy Outcomes

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper proposes a simple index of the welfare significance of uncertainty in the public goods
resulting as policy outcomes. Our measure is the ex ante compensation an individual would
require to accept an uncertain level of service compared to receiving the expected value of the
distribution of possible values for that service. Our compensation measure is a function of the
coefficient of relative risk aversion, the variance in the measure of environmental service
associated with policy and relevant for the individual, and a set of conventional parameters that
describe the properties of nonmarket benefit measures under conditions of certainty. We would
expect that the inverse virtual price elasticity of the for the environmental service and the square
of the coefficient of relative variation are the primary factors influencing the size of our
compensation index.

    1. Introduction

        Most of the literature on policy design under uncertainty since Weitzman’s [1974] classic
    paper considers how uncertainty about pollution control costs, that is assumed known to
    firms but unknown to policymakers, affects instrument choice. This approach to modeling
    the effects of uncertainty is incomplete. When there is uncertainty about how firms will
    respond to a policy we should expect the realized environmental quality will also be
    uncertain regardless of the instrument that is selected. None of the benefit analyses for
    evaluating a new policy take account of the fact that when the outcomes of that intervention
    are uncertain, the benefit measures attributed to the policy will be different from what are
    conventionally used in benefit cost analyses.

        A recent example of the importance of uncertainty in policy outcomes can be found in
    Cropper et al.’s [2017] comparison of the estimates from EPA’s Regulatory Impact Analysis
    (RIA) of the 1998 Cluster Rule, designed to reduce hazardous air and water pollutants from
    pulp and paper mills, with what was realized. They note that the RIA’s predicted reductions
    in chloroform were largely achieved, but other toxic air pollutants experienced reductions
    that were half of what was predicted and there was no reduction in PM10 1. More generally,
    when analysts consider the outcomes of policy using monitored levels of air pollution they
    find significant variability in what is realized. For example, Brajer et al. [2010] note that
    between 2005 and 2007 in Southern California the eight hour ozone standard was exceeded
    about one third of the time somewhere in the region, despite an aggressive program of
    regulation that was expected to assure the standard would be met.

 Cropper et al. [2018] also describe differences between ex ante and ex post outcome with the NOx Budget
program.
                                                                                                                    2


         Fowlie and Muller [2017] have also documented how differences in what is known about
    abatement costs ex ante versus what is realized ex post can impact the welfare properties
    attributed to different policy instruments. Using Muller’s [2011] AP2 model, along with
    engineering estimates of source specific and technology specific abatement costs, they
    compare differentiated tradeable emission permits with undifferentiated permits for EPA’s
    NOx Budget Program (NBP) 2. Their analysis assumes perfect compliance by the electric
    generating plants subject to the rule. Even with this ideal adherence to the regulation, they
    find the difference between plants’ ex post observed compliance choices and the decisions
    that would minimize the ex ante compliance costs were sufficient to undermine any
    theoretical preference for differentiated emission trading policies. When regulators do not
    have knowledge of the intra-source distribution of marginal costs, policies based on ex ante
    engineering estimates of them can lead to markedly different outcomes than what is realized
    ex post. While the Fowlie and Muller analysis uses a simple description of the damage
    function for NOx, the AP2 model does incorporate estimation uncertainty for the key
    parameters leading to the model’s marginal damage estimates. All of the benefit measures in
    these analyses assume people do not recognize the potential for uncertainty in the outcomes
    of policy 3. This assumption is inconsistent with what has been learned from several studies
    of households’ avoidance behavior. Graff Zivin and Neidell [2009], for example, found the




2
  AP2 is an integrated assessment model that connects emissions of five common air pollutants (nitrogen oxides,
sulfur dioxide, fine particulate matter, ammonia, and volatile organic compounds) to estimates of ambient
concentrations, exposures to air pollutants, physical effects, and monetary damages. This last step is as a reduced
form computation. See Baker et.al.[2018] for a comparison of the AP2 model to alternative reduced form models
used to compute the physical effects and monetary damages from emissions of these air pollutants.

  Chavas and Mullarkey [2002] provide the most comprehensive effort to unify the literature on ex ante welfare
measures under uncertainty. Using a two period model that distinguishes both the timing of decisions and the
resolution of uncertainty, these authors describe how the contributions of information, risk aversion, and policy
can be distinguished in ex ante welfare measures. Their risk measure is a conditional measure of risk aversion. It is
the premium that an individual would pay ex ante to have knowledge of the expected values for both periods’
sources of uncertainty. In this context, choices could be made under conditions that reflect compensation for
resolution of the first period’s uncertainty, but with only the information a risk neutral decision maker would need
for private choices. Policies are defined so that they focus on changes in services that are not subject to private
choice. These services can influence the choices of private consumption goods and thus would affect the
decomposition of the ex ante compensation into the conditional value of risk and the individual’s valuation for the
policy. They do not consider uncertainty in the policy outcomes as we treat it here.
                                                                                                                    3


    behavioral dynamics of responses to smog alerts depend on the pattern of alerts and can be
    interpreted as a response to the uncertain air quality conditions 4.

         We develop a simple index of the bias arising when the environmental quality
    improvement from policy is uncertain. Two cases are considered. The first assumes the
    baseline level of environmental quality is not random and that only the level of quality
    realized with a new policy is random. The second case treats both the baseline and level
    arising from policy as random.

         Our analysis develops a second order approximation for a welfare measure that is
    interpreted differently depending on the description of the policy context. For the first case,
    where only the outcome of policy is uncertain, our measure is an approximation for the
    certainty equivalent. We can distinguish two parts of this measure. The first is the second
    order approximation for the Hicksian equivalent surplus for a certain (non-stochastic)
    increase in the environmental service associated with a policy. The second is a term
    reflecting the adjustment a consumer would require to this conventional measure due to the
    effects of uncertainty in the outcome of that policy. When there is uncertainty about both the
    baseline and the outcome from policy we define an option price. Our expression is a second
    order approximation that distinguishes the conventional surplus measure and includes the
    term reflecting the uncertainty which, in this case, depends on the magnitude of the variance
    in baseline compared to the variance in the post policy conditions. The general form of our
    index is not affected by the definition we adopt for the welfare measure –whether certainty
    equivalent or willingness to pay in the case of one random variable or the equivalent and
    compensating definitions for the option price when both baseline and policy outcomes are
    random variables. There is the conventional difference between equivalent and compensating
    definitions and the associated welfare measures for our cases as a result of income effects.

         This extension is important because it distinguishes risk aversion arising from uncertainty
    in the public good from risk aversion arising from income uncertainty. With non-separable
    preferences, the ability to adjust the consumption levels of private goods in response to


4
  Bäer et al. [2014] found the correlation between weather conditions and pollution affects the ability to detect
consistent averting responses to pollution. However, the sensitive groups (children and older adults) do reduce
time outdoors during high pollution episodes.
                                                                                                4


different levels of the quasi-fixed environmental service affects how the two types of
aversion are related. Our compensation measure describes how this connection, together with
private adaptation, influences the importance of uncertainty in the amount of the
environmental public good. In addition, the assumption of non-separable preferences allows
measureable features of individual demand to be used to characterize individual attitudes
toward uncertainty in the amount of the quasi-fixed, environmental good.

   To offer a “back of the envelope” estimate of what our index would imply for the
potential importance of uncertainty in what environmental policy is able to provide, we use
the case of a certain baseline and an uncertain policy outcome. We begin with the Currie-
Neidell [2005] estimates for the within zip code/month variance in ozone for Southern
California, together with the reduction in the eight hour ozone concentrations as our
indication of an air quality policy outcome. Our index of the importance of uncertain
environmental services uses a measure of compensation relative to the amount of virtual
income due to the improved level of the environmental good. With approximate estimates of
demand and income elasticities for environmental services as well as for the coefficient of
relative risk aversion from the literature, our index of the importance of uncertainty would
call for reducing benefit measures for this improvement in ozone relative to this contribution
to virtual income, by approximately ten percent.

   Section two describes how the benefits from improvements in environmental quality are
commonly estimated and provides a selective summary of the past treatment of uncertainty in
these analyses. The third section derives our index of the importance of people’s responses to
uncertainty in environmental services. The last section sketches the details for our back-of-
the-envelope calculation. It also discusses some next steps for considering how the
uncertainty in policy outcomes can be included in the benefits measures used in benefit cost
analysis.

2. Context

   When benefit cost analyses are prepared to evaluate environmental policies the
constraints of time and resources usually require simplified estimation strategies.
Conventional economic theory would define the benefits in terms of an indirect utility
                                                                                                                 5


    function. That is, given a quasi-concave direct utility function, with q designating the amount
    of an environmental service available to an individual as a quasi-fixed commodity, then the
    compensation, A, an individual would require to forego an improvement in 𝑞𝑞 from 𝑞𝑞0 to 𝑞𝑞1
    is defined in equation (1).

                                     (1)      𝑉𝑉(𝑞𝑞0 , 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 + 𝐴𝐴) = 𝑉𝑉(𝑞𝑞1 , 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚)

    𝑉𝑉(𝑚𝑚, 𝑝𝑝, 𝑞𝑞) designates the indirect utility function. Individual income is represented by m
    and a vector of prices for goods and services with p.

        Often benefit cost analyses would approximate A using an estimate of the unit benefits, b,
    as in equation (1a) 5.

                                           (1𝑎𝑎)    𝐴𝐴̂ = 𝑏𝑏 ∙ (𝑞𝑞1 − 𝑞𝑞0 )

    The connection between A and 𝐴𝐴̂ has been discussed extensively in the literature on benefits
    transfer, usually within a willingness to pay framework. One simple way to motivate a link
    between A and 𝐴𝐴̂ is to replaces the left side of equation (1) with a first order Taylor
    approximation in income around the point defined by ( 𝑞𝑞0 , 𝑚𝑚, 𝑝𝑝). This relationship is given
    in equation (2).

                 (2)       𝑉𝑉(𝑞𝑞0 , 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 + 𝐴𝐴) ≈ 𝑉𝑉(𝑞𝑞0 , 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 ) + 𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 (𝑞𝑞0 , 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚) ∙ (𝑚𝑚 + 𝐴𝐴 − 𝑚𝑚)

    Replacing the right side of (1) with a first order expansion in q around (m, p, 𝑞𝑞0 ) and
    substituting (2) for the left side of (1) yields (3) as an approximation for A. It also offers a
    specific interpretation of the measure that should be used for b from equation (1a). It should
    be the virtual price for q, (𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞 ⁄𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 ). 6



5
  Most of the benefit cost analyses prepared as part of evaluating new policies assume the changes under study
are small in relationship to the overall economy. As a result general equilibrium (GE) effects are not considered.
Smith and Zhao [2019] discuss an index for gauging when GE effects need to be considered. Our approach could be
extended to this setting. However, the current state of the art in benefit estimation limits our ability to
characterize both the nature of GE effects and the potential for uncertainty influencing GE outcomes. So we
consider this issue one for future research when these information gaps improve.

  We would get the same result with 𝑞𝑞�𝑉𝑉 evaluated at 𝑞𝑞1 instead of 𝑞𝑞0 had we used a willingness to pay
                                             𝑚𝑚
framework. For the most part, applications are more likely to be able to estimate the marginal value at the initial
quality level (𝑞𝑞0 ), not the one expected to arrive from the policy change.

                           (3) 𝐴𝐴̂ =           ∙ (𝑞𝑞1 − 𝑞𝑞0 )
                                        𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚


    When we assume that the effects of policy are uncertain, then the definition for either the
    compensation or willingness to pay for a policy needs to be reconsidered. An early
    recognition of these issues by Foster and Just [1989] considered a situation when consumers
    recognize that quality is uncertain and make commitments to purchase private goods and
    services based on their initial beliefs about quality7. To develop measures for the benefits
    from information policies, the authors consider a thought experiment. They ask: what would
    be the implications of recognizing that the beliefs about quality were incorrect? They develop
    a benefit measure for the new information (whether good or bad “news” about the level of
    quality) in terms of the adjustments to the expenditures on private goods in response to new
    information, “correcting old beliefs”. Measures of the cost of ignorance are derived by
    specifying a demand structure (and implied quasi indirect utility function) that allows the
    derivation of the price required for the good with new information about quality in order to
    assure the original consumption of that good was maintained. 8 More recently, Shafran [2014]
    has considered a situation with uncertainty in the results of a policy. Using the equivalent
    definition of the option price, along with estimates for an individual’s equivalent variation for
    quality changes that are not random, along with estimates for the coefficient of relative risk
    aversion, he shows how information about Hicksian equivalent surplus for nonrandom
    changes can be adapted to derive the correct option price measure.

         Our analysis describes how an index of the importance of uncertainty can be derived
    within a general setting that distinguishes the second order approximation for a certain change
    in environmental quality from the adjustment required to take account of uncertainty in the
    policy outcomes. This decomposition is derived for the two cases we consider –when the



7
  Quality in their case is associated with a private good. Because it is assumed to make a separate contribution to
individual preferences, their analysis is directly relevant to situations where environmental quality affects the value
of private goods. For example the water quality of a lake would influence households’ decisions to use the lake for
their recreation.
8
  Compensating surplus is then the difference in the expenditures required to realize the original utility level with
the new and old information and associated prices adjusted by the difference in the expenditures required to
purchase the original amount of the private good at the old and “new” price. This new price is what would be
required for the individual to purchase the original consumption level of the private good with the new
information.
                                                                                                           7


      policy outcome is treated as random and when both the baseline and the policy outcomes are
      random.

       3.   Risk Aversion and Compensation for Policy Uncertainty


            a. Uncertainty in Environmental Quality Outcomes of Policy

            Our goal is to develop an index of the effects of uncertainty in a nonmarket
       environmental service while holding prices and income constant. The first case considers a
       situation where we assume the baseline level of environmental quality is not a random
       variable and the level of quality resulting from the policy is. We begin with the definition of
       a certainty equivalent measure, 𝐶𝐶. This is the compensation an individual would require to be
       indifferent between a certain baseline level of environmental quality (𝑞𝑞0 ) with 𝐶𝐶 compared
       to a random level of quality that has a higher mean value of 𝑞𝑞�1 , as defined in equation (4) 9.

                    (4)        𝐸𝐸[𝑉𝑉(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚)] = 𝑉𝑉(𝑞𝑞0 , 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 + 𝐶𝐶)

       To develop our index and connect the result to measures of individual risk aversion, we begin
       by defining the random environmental quality in equation (5).




                     (5)         𝑞𝑞 = 𝑞𝑞0 + 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡

       The term 𝜀𝜀 is random with distribution function 𝐹𝐹1 (𝜀𝜀), expected value of (𝑞𝑞�1 − 𝑞𝑞0 ), and a
       variance of 𝜎𝜎𝜀𝜀2 . The term 𝑡𝑡 defines an index that allows the impact of the policy change
       leading to a random outcome for environmental quality that varies in magnitude. Our
       certainty equivalent measure, 𝐶𝐶, will be a function of the parameters describing the
       distribution for 𝑞𝑞. This use of this certainty equivalent, 𝐶𝐶, is a bit different from the usual
       definition (see Gollier [2001] p.21, equation (2.3)). In the conventional case, we are usually
       considering uncertainty in wealth (or income) and defining the certainty equivalent in the
       same units. Here the uncertainty is in terms of a non-market service and the certainty
       equivalent is in terms of a market good, our numeraire. As a result, it is possible to describe


9
    See note #4 above for further discussion.
                                                                                                                                        8


     how the degree of substitution between market and nonmarket goods, reflecting the ability to
     adapt, will influence measures for 𝐶𝐶.

     Taking a second order expansion of 𝐶𝐶 in terms of t, and expressing the derivatives of 𝐶𝐶 in
     terms of the derivatives of the indirect utility function, we can link our approximation to
     estimated parameters in the literature. Equation (6) replaces the left side of (4) with the
     definition, using 𝐹𝐹1 (𝜀𝜀) to describe the uncertain outcome of the policy intervention and its
     implications for the resulting 𝑞𝑞.




                (6)      ∫ 𝑉𝑉(𝑞𝑞0 + 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 , 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚)𝑑𝑑𝐹𝐹1 (𝜀𝜀) = 𝑉𝑉(𝑞𝑞0 , 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 + 𝐶𝐶(𝑡𝑡))




          Differentiating both sides of (6) with respect to 𝑡𝑡 and evaluating the expression at 𝑡𝑡 = 0,
     we have (6a) which confirms that 𝐶𝐶 ′ (0) uses the virtual price or shadow value for 𝑞𝑞, with the
     partial derivatives of 𝑉𝑉(. ) evaluated at �𝑞𝑞0, 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚�, to approximate the benefits from the
     change in environmental quality associated with the mean level of 𝑞𝑞 with the policy,
     compared to the non-random baseline or (𝑞𝑞�1 − 𝑞𝑞0 ).

                                   𝑞𝑞  𝑉𝑉
                (6𝑎𝑎) 𝐶𝐶 ′ (0) = 𝑉𝑉 (𝑞𝑞�1 − 𝑞𝑞0 ) = 𝑏𝑏(𝑞𝑞�1 − 𝑞𝑞0 )
                                        𝑚𝑚




          In what follows we will use 𝑏𝑏 to designate the virtual price of 𝑞𝑞. In practice, an average
     estimate of consumer surplus per unit change in the measure of environmental quality is
     often used to provide an approximate measure of 𝑏𝑏.

          Taking a second derivative of equation (6) with respect to 𝑡𝑡, using our assumptions about
     the properties of 𝜀𝜀 and evaluating the result at 𝑡𝑡 = 0, we have an expression for 𝐶𝐶 ′′ (0) as
     given in equation (7) 10.


10
  Differentiating equation (6) twice with respect to 𝑡𝑡, we have:
∫ 𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞 𝜀𝜀 2 𝑑𝑑𝐹𝐹1 (𝜀𝜀) = 𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 𝐶𝐶 ′′ (𝑡𝑡) + 𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝐶𝐶′(𝑡𝑡). By evaluating the partial derivatives of 𝑉𝑉(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚) at t=0 we assure
consistency in the point of evaluation of the functions on each side of the equations defining our welfare
                                                                                                                             9




                                     𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞                                    𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
               (7)     𝐶𝐶 ′′ (0) =            (𝜎𝜎𝜀𝜀2 + (𝑞𝑞�1 − 𝑞𝑞0 )2 ) −               𝑏𝑏 2 (𝑞𝑞�1 − 𝑞𝑞0 )2
                                     𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚                                       𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚


         Now using (6a) and (7) in a second order expansion in terms of , with the derivatives
    evaluated at 𝑡𝑡 = 0, we develop an approximation that allows us to separate how our
    expression for the certainty equivalent includes both the conventional benefit measure
    (associated with a certain change in environmental quality from 𝑞𝑞0 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑞𝑞�1 ) and an adjustment
    that takes account of the uncertainty in the level of environmental quality that the policy
    intervention produces. As we noted earlier, our certainty equivalent is being defined for an
    environmental service, not a factor that is defined in monetary terms such as income or
    wealth and affects individual wellbeing. Our goal in developing this approximation for 𝐶𝐶 is
    to use the properties of an individual’s preference function to provide links between
    measures of the importance of variation in environmental services and conventional measure
    of risk aversion.

                                                                              1 ′′

    Using equations (6a) and (7) in this second order approximation for 𝐶𝐶(𝑡𝑡) given in (8), we
    have equation (8a):

    We can use the properties of the virtual price function to provide an alternative expression
    for 𝐶𝐶 that is more directly linked to parameters that can be estimated. Equations (9a) and (9b)
    provide the link between the derivatives of 𝑏𝑏𝑞𝑞 and 𝑏𝑏𝑚𝑚 and the indirect utility function.

     So the expression 𝑏𝑏 ∙ 𝑏𝑏𝑚𝑚 + 𝑏𝑏𝑞𝑞 =                       − 𝑏𝑏 2            allows equation (8a) to be written in a form

         The first two terms in (10) expression are from a second order Taylor series
     approximation for the welfare measure in terms of the quasi-fixed good and analogous to
     what McKenzie and Pearce [1982] use for the case of a welfare measure for price changes
     (see their equation (6)). The last term is our index for the adjustment due to policy
     uncertainty.

     We can re-write this last term by introducing 𝑞𝑞0 into the numerator and denominator. The
                𝑞𝑞0 𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞
     term ( −            �𝑉𝑉 ) is now recognized as the coefficient of relative risk aversion for
                           𝑞𝑞

     𝑞𝑞, denoted by 𝑟𝑟𝑞𝑞 . It describes the curvature of the preference function in terms of the non-
     market environmental service 11. Focusing on this third term, now labeled as c , (to
     distinguish it from the approximation for the certainty equivalent 𝐶𝐶), we have equation
     (11).

  The derivatives of 𝑉𝑉(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚) are evaluated at 𝑞𝑞0 . This assumption is based on the assumption that the
information for evaluating policies describes consumer behavior under the baseline conditions.
                                                                                                            11


     With some further substitutions, we can connect our index to concepts with available
     estimates from applications. Using (9a) and (9b) we can write the income elasticity of the
     virtual price of 𝑞𝑞 in (12)

                        𝑚𝑚    𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕      𝑚𝑚𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞        𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚

                                          𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞            𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚


     Now we can express the relative risk aversion coefficient for 𝑞𝑞, 𝑟𝑟𝑞𝑞 in terms of the income
     elasticity for 𝑏𝑏, the relative risk aversion coefficient for risks to income 𝑟𝑟, defined as 𝑟𝑟 =
             𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
     �−𝑚𝑚             �, and 𝜃𝜃 the inverse “price” elasticity for 𝑞𝑞 as in equation (13).
               𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚


        (13)            𝑟𝑟𝑞𝑞 = 𝑠𝑠 ∙ (𝑟𝑟 − 𝑛𝑛) + 𝜃𝜃

        where: 𝑠𝑠 = the share of income that would be associated with the virtual expenditures on
        q.

                𝑏𝑏𝑞𝑞0
        𝑠𝑠 =            ;
                 𝑚𝑚


        𝑏𝑏 = virtual price for q;

                      𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝑞𝑞0
         𝜃𝜃 = − 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 ∙              ;
                               𝑏𝑏


                  𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕       𝑚𝑚
         𝑛𝑛 = 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 ∙ 𝑏𝑏 .

        Weak complementarity and the Willig [1978] condition imply that 𝑛𝑛 is equal to the
     income elasticity of the weak complement (Palmquist [2005]) 12. As a result, for those cases
     where q has a private good that is a weak complement, equation (13) can be re-written using
     this income elasticity, 𝜉𝜉, for 𝑥𝑥 a private good that is assumed to be a weak complement to 𝑞𝑞
     as equation (14).

        (14)            𝑟𝑟𝑞𝑞 = 𝑠𝑠(𝑟𝑟 − 𝜉𝜉) + 𝜃𝜃

                                        𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕     𝑚𝑚
                        with 𝜉𝜉 = 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 ∙           𝑥𝑥

  For a graphical analysis explaining how weak complementarity and the Willig condition can be related to
equivalent changes in the weak complement’s price see Smith and Banzhaf [2006].
                                                                                                                                     12


          To our knowledge 𝑟𝑟𝑞𝑞 has not been estimated. Thus equation (14) allows our index of the
      effects of uncertainty in 𝑞𝑞 to be expressed in terms of measures of preferences that have
      been estimated in a variety of contexts. As we noted earlier, it is also important to
      acknowledge all measures of risk aversion depend on what is allowed to adjust. For the case
      of environmental quality this is especially important because we usually label these
      adjustments in expenditures on private goods and services or allocations of time as
      adaptation. One can readily demonstrate that bounds for the measures of aversion depend on
      the extent of adaptation. Measures of aversion are smallest when all private goods are
      allowed to adjust and can be expected to be progressively larger as adjustment options are
      restricted 13. Substituting for 𝑟𝑟𝑞𝑞 using (14) into (11) we can express c relative to the virtual
      expenditures for q evaluated at the expected value as in equation (15).

     Our derivation also provides a description of the relationship of our index to a second order
     approximation of the compensation measure for a certain change in 𝑞𝑞 and the first terms in
     equation (10) is the conventional measure of benefits used in practice.

          b. Uncertainty in Environmental Quality Before and After Policy

          To treat both the baseline and policy generated levels for q as random we must introduce
     a new measure of the welfare change for a policy. Instead of a certainty equivalent we use the
     equivalent surplus version for the option price (OP), as defined in equation (17).

     In this equation 𝐹𝐹0 (𝜈𝜈) is the distribution function for 𝜈𝜈 (the error added to the baseline,
     average environmental quality, 𝑞𝑞�0 ) to allow for uncertainty in the initial level of quality. Now
     we re-define 𝐸𝐸(𝜀𝜀) = 𝑞𝑞�1 − 𝑞𝑞�0. We assume E(𝜈𝜈) = 0 and the variance in 𝜈𝜈 is 𝜎𝜎𝜈𝜈2 . Using the

same basic logic as with the case of a single random variable, we can define a second order
approximation for 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂(𝑡𝑡)in terms of 𝑡𝑡 and express 𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑃′ (0) and 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂′′(0) in terms of partial

Now substituting these terms into the second order approximation for the option price
function with the derivatives of the function evaluated at t=0 (comparable to what we did with
the certainty equivalent) we have (19).

The last term in equation (19) has a comparable form to that in equation (10). However it now
considers the difference in the variance in the error for baseline conditions versus what
characterizes the situation with the policy. Using comparable substitutions, we have our index

      the magnitude of the variance in environmental quality after the policy compared to the
      variance in conditions before, as in (20)

      As we demonstrate in the Appendix, the adjustment for uncertainty would not change had we
      adopted a compensating surplus (or a willingness to pay) framework to define the option price
      (labeled as W). The final result in this case is given in equation (21).

           The virtual price flexibility, 𝜃𝜃, can be related to the income elasticity of demand for
      environmental services relative to a composite elasticity of substitution between these
      services and a Hicksian composite good for all private goods that each individual consumes 14.
      While we might expect that the income elasticity of demand for environmental services is
      greater than unity, there is also some indirect evidence indicating for some resources it may
      be less than one (see Kristr𝑜𝑜̈ m and Riera [1996]).

           The logic underlying the expectation for values greater that one assumes that higher
      demands are associated with individuals with higher incomes. If we assume the income
      elasticity is unity, this adaptation of Chavas’ logic would imply that we consider whether
      private goods provide adequate substitutes for the environmental services that are likely to be
      subject to policy uncertainty. If they do not have good substitutes, then we would expect the
      price flexibility (in absolute magnitude) to be appreciably greater than one. So a range of
      estimates from 1 to 3 for 𝜃𝜃 could seem reasonable. This parameter is likely the dominant
      factor in gauging approximate values for our index of the importance of policy uncertainty,
      when the baseline level of environmental quality is assumed non-random.


14
     The relationship can be derived from Chavas [1984] analysis of mixed demands (see Smith [1992] equation (2)).
                                                                                                                    15


         Most policy assessments imply the virtual expenditures for environmental services would
     be small and are likely under 3% of virtual income 15. Selecting a value or range of values for
     the coefficient of relative risk aversion is potentially more controversial. Empirical
     assessments have yielded a wide range of values, some as large as 4 or 5 16. Recent work in
     the context of risks to wealth would support using estimates at the high end of this range
     when we consider aversion to income losses 17. By contrast, Chetty’s [2006] bound for r, with
     modest levels of complementarity between consumption and leisure, implies a value for the
     coefficient of relative risk aversion of 0.97 with a range of values at the bottom end of what
     the literature would imply for risks to income --from 0.30 to 2.30. The composite of this
     research would suggest that using the high end of Chetty’s range would be conservative.

         Our compensation index for the importance of uncertainty needs one more parameter –
     either the “price” flexibility of income (𝑛𝑛), using equation (14) or the income elasticity of
     demand for a private good (𝜉𝜉) known to be a weak complement to the non-market service,
     using equation (15). There are estimates of both in the literature (see Phaneuf and Smith
     [2005] for the case of recreation). None of these estimates for either 𝑛𝑛 or 𝜉𝜉 would exceed the
     upper limit from Chetty’s range for r and certainly not for the majority of the other literature
     using either 𝑛𝑛 or 𝜉𝜉. Thus, we would expect that 𝜃𝜃 and the relative variance in q are the
     primary factors influencing the size of (𝑐𝑐�𝑏𝑏𝑞𝑞� ).
                                                      0


         Developing a range of empirical examples for the approximate magnitude of (𝑐𝑐�𝑏𝑏𝑞𝑞� ) is
                                                                                                               0

     difficult because we are usually confined to proxy variables as our measures for q and
     empirical studies do not always present measures for the variability in these proxies over time
     or geography. Fortunately, Currie and Neidell’s [2005] results using weekly ozone and PM10
     (particulate matter 10 microns or less) readings at the zip code level in California for 11 years

   Virtual income is the sum of monetary income plus the virtual expenditures (i.e. virtual price of the quasi fixed
service times the amount of the service with the baseline or reference allocation of resources). Carbone and Smith
[2008] provide a sensitivity analysis of the effects of the assumption about this virtual share for partial and general
equilibrium measures of the excess burden of taxes that would affect nonmarket environmental services.
16
   See Meyer and Meyer’s [2005] summary reports adjusted estimates between 0.8 and 2.4 for wealth and 2.8 to 7
for consumption which is likely more relevant for our income measure. See their Table 2.
17
   See Cohen and Einav [2007 ].
                                                                                                               16


     provide what we need 18. Considering first the results for ozone, our approximate estimates of
     the remaining parameters would imply that a “back of the envelope” estimate of the welfare
     importance of the uncertainty in ozone of about two percent. Comparing this estimate with an
     estimate of 𝐴𝐴̂ for the change in ozone from 1989 to 2000 relative to 𝑏𝑏𝑞𝑞1 .This example
     interprets the change in ozone from 1989 to 2000 as (𝑞𝑞�1 − 𝑞𝑞0 ). Our ratio would be .227. So
     uncertainty would call for reducing conventional benefit measures compared to 𝑏𝑏𝑞𝑞1 by ten
     percent. The same exercise for PM10 would imply about a twelve percent reduction to the
     corresponding 𝐴𝐴̂ compared to the equivalent 𝑏𝑏𝑞𝑞1 . Of course, the importance of our index of
     uncertainty will vary with the measure for q and the context. As we discuss in footnote #13
     above, our measure of the aversion to uncertainty in environmental conditions will also
     depend on whether other goods can be adjusted. The comparison we discuss in that note
     provides a direct example of the potential importance of private (and public) adaptation to
     environmental uncertainty. It illustrates why the ability to adapt with private goods affects the
     adjustment for uncertainty. Our sample calculations would change with different assumptions
     about the extent of adaptation. When adjustment is not possible or very costly, uncertainty in
     the outcomes of environmental policy can be important to the benefits we attribute to
     proposed policies.




     4. Implications

         Benefit cost analyses of proposed environmental policies assume the regulations being
     evaluated “work”. That is, they assume the new rules yield, with certainty, the improvements
     in the specific dimensions of environmental quality that are being assessed. As we noted
     earlier, there are many examples of discrepancies between the anticipated outcomes of
     regulatory programs and what is actually realized. This observation is hardly surprising.
     Indeed, analysts use these experiences to enhance our understanding of the rulemaking
     process.




18
  Reductions in ambient concentrations of pollution are commonly used as a proxy for air quality. We follow this
logic and use for our example the variance in ambient concentrations as a proxy for 𝜎𝜎𝜀𝜀2 .
                                                                                                              17


         People adapt to uncertainty in environmental conditions. We selected one example for the
     case of air quality. There are many other empirical examples where individuals recognize
     uncertainty in environmental conditions and adjust their behavior – whether in response to
     warnings about food products or drinking water, weather and outdoor recreation, or indoor air
     pollution 19. The possibility that policy measure may change this uncertainty –increasing the
     variability in environmental conditions or decreasing it has been overlooked in the literature.
     Once we acknowledge people adapt then the benefit measures we attribute to these policies
     need to reflect this uncertainty.

         Of course, each regulatory program will be different. Realized outcomes from the new
     rules depend on the actual conditions of those facilities responsible for the emissions. They
     also depend on the implementation process and the natural systems that affect the dispersal of
     emissions and the resulting ambient air quality. To the extent one policy leads to recognizable
     differences in the uncertainty likely for environmental services provided by that program, the
     benefit estimates should be reduced to reflect it. Our index of compensation for risk provides
     a first step in acknowledging that people recognize uncertainty in environmental quality.
     These responses imply that when benefits are attributed to new policies they should be
     reduced to take account of the uncertainty in what they can actually deliver.

         Our examples were presented in relative terms (i.e. compared to approximate measures
     for 𝑏𝑏𝑞𝑞1 ) deliberately because each component of the example uses proxy measures for
     quality and realistic examples will require careful delineation of the estimates underlying 𝑟𝑟𝑞𝑞
     for each environmental resource and a closer link to the specific policies under consideration.
     Ideally the development of the index will motivate greater effort to consider how the variance
     in environmental quality should be measured -- whether over locations within the same air
     shed (or river basin) or over time for a given location -- as well as the economic parameters
     that are components of 𝑟𝑟𝑞𝑞 .




19
  Cases involving information disclosures do not exactly match our framework. They offer indirect evidence that
consumers react to uncertainty in environmental conditions that affect goods and services they consume. For an
example involving drinking water see Graff Zivin, Neidell, and Schlenker [2011]; for one involving consumption
advisories see Shimshack, Ward, and Beatty [2007]; for indoor air pollution see Smith, Desvousges, and Payne
[1995]; and for weather and cycling see Chan and Wichman [2018].
