                  The Physical State of the British
                      Working Class, 1870—1914:
                     Evidence from Army Recruits



                               ABSTRACT




     It is easier to discover why people died in the past than how

healthy they were during their lives.      However, in both Europe and

North America, much evidence survives about the health of young

males from the medical examination of recruits to the armed forces.

The paper discusses the possibility of generalizing from one. such

source, that of British volunteer recruits, to the health of the male

working class.     It concludes that the source is not seriously

biassed and that, after some statistical correction, the data suggest

a gradual improvement in the nutritional status, measured by average

height, of the British working class.     This finding contradicts much

contemporary opinion that the British were physically deteriorating

in the late nineteenth century.

        The British were shocked by the Boer War. Not only did it take an
army of half a million British and colonial soldiers to defeat "an
enemy whose total population, women, children and old men included,
amounted to scarcely one fifth that number" (Searle 1971:38), not only
did the war reveal the incompetence and even venality of many army
officers, but it brought alarming knowledge of the poor physical state
of the British population. The British system of voluntary recruitment
to the armed forces, much cherished in the face of the conscription
systems of the European powers, was seen to have survived in times of
relative peace when manpower needs were small, but to be inadequate in
times of major war; this was not because volunteers were slow to come

forward, but because of   the appalling physical state of those who did.
Many were rejected by the recruiting officers, many more by medical
officers and others -fell      ill quickly under   the   rigours of military
life. In all, as Major—General Sir Frederick Maurice calculated in
1902, "out of every five men who are willing to enlist only two are
fit to become effective soldiers" ('Miles' 1902:79)..




     Although Maurices calculations were soon faulted and               his

pessimistic conclusions disputed, many journalists and politicians
were ready to agree with him that the physical state of the nation had
produced "a far more deadly peril than any that was presented by the
most anxious period of the South African war" ('Miles' 1902:86).. This
peril sprang, Maurice thought, from the fact that "the great body of
the nation itself is decaying in health and physical vigour" ('Miles'
1902:82) and would moreover, as it bred, reproduce itself in ever more
stunted and unhealthy a form. Maurice, like others such as Shee and
like earlier writers such as Cantlie and Freeman—Williams, was
convinced that progressive physical deterioration had set in and that
only a massive programme of education of the lower classes in better
parenthood might stand a chance of averting catastrophe (Maurice
1903:52; Shee 1903; Cantlie 1885; Freeman—Williams 1590). Unless
something were done, the nation would be unable to defend itself.


      Concern with physical deterioration went far wider than worries
about army recruiting, but the evidence cited by Maurice came entirely
from his knowledge a-f recruiting. His arguments were reinforced by the

Inspector—General of Army Recruiting, whose report for 1902 contained


                                  PAGE 2
a telling sentence:

          "The one subject which causes anxiety in the future as
          regards recruiting is the gradual deterioration of the
          physique of the working classes from whom the bulk of the
          recruits must always be drawn" (PP. 1903 xi: para.150).
It was therefore natural that when the government, alarmed by these

warnings and by public opinion on           the    issue,    set   up   the
Inter—Departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration, the Committee
should begin its work by discussing the conclusions that could be
drawn from a study o-F recruiting statistics. In its report, the
Committee quoted with approval a statement made to it by Sir William
Taylor, the Director—General of the Army Medical Service:
          "I consider it is impossible to obtain reliable statistical
          or other data regarding the conditions that have existed in
          the past; and, consequently, as no reliable data are
          obtainable for purposes of comparison, I do not see how the

          question    can     be   dealt    with   from     the progressive
          deterioration point of view (P..P.. 1904 xxxii:8)..

Another witness, Professor Cunningham, expanded on one reason why this
was so and why "perhaps the most unreliable evidence is obtained from
the recruiting statistics":
          "Because the class -from which the recruits are derived
          varies from time to time with the conditions of the labour
          market. When trade is good and employment plentiful it is
          only from the lowest stratum o-f the people that the Army
          receives its supply of men; when, on the other hand, trade
          is bad, a better class of recruit is available. Consequently
          the records of the recruiting department of the Army do not


                                   PAGE 3
          deal with a homogeneous sample o-f the people taken from one
          distinct class" (PF     1904 xxxii:10)
Faced with this body of expert opinion, the Committee concluded that:
             -   it   would be as reasonable to argue from criminal
          statistics to the morals of the great mass of the people, as
          it would be to argue to their physical conditions from the
          feeble specimens that come under the notice of recruiting
          of-ficers" (P_P. 1904 xxxii:12)

Consequently, while the Committee found that there were considerable
grounds f or concern about the physical state of the nation in 1904, it

did not comment on whether that state was improving or deteriorating.


     Yet the question remains an interesting one. As Derek Oddy has
recently observed, historians who seek for evidence of health in the
past usually find only evidence of ill—health; "positive data on
health and normal physical development are scarce, while evidence of
mortality and morbidity can be found in abundance from a variety of
sources... .What is missing is a description of healthy late—Victorian
Homo sapiens" (Oddy 1982:121). Seen in this light, it seems a pity to
dismiss the evidence o-f army recruiting statistics as useless in the
study of the health of the Victorian nation, for the statistics record
at least some information about the medical condition o-f over 2.25
million men who applied for enlistment to the British regular army
between 180 and 1910.


     The most interesting statistics of army recruitment, and those
which were so severely criticised in 1904, stem from the procedures of
the Army Medical Department in the medical inspection of recruits. No


                                  PAGE 4
primary records of the work of the Department in this field can be
traced, other than the records o-f       the enlistment of individual
recruits, and the subject is not mentioned in an otherwise exhaustive
history of Army medicine (Cantlie 1974). However, the organisatjon of
medical inspection of recruits is described in several government
enquiries. Essentially, each potential recruit was first seen by an
army recruiting sergeant or officer. If he seemed healthy and was tall
enough to pass the height standard imposed by Army orders,. he was seen
either by an     Army medical officer or, where recruiting was taking
place away from art army depot, by a civilian doctor. In the latter
case,   the   recruit was re—examined by an Army doctor at the
head—quarters of the recruiting district. All recruits were finally
re—examined by the medical officer of the corps which they joined
(P.P. 1861 xv:7). At each examination, some recruits were rejected and

the causes of rejection were recorded. Finally, a medical officer had
to sign an attestation paper, giving details of the height and age of
the recruit (and, late in the century, of weight and chest expansion).
The recruit then took the oath of allegiance in front of a magistrate.

Details of the examination, which also included an assessment of
literacy, were recorded and form the basis of the statistics which
appear yearly in the reports of the Army Medical Department. These
contain, normally, tabulations of height by age, weight by age, chest
expansion by age, occupations and birthplaces of recruits, literacy
and medical causes of rejection, together with comments on these
statistics.



    Not all tabulations were published in every year, and there was
one major change which affected all the statistics. Up to and


                                PAGE 5
including 1884, all tabulations of the physical state of recruits
referred to all recruits, whether or not they were ultimately approved
for service; from 1887, the tabulations refer only to those accepted
for service. The notes to table 2 below discuss this in more detail
and it has also been shown that the change does not seem to impart any
bias to the statistics (Floud 1983).



     Among these tabulations, those for height by age and medical
reasons for rejection are the most interesting from the point of view
of an assessment of the health of the late Victorian nation, although
others are relevant to the question of whether one can generalise from
recruitment data. Height achieved at a given age is, of all physical
measures, that which is most indicative of health and nutritional
status. Increase in height during childhood and adolescence is
affected by food intake, ill—health, and physical effort although
other factors such as pollution and psychological deprivation can also
affect growth. The height of an individual child is influenced by its

genetic   inheritance   from   its     parents, as well as by these
environmental factors, but individual variations, genetic and random,
produce a distribution of heights around an average height at a given
age. This average height varies between social classes, between
nations and over time in a way that shows plainly that it reflects
environmental changes and is a very good indicator of the nutritional
state of the population in its broadest sense. That is, average height
reflects both the food intake, itself dependent on income and other
factors, and what demands are placed on human bodies; it is a net
measure, the summation of many factors which approximate closely to
what many people think of as the 'standard of living' of a population.


                                PAGE 6
     The reasons for rejection of recruits are also of great interest,
since they reveal the incidence of disease and handicap within a young

male population of potential recruits who were actual or aspirant
members of the civilian labour force. Not only did they presumably see
themselves as able to cope with the rigours of army life, but their
disabilities only became apparent on medical inspection, after they
had passed the scrutiny of the recruiting sergeant. In other words,
the rejection statistics give some indication of the disabilities
common among the civilian population. They will be explored for this
purpose in future research, but this paper concentrates on the height
statistics which, for the reasons just given, are potentially a good
indicator of the nutritional state of the population.


     The witnesses and members of the Inter—departmental Committee on
Physical Deterioration all valued height statistics and accepted
height as a good indicator of health. Many witnesses used height
measurements in their evidence and the Committee itself quoted studies

of average height and concluded that not enough had been carried out;
one of its principal recommendations was that height statistics should
be systematically collected. In spite of this high regard for height
statistics in general, however, the Committee rejected the use of army
height statistics for two principal reasons. First, witnesses like
Professor Cunningham believed that recruits were a biased sample of
the civilian population because varying conditions of trade brought
-forward, at different times, recruits from different social classes.
Second, they believed that the existence o-F a minimum height standard
which varied -from time to time made it impossible to assess the


                               PAGE 7
evidence of average heights of recruits; as one witness put it:

          "Then again the recruiting standards vary tremendously, and
          there could be no comparison between men now and fiFty years
          ago, owing to this variation of standard ...   the   standard

          will depend a good deal upon supply and demand" (P..P. 1904
          xxxii: Q.9717).

The two grounds for rejection of the evidence were linked, as this
statement shows, since the height standard was consciously used to
regulate the flow of recruits; in times of trade depression, more
recruits came forward and the height standard was raised as a
rudimentary form of quality check. Nevertheless, it is sensible to
consider the two objections separately.


     The witnesses    first and most fundamental objection was that
changes in the pool from which recruits were drawn rendered it
impossible to draw conclusions about changes in the health of the
population from the evidence of military recruits. There is flO doubt
that recruits were drawn from a sub—section of the population, from
the working class. This was attested by all contemporary observers and
is also demonstrated by the tabulations of occupations which form part
of each annual report of the Army medical department. Table 1 shows
the mean proportions in each occupational group of the recruits; the
exact basis for the classification into groups is not stated in the
reports so that direct comparison with the census is impossible..
Nevertheless, it is clear that the working class          is   heavily


                                PA6E B
over—represented among recruits.


     What is much more at issue, however, is the question of whether
recruits were representative of the working—class. One witness to the

Inter—departmental Committee, in discussing this question, said that
the evidence was conflicting; the Rev.. WE. Edwards, of the Salford
Education Committee, concluded that:

          (A) "One can only go upon the dictum of experienced army
          medical officers, and they, or some o-f them, hold that the
          Tommy Atkins recruit is just an average type of his class.
          (0)   "Yes, the slum class? —— (A) Of the class from which he

          is born, 50 per cent of our people. But 35 or 40 per cent of
          our people live in slums" (PP. 1904 xxxii:Q4252—4).
The Director General of the Army Medical Department, Sir William
Taylor, was also asked about the representativeness o-F the data:

          (0) Do you think that we can get from it (i.e. recruitment
          statistics) any indication whatever as to the physique of
          the people, of whole classes of people, in either certain
          districts of the country or certain occupations? — (A) As to

          the districts of the country certainly, so far as the class
          -from which recruits generally come is concerned" (P.P 1904
          xxxii :Q 163).



      Many witnesses, however, had no doubt that the recruits were a
biassed sample. Dr Alfred Eichholz, one of His Majesty's Inspectors of
Schools and a doctor, had examined the height and physique of
schoolchildren and was committed to the view that physical degeneracy
was "decidedly decreasing" but that much more could be done.(P.P. 1904


                                   PAGE 9
xxxii:!.428). He had looked at the trend of army recruitment over time
and commented on it in a passage which was quoted in -full and with
approval in the Committees report:
          "The apparent deterioration in army recruiting material
          seems to be associated with the demand for youthful labour
          in unskilled occupations, which pay well, and                absorb

          adolescent populations more and more completely each year.

          Moreover,       owing    to    the   peculiar    circumstances   of

          apprenticeship which are coming to prevail in this country,
          clever boys are often unable to take up skilled work on
          leaving school. This circumstance puts additional pressure
          on the field of unskilled labour, and, coupled with the high
          rates c-f wages for unskilled labour, tends to force out of
          competition the aimless wastrel population at the bottom of
          the intellectual scale and this, unfortunately, becomes more
          and more the material available f or              army   recruiting
          purposes" (P.P. 1904 xxxii:20 and Q.435).

The Royal College of Surgeons testified to similar beliefs:
          "There are reasons For believing that, compared with former
          times, most of the men who now offer themselves as recruits
          are drawn from a class physically inferior, and that a
          general     statistical        statement   may    be,    therefore,

          misleading. -   - - (Various   factors) have altered the conditions

          of labour and raised at once the comparative standard of
          efficiency of the workmen, the standard of living, and the
          rate of wages. In the struggle for employment the better
          educated, the more intelligent, and the more active and
          industrious are attracted to the better paid and more


                                    PAGE 10
          coveted occupations.. The result is a large, and probably
          growing., remainder of those who, more or less unfit,    fail    to

          obtain regular employment. And it is apparently from this
          residue that the Army has to obtain the larger proportion of
          its recruits" (P_P. 1904 xxxii:105)

     Eichholz and the Committee were, as we will show, wrong to
suppose that the army recruiting statistics demonstrated physical
deterioration. But do their criticisms of the statistics still hold
force? There are, first, some features of the economic analysis which
Eichholz and the Royal College advance which are difficult to
reconcile either with conventional theory or with our knowledge of
British labour markets in the late nineteenth century..



      Both witnesses state that, over some long term, the demand for
labour has increased, leading to higher employment levels                 for
"youthful labour" and to "high rates of wages + or unskilled labour"..
At the same time, according to Eichholz, the decline of opportunities
for apprenticeship led to an increase in the supply of unskilled
labour, as "clever boys" could not find skilled jobs. These "clever"
(Eichholz) or "better educated      more intelligent   .   more active and
industrious (Royal College) boys then displaced from unskilled Jobs
the "aimless wastrel population at the bottom of the intellectual
scale" (Eichholz) or the "remainder - -   more   or less unfit" (Royal
College) who were forced by unemployment to seek to Join the Army.
Since men of this group were "a class physically inferior" (Royal
College) there was a decline in the quality of recruits.


     This analysis appears to assume the existence of a rising number


                               PAGE 11
o-f unskilled jobs   (which "absorb adolescent populations more and more
completely each year") at a fixed or rising nominal wage, despite an
increase in the supply of labour (from "clever boys"); the supply of
"clever boys" must be rising more rapidly than the overall demand for
unskilled labour, in order for them to displace the              "aimless

wastrels". It would be normal, however, to assume that this process
would lower nominal wages per employee, not raise them, since the
supply of unskilled labour (both "clever" and "aimless") would be
rising faster than demand. "Clever boys" would still be at an
advantage in the labour market, since an employer would prefer to hire
a clever than an aimless employee at an equal wage, but that wage
would be falling because, in total, more would be seeking work. If
that were the case, though it seems to be denied by Eichholz and the
Royal College, then the relative attraction of army recruitment would

increase (assuming a constant or rising military wage), making the
army more, not less, attractive to "clever boys" as well as to
"aimless wastrels". In such circumstances, there is no apparent reason
why there should have been a decline in the quality of recruits. If,
on the other hand, the rate of civilian wages did not fall, this would
imply that demand for labour was keeping pace with, or surpassing, the
supply (both "clever" and "aimless") and, although the relative army
wage would be reduced, there would be no necessary effect on the
quality o-f recruits, since the attaction of the army to clever and
aimless alike would be reduced


      This discussion has so far assumed, like Eichholz, that there is
a fixed wage -for an unskilled worker. The case is stronger, however
i-f   one   assumes that the "clever boys" have a higher marginal product


                                  PA6E 12
in unskilled Jobs than the 'aimless". In that case, the increase in

supply, now measured in units of labour quality, from the influx of
"clever boys" is even higher than was assumed above and the average
wage should have fallen even more rapidly.



        This discussion assumes, of course, a highly competitive labour
market, but this is in line both with the assumptions of Eichholz and
the Royal College — the        "struggle for employment" — and with our
knowledge of late nineteenth century labour markets., As to the
long—term state of those markets, while real wages increased on trend
from the 1870s to the 1900s, nominal wages tended to fall and there
was little change in the trend level of unemployment. Both these
factors suggest that the decline of apprenticeship did not have the
effect which the witnesses assumed. It should be remembered, of
course, that Eichholz was struggling to reconcile his belief that
physical degeneration had not occurred in the population with the
"apparent deterioration" in army recruiting material. It is perhaps
not surprising that since, as we shall show, the army statistics were
being misinterpreted, his analysis of the labour market should be
flawecL



        A second reason for distrusting the evidence given by Eichholz
and the Royal College lies in the evidence presented in table 1.     It

can be seen that the proportion of those inspected who were drawn from

different sections o-f the working class varied very little over time;
between 183 and 1903, for e>ample, the proportion of recruits drawn
-from    "Labourers, Servants, Husbandmen, etc." was   never lower than
7.2Y. nor higher than 67.97. of those recruited. There was, it is true,


                                PAGE 13
a gradual reduction over time in the proportion drawn from       "Mechanics

employed   in occupations   favourable   to physical development" but it is

quite likely that this fall was seen in the population as a whole;
otherwise the table shows very little change over time. This does not
suggest that there was a major fall in the quality of recruits.


       Some witnesses carefully confined themselves to discussions of
the cyclical rather than secular effects of the labour market on
recruiting. This was the point of Professor Cunningham's remarks, and

they     were   confirmed    by   the Inspector—General of Recruiting,
Major—General H C. Borrett:
                 "But we must remember that strikes and things of that
                 kind give us a lot of recruits; sometimes a place is
                 shut up and therefore it is through no fault of their
                 own that men are out of work. We all know that strikes
                 do us a lot of good" (P_P. 1904 xxxii:Q. 188)

In 1907 the      Army Medical Department stressed         the    effect   of

unemployment: "The majority of recruits were growing lads, and a large
                 number were out of work at the time of enlistment.
                 Experienced recruiting agents estimate the proportion
                 of the latter as high as 95/ of the total . In many
                 instances the lads were suffering from want of food,
                 and were generally in poor condition". (Army Medical

                 Dept. report, 1907:1)




       Cyclical variations of this kind do not, however, vitiate the
evidence of the recruiting statistics, since the period from 186(1 to


                                  PA6E 14
1908 covers several cycles. There        are   certainly   signs   that
unemployment is correlated with the numbers a-F men recruited, but
there is no reason why long—term trends should not be derived by
smoothing cyclical effects, as one does by eye in looking at figure 1.


     There   are, in any case, several reasons for having more
confidence in the recruiting data as being representative of the
British   working class. At first sight, it seems ludicrous to
generalise from army data to the working class as a whole, since the
armed forces were such a small proportion of the labour force; the
armed forces, army, navy and marines, made up 1.67. of the occupied
population in 1861 and never rose above 1.77. between 1861 and 1911
(Mitchell xxxx:60). Since troops overseas were not counted in the
census, these figures somewhat underestimate the size of the armed
forces. More important, however, the occupied population contained men
of all ages, while the armed forces recruited men almost exclusively
between the ages of 17 and 25, keeping them in the services for a
relatively small proportion of their working lives. It is therefore
more relevant to calculate the number of men who joined or tried to
join the army (and were therefore medically examined) as a proportion
of their age—group; what is needed, in fact, is an age—specific
recruitment rate. This rate is shown in table 2 and the method used in
calculating it is described in the notes to that table.



     These results are striking; of men born between 1851 and 1884 who
had survived to the age 0+ 18, at least 107 were medically examined
after applying for enlistment to the army. For much o-f the period the
proportion was much higher, reaching a peak of 17.07. f or the cohort


                               PAGE 15
born in 1880. (In addition, the army figures do not include, because
they had no chance of being accepted for enlistment, the substantial
fraction of men who were shorter than the army height standards).
Moreover, these comparisons are made with the total male population,
not   with   the   mare appropriate comparator, the working class
population. Estimates of the size of the working class in late
nineteenth century Britain are contentious; the Rev. Edwards, who gave
a figure of 507., was certainly too low and 707. might be more accurate.

Some 177. of the whole population is equivalent on either basis,
therefore, to between 247. and 347. of working class males.



      The armed farces (and it should be remembered that these
calculations exclude recruits to the navy and marines) therefore
attracted a very substantial proportion of the           working   class

population. It is possible, however, that the proportion a-F men so
attracted was still a biassed sample. Two further sets of evidence
from the reports of the Army Medical Department are relevant to this
question. First, the reports give the national origin of recruits.
Table 3 compares those data with the proportions of English, Scottish
and Irish 18 year olds in the total population c-F Britain and Ireland
at census years. The match is very close indeed except for an
over—representation of Irish in recruits in 1871. The recruits do not
seem to be a biassed sample in terms of national origins.


      Second, it is possible to compare the illiteracy of army recruits
with that of the total population. This comparison is shown in table
4. It must be remembered that the criteria a-f illiteracy are crude in
the extreme and, moreover, differ between recruits and the rest of the


                                PAGE 16
population.. Illiteracy of recruits was assessed by the army medical
o-fficer, while the population illiteracy is based on the numbers of
men (in all classes, not Just the working class) unable to sign their
names in marriage register. With this difference borne in mind, table
4 shows that the illiteracy o-F recruits was higher than that of the
population as a whole until the late 1880s, both rates following a
downward trend; thereafter, the downward trend continued, with army
recruits being somewhat more literate than the population as a whole,
although by that time both illiteracy rates were very low indeed. The
overall impression is, therefore, one of convergence between the
national and army illiteracy rates. It is interesting to remember that

universal primary education was provided for in England by the
Education Act o-F 1870, enacted some 19 years before, according to
table 4, the literacy of 18 year old recruits became comparable with
that of the population as a whole. This suggests that table 4 is
recording, not a bias in army recruits as a sample of the working
class, but a genuine decline in the illiteracy o-F the British working
ci ass.

      It should be noted that the change in the late 880s may have
another explanation. In the years through 1886, the Army Medical
Department recorded the literacy of all recruits who were inspected,
while from 1887 they recorded literacy only for those finally approved
for service. It may be, therefore, that literacy played a part in the
approval of recruits and that the rising literacy rates in the late
IBBOs are spurious. However, the fact that the army rates mimic the
downward trend in the population rates, both before and after the
iBBOs,    gives   no ground for the view that the quality of army recruits

was deteriorating..



                                   PAGE 17
     There is little reason, therefore, to be as harsh as was the
Inter—departmental Committee in rejecting the evidence of        army
recruitment statistics.. Army officers, it has to be remembered, have
an interest in claiming that they have taken the scum of the earth and
moulded it into a fine fighting force.. Unless one is prepared to
classify around 30V. of working class males as scum, such claims are
incompatible with the proportion of the population who tried to join
the army in the late Victorian period.. Moreover, the stability of the
distribution of the previous occupation of recruits, the evidence of
their literacy and their national origins all point to the conclusion
that army recruits were generally representative of the working
classes of Britain..



     It will be recalled, however, that the belief that army recruits
were not representative of the working class was only the first reason
why some contemporaries distrusted the evidence of army recruitment..
The second objection rested on the belief that an average height
calculated from those recruits who did surpass the height standard
must be an overestimate of the true average height of actual and
potential recruits. After all, an unknown number of potential recruits
did not volunteer because they knew themselves to be too short and a
further unknown number were rejected on those grounds by recruiting
sergeants; these shorter heights are necessarily missing from the
statistics.. The witnesses saw no way of overcoming this problem, but
their pessimism reflected lack of knowledge at the time of the
statistical characteristics of distributions of heights of men and
women at a particular age. It is now recognized that large samples of


                              PAGE 18
such heigts, Especially of adults, tend to be distributed according to
the normal distribution.. I-f a height standard rejects shorter men, the

distribution will be truncated —      cut   off sharply — below some point.

If   the   height standard discourages other short men, the distribution
will evince irregular shortfall from normality below some point. But
above such a point, the distribution will still tend to agree with the
normal curve. Since the normal distribution is symmetrical, the
distribution of observed heightsabove the extent of shortfall may
therefore be used to infer the distribution below the extent of
shortfall. Then the mean height of the whole population a-f actual and
potential recruits may be estimated (Trussell and Wachter 1982).



      Figure 1 shows the average heights            calculated   from   the

uncorrected data in the reports of the Army medical department. This
was the evidence available at the time. There was, as figure 1       shows,
very little change in the long term in the average height of recruits
to the army between the 1870s and 1910; there was probably, in fact, a
very slight decrease.. Table 5 (part A) shows the linear trends
calculated through these data; the coefficients on the slopes are
uniformly negative, although only two are statistically significant at
the 57. level. This stability was produced, however, by varying the
height standard so as to maintain the desired levels. It tells us very
little about the heights of the pool of potential recruits from which
the army drew.



       Figure 2, by contrast, shows the results c-F correcting the
height distributions to remove the effects of the truncation imposed
by the minimum height standard. Only the corrected means are plotted,


                                  PAGE 19
 but the full details of the estimates, including corrected and
uncorrected means and standard deviations are available from the first
author. The overall effect of the correction is to suggest that, over
time, there was a slow upward movement in the mean heights of the
population of actual and potential recruits; table 5 (part B) shows
the linear trends, five of which are significantly upwards at the 57.
level or more. Figure 3, in which the uncorrected and corrected mean
heights of 20 year olds are plotted together, demonstrates the effect
of the correction more clearly. Table 5 (part C), finally, shows the
statistical   significance   of the differences between the slope
coefficients of the linear trends through the uncorrected            and

corrected data; of the nine ages, four show significant differences at
the 17. level and one at the 57. level. In other words, the evidence of

the Army medical department reports, when properly considered, shows
that there was no physical deterioration among working class recruits
in the late nineteenth century. By contrast, their physical condition

appears to have improved.


     Since this is so and since the recruits have been shown to be
broadly representative of the working class, the evidence of their
health and strength is of much broader interest than historians have
hitherto believed. The alleged deterioration in the quality of the
working class population is not borne out by its mean height, which
seems to have risen gradually during the late nineteenth century..




                               PAGE 20
      Those mean heights were, of course, still substantially below
the modern British mean height for adult males aged 20—24 of 69.3
inches. The average height of these working class men —   approximately
66.5 inches when they were aged 20—24 — was, in fact, less than the
height of all but the shortest 207. of the modern British male
population. No population of European males or of males of European
origin today is as short. The nutritional status of these men was, by

modern standards, deplorable even though they were, on average, taller
than all but two other European populations of the time whose heights
can be measured. Only the Norwegians and the Swedes were taller, while
Danes, Dutch, Belgians, French, Swiss and Italians were (in that
order) shorter (Floud 1984). Unemployment and low wages must bear some
of the responsibility for this, while the evidence of the diseases
from which potential recruits suffered, and which debarred them from
an army career, shows the generally low state of normal health of the
working class population of Britain and Ireland. Even if Maurice and
his colleagues were wrong in their alarmist claims about the state of
the nations health, the Inter—departmental Committee were certainly
right to conclude that much more could and should be done to improve
the health of the British.

Col. A: Date.
Col. B: Date — 18.
           Date less 18 years.    18 year olds formed the largest
           age—group among recruits and this date — 18 is therefore
           taken as the basis for computing the size of the cohort
           of recruits in Col. D.

Col. C: Estimated number of 8 year olds, in the population of
         England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland.
         The estimate is based on census data (reported in
         Mitchell )0QX : 12—14) which give the number of males
         aged 15_19 in each country.   Each such census figure
         was divided by 5 and intervening years were estimated by
         linea' interpolation, before the country estimates were
         summed to give the figure here.
Col. D: Number of recuits born in years shown in Col. B.
         These data are derived from the Annual Reports of the
         Army Medical Department.   The Reports before 1 887 give
         a tabulation of numbers of recruits who were inspected,
         by age, including those ultimately rejected.    These data
         have been re-arranged by implied date of birth; thus,
         the figure in Col. D. for recuits born in 1860 comprises
         18 year olds recruited in 1878 plus 19 year aids recruited
         in 1879, plus 20 year olds recruited in 1880, etc.    From
         1887 onwards tabulations are given only for those approved
         for service, together with a statement of the proportion
         approved which is not broken down by age.    In order to
         make the pre—1887 and post—1887 figures comparable, it has
         been assumed that approval rates did not vary by age, and
         the numbers approved have therefore been inflated, age—group
         by age—group, on the basis of the average approval rate in
         the year in which they were recruited.    It is possible,
         alternatively, to deflate in a similar way the numbers
         recruited before 1887, but the focus here is on the number
         of men who were inspected.
E. Col. D as % of Col. C.
         A small proportion of recruits from overseas are included
         in the figures in Column D,   importing   a slight but
         un)mown upward bias to Col. E.   By contrast, the procedure
         for computing Column C is likely to give a downward bias to
         Cal. E: the calculation of 18 year aids as one—fifth of
         15 — 19 year aids ignores the mortality at ages 15 — 17.
         In addition, mortality after age 18 is not reflected in
         Column C whereas it diminishes the opportunity for
         potential recuits to appear in Cal. D

General note:—
     It must be remembered throughout that these tables do not
include the majority of those whose height was below the required
standard and who were, therefore, rejected — or ruled themselves
out —at anearlier stage of the recruitment process.

Notes   and   sources:—
Col. A.       Date.
              Date of recruitment of soldiers and date of marriageS.
              It would be possible to lag the marriage date by some years
              to ta]e account of marriage age being, on average, later
              than age of recruitment.   This has not been done in this
              table.
                                                                  29


Col. B.      Average weighted male illiteracy rate.
             This was calculated by applying to the Registrar-
             Generals' illiteracy rates for each country weights
             which were calculated from the proportions of English
             and Welsh, Scottish and Irish recruits in each year.
             Soldiers from other nations who were counted as English and
             Welsh country proportions in census years are shown in
             Table 3.
Col.   D.    Illiteracy rate of army recruits from annual reports of
             the krmy Medical Department.

Figure 2.   Notes and sources.

Data were taken from the height by age distributions given in the
annual reports of the Army Medical Department.   Data in open—ended
categories at each end of the distributions were excluded.
The data were corrected for truncation by the Quartile Bend Estimator
(Trussell and Wachter 1982).
For the sake of clarity, only data for 18, 20, 22 and 24 year olds
have been plotted.
