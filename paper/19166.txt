                                              ABSTRACT

A growing literature seeks to understand how the characteristics of firms shape the manner in which
they serve foreign markets. We consider an environment in which multiproduct firms can sell their
products in multiple countries from multiple locations. We show that there are strong empirical regularities
in the expansion strategies of U.S. multinational firms and that simple extensions of standard models
do not explain these regularities. We augment these models by introducing a framework in which
organizational capital is a scarce input within the firm that has to be allocated to particular products
and production locations and show that the standard model, so amended, is consistent with the data.
We then use the model to analyze the productivity effect of changes in international frictions both
within and across firms.

1   Introduction
The world’s largest …rms are incredibly complex organizations that sprawl across in-
dustries and countries. For instance, according to its annual report, Dupont operated
production facilities in over 70 countries and produced a wide range of goods such as
food, motor vehicle parts, electronics, plastics, construction materials, and industrial
chemicals. Such multi-product …rms dominate both domestic and international com-
merce. According to Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010) U.S. manufacturing …rms
that produce multiple products account for 91% of U.S. manufacturing output. With
respect to U.S. trade, the role of multiproduct …rms is even more pronounced. According
to Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007), U.S. based …rms that exported 5 or more prod-
ucts account for a staggering 98% of the value of U.S. exports. Further, most of these
large, multiproduct exporters are in fact multinational corporations for whom exports
are less than half of their total foreign sales.
    In organizing the global activities of their …rms, management must make a wide range
of interrelated decisions: Which goods should they produce? Where should their focus
lie? Where should it produce each good and for which markets? Standard models within
the international trade literature typically deal with only a subset of a …rm’s activities
and may miss important interactions between decisions. Indeed, it is the possibility that
multiproduct …rms internalize the cross-product impacts of their decisions that make
their existence an interesting area of study.
    This paper begins with a descriptive empirical analysis that establishes new facts
from a con…dential …rm-level dataset for U.S. multinationals. This dataset allows us to
link the domestic and export activity of the U.S. parent …rms of U.S. multinationals to
the activity of their foreign a¢ liates. We show that many large U.S. …rms simultaneously
sell to una¢ liated customers in a given foreign market through exports from the United
States and through locally based a¢ liates. While there are other possible interpretations
of this fact, we feel that the most natural interpretation is that …rms export a subset of
their products and produce a di¤erent subset abroad. We also show that while larger
…rms engage in more exports and a¢ liate sales in any given market, it is the more
narrowly focused …rms in terms of their industrial diversi…cation that rely relatively
more on foreign a¢ liates than on exports from the United States.
    To understand the forces at work in the data, we introduce a simple model in which
…rms produce multiple products for multiple countries in multiple locations. As in


                                            2
Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2011) …rms may produce goods in a continuum of in-
dustries. We extend this setting to allow …rms to tradeo¤ local production in foreign
countries for export from the home country. As in Brainard (1993, 1997), Horstmann
and Markusen (1992), and Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple (2004) …rms face a proximity-
concentration tradeo¤ in choosing between these two modes of serving foreign markets.
    The unique feature of the model is that production e¢ ciency for any particular good
requires organizational capital, which is in …xed supply within the …rm. We think of or-
ganizational capital as embedded in the management structure of the …rm, re‡ecting the
organizational capacity of the …rm due to its institutional structure, corporate culture,
and set of established routines. Organizational capital cannot be increased by simply
hiring more managers or by merging …rms. Because organizational capital is in …xed
supply within the …rm, increasing productivity of some goods (or equivalently in our
framework, raising quality) comes at the expense of productivity improvements in other
goods. It is this tradeo¤ that is internalized by a multiproduct …rm that make it behave
di¤erently than a continuum of single product …rms.
    Firms are heterogeneous along two dimensions with respect to their organizational
capital. First, …rms di¤er in their stock of organizational capital. Firms with greater
organizational capital can support large global operations across a wider product mix.
Second, …rms di¤er in the adaptability of their organizational capital to foreign environ-
ments.
    Our model has interesting implications for the geographic structure of production.
Firms with larger endowments of organizational capital have higher aggregate sales in
domestic markets, higher exports, and higher foreign a¢ liate sales. It turns out, however,
that variation across …rms that is exclusively in the stock of organizational capital cannot
predict the relative importance of exports versus a¢ liate sales. This is inconsistent with
the empirical facts as demonstrated in the empirical section of the paper.
    It is the second source of …rm heterogeneity in our model that can create the observed
empirical link between small, concentrated parents and highly multinational operations.
As one would expect, …rms that can better adapt their organizational capital abroad tend
to sell to foreign customers relatively more through a foreign a¢ liate rather than through
exporting. However, because producing in multiple locations consumes organizational
capital, there is less available to manage marginal product lines in the home market,
leading the parent …rm to be narrower and smaller than otherwise.
    Finally, we use the model to analyze the impact of trade and MP frictions on the

                                             3
allocation of resources within the …rm. Lower barriers to international activity a¤ect the
allocation of organizational capital across products through two forces. First, as prod-
uct markets become more competitive, …rms drop marginal products, and this pushes
organizational capital into other uses within the …rm. Second, as …rms shift between
exports and MP, organizational capital is pulled into international activities. The rela-
tive strength of these two e¤ects di¤ers across …rms depending on their endowment of
organizational capital.
    This paper contributes to a broad range of the literature, including international eco-
nomics, industrial organization, and productivity analysis. Most distinctively, it blends
the elements of the literature on multiproduct …rms with elements of the literature on
multinational …rms.1 Its treatment of multiproduct …rms as having a heterogeneous
portfolio of productivities across products makes it similar to Bernard, Redding, and
Schott (2011).2 Further, in Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2011) …rms are endowed
with a ‘core productivity’that raises the productivity (and hence pro…tability) of all of
their products evenly, while in our model …rms are endowed with organizational capital
that can be used to raise the productivity of all or some of its products as management
sees …t, but this organizational capital is in …xed supply within the …rm. As managers
have to make trade-o¤s across products, it is generally not optimal to allocate of organi-
zational capital evenly across potential uses and a change in product market conditions
will alter this allocation. Were managers forced to allocate organizational capital across
goods evenly, the model collapses to a direct extension of Bernard, Redding, and Schott
(2011) to allow for horizontal multinational production.
   1
     Helpman (1985) does allow for multiproduct …rms in his analysis of vertical FDI, but because …rms
are homogeneous, this feature of the model gets relatively little attention. Baldwin and Ottaviano (2001)
do in fact analyze multi-product multinationals in an oligopolistic environment where cannibalization
places center stage. Their paper does not consider …rm heterogeneity and assumes that each product is
produced exclusively in one location. By assuming that …rms are heterogeneous in their endowment of
organizational capital, our focus is more squarely on the implications of the congestion e¤ects imposed
by a broad product scope. Other examples of multiproduct …rms and trade, include Eckel and Neary
(2009) who focus on ‡exible manufacturing and cannibalization e¤ects. Dhingra (2010) is another
example of a multiproduct …rm framework in which trade liberalization has productivity e¤ects within
the …rm.
   2
     In the published version of the paper, the authors consider heterogeniety in demand levels across
countries at the level of the individual variety. A special case of this model in which demand levels are
constant across countries would be consistent with our treatment.



                                                   4
    This paper is also related to the literature on corporate …nance that explores the
multiproduct …rm. The idea that there is a …xed stock of organizational capital within
the …rm that can be applied across products can also be found in Matsusaka (2001) and
Phillips and Maksimovic (2002) whose focus is on the understanding diversi…cation in
conglomerates. In its focus on the span of control across product lines within the …rm,
the paper is similar to Nocke and Yeaple (2012) in exploring the implications of treating
organizational capital as a scarce resource within the multiproduct …rm. That paper
is focused on the implications for …rm performance (including export performance) of
variation across …rms in the span of control (held …xed in this paper) while the current
paper focuses on how the possibility of multinational production a¤ects internal resource
allocation decisions within the …rm.
    The remainder of this paper is broken into four main sections. The next section
describes a dimension of the data on multinational …rms that has received less attention
in the international trade literature: the …rm-level composition of sales broken down by
parent sales in the home market, parent exports by country, and a¢ liate sales by host
country. Section three speci…es our model of multi-product multinationals. In section
four, the equilibrium of the model is characterized with a focus on the mapping of a …rm’s
characteristics to its domestic and international operations. We show that a model in
the tradition of Helpman et al (2004) naturally extended along the lines of Bernard et
al (2011) cannot reproduce the facts presented in section two while a model featuring
internal resource constraints can. In section …ve, we analyze the e¤ects of a reduction in
trade and MP frictions on the allocation of scarce organizational resources across product
lines within the …rm. The …nal section summarizes and concludes.

2       Features of Multiproduct Multinationals
In this section, we uncover several unknown or underappreciated features of the interna-
tional expansion strategies of multinational …rms. First, we show that large multinational
…rms tend to both export to and engage in local production for una¢ liated customers
in a given foreign market. The most natural interpretation of the phenomenon is that
…rms sell multiple products and individual products are sold exclusively by one mode or
another.3 Second, we show that …rms with large U.S. market shares and diverse product
    3
   Rob and Vettes (2003) show that a …rm might sell the same product through both modes when
dynamic concerns are paramount. The model does not give rise to both trade and FDI in the long-run,
however, as …rms ultimately specialize in FDI.


                                                5
portfolios disproportionately sell in foreign markets via exports from the United States
rather from local a¢ liates. The fact that smaller, highly focused …rms are more likely
to engage in multinational operation is not a prediction of the standard models.

2.1     Data Description
The ideal dataset for the study of multi-product, multinational …rms would contain
information about …rm activities across a large number of dimensions. Such a data set
would contain information on the full set of products produced by the …rm, where each
product was produced and where the output was sold. Further the dataset would allow
for productivity measurement at the product level, allowing outputs of each product to
be linked to the inputs used in their production. Of the datasets that exist, the one
closest to the ideal is the data from the Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment
Abroad conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The data set contains
excellent information on where …rms own production facilities, solid information on the
volume of sales in each market, modest information on the industrial classi…cation of the
goods sold by location, and some information on parent …rm exports by country. It is
this data that is used in our analysis.
    The BEA surveys of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad are conducted for the purpose of
producing aggregate statistics on direct investment activities for the general public.4 A
U.S. multinational entity is the combination of a single U.S. legal entity that has made
the direct investment, called the U.S. parent, and at least one foreign business enterprise,
called the foreign a¢ liate. As a result of con…dentiality assurances and penalties for non-
compliance, the BEA believes that coverage in this survey is close to complete and the
level of accuracy is high.
    For reasons of data availability, we rely on the 1994 benchmark survey of the Bureau
of Economic Analysis.5 We are interested in the manner in which U.S. …rms serve
una¢ liated customers (i.e. not related by ownership) in foreign markets; by exporting
from the U.S. parent or by selling to these customers from a local a¢ liate. While every
   4
      U.S. direct investment abroad is de…ned as the direct or indirect ownership or control of a single U.S.
legal entity of at least ten percent of the voting securities of an incorporated foreign business enterprise
or the equivalent interest in an unincorporated foreign business enterprise.

benchmark survey collected detailed …rm-level data by country on the value of sales of
the foreign a¢ liates to una¢ liated customers in their host country markets, the last year
that the BEA collected comprehensive data on parent exports to una¢ liated customers
by destination country was 1994.6
    We also collect data on the scale and scope of the parent …rms operations in the
United States that are geared toward serving the U.S. market. We observe a parent
…rm’s sales to U.S. customers in the aggregate across all categories of goods, the number
of three-digit manufacturing industries in which the parent is active, and the value of
sales of each of these types of goods.7 From these data, we can infer a …rm’s U.S.
scope (the number of product categories), its scale (average U.S. sales per industrial
category), and a Her…ndahl index of the concentration of sales across product lines. We
focus on U.S. …rms whose main-line-of-business is manufacturing and count only the
product classi…cations that correspond to manufacturing industries. The parent …rm’s
export data does not provide useful disaggregation across product categories, but it is
disaggregated by …nal destination.8 To these sales, we added the sales by parents to
their a¢ liates intended for resale without further processing.
    For each parent …rm, we observe their network of foreign a¢ liates by country and
industry. Our measure of a¢ liate activity by …rm and country is the sales of manufac-
turing a¢ liates to una¢ liated customers in their host country. In cases in which the
same …rm owned more than one manufacturing a¢ liate, we aggregated over a¢ liates to
create a single …rm-country observation so that it was comparable to the export data.
    Descriptive statistics for our sample of 725 parent …rms are reported in Table 1. These
…rms tend to be very large with average U.S. sales of $1.7 billion and their sales span
multiple(highly aggregate) industries. The average parent …rm exports to 11 countries
and owns a¢ liates in 3.4 countries. The volume of sales by mode is very di¤erent, as the
average export by country is only $2.4 million while the average a¢ liate sales by country
is $97 million. Note that the distribution of both types of sales is highly skewed, which
is why we consider a log-log speci…cation below. Further, while …rms tend to export
   6
     Data collection on this variable was gradually phased out after 1994. In 1999, the reporting
threshold was raised substantially so that smaller parents need not report. After 1999, this part of the
survey was eliminated.
   7
     In the 1994 benchmark survey, the BEA asked …rms to report their top eight industries, so there
are likely a number of …rms for which this restriction binds.
   8
     Only exports in excess of $500,000 are reported.



                                                   7
to a larger number of countries than they engage in a¢ liate sales, a¢ liate sales in the
aggregate account for 57% of total foreign sales (77% unweighted average across …rms).

2.2    Empirical Results
Our empirical analysis is entirely descriptive and intended only to highlight empirical
regularities along dimensions of …rm behavior that have not been previously explored. In
particular, we regress measures of …rms’expansion strategies on variables that measure
aspects of parent …rms’ success in its home market controlling for destination country
characteristics.
    Table 2 reports the results of our simple regression analysis. Columns 1, 2, and 3
correspond to dependent variables that are (1) the logarithm of a …rm’s foreign a¢ liate to
local customers, (2) the logarithm of the parents exports to una¢ liated local customers,
and (3) the logarithm of the share of a¢ liate sales in total …rm sales. The rows correspond
to the explanatory variables. The …rst row corresponds to the logarithm of the parent
…rm’s sales in the United States. The remaining four rows correspond to standard
gravity controls: log GDP, log GDP per capita, log distance from the United States, and
an indicator variable for English as the o¢ cial language. Columns 4, 5, and 6 show the
results of replacing the country characteristics with country …xed e¤ects.
    We begin by discussing the results for the levels of sales by each mode. Looking
across the …rst row, we see that larger parents sell larger quantities to any given foreign
country whether through their foreign a¢ liates (columns 1 and 4) or by exporting from
the United States (columns 2 and 5). The coe¢ cients on parent sales in the United
States are highly statistically signi…cant using standard errors that have been corrected
for heteroskedasticity and for clustering by …rm. Further, the results in columns 1 and
2 show that gravity …ts quite well at the …rm-level for both a¢ liate sales and for parent
exports, although there are di¤erences in the sizes of the coe¢ cient estimates. Note the
larger number of observations for the export speci…cation demonstrates that parents are
more likely to export to any given location than they are to open an a¢ liate there.
    In columns 3 and 6, the coe¢ cient estimates associated with a dependent variable that
is the ratio of a¢ liate sales to total …rm sales in a given foreign market. The coe¢ cient
is negative and highly statistically signi…cant, indicating that while larger parents have
larger a¢ liate sales and larger export sales to a given market, larger parent …rms rely
relatively more heavily on export sales to a given market than on a¢ liate sales. As our
interest is on the coe¢ cients on parent …rm variables, we henceforth focus exclusively on

                                             8
country …xed-e¤ect regressions.
    In Table 3, we explore how other features of the structure of the parent …rms’ op-
erations predict its approach to serving foreign markets. In column 1 parent sales are
decomposed into scale (logarithm of U.S. sales per product) and scope (logarithm of
number of products). The results indicate that both outcome variables for the parent
…rm predict the …rm’s foreign expansion strategies: high scale or high scope is associated
with larger exports relative to a¢ liate sales. In column 2, we add two additional parent
…rm characteristics, the logarithm of their R&D intensity and the logarithm of their
capital to labor ratio. We …nd that adding these additional parent …rm characteristics
only increases the coe¢ cient on scope.
    In column three of Table 3, we add a measure of concentration at the level of the
parent …rm: i.e. the logarithm of the sum of squared product category shares by …rm.
An increase in this variable, which represents a less diversi…ed …rm, is associated with
an increase in the relative importance of a¢ liate sales in the expansion strategies of
…rms. Note that adding this variable makes the coe¢ cient on scope change sign and to
become statistically insigni…cant. In the last column of Table 3, we drop product scope
and scale and add back our measure of parent sales in the United States. The coe¢ cient
estimates are consistent with our previous results: parents that are smaller and more
highly focused on a narrow product range tend to expand relatively more through foreign
a¢ liates than larger and more highly diversi…ed parents.
    We have run a number of robustness checks through which the essential message of
Tables 2 and 3 remains intact. These include Heckman selection speci…cations using
World Bank measures of business costs as an exclusion restriction and …xed e¤ects spec-
i…cations for the main-line-of-business. We also consider Tobit speci…cations with an
upper limit of zero to account for observations in which only a¢ liate sales are observed.
The e¤ects are to increase the absolute values of the estimated coe¢ cients, but not their
sign or statistical signi…cance.
    We draw two main conclusions from the results presented in this section. First, parent
…rms that have larger domestic market shares tend to expand through both exports and
foreign a¢ liate sales in absolute terms. Second, in relative terms it is the parent …rms
that are focused on a relatively narrow set of products in the U.S. market that are more
engaged in multinational production relative to exports.

3       Model Assumptions
Our model framework is designed to analyze how multiple-product …rms serve multiple
markets in the presence of an internal resource constraint. To allow for …rms to produce
and sell their product in multiple locations we consider a world in which there are
two identical countries indexed by l and j. To allow for …rms to produce in multiple
industries, we assume that there are a continuum of industries on the unit interval.
Preferences over the goods produced in these industries are Cobb-Douglas with equal
budget shares:                           Z            1
                                         U=               ln C(i)di:                                (1)
                                                  0
Each industry is di¤erentiated by variety with subutility function given by

where > 1 is the elasticity of substitution across individual varieties. For expositional
convenience, we assume that the elasticity of substitution is common across goods i.
    All goods are produced using exclusively labor, which we choose as the numeraire,
and an input we will refer to as organizational capital. There exists a continuum of
ex ante identical entrepreneurs. When an entrepreneur incurs a …xed cost F E , she
receives a bundle of characteristics from distributions known ex ante. First, she receives
the blueprint to produce one variety of each type of good. Each blueprint implies a
level of “fundamental” productivity Z independently drawn from a Pareto distribution
G(Z) = 1 Z ; where > 1. As all …rms draw from the same distribution, there is no
aggregate variation across …rms due to this source of heterogeneity.9
    The actual productivity with which the …rm will produce a product of fundamental
productivity Z depends as well on the quantity of organizational capital that is dedicated
by the …rm to the plant producing that variety. If kj (Z) is the quantity of this organiza-
tional capital allocated to a plant at location j that produces a variety of fundamental
productivity Z then the productivity of that plant is
                                                                          e
                                     e (kj (Z); Z) = Z kj (Z) ;

    The heterogeneity across products is necessary to get …rms to be willing to export some set of goods
and to engage in MP in another set of goods.

where e 2 (0; 1=(    1)) is a measure of the span of control of organizational capital by
product. By location j 2 fd; f g, domestic and foreign is relative to the country that the
…rm entered. If a …rm entered in l is producing in k = l then j = d whereas if k 6= l then
j = f.
    When a …rm enters it also receives a random draw that de…nes its organizational
endowment, which is the source of intrinsic aggregate heterogeneity across …rms. This
types includes the …rm’s stock of organizational capital, K, and a parameter 2 [1; ]
that governs the cost of adapting the …rm’s organizational capital for use in foreign
countries. These characteristics are drawn from a joint probability distribution H with
density h.
    Equation (3) shows that a good-speci…c plant’s productivity is endogenous and de-
pends on the amount of organizational capital that the entrepreneur allocates to it. In
allocating organizational capital to the various goods produced by the …rm, the man-
ager must respect the constraint that she can allocate no more than K units of her
organizational capital to all goods that are produced:
                                          Z     1   X
                                    K                    j kj (Z)dG(Z);                                (4)
                                            0       j

where kj (Z) is the organizational capital allocated to a plant of productivity Z that is
located in country j 2 fd; f g.10 If j = d, then j = 1; otherwise j = .
    An active …rm must decide where to produce each good. If a …rm produces a partic-
ular variety at home, it must pay a …xed cost F . If it chooses to export that good to
the foreign country, it must pay a variable iceberg-type trade cost     1. We will use in
                                                                             1

                                             x
addition, the …rm must pay a …xed cost F to …nd a distributor for its product. Finally,
the …rm might choose to produce abroad to serve the local market from a local a¢ liate.
As is standard in the proximity-concentration literature, by opening the a¢ liate, the
producer avoids trade costs but must pay a …xed cost F m . To obtain an interior solu-
tion in which all modes will be observed by at least some …rms, we make the following
  10
    It is possibilible to rewrite the model so that productivity draws instead corresponds to heterogeneity
across products in the extent to which organizational capital can be adapted for the production of the
particular good. This would give the model a “core competency” type ‡avor as in Eckel and Neary
(2011).

    The timing of decisions is as follows. First, …rms draw their type (K; ) and their
good-speci…c productivities. Second, …rms decide which goods to produce, which markets
to serve, and where to locate production for each good and market (mode choice). Third,
…rms choose how much organizational capital to allocate to production of each good at
each location. Finally, …rms compete in monopolistically competitive fashion in each
market.
    In summary, the model extends the simplest version of Bernard, Redding, and Schott
(2011) (henceforth BRS) to a setting in which …rms face a proximity-concentration trade-
o¤ between exports and multinational production as in Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple
(2004) (henceforth HMY). While …rms are heterogeneous in their productivity in var-
ious good categories, this heterogeneity is entirely idiosyncratic and not the origin of
aggregate productivity di¤erences across …rms. Instead, productivity of individual prod-
ucts depend on the characteristics of management that enter the resource constraint (4).
Note that because all …xed costs (aside from the entry …xed cost) are product speci…c
so that once a …rm has entered, it will sell at least some goods in all markets, i.e. we
have eliminated selection e¤ects across …rms to focus on selection and resource allocation
across goods within …rms.12

4        The Expansion Strategies of Multiproduct Firms
In this section we characterize the equilibrium choices of heterogeneous …rms as a function
of their types (K; ). We solve the model backwards by …rst deriving sales and pro…ts
for each good and production location taking as given the allocation of organizational
capital to each product and the production location of that product vis-a-vis the …nal
market served. Then, we solve for the optimal allocation of organizational capital within
a given …rm across goods as a function of that good’s productivity Z and its production
location (domestic or foreign). Next, we solve for the production location of each good.
    11
     In the special case that = 0 this is equivalent to the parameter restriction made in Helpman et al
(2004).
  12
     Such e¤ects could be easily added by having …xed costs of serving various markets that occur at the
…rm level. As these selection e¤ects are very well understood we leave this extension to the interested
reader.


                                                   12
Finally, we impose a free entry condition.
   Throughout the exposition of this section, our derivation is entirely from the per-
spective of a …rm from the country l which has its mirror image in country j 6= l.

4.1     Pro…ts and Sales Volumes
The preference system given by (1) and (2) combined with the symmetry of the model
implies a demand system with constant elasticity and location determined by aggregate
expenditure E and by the price index P given by
                                      Z
                                1

                                             !2   l


where l is the set of goods available for sales in country l. Given the symmetry across
industries, demand conditions are identical in each industry.
    As is well known, pro…t maximizing …rms from country j facing iso-elastic demand
in country l optimally charge a price that is a constant mark-up over marginal cost for
serving that country. For a good of fundamental productivity Z we have

                                  pjl (Z) =               Cjl (Z)                    (6)

                                                            if j = l
                             Cjl (Z) =                                  :            (7)

Note that a …rm will never produce in a foreign market for sale in the domestic market
because doing so would require it to incur both adaption costs and shipping costs
which is never sensible given the symmetry of the two countries. Note also that we have
normalized the wage in the two identical countries to unity.
    Given the optimal pricing formula, and the cost function, we can derive the pro…ts
that accrue to any particular mode of serving global markets. For instance, a …rm that
sells a particular good Z only in its domestic market faces only the domestic …xed cost
F and faces no costs of shipping a good or of adapting organizational capital to foreign
use. Hence, the pro…t associated with a purely domestic mode of operation for a product
line with speci…c productivity Z of a type (K; ) can be written

                              D                       1
                                  (kd ; Z) = AZ           (kd )     F;               (8)

where = e(            1) < 1, and A is the mark-up adjusted demand level in each country

The …rm may also choose to serve foreign markets in addition to its domestic market.
If it chooses to export its product, it must incur …xed costs F and F x and it must also
incur variable costs on its sales to foreign customers. The resulting pro…t associated
with exporting is thus
                              X                                   1
                                  (kd ; Z) = (1 + )AZ                 (kd )       F    F x;                   (9)
                          1
where we have used             to simplify notation.
   A …rm that decides to engage in horizontal FDI avoids all trade costs, but is now
exposed to costs of adapting its organizational capital to a foreign environment. Further,
the …rm must incur the higher …xed costs associated with international production given
by F m . The resulting pro…t is
                        M                            1
                            (kd ; kf ; Z) = AZ            (kd ) + (kf )               F   F m:              (10)

This expression makes clear that a signi…cant cost to multinational production vis-a-vis
the export mode is the need to use organizational capital for both the domestic and
foreign operation. It also implies that the foreign plants of a …rm are likely to be at
productivity disadvantage relative to their home-country counterparts, which is consis-
tent with the fact that overseas production tends to be less productive than domestic
production (see Keller and Yeaple, 2013).
    Given the pro…ts associated with each mode in equations (8)-(10), the aggregate
pro…ts of a multiproduct, multinational …rm are

             Z    1
                                  D                  X                        M
   (K; ) =            max(0;          (kd (Z); Z);       (kd (Z); Z);             (kd (Z); kf (Z); Z))dG(Z): (11)
              1

We now turn to the optimal allocation of organizational capital across goods and loca-
tions conditional on the location decisions of the …rm for each variety.

4.2    Allocation of Organizational Capital across Products
Suppose that a …rm has made production location decisions by allocating product lines
into three sets, D , X , and M , which are the product-speci…c productivities Z of

                                                         14
goods allocated to pure domestic sales, export, and multiplant production, respectively.
Goods whose Z is not an element of the union of these sets are not produced by the …rm.
Using the pro…t functions by mode (8)-(10), the aggregate pro…t function (11), and the
organizational capital constraint (4), the …rst-order conditions for the optimal choice of
the amount of organizational capital to allocate across various goods then imply

measures the total burden of the …rm’s production network on its stock of organizational
capital. Equations (12) and (13) illustrate trade-o¤s facing …rms. First, everything
else equal, a …rm that expands the number of goods that it manages will have less
organizational capital to allocate to each good that it produces and so will tend to be
less productive on average (higher B). Second, the allocation of organizational capital
magni…es di¤erences in the initial productivities across products produced within the
…rm. Third, a …rm that reallocates a product from an export mode to a multinational
production mode will use less organizational capital on the foreign a¢ liate than it did in
the exporting plant in the home country but may use more on the product line in total
because it needs to support two, rather than one plant.
    Given the optimal allocation of organizational capital across products, we can rewrite
the pro…ts by mode from the system (8)-(10) as
                                                                  1

We now focus our attention to the manner in which …rms assign various goods in their
portfolio to various modes of serving global markets.

                                                              15
4.3     Allocation of Goods to Modes
Pro…ts per mode are given by the equations in (14). Given this formulation, we can use
the logic in Helpman et al (2004) to assign products to modes. From the assumptions
(5), it follows from the expressions in (14) that there exist cuto¤s zD and zX > zD such
that for Z < zD goods are not produced, goods Z > zD will be sold in at least the
domestic market, and goods Z > zX will be sold in both markets. For …rms for which
the organizational adaption costs abroad are su¢ ciently low, i.e.

                                               1    >        ;
                       1
where       (1 + ) 1     1 there will be at least some products for which multinational
production is optimal. We henceforth assume that the support of distribution of …rm
ine¢ ciencies is such that this condition is meant. Speci…cally, we assume that the
upper bound of the support of international ine¢ ciency satis…es   1
                                                                      > .13 It follows
immediately that there exists an additional cuto¤, zM > zX , such that goods Z > zM
will be produced (and sold) in both countries.
    Given the existence of the three cuto¤s zD < zX < zM that de…ne the sets D , X ,
and M , we may use equations (14), (13) to rewrite (11) as


                           = AK B(zD ; zX ; zM )1                (1   G(zD ))F                  (15)
                               (1    G(zM ))F m          (G(zm )      G(zx ))F x

where the function B is now written
                               Z zX                        Z zM
                                        1                1          1
            B(zD ; zX ; zM ) =      Z 1 dG(Z) + (1 + ) 1        Z 1 dG(Z)                       (16)
                                zD                          zX
                                            Z 1
                                                    1
                               + 1+ 1           Z 1 dG(Z):
                                                        zM

The …rst order conditions for pro…t maximization associated with (15) imply the following
  13
    Relaxing this assumption is straightforward and will result in …rms that are large and productive
in their home market but that choose not to own any foreign a¢ liates.

The following proposition follows directly from inspection of expressions (22), (23), and
(24).

Proposition 1 An increase in a …rm’s endowment of organizational capital, K, in-
creases the …rm’s domestic sales, export sales, and local a¢ liate sales.

    Firm that have higher levels of organizational capital use it to expand along all
dimensions. In a sense, it is as if they have higher “core productivity” as in BRS.
This result is consistent with the empirical fact in section 2: parent …rms with larger
domestic sales have a larger value of aggregate export sales and multinational sales by
foreign market.
    We now decompose a …rm’s parent sales into its scale (local sales per product or its
intensive margin) and its scope (number of products managed or its extensive margin)
and explore the manner in which a …rm’s type is revealed by these observable character-
istics. In the model, a parent …rm’s scope is the share of product categories above the
domestic production cuto¤: N (K; ) = (zD ) . Using (17) and (20), we …nd that

Inspection of (25) and (26) establishes the following proposition that summarizes the
relationship between a …rm’s type and the parent scale and scope.

Proposition 2 A …rm’s scale is independent of K and increasing in . A …rm’s scope
is increasing in both K and .

    The proposition shows us how to perceive variation in a …rm’s type from its scale and
scope. The intuition for why a parent …rm’s scale is independent of K is as follows. An
increase in K leads …rms to add more organizational capital to each of the products in
its existing portfolio and to expand into weaker products, which shows up as an increase
in scope. As these products have smaller sales than the average product sold previously,
the Pareto parameterization of product-level productivity requires that the within-…rm
extensive and intensive margins cancel out leaving average sales per product unchanged.
    Now consider the e¤ect of an increase in . This shift induces the …rm to allocate or-
ganizational capital away from organizational capital-intensive multinational operations
toward domestic production. The resulting impact on the …rm’s domestic operations is
similar to that of an increase in K. There is, however, an additional e¤ect. As the share
of foreign sales shifts toward exports, more organizational capital is allocated to this
end. Because the plants that produce for export also produce for the domestic market,
the productivity of these export plants rises, lowering the cost of selling in the domestic
market and raising the average size of domestic operations.
    We now turn our attention to …rms’international expansion strategies as measured
by the ratio of the …rm’s aggregate export to its local a¢ liate sales. Dividing (23) by
(24), we obtain
                                            "                    e

where e       (1    ). This expression is very similar to the industry level measures that
appear in HMY, and when organizational capital is unnecessary for production ( = 0)
it simpli…es exactly to the industry-level expression found in HMY.
    Note that K does not appear in (27). As K is similar to ‘core productivity’in BRS,
it follows that purely selection driven models cannot explain the empirical patterns that
were documented in section 2. This result obtains because as K expands, the cuto¤s
ZM and ZX both shift down with the implication that both types of sales rise, but by
exactly the same proportion. This stark result is in part due to the curious features of the
Pareto distribution, but the general tendency would be present for other distributional
assumptions.
    One might propose that …rms di¤er in the degree of productivity dispersion across
industry: i.e. that lower might be a feature of particular types of …rms. If so, a model
without scarce organizational resources within the …rm is unnecessary to explain the
facts in the empirical section. While this does generate the proposed e¤ect on S X =S M
as can be seen from (27), the following proposition shows that in a model without scarce
organizational resources, increased dispersion within the …rm is not consistent with the
data (proof is in appendix).

Proposition 3 Suppose that = 0. An increase in within-…rm heterogeneity (lower e)
increases the multinational sales relative to exports and increases both the domestic sales
of the same …rm and the number of varieties sold in the domestic market.

    Intuitively, increasing within-…rm productivity dispersion increases the mass of activ-
ity above an given cuto¤ value. This is precisely the point made in HMY: as productivity
becomes more dispersed, more of the productivity draws exceed the domestic productiv-
ity cuto¤ raising both domestic sales and the number of products sold in the domestic
market. As this runs counter to the facts demonstrated in section 2, we turn to the role
played by heterogeneity in .
    A quick glance at equation (27) con…rms that variation in plays the role one would
expect. The greater the di¢ culty that a …rm has in providing organizational inputs to
its a¢ liate, the higher the export to multinational production ratio will be. The next
proposition, which follows from inspection of equations (25), (26), and (27), shows that
the organizational capital mechanism is consistent with the empirics shown in section 2.



                                            20
Proposition 4 Holding …xed …rms’ absolute organizational capital K, …rms that have
di¢ culty adapting their organizational capital to foreign use (high ) sell a wider range
of goods in their domestic market (scope), have larger sales per product in the domestic
market (scale) and tend to serve foreign markets through exports rather than a¢ liate
sales.

    When a …rm chooses not to open many foreign plants because it is relatively costly to
do so, it frees up organizational capital that can then be used to raise the productivity
of marginal domestic plants. As a result, parent …rms expand domestically by increasing
both their product scale and their product scope. Hence, the model can generate the facts
described in section 2 both in terms of absolute levels of sales across modes (Proposition
1), and in terms of the relationship between domestic levels and the relative mode choice
by …rms in international markets (Proposition 4).

We now brie‡y discuss the empirical relevance of our model in explaining the evidence and
other potential explanations. The most obvious alternative explanation is that …rms are
not constrained in their activities due to intangible “organizational capital” but rather
simply physical capital constraints. Physical capital constraints would have many of the
same implications as would shortages of managerial resources. However, a …rm’s stock
of physical capital was included as a control in the empirical analysis of section 2, raising
questions as to whether this explanation is a more attractive explanation than shortages
of organizational capital.
    A more di¢ cult alternative explanation to address is the possibility that the fact that
…rms export and produce locally for una¢ liated customers is not due to specialization

                                             21
across product lines but rather multi-sourcing of the same product as in Rob and Vlettas
(2003). The lack of data in the BEA dataset on the commodity composition of …rm-
level trade prevents us from addressing this possibility. However, we believe that our
explanation is more reasonable as it provides an explanation for why less diversi…ed …rms
tend to be more engaged in multinational production relative to exports whereas Rob
and Vlettas (2003) does not.

5    Trade Liberalization and Intra-Firm Productivity
In this section, we use the model to analyze the e¤ects on …rm organization of 1) lower
variable trade costs (greater ), and 2) lower …xed costs of foreign investment F I . All
proofs are in the appendix.
    The intra-…rm productivity e¤ects work through the mechanisms in (12) and (13).
For instance, a reduction in trade cost (increase in ) directly causes a reallocation
of organizational capital toward exported goods. Because organizational capital is in
limited supply within the …rm, there is also an impact on all goods that works through
changes in B. Further, to the extent that the change in the external environment causes
…rms to switch modes for individual products (changes in the cuto¤s zD , zX , and zM )
this too will have an impact on the resources available to any individual good.
    We begin by showing that a reduction in international friction leads to a rationaliza-
tion e¤ect within the …rm as plants producing marginal products are closed.

Proposition 5 An increase in the freeness of trade or a reduction in the …xed cost of
investing abroad reduces the product range of all …rms.

    A reduction in an international friction has a push and a pull e¤ect on the resource
allocation within the …rm. First, as international frictions get less intense, the free entry
condition requires that the mark-up adjusted demand level A must fall, which discourages
the production of marginal goods within the …rm. The same reduction in trade frictions
will also encourage a reallocation of organizational capital away from goods that are
produced exclusively for the domestic market toward goods that are sold in both the
domestic and foreign markets.
    We now consider the within-…rm productivity e¤ects of a reduction in trade costs (a
rise in trade freeness ). We summarize the e¤ects of trade and multinational production
liberalization through its e¤ect on the productivity of individual goods within the …rm
                            e
de…ned as '(Z) = Z k(Z) . We begin with the following intermediate result:

                                             22
Lemma 1: An increase in trade freeness, , causes at least some products produced by
a …rm to switch from not being exported to being exported.

    At least some of the goods that were previously produced in both the domestic and
foreign market will have their production rationalized to being exported from a domestic
plant. It is also possible that some products that were previously sold exclusively in the
domestic market will also begin to be exported. The following proposition establishes
how the productivity of this plant will change as it begins to export:

Proposition 6 A plant that switches from not exporting its product to exporting its
product after an increase in trade freeness must see its productivity rise.

   The productivity of the plants that produce goods that switch from not being ex-
ported to being exported rises relative to the productivity of plants producing other
goods in the …rm’s portfolio and in absolute terms. This is consistent with the empirical
results of Lileeva and Tre‡er (2009), who show that Canadian plants that switch from
domestic only to export become more productive. What is novel about our approach is
that the e¤ect is due to the reallocation of organizational capital within the …rm. Once
a …rm consolidates the production of a good in one location for two markets the plant
producing that good receives a higher proportion of the …rm’s organizational capital.
   We now expand our analysis of how globalization a¤ects the productivity of the entire
portfolio of …rms’ product lines and how this impact depends on …rm characteristics.
The following proposition considers the e¤ect of a reduction in variable trade costs, or
an increase in the freeness of trade.

Proposition 7 Consider an increase in trade freeness, . There exists a cuto¤ level of
domestic comparative advantage, b < such that for all …rms with < b the productivity
of all goods produced by the …rm increases while for > b the productivity of all non-
exported goods falls.

    The e¤ect of an increase in trade freeness on …rm-level productivity depends on the
…rm’s initial orientation toward the foreign market. If the …rm has a high comparative
cost advantage producing in the domestic market for export (i.e. > b), then much of
its organizational capital was already allocated toward exporting. In this case, the pull
of the export market leads to such a large reallocation of organizational capital out of

                                           23
non-exported goods that the productivity of non-exported goods ultimately falls. If the
…rm exports relatively few products, then the fall in the mark-up adjusted demand level
A brought about by the increase in trade freeness pushes enough organizational capital
out of marginal plants, leading to an increase in the productivity of remaining plants.
   The asymmetric e¤ect of a change in the international environment across …rms also
appears when we consider the e¤ect of a reduction in the …xed cost of engaging in
multinational production as the following proposition makes clear.

Proposition 8 Consider a reduction in the …xed cost of international operations, F I .
There exists a e < such that for …rms of type < e the productivity of all goods
decreases and for …rms of type > e the productivity of all goods increases.

    Unlike an increase in the freeness of trade, a reduction in the …xed cost of international
operations has no direct e¤ect on the allocation of organizational capital across goods.
Two indirect e¤ects are at work. First, there is a tendency for …rms to substitute
on the margin multinational production for exports. While less organizational capital
is allocated to any one plant for a switching good, collectively the two plants require
more organizational capital than a single plant. This tends to divert organizational
capital from other goods. Second, as noted above, the marginal domestic plant closes
as the mark-up adjusted demand level falls, freeing organizational capital for use in the
remaining plants.
Discussion The key result that obtains in this section is that shocks to the interna-
tional trading environment will change the focus of multi-product …rms and that this
change in focus alters the productivity of incumbent plants. Changes in focus within
the …rm have been shown elsewhere to have exactly such e¤ects on productivity. For
instance, Schoar (2002) shows that …rms that acquire new product lines see the total
factor productivity (TFP) of incumbent product lines fall. Such changes in TFP are
not obviously associated with capital constraints, leading Schoar to attribute the fall in
TFP to a reduction in managerial attention to these product lines. Note that Schoar’s
empirical analysis could potentially be repeated in an international context: a change
in policies that increase foreign access to a large trading partner should have the e¤ect
of lowering TFP of the plants producing goods that are not exported to that foreign
market.

6   Conclusion
The key feature of multiproduct …rms is that they can internalize the e¤ects of decisions
directed toward one set of goods on the outcomes of another. The types of e¤ects that
are internalized can either be on the product market side (cannibalization e¤ects) or on
the production side. This paper has been squarely focused on the latter. We have shown
that when organizational capital is a scarce resource in the …rm that is a key input in
production (as in Lucas 1977 and Rosen 1982), that the decision of how many goods to
produce, where to produce them (export versus FDI), and for which markets to produce
all become inter-related.
    Several important insights emerge from our analysis. First, we show that consider-
ing the internalization e¤ects of scarce organizational capital provides insight into the
standard “proximity-concentration” model. An important bene…t to consolidating pro-
duction in a single location is that organizational capital is conserved, allowing the …rm
to produce the same set of goods more e¢ ciently while also producing a wider range of
goods.
    Second, we have derived a new set of facts on the behavior of large multiproduct
…rms that both export and engage in MP in foreign markets and demonstrated that
standard proximity-concentration models naively adapted to a multiproduct setting het-
erogeneity cannot explain these facts. Comparative advantage in domestic versus foreign
management across …rms combined with an internal resource constraint within the …rm
is consistent with these facts, however.
    Third, we have shown how an internal organizational capital resource constraint
leads to within-…rm productivity e¤ects that di¤er substantially from those of purely
selection driven models. Changes in the international trading environment a¤ect the
way that …rms allocate scarce organizational capital across products with the implication
that some …rms will become more productive as they narrow their product range and
concentrate production in fewer locations, while other …rms will appear to become less
productive as they expand their product range and allocate more resources to foreign
production.
    There are several natural extensions to the model. First, by adding additional coun-
tries one can generate export platform multinational production that provides a …rm
with the bene…t of conserving scarce organizational capital relative to replicating pro-
duction in many locations. Second, by adding idiosyncratic di¤erences in demand across


                                           25
countries and products, it becomes possible to generate a number of new outcomes such
as the same …rm exporting “both ways”between two countries.

                                                         a
                                       S D (a) =                 (A)a F 1 a ;
                                                    a        1
where we have written sales as a function of a because we have put all …rm heterogeneity
into this variable. Note that a decrease in a is associated with an increase in dispersion
across goods within an industry. Taking the logarithms of this expression we obtain

            log S D (a) = log + log(a)              log(a          1) + a log(A) + (1            a) log F

Now di¤erentiating, we obtain
                                    dS D (a)              1                     F
                                             =                           log
                                      da            a(a          1)             A
                       1
Because zD = FA            1
                               1 we have dS D (a)=da < 0. So an increase in dispersion must
raise local sales.

Substitute for the Pareto Distribution to obtain

Substitute for the cuto¤s using (17)-(19) to obtain

Using the de…nition of B, solving for ( ), and substituting the resultant expression,
this can be simpli…ed to
                                  1 + (a 1)

                                        a
    Now, substitute for B and simplify to obtain

As our model delivers no extensive margin across …rms by abstracting from on-going
corporate …xed costs, this parameter never changes in any comparative statics.

7.4           Proof of Proposition 5
The least productive good produced by a …rm is given by equation (17). Let a prime
denote the value of a variable after a reduction in an international friction. We have
                                                                                !1        1
                                               0                         0
                                              zD               A         B
                                                      =
                                              zD               A0        B
Neither trade or MP friction enters this expression, so all the e¤ects work through the

endogenous variables AB . Using the de…nition of B given by (20) we …nd
                                    1
                                                       !1 1

                      zD      A0            ( )
Note that if this variable falls with a reduction in international frictions, then the cuto¤
rises as we now show. Let primed variables be the values after a trade or MP liberal-
ization. It is immediate from our parameter restrictions that ( )0 > ( ) for all …rms.
Using the free entry condition (29), we obtain
                 0                                                                  1 a1

Hence, we have
                                1           RR            a                     1                             ! a1
                     A0     1   +a                K1       +a       [ (l)] 1        +a    h(K; l)dKdl
                                     =      RR            a                     1                                    <1

So either type of liberalization lowers the mark-up adjusted demand level. Thus, we
have

The cuto¤ for operating a good for all …rms must rise.

7.5    Proof of Lemma 1
Consider the ratio of cuto¤s zM =zD . Using the cuto¤ de…nitions (17) and (19), we have
                                                              1
                               zM      FI        1                1
                                  =                                   :
                               zD      F     1



An increase in trade freeness raises   directly, and by proposition 5 raises zD thus at
least some goods that were previous produced in both locations (and thus not exported)
become exported.

7.6    Proof of Proposition 6
For a small change in the freeness of trade there are two types of goods that could switch
from not being exported to being exported. First there are goods that were not sold
abroad at all (Z near zM ). Second, there are goods that were sold abroad through a
multinational a¢ liate (see Lemma 1) whose production is rationalized with an increase
in the freeness of trade. Let a prime indicate the value of a variable after a change, the
change in organizational capital allocated to that plant is

                                 k(Z)0  B            1
                                       = 0 (1 + 0 ) 1 :
                                 k(Z)   B
There are two possibilities. First, B falls. In this case, the organizational capital allo-
cated to all remaining plants must rise including those that are exported. Second, B
might rise so that B=B 0 < 1. In this case, equations (12) shows that all goods that are
not exported must have less organizational capital allocated to them. The change in
k(Z) for an incumbent exporter is
                                                              1
                                k(Z)0  B         1+   0   1
                                      = 0                         ;
                                k(Z)   B         1+

which is strictly less than for a good that has switched from non-exporting to exporting.
Hence, as some goods must receive more organizational capital, the resource allocation
constraint binds and so the productivity of switchers must rise.

A reduction in trade costs must increase entry and so make the mark-up adjusted demand
level fall and the magnitude of this fall is proportional to a weighted average of percent
change in the cost index ( ) across …rms. Combining expressions, we obtain

From this expression we note two things. First, (a 1)(1
                                                     a

                                                           < 1 and second because
@ ( )=@ > 0 there must exist a < such that for all > b, dB=d > 0 and for
                                b
  < b, dB=d < 0, and it may be that b < 1 in which case dB=d > 0 for all …rms. For
the …rms with above this cuto¤, the productivity of non-export goods will fall.

An increase in F I must reduce and so make the mark-up adjusted demand level fall and
the magnitude of this fall is proportional to a weighted average of percent change in the
cost index ( ) across …rms. Combining expressions, we obtain

From

              i        we note two things. First, (a 1)(1

                                                            < 1 and second because
@ @@F(I ) (1 ) =@ < 0 there must exist a e < such that for all > e, dB=dF I < 0 and
for < e, dB=dF I > 0, and it may be that e < 1 in which case dB=dF I > 0 for all
…rms. Our result follows as we consider a decrease in F I .
