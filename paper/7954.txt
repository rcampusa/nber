1. INTRODUCTION
A large literature has examined variables that help predict the business cycle. Interest rates and

interest rate spreadsthat is, differences between interest rates on alternative financial

assetshave attracted considerable attention from market analysts, policy-makers and academic

economists. Stock and Watson (1989) found that two interest rate spreadsthe difference

between the 6-month commercial paper rate and 6-month Treasury bill rate, and the difference

between the 10-year and 1-year Treasury bond rateswere important to include in their newly

constructed index of leading economic indicators. Since then, various authors have investigated a

variety of alternative interest rates and spreads.1

    The usefulness of the yield spread between long- and short-term interest rates for forecasting

future economic activity has been particularly well established. Harvey (1988) has shown that

there is information about future consumption growth in the real term structure. Estrella and

Hardouvelis (1991) documented that the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury bond rate

and the 3-month Treasury bill rate is a useful predictor of future growth in output, consumption

and investment, and the probability of a recession. Plosser and Rouwenhorst (1994) examined the

information contained in the term structure about future real economic growth in three

industrialized countries. They found that the term structure has significant predictive power for

long-term economic growth and showed that the term structure contains information about future

real activity that is independent from information about current or future monetary policy.

Haubrich and Dombrosky (1996) found that the yield spread is an excellent predictor of four-

quarter economic growth but its predictive content has changed over time. Estrella and Mishkin

(1997) confirmed that the basic results of Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991) continue to hold in a

number of European countries as well as in the United States. Dueker (1997) has shown that the

yield spread among leading indicators is a relatively good recession predictor. Estrella and

Mishkin (1998) found the spread to be the best out-of-sample predictor of the probability of a



                                                      3
recession occurring in the next four quarters. Dotsey (1998) has thoroughly investigated the

forecasting properties of the yield spread for economic activity. He concluded that the spread

contains useful information beyond that contained in past economic activity or past monetary

policy, although over more recent periods the spread has not been nearly as informative as it has

been in the past. Many other papers also have demonstrated the predictive power of the spread

for future economic activity.2

    Why does the yield spread help forecast the business cycle? While a large literature provides

evidence on the usefulness of the yield spread as a predictor of economic activity, few studies

have addressed this question. In particular, even though several researchers have observed that

the time-varying term premium is a significant component of the yield spread, no one has yet

proposed a way of separately measuring the role of the term premium itself in accounting for the

spread’s usefulness in forecasting. 3

    The paper begins with a review of the forecasting usefulness of the spread. We confirm and

extend the conclusion of earlier studies that the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury bond

rate and the 3-month Treasury bill rate contains information about future real GDP beyond that

contained in various measures of monetary policy or oil price changes. We then note that the

empirical contribution of the yield spread for predicting economic activity can be decomposed

into separate contributions of expected changes in interest rates and the term premium.

Specifically, we attempt to answer the following question: given that the short rate rises relative

to the long rate prior to a recession, to what extent is this because future short rates are rationally

expected to fall (simple expectations hypothesis), and to what extent is it because the

forecastable excess yield from holding long-term bonds (term premium) has fallen (which must

be either a risk premium or a liquidity premium)? We find that both factors make statistically

important contributions. The contributions are similar at short horizons but the effect of expected




                                                  4
future short rates is much more important than the term premium for predicting GDP more than 2

years ahead.

        We then go on to investigate why the term premium may be playing a useful role. We

use a two-factor affine pricing model of the term structure based on Longstaff and Schwartz

(1992) and Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997).4 In this model, two factors, which can be

interpreted as the current level of the short rate and its volatility, determine the yield spread as

well as expected changes in future short rates and the term premium. We find empirically that

although interest rate volatility is a statistically significant factor in all three magnitudes, cyclical

variation of interest rate volatility does not explain why any of the three magnitudes help predict

economic activity.



2. THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF THE SPREAD

2.1. The predictability of real economic activity using the yield spread

    Our study uses the 10-year T-bond rate, 3-month T-bill rate, and real GDP from 1953:Q2 to

1998:Q2. The source of interest rates is the Statistical Release H.15 of the Federal Reserve Board

of Governors, while real GDP is taken from the DRI Economic Database (formerly Citibase

Economic Database).5

    Figure 1 displays (1) the yield spread between the discount equivalent yield on the 10-year

Treasury bond and the 3-month Treasury bill and (2) the annualized rate of growth of real GDP

over the next 4 quarters. The NBER recession dates are shaded in. On several occasions prior to

historical recessions, short rates rose above prevailing long rates, a phenomenon known as an

inverted yield curve. The figure illustrates episodes when the gap between two interest rates

became negative. The yield curve has flattened or become inverted prior to all seven recessions.

Many researchers have identified the extent to which the yield curve is tilted away from its




                                                   5
normal slope as a useful leading indicator of recessions. Of course, the yield curve does not have

to become inverted to signal that recession is imminent; it may simply flatten relative to normal.

    Many previous studies, such as Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991), Estrella and Mishkin

(1997), Haubrich and Dombrosky (1996), Bonser-Neal and Morley (1997), Kozicki (1997) and

Dotsey (1998), used the following regression to examine the predictability of the yield spread for

real activity:

 y tk = α 0 + α 1 Spread t + ε t ,                                                          (2.1)

 y tk = (400 / k ) * (ln Yt + k − ln Yt ) ,

 Spread t = itn − it1 ,

where Yt + k is real GDP in quarter t+k , ytk is the annualized real GDP growth over the next k

quarters, and itn , it1 are the 10-year Treasury bond rate and the 3-month Treasury bill rate at time

t. Table 1 shows the results of the estimation of equation (2.1) using OLS. These estimates are

qualitatively similar to those obtained by previous researchers, confirming that the yield spread

helps predict real GDP growth up to 8 quarters ahead.

         Although equation (2.1) follows most of the literature in trying to predict the cumulative

GDP growth over the next k quarters, it is also of interest as in Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991),

Plosser and Rouwenhorst (1994), Kozicki(1997), and Dotsey (1998) to measure the marginal

effect on year-to-year GDP growth for a horizon k quarters in the future. Table 2 confirms that

the spread makes a contribution to year-to-year growth rates for up to seven quarters in the

future, though interestingly makes a negative contribution as one looks to a four-year horizon.




                                                 6
2.2. The role of other variables

         Following Haubrich and Dombrosky (1996), Bonser-Neal and Morley (1997), Kozicki

(1997), and Dotsey (1998) we also estimated the following equation,

y tk = β 0 + β 1 Spread t + β 2 y t1−1 + β 3 y t1− 2 + β 4 y t1−3 + β 5 y t1− 4 + ε t ,     (2.2)

where y t1−i is quarterly real GDP growth beginning in quarter t-i. Because current and lagged

rates of growth of real GDP may be useful for forecasting future GDP, these real growth rates are

included in the estimated equation (2.2).

    Table 3 shows the estimation results for equation (2.2). Again these results are qualitatively

similar to previous studies. The values of the estimated coefficient on the spread are slightly

smaller than the estimated coefficients without including lagged real GDP growth, but remain

statistically significant at conventional levels up to 8 quarters ahead. Thus, the yield spread

provides additional information beyond that contained in current and lagged growth rates.6 The

statistical significance of the estimated coefficient on the spread shows a similar pattern with that

of the estimated coefficient on the spread without lagged real GDP growth as explanatory

variables.

    Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991), Plosser and Rouwenhorst (1994), Estrella and Mishkin

(1997), and Dotsey (1998) have investigated whether the yield spread has additional information

beyond that contained in monetary policy. The following regression allows us to take a look at

whether there is predictive power of the yield spread over and above that provided by other

variables that reflect the stance of monetary policy:

y tk = β 0 + β 1 Spread t + β 2 X t + ε t                                                   (2.3)

where X t is the contemporaneous measure of monetary policy. Following Plosser and

Rouwenhorst (1994), and Estrella and Mishkin (1997), we used the Federal funds rate and two

monetary aggregates as measures of monetary policy X t . The source of Federal funds rate and



                                                             7
narrow (M1) and broad (M2) monetary aggregates is the Statistical Release H.15 and H.6 of the

Federal Reserve Board of Governors.7

          The results are presented in Tables 4 and 5.              Even when we include the change in the

Federal funds rate or either monetary aggregate, the coefficient on the spread remains statistically

significant at the 5% level up to 8 quarters ahead. It is interesting that although the coefficient on

the change in the Federal funds rate 1 quarter ahead is statistically significant and positive, the

coefficients from 8 quarters ahead are statistically significant and negative. The positive value of

the coefficient on the change in Federal funds rate suggests that the Fed tries to raise the Federal

funds rate to hold down the inflation pressure in an economic expansion. In the monetary

aggregate case, the coefficient on the spread is statistically significant at the 1% level up to 8

quarters ahead conditioning on either M1 or M2. These results confirm the finding of previous

studies that the yield spread provides additional information beyond that contained in monetary

policy.

    Hamilton (1983) demonstrated a correlation between oil price changes and GNP growth,

though recent evidence surveyed in Hamilton (2000) suggests that the relation is highly

nonlinear. We examine whether the yield spread has additional information beyond that

contained in current and lagged oil price changes:

y tk = β 0 + β 1 Spread t + φ1ot + φ 2 ot −1 + φ 3 ot − 2 + φ 4 ot −3 + ε t                       (2.4)

where ot is the oil variable reflecting oil price changes at time t. Two oil variables are used. The

first (Table 6) is the percent quarterly logarithmic growth rate of the nominal crude oil producer

price index. The second (Table 7) is Hamilton’s (1996) measure of the net oil price increase and

is defined as the amount by which oil prices in quarter t exceed their peak value over the

previous 4 quarters; if they do not exceed the previous peak, then the value is taken to be zero.

          The coefficient on the yield spread still remains statistically significant at the 5% level in

Tables 6 and 7 up to 8 quarters ahead. Thus, the yield spread provides additional information


                                                          8
beyond that contained in oil price changes. In the case of the percent change in the nominal price

of crude petroleum, the oil price change helps predict real GDP growth only two quarters ahead.

The net oil price increase, however, helps predict real GDP up to 16 quarters ahead and thus, the

predictability of oil variable remains quite strong even though the predictability of the spread

disappears.

           Finally, we note in Table 8 that inclusion of contemporaneous values of all the variables

in Tables 3 through 7 also fails to change the basic result that the yield spread helps to predict

economic growth up to two years ahead.



2.3. Why might the spread predict GDP growth?

           The yield spread is determined by the financial market’s expectation of future short rates

and a term premium. The relationship between the yield spread and future economic activity

could be explained either in terms of the spread’s role as a signal of the future expected short

rates (the expectation effect) or as a signal of the change in the term premium (the term premium

effect).

    Suppose that the Fed adopts a contractionary monetary policy. In this case, market

participants expect that tight monetary policy will temporarily raise short-term interest rates. If

the current short-term interest is higher than the expected future short-term rate, this means that

the long-term rate should rise less than the short-term rate according to the expectations

hypothesis. Thus, the yield spread will be flattened. The monetary contraction will eventually

also reduce spending in interest sensitive sectors of the economy, causing economic growth to

slow. Conversely, easy monetary policy would result in a high yield spread, which would signal

faster future real economic growth. According to this scenario, the positive correlation between

the spread and future economic growth results from the expectations hypothesis of the term

structure and the temporary influence of monetary policy.



                                                   9
    Alternatively, market expectations of future economic growth may be reflected in the spread

through the expected future change in the short-term rate. If market participants anticipate an

economic boom and future higher rates of return to investment, then expected future short rates

exceed the current short rate and the yield on long-term bonds should rise relative to short-term

yields according to the expectations hypothesis.

    Both of these interpretations of the yield spread’s usefulness for forecasting real output

operate through the spread’s role as a signal of future expected short rates. However, the spread

also contains a term premium, which reflects in part the risk of alternative investments. For

example, if interest rates become more volatile at the end of an expansion, this could reduce the

spread, as will be seen in equation (3.12) below. Then long rates might fall relative to short rates

at the end of an expansion, not because future short rates are expected to fall, but because the

cyclical volatility warrants a change in the risk premium. Other cyclical factors in the term

premium or liquidity premium could conceivably also account for the correlation.

    To investigate these possibilities, it would be useful to be able to decompose the spread’s

forecasting contribution into an expectations effect and a term premium effect, to see which

mechanism accounts for the historical correlation.



2.4. A decomposition of why the yield spread helps forecast GDP

    As before, let itn , it1 denote the n-period interest rate (long-term rate) and one-period interest

rate (short-term rate) respectively. Consider the following definition of the time-varying term

premium TPt :

        1 n −1 1
itn =     ∑ E t it + j + TPt ,
        n j =0
                                                                                             (2.5)




                                                 10
where E t (it1+ j ) denotes the market’s expectation at time t of the value of it1+ j . The term

premium TPt could be viewed, for example, as the sum of a liquidity premium ( η t ) and risk

premium ( θ t ) : TPt = η t + θ t ; see Kim (2000). Equation (2.5) can alternatively be written

              1 n −1               
itn − it1 =  ∑ E t it1+ j − i t1  + TPt .                                                (2.6)
              n j =0               

Equation (2.6) implies that the spread can be decomposed into two terms. The first term on the

right-hand side of equation (2.6) is the difference between short-term interest rates expected over

the next n periods and the current rate. The second term is the time-varying term premium. Thus,

if a fall in the spread predicts U.S. recessions, it could either be because (1) a temporarily high

short-term rate suggests a coming recession, or (2) a fall in the premium on long-term bonds

relative to short-term bonds suggests an economic recession. Given that the short rate rises

relative to the long rate prior to a recession, to what extent is this because future short rates are

rationally expected to fall (the simple expectations hypothesis), and to what extent is it because

the forecastable excess yield from holding long-term bonds has fallen (which must be a risk

premium or a liquidity premium)? We now show how this question can be answered from the

data.

     Notice that the spread can be written

              1 n −1                         1 n −1         
itn − it1 =  ∑ E t i t1+ j − it1  +  itn − ∑ E t it1+ j  .                           (2.7)
              n j =0                         n j =0         

Substituting equation (2.7) into (2.1),

                   1 n −1                           1 n−1         
y tk = α 0 + α 1  ∑ Et it1+ j − it1  + α 1  itn − ∑ Et it1+ j  + ε t .               (2.8)
                   n j =0                           n j =0        




                                                            11
Expression (2.8) decomposes the contribution of the spread into the effect of expected future

                                        1 n −1 1           
changes in short rates                  ∑ E t it + j − it1     and the effect of the term premium
                                       n                   
                                        j =0               

            1 n −1        
 TPt = itn − ∑ E t it1+ j  . A generalization of equation (2.8) would allow these two components

Let vt + n denote the error in forecasting future short-term rates:

                             E t it + j .


Then (2.9) can be written

                   1 n −1                        1 n −1     

                   n j =0                        n j =0     

where u t = e t + (γ 2 − γ 1 )v t + n . Under rational expectations, the error term u t should be

uncorrelated with any variable known at time t. Thus, (2.10) can be estimated using instrumental

variable estimation with any variables dated t or earlier as instruments.

     Table 9 shows the estimation results for equation (2.10), with a constant, itn , and it1 as

instruments; similar results were obtained when all the variables in Table 8 were used as

instruments. The estimated coefficient on the future expected short-term interest rate change over

n periods is statistically significant up to 12 quarters ahead at the 1% level and the coefficient on

the term premium is statistically significant at the 1% level up to 8 quarters ahead. Thus, both the

expected change of the short-term rate over n periods (the simple expectations hypothesis) and

the time-varying term premium help predict real GDP growth up to 8 quarters ahead. Which

factor contributes more to predicting real GDP growth? The results of a Wald test of the null


                                                           12
hypothesis that the coefficient on the expected change of short-term rates over n-periods is equal

to that of the term premium are shown in the fifth column of Table 9. Even though the estimated

coefficients are similar, the null hypothesis is rejected in all cases where both estimated

coefficients are statistically significant. The contribution of the future expected change of short-

term rates to prediction of real GDP growth is statistically significantly bigger than that of the

term premium. Hence the most important reason that a negative yield spread predicts slower real

GDP growth is that a low spread implies falling future short-term interest rates.

          One factor that should matter for the term premium is the volatility of interest rates. The

following section develops a theoretical model for investigating the effect of interest rate

volatility on the term structure to see whether cyclical variation in volatility could account for the

predictive ability of the spread and term premium.



3. THE ROLE OF INTEREST RATE VARIABILITY AND THE RISK PREMIUM

3.1. A two-factor affine model of the term structure

          To understand why the term premium might help predict the level of economic activity,

we investigate a simple model of the term structure. Following Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay

(1997, p. 428), let Pt n denote the price of an n-period discount bond purchased at t whose

redemption value at t + n is unity, and let Mt denote a pricing kernel satisfying

 Pt n = Et ( Pt +n1−1 M t +1 ) .                                                                  (3.1)

For example, one popular specification uses M t +1 = βU ' (C t +1 ) / U ' (C t ). If we assume that

( Pt n+1−1 , M t +1 )' is jointly conditionally lognormal, then taking logs of (3.1) results in

  ptn = Et ( p tn+−11 + mt +1 ) + (1 / 2)Vart ( ptn+−11 + mt +1 )                                 (3.2)

where lowercase letters denote logarithms. Note that (3.2) implies that an increase in the

variability of either future bond prices or the pricing kernel results in a higher price of an n-



                                                             13
period bond relative to expected future values for mt +1 and ptn+−11 . Hence, if the end of an

economic expansion is characterized by an increase in the variability of either interest rates or the

pricing kernel, then this might appear as a drop in the yield on long-term bonds relative to short-

term bonds.

           We investigate this possibility in more detail using the two-factor affine yield model of

Longstaff and Schwartz (1992) as discretized by Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay (1997, pp. 438-

439). Suppose that the log of the pricing kernel can be described with two factors, x1t and x 2t ,

− mt +1 = x1t + x 2t + x11t/ 2 βξ1,t +1                                                           (3.3)

where the factors evolve according to

x1,t +1 = (1 − φ1 ) µ1 + φ1 x1t + x11t/ 2ξ 1,t +1                                                 (3.4)

x 2,t +1 = (1 − φ 2 ) µ 2 + φ 2 x 2 t + x 12 t/ 2ξ 2,t +1 .                                       (3.5)

Note both factors are heteroskedastic, displaying the greatest variance when the level is highest,

and innovations in factor 1 are perfectly correlated with the pricing kernel. The innovations

(ξ1,t , ξ 2t )' are independent Gaussian white noise with variances σ 12 and σ 22 respectively.

           Setting n = 1 and noting that the one-period bond yield it1 corresponds to − pt1 , we

deduce from (3.2) and (3.3) that

it1 = (1 − β 2σ 12 / 2) x1t + x 2t .                                                              (3.6)

Using (3.4) and (3.5), it follows from (3.6) that

Vart (it1+1 ) = (1 − β 2σ 12 / 2) 2 σ 12 x1t + σ 22 x 2t .                                        (3.7)

Equations (3.6) and (3.7) can be used to solve for x1t and x 2t in terms of it1 and Vart (it1+1 ) ;

hence the level and conditional variance of the short-term interest rate can be used to represent

the two factors that will determine any yield in this framework. It is mathematically simpler to




                                                              14
represent the factors as x1t and x 2t , noting that, provided we assume that (1 − β 2σ 12 / 2) > 0, an

increase in either x1t or x 2t results in both an increase in the level of the short-term rate and an

increase in its conditional variance.

            In general, Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay show that the log price of an n-period bond can

be characterized by

− ptn = An + B1n x1t + B2 n x 2t                                                                     (3.8)

B1n = 1 + φ1 B1,n −1 − ( β + B1, n −1 ) 2 σ 12 / 2                                                   (3.9)

B2 n = 1 + φ 2 B2,n −1 − B22,n −1σ 22 / 2                                                            (3.10)

An − An −1 = (1 − φ1 ) µ1 B1,n −1 + (1 − φ 2 ) µ 2 B2,n −1                                           (3.11)

where, from (3.6), A1 = 0 , B11 = (1 − β 2σ 12 / 2) and B21 = 1 . The spread can be calculated as

itn − it1 = −n −1 ptn − it1
                                                                                                     (3.12)
             = n −1 An + (n −1 B1n − B11 ) x1t + (n −1 B2 n − B21 ) x 2t .

Note that since φ i < 1 and Bin < (1 + φ i + φ i2 + ... + φ in −1 ) Bi1 , it follows that n −1 Bin − Bi1 < 0 .

Hence an increase in either factor will produce a decrease in the spread.

            To calculate the effect on the term premium, notice that

n −1

∑E x

       t   i ,t + j   = C in + Din xit                                                               (3.13)


where the coefficients C in and Din can be deduced recursively from the fact that


n −1                            n−2                    

j =0                            j = 0                  

so that

C in + Din xit = xit + Et (C i ,n −1 + Di ,n −1 xi ,t +1 )                                           (3.15)




                                                             15
Din = 1 + φ i Di ,n −1 .                                                                                 (3.16)

It follows from (3.13) and (3.6) that

n −1

∑E i

           1
         t t+ j      = B11 (C1n + D1n x1t ) + B21 (C 2 n + D2 n x 2t )                                   (3.17)


where B11 = (1 − β 2σ 12 / 2) and B21 = 1 .

               From (3.17) and (3.6) one can calculate the expected change in interest rates as

       n −1
n −1 ∑ Et it1+ j − it1 = Ane + B1en x1t + B2en x 2t                                                      (3.18)
       j =0



where Bine = Bi1 (n −1 Din − 1) < 0. Likewise the term premium can be characterized by

where Binp = n −1 ( Bin − Bi1 Din ). Note from (3.9) and (3.16) that

B1pn − φ1 B1p,n −1 = n −1[ B1n − φ1 B1, n−1 − B11 ( D1n − φ1 D1, n−1 )]
                           = n −1 [1 − ( β + B1,n −1 ) 2 σ 12 / 2 − B11 ]                                (3.20)
                           = n −1 [ β 2σ 12 / 2 − ( β + B1,n −1 ) 2 σ 12 / 2]

which for typical parameter values should be negative for all n. Likewise

B2pn − φ 2 B2p,n −1 = n −1 [1 − B22,n −1σ 22 / 2 − B21 ]
                             = − n −1 B22,n −1σ 22 / 2
                             < 0.

               Equations (3.12), (3.18), and (3.19) establish that the spread, expected change in interest

rates, and term premium all take the form y nt = Any + B1yn x1t + B2yn x 2 t for

                                   n −1                           n −1
y nt = itn − it1 , n −1 ∑ Et it1+ j − it1 , or itn − n −1 ∑ Et it1+ j , with Biny < 0 . Note further from (3.7)
                                   j =0                           j =0



and the independence of the factors x1t and x 2t that the covariance between y nt and Vart (it1+1 ) is




                                                                         16
given by B1yn B112 σ 12Var ( x1t ) + B2ynσ 22Var ( x 2t ) < 0 . Since the ex-post magnitudes differ from

the expected values by a term that is uncorrelated with information available at time t, it follows

that a regression of any of these three ex-post magnitudes on the conditional variance at time t

should yield a negative coefficient.



3.2. Empirical results

          To investigate the empirical relevance of changes over time in the variance of interest

rates, we employ the model of Brenner, Harjes, and Kroner (1996) which treats volatility as a

function of both the interest rate level and previous squared interest rate innovations:

it1 = c + φit1−1 + ε t
ε t | Ω t −1 ~ N (0, σ t2|t −1 )
σ t2|t −1 − ω = α (ε t2−1 − ω ) + β (σ t2−1|t − 2 − ω ) + γ (it1−1 − 2)



where we started the recursion for σ t2|t −1 by setting ε 02 = σ 02|−1 = ω .8 Maximum likelihood

estimates are as follows, with conventional standard errors in parentheses:

it1 = 0.190 + 0.964 it1−1 + ε t
     (0.098) (0.019)
σ t2|t −1 = 0.077 + 0.32 (ε t2−1 − 0.077) + 0.48 (σ t2|t −1 − 0.077) + 0.0257 (it1−1 − 2).
           (0.045) (0.13)                  (0.15)                     (0.0117)

We then used the fitted values σˆ t2+1|t in regressions explaining the spread, ex post change in

interest rates, and ex post term premium at date t, obtaining the following empirical estimates

(heteroskedasticity and 12-lag autocorrelation consistent standard errors in parentheses):

itn − it1 = 1.44 − 0.27 σˆ t +1|t + u t
                           2
                                                                                                  (3.21)
           (0.21) (0.14)




                                                            17

     j =0               (0.42) (0.19)


           n −1
itn − n −1 ∑ Et it1+ j = 0.10 + 1.06 σˆ t2+1|t + u t .
                                                                                                 (3.23)
           j =0         (0.51) (0.29)


Higher interest rate volatility is associated with a decrease in the spread and an expected drop in

interest rates, as predicted in equations (3.12) and (3.18). However, higher volatility appears in

(3.23) to increase the term premium, rather than decrease as predicted by equation (3.19).

Nevertheless, volatility is seen to play an important empirical role in all three magnitudes, and is

clearly something that a priori should affect the term structure of interest rates, even if that effect

in reality is more complicated than is captured by the simple theoretical model in (3.2) through

(3.5). It accordingly seems worth investigating whether the ability of the spread and the term

premium to predict future downturns in GDP growth might be accounted for by the fact that

interest rate volatility is perceived to be higher at the end of an expansion.

           To investigate this possibility, we added interest rate volatility to the specification in

(2.10),

                   1 n −1                        1 n −1     
y tk = γ 0 + γ 1  ∑ it1+ j − it1  + γ 2  itn − ∑ it1+ j  + γ 3σˆ t2+1|t + u t            (3.24)
                   n j =0                        n j =0     

which is now estimated by instrumental variables with instruments it1 , itn , σˆ t2+1|t , and a constant.

Results are presented in Table 10. Note that although σˆ t2+1|t makes a statistically significant

contribution to predicting GDP growth at horizons of two to four quarters, the coefficient is

positive (higher volatility precedes faster GDP growth), and thus could not account for the

positive coefficient relating the yield spread to GDP (a higher yield spread precedes faster GDP

growth), given that high volatility is associated with a low yield spread. Furthermore, the




                                                             18
coefficients γˆ1 and γˆ 2 both become even bigger in magnitude once σˆ t2+1|t has been added to the

regression, meaning that the omission of σˆ t2+1|t from (2.10) was not determining those results.

We thus conclude that although interest rate volatility is an important determinant of the term

structure of interest rates and an a priori plausible explanation for why the term premium helps

predict GDP growth, in practice it appears that the explanation for why the interest spread helps

forecast economic activity must be sought elsewhere.



4. CONCLUSION

    We have confirmed earlier results on the usefulness of the spread between long-term and

short-term interest rates for forecasting GDP growth. We have shown how to decompose this

effect into an expectations effect and a term premium effect. Both effects are statistically

significanta forecast of falling short-term interest rates is associated with a forecast of slower

GDP growth, and an increase in the expected return from rolling over 1-period bonds relative to

an n-period bond is also associated with a forecast of slower GDP growththough the first effect

(the expectations effect) is slightly more important quantitatively and statistically.

    We proposed a simple model for interpreting the second effect (the term premium effect)

based on time-variation in the variance of short-term interest rates. According to the model, an

increase in interest rate volatility at the end of an expansion could explain why the spread and

term premium fall at the end of the expansion. We found that volatility is an empirically

important determinant of the spread and the term premium and a useful predictor of future

interest rates. However, cyclical movements in volatility appear to be unable to account for the

usefulness of the spread and term premium for forecasting GDP.

(1994), Gerlach (1997), and Kozicki (1997), have further reported that the yield spread helps

predict inflation at moderate to long horizons.

    Dotsey (1998) shows that the information content of the spread differs across sample periods

and the spread does not appear to be statistically significant over some subperiods. Smets and

Tsatsaronis (1997) also state that the predictive content of the term spread is not time-invariant.

    The monthly average Federal funds rate series and monthly monetary aggregate were converted

to quarterly by averaging. Data for Federal funds rates are from July 1954 to June 1998 and data

for the monetary aggregates are available from January 1959 to June 1998.

Notes: a. o *t is the amount by which oil prices in quarter t exceed their peak value over the

previous 12 months; if they do not exceed the previous peak then the oil shock is taken to be zero.
This nonlinear transformation of oil price changes is Hamilton’s (1996, 1999) measure of the net
oil price increase.
