                                             ABSTRACT

We use detailed microeconomic data to investigate why aggregate residential electricity consumption
in California has been flat since 1980. Using unique micro data, we document the role that household
demographics and ideology play in determining electricity demand. We show that building codes
have been effective for homes built after 1983. We find that houses built in the 1970s and early 1980s
were energy inefficient relative to houses built before 1960 because the price of electricity at the time
of construction was low. Employing our regression estimates, we construct an aggregate residential
electricity consumption time series index from 1980 to 2006. We show that certain micro determinants
of household electricity consumption such as the phase in of building codes explain California’s flat
consumption while other factors (such as rising incomes and increased new home sizes) go in the opposite
direction. Because homes are long-lived durables, we have not yet seen the full impact of building
codes on California’s electricity consumption.

       California’s electricity use per capita has been almost flat from 1973 to the present

whereas that of the U.S. has increased by 50 percent. Explanations for this divergence, called

the Rosenfeld curve, have focused on California’s energy policies, in particular its increasingly

strict building and appliance codes, as well as its milder climate, household demographic trends,

and its higher energy and land prices which have made its homes smaller and may have driven

some energy intensive heavy industries out of the state (Charles 2009).


       The residential sector consumes roughly 34% of California’s electricity. Between 1970

and 2007 residential retail electricity sales per housing unit increased by 60 percent for the

nation but by only 24 percent for California.   Since 1980 residential consumption has been flat

(Gorin and Pisor 2007). Underlying the flat macro trend average are the individual purchase

decisions of millions of heterogeneous households. At any point in time, there is large variation

across households in electricity purchases, but this variation is stable over time. Residential

monthly electricity sales data from a California county show that between 2001 and 2008 the

ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile is between 6 and 7 in any calendar year.


       This paper uses several unique data sets to examine cross-sectional and temporal

variation in household electricity consumption. Our study contributes to a growing literature on

residential electricity demand (Aroonruengsawan and Auffhammer 2009; Borenstein 2009;

Reiss and White 2005, 2008). Similar to recent studies, we work with a very large residential

panel data base that provides monthly electricity purchases for every home in a California

county over the years 2000 to 2009. Unlike the recent literature we also have information on

the home’s physical characteristics, the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the

household living in the home, own and neighborhood ideology, and information about the

attributes of the community the home is in. We use these data to investigate why households

differ with respect to their electricity purchases at a point in time and over time.




                                                                                                    3
       We find that building codes, which were first instituted in 1978, lower the electricity

efficiency of post-code relative to pre-code dwellings after 1983 but not before. We argue that

houses built in the 1970s and early 1980s were energy inefficient because the price of electricity

was low. Although household electricity purchases are not very responsive to

contemporaneous prices, the price of electricity at the time the house was built is negatively

correlated with current energy consumption. We also document how electricity consumption

depends on liberal/environmentalist ideology, characteristics of the household such as income

and number of persons, and characteristics of the residence such as size.


       We use our regression estimates to construct an aggregate residential electricity

consumption time series index. This index enables us to decompose the residential sector’s

total change in electricity consumption into several key subcategories including changes over

time in the vintages of the building stock, in household demographics, in the size of homes, and

in the location of the population. 1 Employing data from 1980 to 2006, we use our

decomposition to document countervailing macro trends. We show that while the increase in

household incomes and in the square footage of new homes both predict rising average

electricity consumption, the phase in of building codes partially offsets these effects. The

average home is becoming more energy efficient as new homes are built under more stringent

codes and homes built during the 1970s and early 1980s begin to represent a smaller share of

the overall housing stock. We predict that this trend will continue.


Empirical Framework




1
  Sudarshan and Sweeney (2008) explain the Rosenfeld curve by employing a macro shift share
approach in which they ask how much of the overall difference between California and the rest
of the nation can be explained by the composition of California households, urbanization,
industry composition, structure floor space, fuel type used, and climate.


                                                                                                  4
       Within a household production framework, a household values electricity as an input in

producing comfort (e.g. indoor temperature) and leisure and household production activities . A

household's electricity consumption depends on three choices: 1) the choice of a specific home

that differs along dimensions such as size, vintage, and presence of a pool; 2) the choice of

appliances and renovations made to the structure; and, 3) utilization of appliances for leisure

and household activities, indoor temperature control and illumination.


       A house is a long-lasting durable. At its birth, building codes and decisions made by the

developer affect the home's energy efficiency. A developer’s decisions depend on current

building codes, technology, and energy prices. 2 Houses built during years of low electricity

prices could be less energy efficient either because consumers demand less efficient houses or

because during times of high housing demand the use of less skilled labor leads to poorer

construction.


       When a household first moves into a home, it may make changes to the home such as

updating durable appliances. If energy efficiency is not capitalized into the resale price of

homes, then home owners with the longest expected future tenure in the home have the

greatest incentive to invest in new energy efficient durables. Once these durables are installed,

the household faces temperature shocks and chooses durables depending on its demographics,

income, and time spent at home.


       A household’s total monthly electricity purchases depend in part on household

demographics and time use at a given point in time and a whole collection of past actions (such

as durables choices and decisions about the construction of the home) that are only partially

observed by the econometrician. We therefore focus on estimating reduced form


2
  Treating energy as an input into the price of housing services, Quigley (1984) shows that an
increase in energy prices leads to a decline in the demand for housing and a decline in the
demand for energy inputs, including residential electricity demand.
                                                                                                    5
household/month electricity consumption regressions as a function of household income and

demographic characteristics, electricity rates, year built, and proxies for household ideology. All

else equal, we posit that environmentalist households will consume less electricity. 3 We focus

on homeowners because we can observe neither landlord characteristics nor the contractual

agreement between the landlord and tenant (Levinson and Niemann 2004).


        We investigate the role of building codes and prices at the time the home was built in

determining household monthly electricity consumption. We proxy for building codes using

vintage year dummies. These dummies proxy not just for building codes, but also for the

energy efficiency of major appliances and general construction standards. As seen in Table 1,

energy efficiency requirements for California homes have become stricter since the introduction

of energy efficiency standards for residential buildings in 1978. Standards for appliances (not

shown) have also become stricter. 4       Rosenfeld (2008) argues that per capita electricity sales

in California would have been 14 percent higher without California standards and programs.

Table 1 also shows that in a survey of households in our county, those living in homes built in

the 1970s have older furnaces and AC systems than those living in older homes. An increased

prevalence of furnaces and AC systems with ducts also might reduce the energy efficiency of

homes built in the 1970s relative to earlier years. Finally, because real electricity prices in

 Kotchen and Moore (2007), and Kahn (2007), Kahn and Morris (2009), Kahn and Vaughn
(2009) have documented that environmentalists exhibit “greener” day to day consumption
choices than the average person. Kotchen and Moore (2007) find that in Michigan
environmentalists consume less electricity than observationally similar people. Kahn
documents that environmentalists are more likely to have a smaller carbon footprint (based on
driving, vehicles owned, and their home’s physical attributes) than the average person. One
possible explanation for these facts is that environmentalists gain pleasure from engaging in
“voluntary restraint”.

 Energy efficiency codes changed for refrigerators in 1978, 1977, 1987, 1992, 2001; for air-conditioners in
1978, 1979, 1981, 1984, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, and 2006; for clothes washers in 1994, 2004,
and 2007; for electric furnaces and boilers in 2008 and for small water heaters in 2004 but also in earlier
years (see Nadel 2002 and Residential Compliance Manuals from 1978 to the present). See

California were falling in the 1960s and 1970s and only began to rise in the 1980s, we would

expect that homes built in the 1970s would be less energy efficient than earlier and later homes.


       Our data, described in detail in the next section, come from a California utility which

serves an entire county and a small part of another. Compared to the nation as a whole, this

county has the same proportion of college graduates (24 percent in the nation versus 25

percent in this county) and the same proportion of residents above age 64 (12 percent in the

nation versus 11 percent in this county), but its population has a smaller share of whites (76

percent in the nation versus 66 percent in this county).


       The utility did not institute large price increases in the years for which we have data

(2000-2008). In 2001 the utility increased its pricing tiers from two to three (see Table 2 for

2008 tier pricing). There were rate changes in 2001 (coincident with a mass media campaign

and therefore unidentifiable), 2005, and 2008, but electricity purchases were remarkably

consistent across quantiles (see Table 3).


Data


       Our primary data set consists of residential billing data from September 2000 to

December 2008. These data provide us with information on kilowatt hours purchased per

billing cycle, whether the home generated power, whether the household uses electric heat, and

whether the household is enrolled in the utility's renewable energy program, their medical

assistance program, or their energy assistance program. We link each billing cycle to the mean

daytime and nighttime temperature in that billing cycle.


       We merge 2008 credit bureau data to our residential billing data. These credit bureau

data provide us with household income; demographic characteristics of the household such as

ethnicity, age of the household head, and number of persons in the household; and, the year

the house was built and other house characteristics such as square footage, whether the house

                                                                                                  7
has a pool, and the type of roof the house has. We also have access to the 2009 credit bureau

data. These two cross-sections allow us to create a short panel data set. 5


        The 2008 credit bureau data contain information on 520,835 households and we restrict

the sample to the 309,149 single family homeowners. These households are slightly older (a

mean age of 55 for the household head) and include fewer household members (a mean of 2.2)

compared to a random sample of single family homeowners in the metropolitan area of our

utility in the American Community Survey (ACS) of 2005-2008 (where the mean age of the

household head is 53 and the mean number of persons in the household is 2.8). We focus on

the subset of households who are single family homeowners. Because we only have the credit

bureau data at two points in time (2008 and 2009), we know nothing about the demographics of

households who lived in a house in our utility’s service area before 2008 and then moved even

though we observe their electricity consumption.


        We merge individual voter registration and marketing data to our data set. 6 For

registered voters we know party affiliation, level of education, and whether the individual

donates to environmental organizations. We were able to link half of our sample to the voter

registration data. (We do not limit our sample to the registered.) We linked either the person

whose name was on the utility bill or the first person on the utility bill. 7   The individuals we

could not link were living in smaller households and in block groups with a low proportion of the

college-educated, were more likely to receive a subsidy for electricity because of their low

income, and were more likely to have a household head above age 60. 8 We also merge to

  Only 5% of households were “mixed” between conservatives and liberals.

  Relative to all homeowners in the same county these individuals were also more likely to be of
Asian or other ancestry rather than of European ancestry, but were less likely to be Spanish
speaking. They were also lower income.

these data, by the block group, the share of registered voters who were liberal (Democrat,

Green, or Peace and Freedom) in 2000 and the share of vehicles which were hybrids in June

2009. 9 We expect that environmentalists are more likely to live in liberal, educated

communities.


       We have access to two other revealed preference measures of a household’s

environmentalism. From the data base with voter registration information, we know whether a

household has donated money to an environmental group and we know whether the household

has signed up for the utility’s renewable power program. Each household decides whether to

opt in and pay a fixed cost of $3 a month to have 50% of its power generated by renewables or

$6 a month to have 100% of its power generated by renewables. 10


       We use these data to examine the effects of income, demographics, ideology, and

building vintage effects on 2008 daily household energy purchases. We continue our

examination of the effects of building vintage on energy purchases using a sample of California

owner-occupied, single family homes from the 2000 5% IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Sample).

Respondents were asked their annual electricity expenditures. We restrict to households in

which the head is ages 30-65. We merge these data to the price of electricity in the home's

utility district when the house was built. 11 Because our price data are available from 1960

onward only, we restrict our sample to homes that are at most 40 years old. We use these data

to examine whether homes built in years when electricity prices were low used more electricity

in calendar year 2000.

  The political voter registration data are obtained from http://swdb.berkeley.edu/. While we
acknowledge that it is a little bit odd to merge future (June 2009) hybrid registrations to 2008
data, it is important to note that vehicles are a durable good and many of the vehicles were
owned as of 2008. We also believe that a block group’s hybrid vehicle ownership is extremely
highly correlated between 2008 and 2009.

       We also examine panel data on electricity purchases to probe the robustness of our

results. These data allow us to examine movers and renovators. Our electricity panel data

begin in September 2000.     For 2005 to 2008 we also have permit data from the Development

Services Department of the major city in our utility district. These data indicate the type of

renovation (e.g. kitchen, HVAC, electrical, etc), when it was done, and the value of the

renovation. We link these data to the single family homeowners in the credit bureau data and to

their 2000-2008 billing data. We can thus examine how, in the sub-sample of renovators,

energy consumption changes after a renovation.


       The full electric utility panel of approximately 50 million billing cycle observations, which

includes owners, renters, and apartment dwellers, allows us to examine how different

households respond to climate and price changes. We use the panel data set to test whether

liberal/environmentalists voluntarily restrain their consumption in the summer (Kotchen and

Moore 2007). We also use this panel to investigate the effects on consumption of price

changes employing both the variation provided by the modest rate increases and by differences

in winter and summer prices. We know the billing cycle that each household is on. For

example, some households may be on a July 15th to August 14th cycle while other households

may be on a July 4th to August 3rd cycle. Thus two different households in the same calendar

year and same month who are on different billing cycles will face different climate conditions

and electricity prices. To exploit this within calendar year/month variation we take daily

average temperature data and use the billing cycle start and end date to calculate the

household specific average temperature in that billing cycle. Any two households on the same

billing cycle will face the same average temperature but since different households are on

different billing cycles within the same month, we have within month variation in climate. The

same strategy is used to generate within year/month variation in average electricity prices. The

utility’s peak season is from May to October. Thus, between April and May prices rise and


                                                                                                   10
between October and November prices fall. We exploit these discontinuities to generate within

price variation.


Empirical Methods


        We run specifications on both cross-sectional and panel data to examine the impact on

current electricity purchases of a household's income, ideology, and demographic

characteristics; building codes; and electricity rates, including past rates.


Electricity Purchases in the Cross-Section


        Our first specification uses the 2008 billing data linked to the credit bureau data. We

regress the logarithm of mean daily kilowatt hours purchased by a household in each billing

cycle on household and house characteristics and neighborhood ideology, that is we run


1)                 ln(𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ) = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑋𝑋1 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑋𝑋2 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑋𝑋3 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝑋𝑋4 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑋𝑋5 + 𝛽𝛽6 𝑋𝑋6 + 𝜀𝜀


where 𝑋𝑋1 is household income; 𝑋𝑋2 is a vector of demographic, ideological, and other

characteristics including age, ethnicity, whether Spanish is spoken at home, the year the

household moved into the house, the number of persons in the household, the party of

registration, whether the household donates to environmental organizations, whether the

household purchases energy from renewable resources, and the special utility rate of the

household (medical assistance or energy assistance); 𝑋𝑋3 is a vector of house characteristics

(square footage, electric heat, roof type, and whether the house has a pool); 𝑋𝑋4 is a vector of

census block group characteristics, consisting of the fraction of registered voters who were

"liberal" (Democrats, Green Party, or Peace and Freedom) in 2000 and the fraction of registered

vehicles that were hybrids in June 2009; 𝑋𝑋5 is the mean of daytime and nighttime temperature in

the billing cycle (we also examine the interaction between liberal and mean temperature); 𝑋𝑋6 is a

vector of building year dummies (single years with pre-1960 as the omitted category); and, 𝜀𝜀 is


                                                                                                      11
an error term. The dummies enable us to determine if stronger building codes coincide with

improved electricity efficiency. Standard errors are clustered on the household and the block

level.


         As we discussed in the empirical framework section, we are aware that we are

collapsing both discrete choices (over home type and appliances) and continuous choice

(utilization) into one outcome measure; monthly electricity consumption. The cost of this

approach is that we cannot claim to recover how our explanatory variables affect each of these

three choices. Instead, we recover a “total effect”. 12


         We estimate Equation 1 using OLS. Under the standard assumption that E(ε|X) equals

zero, this regression recovers a series of treatment effect estimates. For example, if a random

person were assigned a swimming pool, we would estimate how her electricity consumption

would change. We acknowledge the possibility that people who live in big homes with

swimming pools may be “different on unobservables”. If those with an unobserved taste for

electricity intensive goods self select to live in large homes that have energy consuming

attributes (such as swimming pools), then our OLS estimates will over-state the true causal

effects of home size and swimming pools on a random household’s electricity consumption.

We will discuss panel results where our regression results are identified from within home




12
  Leading structural papers such as Dubin and McFadden (1984) , Goldberg (1998), and
Mansur, Mendelsohn, and Morrison (2008) have jointly modeled the decision of durable
purchase and utilization. In the case of cars, a household simultaneously chooses what car to
buy and how much to drive it. The price per mile of driving depends on the car chosen, so in a
regression of utilization (miles driven) on demographics and price per mile, this last variable is
endogenous. It is important to note that we are not following this empirical strategy. Our
dependent variable is not "utilization" it is total electricity consumption. We are assuming that
the error term in equation (1) is uncorrelated with the unobserved determinants of housing type.


                                                                                                12
variation (two different families living in the same house) and from families moving within the

utility service area (observing the same family living in two different homes). 13


       The marginal and average price that households face for electricity is a choice variable

because of the utility’s rising block tier pricing system. Households consuming more electricity

face a higher marginal price. Recent research (see Borenstein 2009 and Reiss and White

2005) examines whether households are responsive to average or marginal prices. In this

paper, we pursue two different strategies (one cross-sectional and one panel) for examining

how robust are our results once we control for electricity prices.


       In our cross-sectional approach to controlling for electricity prices, we modify Equation 1

to resemble a demand equation. Because prices are potentially endogenous and we do not

have a credible instrument, we use Reiss and White's (2005) price elasticity estimate of -0.39.

We assume that this price elasticity is the same for all households in our sample, thus ruling

differential price responses by demographic group. We then rewrite Equation 1 as


                              𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ) = 𝛽𝛽0 − 0.39 × 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑃𝑃) + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽 + 𝜀𝜀


where P is the price of electricity and X is a vector of other control variables. Using information

on the tier price structure by month, electricity consumption by tier, and the type of rate the

household faces (electric homes face different rates), we can calculate each household's

average price per kilowatt-hour of electricity by month (𝑃𝑃∗ ). We use this information to redefine

our dependent variable as 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ) + 0.39𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑃𝑃∗ ) and rerun Equation 1. This transformation

permits us to study the robustness of our results once we control for price.


       We further investigate the relationship between year built and household electricity

consumption by examining whether households living in houses built in years when energy

service area movers.

prices were low purchase less energy. We compare houses built in different years in the same

neighborhood at the same point in time. Using the 2000 IPUMS we specify the log of annual

household electricity expenditure, E, as a function of the logarithm of the mean price of

electricity in the electric utility district in the building vintage year (P), a vector of house year built

dummies (Y), a vector of house characteristics (H), including electric heat and number of rooms,

a vector of socioeconomic and demographic statistics (X), geographical fixed effects (F) called

“PUMAs” in the Census data, and an error term (𝜀𝜀):

Our year built dummies are less than 2 years old (the omitted category), 2-5 years ago, 6-10

years ago, 11-20 years ago, 21-30 years ago, and 31-40 years ago. Our socioeconomic and

demographic variables include the logarithm of household income, the Duncan Socioeconomic

Index, race, the number of persons in the household, and the age of the household.                          We

cluster the standard errors on electric utility district/year built dummies.


Electricity Purchase in the Panel


        We continue to investigate how the building stock affects household energy purchases

by performing an analysis of variance among a random sample of movers within the electric

utility service area. That is, for every single month, we perform a two-way ANOVA, in which we

estimate the partial sum of squares for the residence and for the household among non-

apartment dwellers. A comparison of the partial sum of squares for the residence and for the

household will reveal whether the structure or the family explains a greater proportion of the

variance in electricity consumption.


        We further analyze how the building stock affects household energy purchases by

examining the effect of home renovations on household energy purchases in the major city of

the electric utility service area from September to 2000 to December 2008. We regress the

                                                                                                                 14
logarithm of a household's mean daily kilowatt hours purchased in a billing cycle (kWh) on the

mean temperature in the billing cycle (T) and the interaction between mean temperature and the

percent of liberals in the block group and between mean temperature and political party of

registration (L), a vector of dummy variables (R) indicating whether the household added square

footage, a new roof, new windows, a new kitchen, a new HVAC, and a new water heater by the

billing cycle date, a vector of dummy variables (W) indicating that work was in progress on a

specific renovation, R, and household fixed effects (F):

We also examine interactions between mean temperature and the dummy variables indicating

specific renovations. Equation (3) enables us simultaneously to examine the role of

renovations in determining electricity consumption and, through testing for whether β2 is

negative, to test the voluntary restraint hypothesis that liberal/environmentalists consume less

electricity on hotter days. As a comparison, we present results (without the renovation

variables) for the entire electric utility panel of all customers (renters and owners) from 2000 to

2008. Standard errors are clustered on the billing cycle.


          We use our panel data to estimate aging effects between 2000 and 2008, enabling us to

understand the extent to which our year built dummies are determined by aging.                          That is, we

estimate

where T is mean temperature, A is current year minus year built, and F is a household fixed

effect.


          We test the robustness of our cross-sectional estimates by examining movers between

2008 and 2009 linked to the 2008 and 2009 credit bureau data.                  This second “short” panel


                                                                                                                      15
allows us to examine households who moved into different homes within the electric utility

service area and residences whose owners changed. In looking at households who moved into

different homes, we include a household fixed effect and test how the home’s attributes (size

and year built) affect electricity consumption. In looking at homes with different owners, we

include a home fixed effect to study how within home changes in the demographics of the family

(income and age) correlate with electricity consumption. Specifically, we estimate

where δ is the home or household fixed effect.


           We use the full 50 million panel observations to examine the effect of electricity prices on

consumption. We calculate for each year/month in our sample the mean price per kilowatt hour

that households faced. This mean price is exogenously determined for any household. Prices

vary because of rate changes in 2001, 2005, and 2008 and, more importantly, because of rate

increases in the summer. We estimate

where T is temperature in the billing cycle, P is the price, and H is a vector of household fixed

effects.     Standard errors are clustered on the billing cycle.


Results


Home, Demographic Characteristics and Ideology and Prices


           Table 4 reports estimates of equation 1. We estimate a small income elasticity of 0.05

and an elasticity for the square footage of the home of 0.42, holding all factors constant.

                                                                                                                     16
Asians, other non-European ethnics, and Spanish language speakers purchase fewer kilowatt

hours, perhaps because of unobserved wealth effects. For every ten years of duration living in

the home, we estimate that household electricity consumption increases by 1%. We view this

variable as proxying for the average age of the durable stock. Note that despite being able to

control for a large number of household, structure, and neighborhood attributes, we can explain

relatively little of the variance in electricity consumption -- the R2 in these regressions averages

around 0.26.


       Our results highlight the role that ideology plays in explaining cross-sectional variation in

electricity consumption. Controlling for structure and census block group characteristics and

household income and demographics, registered Democrats, Greens, and Peace and Freedom

purchase less electricity than registered Republicans, American Party, or Libertarians. A Green

consumes 9.6% less than a Republican and a Democrat 3.9% less. Those enrolled in the

utility’s renewable energy program purchase 1.1% fewer kWh. The greater the fraction of

liberals in a block group and the greater the fraction of hybrids among registered vehicles in the

block group the lower are electricity purchases. 14 A one percentage point increase in the

block's liberal share is associated with 3.6% lower electricity consumption. The second column

of Table 4 shows that when we restrict ourselves to warm summer days, we find that voluntary

restraint is greater in the summer. Greens consume 11.1% less than Republicans and the

coefficient on liberal community jumps from -0.36 to -0.60. We cannot pin down why electricity

consumption is lower in more liberal communities. Either liberals who choose to live in liberal

communities are more liberal and practice greater voluntary restraint or social pressure in liberal

communities encourages individuals to conserve on electricity consumption.




14
  Our demographic results such as household income, age, and household size are in line with
previous estimates discussed in studies such as Lutzenhiser (1993), Schipper, Bartlett, Hawk
and Vine (1989), Wilson and Dowlatabadi (2007).
                                                                                                   17
        When we control for price effects by modifying our dependent variable to equal

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ) + 0.39𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑃𝑃∗ ) and re-run our regressions, our results show a slightly greater reduction in

daily kilowatt hours among liberals, customers living in neighborhoods with a high fraction of

hybrid vehicles, users of renewable energy and customers living in houses built after 1983 (see

Table 4). Accounting for price effects leads to an even greater increase in daily kilowatt hours

among customers with a pool and customers living in bigger homes (compare the right column

to the left column of Table 4). Electric home customers enjoy a lower average and marginal

price (because their steps in the tier system are longer and they face lower winter rates). The

positive effect of having an electric home falls slightly once we account for price in our

dependent variable.


Building Codes and Year Dummies


        California introduced its energy efficiency standards for new construction in 1978.

Figure 1, which plots year dummies from the first specification given in Table 4 for every year

after 1960 (pre-1960 is the omitted category), demonstrates that electricity purchases for

households living in houses built when those codes were implemented are not lower than

homes built before these new codes were enacted. Controlling for our host of demographic,

structure and ideology variables, we find a distinctive non-monotonic relationship between a

home’s year built and electricity consumption. Relative to homes built before 1960, homes built

between 1960 and 1983 consume roughly 5% more electricity. Homes built in the 1990s

consume 15% less electricity than homes built in the 1978 to 1983 period. Starting from 1984 to

the present, we observe a monotonic negative relationship between year built and electricity

consumption. Relative to homes built before 1960, those living in houses built in 2006 or later

consume 16 percent fewer kilowatt hours. When we restrict to hot billing cycles (results not

shown), households' increase in daily kilowatt hours is greater for houses built between 1960-



                                                                                                      18
1983 relative to houses built before 1960 and the decline in daily kilowatt hours for post 1992

structures is smaller compared to our results for all billing cycles.


        The age of major appliances and controls for insulation cannot account for the building

year dummy pattern. When we used a 2008 Home Energy Survey for 495 single family

homeowner households, we found that houses built after 1992 were more energy efficient than

houses built before 1960 regardless of whether we controlled for the age and type of

appliances. Controlling for variables such as the age of the furnace, the age of the HVAC, the

type of windows, the presence of insulation, the number of refrigerators, the age of the

refrigerator, and the number of LCD and plasma TVs, we found that that coefficient on built in

1992 or later relative to built before 1960 was -0.191 (𝜎𝜎� = 0.073). Without these controls, the

coefficient was -0.199 (𝜎𝜎� =0.080).


        Using census data from the calendar year 2000, we observe that in California as a whole

households living in houses built in the 1970s have higher annual electricity bills controlling for

electric heat, the number of rooms, household income and demographic characteristics, and

PUMA fixed effects (results not shown). Compared to houses built after 1998, the coefficients

on year built pre-1960, 1960-69, 1970-79, 1980-89, 1990-94, and 1995-98 are 0.092 (𝜎𝜎�=.011),

0.132 (𝜎𝜎�=.012), 0.151 (𝜎𝜎�=.011), 0.124 (𝜎𝜎�=.011), 0.080 (𝜎𝜎�=.012), and 0.029 (𝜎𝜎�=.012),

respectively.


        Table 5, which looks at houses built after 1959, shows that houses built in periods of low

electricity prices are less energy efficient. 15 Between 1960 and 1983 our electric utility's real

price of kilowatt hours in 1977 dollars fell from 3.2 cents per kilowatt hour to 2.6 cents per

kilowatt hour, reaching a low in the late 1970s. Real prices then rose, reaching a high in the

                                                                                                     19
late 1980s and then fluctuating in a narrow band. In other California utility districts the 1970s

were a period of low energy rates as well.


        Controlling for price in the local utility district and vintage year category, the magnitude

of the coefficient on the year built 1970-79 dummy falls from 0.154 to 0.090.      The price

elasticity of annual electricity expenditures with respect to price at the time the house was built

is -0.22, suggesting that low energy prices lead either to less demand for energy efficient homes

on the part of owners or to shoddier construction. Low electricity prices also encouraged the

building of electric homes. When we estimated a probit model of whether the home was an

electric home on the logarithm of the electricity price in the year and utility district when and

where the house was built (and controlling for PUMA fixed effects), we obtained a coefficient of -

0.058 (𝜎𝜎�=.019) on price (this is a derivative of the coefficient on price). However, because we

control for electric homes in all of our cross-sectional specifications the pattern that we observe

in the year built dummies cannot be explained by whether a home is an electric home.


Movers and Renovators


       Our panel data show that while a house is energy inefficient both because of its structure

and the people living within it, the house itself accounts for a larger share of the variance in total

electricity purchases (see Table 6). Our analysis of variance shows that in a random sample of

movers moving to different homes within the utility district between 2000 and 2008, the partial

sum of squares for the residence is more than three times larger than the partial sum of squares

for the family in July, the hottest month of the year, and the partial sum of squares for the

residence is more than two times larger than the partial sum of squares for the family in

December, the coldest month of the year.


       Cross-sectional regressions (such as equation 1) are subject to the criticism that there

may be unobserved features of the home or the household that are correlated with the


                                                                                                    20
observables. We use our short panel from 2008 to 2009 and focus on households who moved

between electric utility service area homes over this period and on the same house in the

electric utility service area with two different owners. Unfortunately, there are only 3,000 such

movers. We use these data and estimate Equations 5 and 6.         The panel specification that

includes a home fixed effect allows us to estimate the role of household size and household

income and the panel specification that includes a household fixed effect allows us to estimate

the role of housing attributes such as square feet and year built on electricity consumption. All

of these results are available on request. The panel results with fixed effects yield “within”

estimates that are generally similar to the OLS results estimated on the same sample. This

robustness test raises our confidence in our cross-sectional estimates.


       We use our full 2000-2008 panel to examine whether aging effects can explain our year

built dummies (Equation 4) and conclude that while there are aging effects, these effects are

small (results not shown). We find that as a house ages, each additional year increases mean

daily kWh by 0.1 percent. (When the dependent variable is the logarithm of mean daily kWh

and control variables are temperature, a dummy for summer months, and house fixed effects,

the coefficient on house age is 0.0011, 𝜎𝜎�=0.0005.)


       How much is a house’s energy efficiency determined by its year of birth, or can a home

renovation change the energy efficiency of the dwelling? Table 8 shows that most renovations

increase energy consumption. A new HVAC decreases electricity purchases for mean

temperatures below 58.3°F or 14.6°C (roughly the 35th bottom mean temperature decile). At a

temperature of 75°F (23.9°C) a new HVAC increases electricity purchases by 5 percent. This

finding is consistent with past work documenting a rebound effect associated with new

residential durables purchases (see Dubin, Miedema and Chandran 1986, and Davis 2008).

Additions of square footage and new kitchens increase daily kilowatt hours purchased by 1.4

and 1.7 percent, respectively. A new roof decreases electricity purchases by 1.6 percent.

                                                                                                 21
        Table 8 also presents results for the full panel showing that registered liberals and

households living in block groups with a high proportion of liberals reduce their consumption

during the summer months. When we use the full panel to investigate the effects of price

changes on electricity purchases (Equation 7), we obtain a statistically insignificant coefficient of

-0.126 (𝜎𝜎�=.081) on the logarithm of the price of electricity (full results not shown).   This is

smaller than Reiss and White's (2005) price elasticity estimate of -0.28 from OLS estimation and

of -0.39 based on GMM estimation. Our estimate is also smaller than Borenstein’s (2009)

median average price elasticity of -0.217 but well within his estimated range.


Understanding Aggregate Time Series Trends


        Between 1980 and 2005 average residential consumption among California electric

utilities ranged between 400 and 800 kWh per month (depending on climate zone), with minor

fluctuations in residential consumption over this 25 year period (Gorin and Pisor 2007). What

accounts for the “flat” California trend? Rising incomes, bigger home sizes, an increase in the

share of electric homes from 10% in 1980 to 15% in 1980, and the move to warmer inland areas

should increase electricity consumption. But the declining share of energy inefficient homes

built in the 1970s (see Table 9) should decrease electricity consumption.


        We examine how average household electricity consumption changes as the attributes

of California households and structures, the temperature where most people live, and

Californians’ party registration have changed over time. We begin by estimating a modified

version of our 2008 cross-sectional regression (Equation 1) for all electric utility homeowners

using in the regression only attributes that are available in the 1980-2000 Censuses and the




                                                                                                     22

sectional data. 16 That is, we estimate

where the dependent variable is mean daily kWh per billing cycle in July 2008, our household

variables are the age of the household head, the number of persons living in the household, and

income; the home characteristics are square feet and whether the home has electric heat;

Temperature is the mean of daytime and night-time temperature within the billing cycle;

Democrat indicates that the utility customer is a registered Democrat; and the eight year

dummies are indicators for built prior to 1940, built in 1940-1949, 1950-1959, 1960-1969, 1970-

1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, and built 2000 or later.                            We restrict our sample to registered

Democrats and Republicans.                   The regression results are given in Appendix Table 1.


        We then calculate average electricity consumption per decade for the average California

household who lives in single family housing. We calculate this by using our estimated

coefficients, 𝛽𝛽̂𝐻𝐻 , 𝛽𝛽̂𝑆𝑆 , 𝛽𝛽̂𝑇𝑇 , 𝛽𝛽̂𝐷𝐷 , 𝛽𝛽̂𝑌𝑌 , and sample means for household demographics and politics and

structure attributes from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Census, 2006 American Community Survey

and voter registration data. We use county level July average temperature data and calculate a

state level mean by calculating the population weighted July temperature exposure in each

year. We use aggregate state political voter registration data to calculate the share Democrat in

each year. To calculate our electricity consumption index, we combine these data sources

along with our index weight estimates from the linear regression (see equation 8) and we

estimate for each year t (1980,1990, 2000, and 2006):

  Because we do not know square footage from census data we proxy for state-wide square

Our resulting index resembles a Paasche Index because we use our regression estimates of

Equation 8 from 2008 as index weights to collapse the characteristics at each point in time into

a single energy index.


       Table 10 reports our decomposition results. The units are kWh per day in July. We

present the total average consumption by decade and disaggregate this total into the

contributions from housing structure, household demographics, climate migration, and politics.

Predicted average electricity consumption is rising over time but slowly. The subindices show

that different subcomponents are moving in opposite directions. Rising household income and

larger homes over time have increased electricity consumption but partially offsetting this is the

shrinking share of the housing stock built in the “brown vintages” from 1960 to 1980. Changes

in household characteristics (income, household size, and age of the household head) predict

greater consumption over time. The move to higher temperature areas has relatively little effect

as do changes in the share of registered Democrats. The share of Democrats, however, may

be a poor predictor of environmentalism if Democrats have become greener over time.


       Although we do not explicitly account for price changes, they are unlikely to explain the

flat California trend because prices in California as a whole were relatively flat since the 1980s.

Between 1980 and 1990 real prices rose by 12 percent but by 2000 had fallen once more to

their 1980 level. By 2006 real prices had risen again to their 1990 level (Gorin and Pisor 2007).


Conclusion


Using several unique datasets we examined cross-sectional and longitudinal variation in

homeowner electricity purchases and provided insights into why California's per capita



                                                                                                                                       24
residential electricity consumption has been roughly constant since the 1980s. Our cross-

sectional estimates permitted us to account for the role of housing structure, household

demographics, and ideology in residential electricity consumption. We then used our cross-

sectional estimates in an aggregation exercise where we averaged over housing and household

types using the census counts. This aggregation allowed us to study how the average home

evolves over time as demolition and new construction takes place and as the housing,

socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics of diverse California households evolve.


       We conclude that we have not yet seen the full impact of building and appliance code

regulation and of today's relatively high electricity prices on California's electricity consumption.

We found that California houses built between1960-1983 were less electricity efficient than

homes built prior to 1960 (in part because they were built when electricity prices were low), but

that after 1983 homes became more electricity efficient (because of higher electricity prices and

building code regulations).      The past is still with us because homes are long lived durables.

The homes born in times of low electricity prices and weaker regulations still constitute a large

fraction of the housing stock.

Note: The sample consists of single family homeowners linked to the credit bureau data and to their 2008
electricity data. Each observation is a household's billing cycle. See Equation 1 in the text. The
dependent variable is the first three specifications is the logarithm of mean daily kilowatt hours purchased
by the household in the billing cycle. The dependent variable in the fourth specification is
ln(kwh)+0.39ln(Price). Daily kilowatt hours purchased is bottom-coded at 2.09 kilowatt hours. Mean daily
kilowatt hours is 28.9. Standard errors (in parenthesis) are clustered on the billing cycle and block level.
*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 Additional covariates are dummy variables indicating unknown year the
house was built, unknown square footage, unknown age of household head, unknown family income, and
unknown number of household members. The constant term is not shown. Building year dummies are
plotted in Figure 1.

Note: Each observation is a household’s billing cycle. The renovators sample estimates Equation 3.
The dependent variable is the logarithm of mean daily kilowatt hours purchased by a household in the
billing cycle. The all households sample consists of all electric utility customers, regardless of dwelling
type or ownership status, from September 2000 to the end of 2008. Mean daily kilowatt hours in this
sample is 18.6. The renovators sample consists of single family homeowners in the major city in the
electric utility service area who are in the credit bureau data, are linked to their September 2000-2008
electricity data, and completed a renovation with a permit between 2004-2008. Mean daily kilowatt hours
in the renovators sample is 24.2. Standard errors are clustered on the billing cycle. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05,
