                                         ABSTRACT

We examine how market structure, measured as the number of firms, affects prices, quantities,
product assortment, and consumer surplus. Our analysis exploits Washington's deregulation of
spirit sales, which generated exogenous variation in market structure across the state. Consistent
with the uniform pricing literature, we find no effect of increased competition on prices. Rather,
we document an expansion of product assortment, which in turn increases purchasing. Using a
discrete-choice demand model, we estimate that wider assortments increase consumer surplus by
$3.20/month when moving from monopoly to duopoly. However, the likelihood that a household
engages in heavy drinking, as defined by the CDC, increases by 5.6 percentage points, raising
concerns about social welfare.

    The relationships between market structure, prices, product variety, and consumer
welfare are important inputs into many economic questions, such as how to design
antitrust policy and the effects of licensure restrictions. Because theoretical models
make starkly different predictions about the effect of market structure on prices
(Bresnahan and Reiss (1991)) and on product variety (Stole (2007)), the onus falls
on empirical work to determine how a change in the number of firms actually affects
a market.
     This paper studies the effect of market structure in the retail market for liquor
in Washington.1 This context is interesting for three reasons: first, recent work
documents that retailers follow uniform pricing policies across broad regions of
the United States (Adams and Williams (2019); DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2019);
Hitsch et al. (2017)). Such pricing policies call into question the role of competition
in determining market outcomes at the local level. Indeed, our examination of liquor
markets reveals that firms do not adjust prices in response to local competition.
Nonetheless, we find that local competition does increase consumer surplus because
it induces retailers to broaden their product assortment.
    A second motive for studying competition in Washington's liquor markets is to
learn about the potential for licensure restrictions to reduce the negative externalities
associated with liquor consumption. An explicit goal of licensure restrictions, such
as those imposed in Washington, is to curb alcohol purchasing by reducing the
number of liquor retailers. However, the success of these restrictions in reducing
externalities, such as alcohol-fueled car accidents, depends who consumes less when
fewer retailers sell spirits and how much less they consume. Do would-be liquor
shoppers substitute to beer or wine? Would they engage in heavy-drinking behavior
were liquor more readily available? By investigating these questions, we hope to
provide guidance for improving liquor regulation.
    The main hurdle for identification of these causal relationships is that entry
responds to market conditions that are unobserved to the econometrician. This
endogeneity challenge provides a third reason to study liquor retail in Washington:
this case study features a natural experiment that provides exogenous variation in
the number of liquor retailers across markets in the state. This variation allows

us to identify how competition affects market outcomes. The natural experiment
was induced by Washington's deregulation of liquor markets in 2012. From the
end of Prohibition through May 2012, the Washington State Liquor Control Board
(WSLCB) held a monopoly on spirit sales, similar to fourteen other "Alcohol Bever-
age Control" (ABC) states.2 On June 1, 2012, private retailers were allowed to enter
the deregulated market so long as their premises exceeded 10, 000ft2 and they paid
a fee of $316.3 Importantly, these regulations do not apply to the sale of beer and
wine, which have long be deregulated in Washington. Thus, we refer to the set of
retailers that sold beer and/or wine before liquor deregulation as potential entrants
into Washington's fledgling liquor markets. Using this population of potential en-
trants, we adopt a regression discontinuity design to leverage the licensure threshold.
Controlling for a rich set of market characteristics, we compare outcomes in mar-
kets with a potential entrant just above versus just below the 10, 000ft2 threshold.4
Our identification argument is that potential entrants sized just above 10, 000ft2 are
otherwise similar to those sized just below, except in their license-eligibility.
    The natural concern with this identification strategy is that retailers might alter
their square footage in response to the restriction. For example, a retailer sized
9, 000ft2 might build an annex to qualify for a liquor license. We present evidence
that this type of gaming did not occur by documenting that there are very few
renovations following the announcement of the deregulation law. Further, a formal
test does not reject the that the density of retailer outlet sizes is smooth at 10, 000ft2 .
An additional concern is that the threshold may not bind; that is, stores with sizes
near 10, 000ft2 might not find it profitable to sell liquor. To the contrary, we show
that there is a large discontinuity in licensure probability at the threshold: a 27
percentage point jump across all stores, and an 86 percentage point jump for chain
stores.
    At the market level, we show that the size requirement does indeed reduce the

  In our preferred specification, we also exploit markets with multiple potential entrants near the
  threshold by conditioning on the total number of potential entrants with square footage in the
  neighborhood of 10, 000ft2 , and then comparing markets with different numbers of incumbents just
  above versus just below it.

number of spirits retailers. On average, markets with a potential entrant sized just
above the threshold sustain 0.88 more liquor retailers than those with a potential
entrant sized just below. As a placebo test, we verify that markets with a retailer
sized just above/below 10, 000ft2 are similar in demographics such as age, income,
and race, as well as pre-privatization liquor purchasing, which we interpret as a
proxy for spirits demand. Thus, we feel confident employing the natural experiment
in a two-stage least squares estimator to compare outcomes across different market
structures.
     Our estimates reveal that retailers alter product assortment rather than prices
when facing an additional competitor in the same ZIP code. Using point-of-sale
data from 390 Nielsen RMS stores, we find that the average retailer offers roughly
20 more products (UPCs) when competing as a duopolist instead of operating as a
monopolist. Further, we find that the marginal entrant offers unique inventory, so that
an exogenous shift from monopoly to duopoly broadens the market-wide assortment
available to consumers by approximately 160 UPCs. The wider product assortment
and greater convenience afforded by an additional competitor in a duopoly increase
liters sold by approximately 28% over monopoly markets. We note, however, that our
results indicate strongly diminishing returns as the number of firms increases. The
combination of additional variety and increased consumption delivers a consumer
surplus increase of $3.2 dollars a month when moving from monopoly to duopoly.
    Taken together, our findings highlight how competition benefits consumers, even
when it does not alter prices. They underscore the need for antitrust analysis to
look beyond prices to assess how competition affects consumer welfare in retail
markets. More broadly, the results suggest that models of retail competition that
impose optimal pricing but ignore assortment decisions may poorly approximate
firm conduct in practice.
    Finally, our findings suggest that licensure restrictions can successfully curb
risky drinking behaviors. First, we show that Washington's restrictions reduce spirits
purchasing for off-premise consumption, without increasing either beer or wine
purchasing or expenditures on spirits at restaurants and bars. In other words, ZIP
codes in Washington with an additional spirits retailer see an overall increase in
alcohol purchasing. Second, we examine how the size restriction affects the distribu-

                                          3
tion of purchasing across consumers using Nielsen data on a panel of Washington
households. We document that an additional firm increases in the proportion of
households that engage in heavy drinking, as defined by the Center for Disease
Control. For example, an exogenous shift from monopoly to duopoly increases the
likelihood of heavy drinking by 5.6 percentage points. However, as we noted before,
the effect magnitude falls in the number of firms so that a shift from 5 to 6 liquor
outlets yields no detectable change in heavy drinking.


Related Literature This paper contributes to a growing literature, including Adams
and Williams (2019), DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2019), and Hitsch et al. (2017), that
documents uniform pricing among US retail chains. This paper provides additional
evidence on this phenomenon; we show that prices do not respond to exogenous
shocks to competition. Instead, retailers appear to tailor their product assortment to
the local retail environment.
     By taking a reduced-form approach to studying market structure, this work also
contributes to long literatures on entry (see Berry and Reiss (2007) for a survey)
and product variety (Berry and Waldfogel (2001); McManus (2007); Fan (2013);
Sweeting (2010, 2013); Eizenberg (2014); Wollmann (2018)), which chiefly employ
structural methods. We leverage a natural experiment to quantify how an additional
firm affects prices and product assortment, so that we need not take a stand on
objects such as the distribution of unobservables, the choice set facing consumers,
or firm conduct. Thus, the natural experiment enables us to study a setting with
hundreds of differentiated products and dozens of retailers, where solving an optimal
entry, product assortment, and pricing game might otherwise require heavy-handed
assumptions.
    Our results also add to the burgeoning literature investigating liquor regulation
in the United States, including Milyo and Waldfogel (1999), Seim and Waldfogel
(2013), Conlon and Rao (2015, 2019), Miravete et al. (2018, 2020), Seo (2016), and
Huang et al. (2019). We complement these previous studies by documenting the
effects of licensure restrictions on private liquor market outcomes and our focus on
the product variety margin.

                                         I. Data

I.A. Data on Beer, Wine and Liquor Licensure

We obtain data on beer, wine and liquor licensure from WSLCB off-premise licensee
lists. These lists contain information on every retailer licensed to sell beer, wine,
and/or liquor for consumption outside of the store, including former licensees that
have ceased operations. We observe all licensees from 2011 through 2017. From the
WSLCB, we also obtain off-premise liquor revenues (excluding beer and wine sales)
and on-premise licensee lists for this period.
    Our analysis focuses on the set of beer and wine retailers that began operating
before 2012. These licensees compose the set of firms for whom we have a natural
experiment on entry into spirits markets, as they did not set square footage in response
to the licensure threshold. Our identification strategy rests on the assumption that
stores sized just above the 10, 000ft2 threshold are comparable to those just below.
Beginning in 2011, the licensure threshold induces a discontinuity in the payoff
to square footage for new establishments. Thus, new retailers sized just above the
threshold may value the spirits licensure option more than those sized just below,
perhaps due to differences in local liquor demand. Therefore, there is no clear control
group for retail outlets that commence beer and/or wine sales after the licensure
threshold is introduced.
    Table 1 presents summary statistics for licensees over time. There are 4,978
beer and wine licensed retailers in December 2011, of which 2,098 are chains. At
liberalization, on June 1st of 2012, 4,977 of these stores were still operating, and
1,075 of them obtained liquor licenses. Most of these entrants belong to retail chains
(924 of 1,075). These 1,075 pre-existing beer and wine retailers constitute the lion's
share of liquor retailers in Washington's nascent spirits markets. While 570 new
alcohol retailers enter during 2012, a mere 57 sell spirits. That is, only 5% of spirits
retailers fall outside of our potential entry sample. The low level of liquor licensure
for stores that were not selling beer or wine prior to 2012 makes us confident that

the set of retailers that we consider captures the vast majority of potential entrants.
    Chain identity is an important characteristic of liquor retailers. We define a chain
as a group of at least two outlets in different locations with the same store name on
their license application. In what follows, we will use the term "independent" stores
to refer to non-chain stores. Most chains are all-or-nothing with spirits licensure;
either all outlets sell spirits or none of them do, as shown by Appendix Figure A1.
Appendix Figure A2 reports chain name and number of branches for all chains with
5 or more stores. Overall, 44% of chains obtain a liquor license. Chains that never
sell spirits, such as gas stations and convenience stores, typically feature formats that
are quite small. In contrast, large format retailers, like Costco and Safeway, always
sell liquor. Variation in licensure is highest for small-footprint grocery chains like
Trader Joe's, where retail outlet sizes fall on both sides of the licensure threshold.


I.B. Data on Square Footage

We employ Google Map Developers' Area Calculator to measure square footage
for the retail outlets in our sample.5 This application overlays a tool for calculating
square footage on top of Google Maps' satellite images. Figure B1 in Appendix B
presents an example of how we use the application to calculate store areas. To obtain
data for all 4,978 stores in our sample, we hired Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
workers to measure each store's square footage. Appendix B details our procedure.

    Figure 1 presents histograms of retailer sizes separately for chain and independent
stores. Both distributions are skewed towards small formats, which are typical of gas

10, 000ft2 , which are not license-eligible. Chain stores are larger than independents,
but the majority (54.6%) are still below the licensure threshold.


I.C. Data on Liquor Prices and Quantities

Our data on liquor sales comes from two sources: the Nielsen Consumer Panel
and Retail Scanner Datasets hosted by the Kilts Center. The former comprises all
transactions for a revolving panel of 2,700 households in Washington State between
2010 and 2015. The latter includes product-level weekly prices and quantities of
liquor sold at a set of retail chains that partner with Nielsen (which account for
approximately 45% of spirits sales in Washington).
    Table 2 displays summary statistics for panelist households living in a ZIP code
with at least one store sized between 5, 000ft2 and 10, 000ft2 . This includes some
141 ZIP codes and 1,138 households. Note that only 10% of households live in a ZIP
code that had a WSLCB store under the state monopoly, but these panelists average
nearly 5.4 liquor retailers within their ZIP code after deregulation. To calculate
liquor consumption, we restrict attention to products in the Nielsen alcohol module
that also qualify under the WSLCB definition of liquor. See appendix C for details on

                                                                    7

sample construction. The summary statistics in table 2 reveal that liquor purchasing
is highly skewed across households. The average household spends only $6.00 on
spirits per month, but the standard deviation of expenditures is $31.35.
    The household data does not include information on products that are on store
shelves but are not purchased by Nielsen panelists. The Nielsen Scanner Dataset,
supplemented with data on retailer 5-digit ZIP codes, fills in this gap. Figure 2 plots
the distribution of annual quantity sold for each ZIP code × UPC combination in the
Consumer Panel Dataset and in the Retail Scanner Dataset. While many products
appear only once in the former, singleton sales seldom occur in the latter. In fact,
over 60% of products sell at least 30 units annually per store in the Retail Scanner
Dataset. Tis suggests that there are few products on shelves that are not transacted at
least once in a month.
     Two salient facts emerge from the Retail Scanner Dataset: first, there is little
variation in prices across stores, and second, variation in product assortment is sub-
stantial. Table 3 provides descriptive statistics about prices and product assortment
at these chains. To measure price variation for a particular UPC, we first calculate
its coefficient of variation (the average selling price at each outlet for a given year,
scaled by the standard deviation of this average price across outlets for that same
year). The average coefficient of variation across products and years is 9%, showing
that there is little variation in price relative to its level. Most of this variation is
across chains. The average within-chain coefficient of variation is 3%. These de-

                                                           8
scriptive statistics dovetail with findings in Adams & Williams (2019), DellaVigna
& Gentzkow (2019), and Hitch, Hortacsu & Lin (2019).


    In contrast, chains sell widely different assortments across retail outlet locations.
On average, chains sell 678 unique UPCs each year, but the average retail outlet sells
only 327. This figure varies substantially across outlets. The coefficient of variation
for the number of products sold annually is 47%. Even within chain, the coefficient
of variation for the number of products is 18%. Part of this heterogeneity could
results from differences in square footage across outlets within a chain. We therefore
investigate product overlap between retail outlets in the same chain. For each pair
of outlets in the same retail chain, we compute the fraction of the smaller outlet's
products (UPCs) that are also sold at the larger store. This calculation mitigates
concerns related to shelf space. If assortment simply expands with store size, then
this ratio should be one. It is zero if the intersection of the two assortments is empty.
The average overlap across chains is our sample is 81%, which means that one in
five products carried by a small store is not available at larger outlets. These findings
motivate our interest in understanding whether competition drives local product
assortment decisions.

 Notes: Based on the sales of 9 retail chains in the Nilesen Scanner data operating in Washington State May 2012 - December 2015. Coefficient
 of variation for price is the average across UPCs of the following quotient: standard deviation of price divided by its mean. To calculate the with-
 in chain coefficient of variation, we recalculate the CoV separately by chain and then report the average across chains. "Overlap - within Chain"
 is a measure of similarity between intenvtories of two stores within the same chain. For any two stores within the same chain, we calculate the
 share of the smaller store's inventory also carried in the larger store, and then average that measure across branches within the chain.




                                                     II. Empirical Strategy

Our estimation strategy leverages the discontinuity of license eligibility in store size
at 10, 000ft2 to identify the effect of market structure on outcomes. To establish
the power and validity of this strategy, we begin by documenting the effects of the
licensure threshold on individual firm's entry decisions. We then discuss our market-
level identification strategy and present evidence on the effects of the licensure
threshold on the number of entrants in a given location.


II.A. Firm-Level Entry Decisions

The basic model for estimating the effect of eligibility on entry is:

            1 [Liquor Licensed]s = 0 + 1 · 1 [SqF ts  10, 000]s + 2 · SqF ts                                                                       (1)
                                                  + 3 · 1 [SqF ts  10, 000]s × SqF ts +                                        s


where 1 [Liquor Licensed]s and SqF ts are a liquor licensure indicator variable and
the square footage of store s, respectively, and the model is estimated using only
stores in a neighborhood around the threshold. We are mainly interested in the
coefficient on 1 [SqF ts  10, 000]s , an indicator variable for square footage above
10, 000ft2 , which captures any change in the probability of licensure at that threshold.
Because these retail outlets were established years before the threshold rule was

introduced (and because there is no other regulation that induces a discontinuity in
retailer profits at 10, 000ft2 ), we argue that whether a particular outlet is above or
below the threshold is as good as random.
    One concern with this approach is that firms might game the licensure threshold,
for example by building an annex. This behavior would create a selection problem,
as only stores that can profitably sell liquor would expand. To test for manipulation
of square footage, we examine whether there is bunching above 10, 000ft2 . Table
A1 presents the results of a McCrary test (McCrary (2008)) for manipulation of the
running variable around the threshold. For all specifications, we cannot reject the
null hypothesis that there there is no discontinuity in the density of store square
footage at 10, 000ft2 at the 5% level.
    In appendix D, we also analyze whether retail outlet characteristics are balanced
around the licensure threshold, and whether retail outlets that are just below the
licensure threshold are differentially likely to expand their premises after 2012. We
find no differences along these margins. Overall, the results from these regressions
leave us confident in the validity of the exclusion restriction.
    A separate concern is whether stores just above 10, 000ft2 , which are marginally-
eligible, actually choose to sell liquor. For instance, large firms may deter entry
by marginal firms. Alternatively, marginally-eligible firms may face prohibitively
high wholesale costs from powerful upstream distributors. If the licensure threshold
does not bind, then we would not expect it to affect market structure or outcomes.

probability of licensure among outlets sized 10, 000ft2 + is approximately 40%, well
below full compliance. Furthermore, the likelihood of licensure is approximately
10 percent among retail outlets sized just below 10, 000ft2 , indicating that some
measurement error in square footage remains (as these retailers must, in fact, be
larger than 10, 000ft2 ).
    Figure 3 also plots the likelihood of liquor licensure separately for chain and
independent stores. Independents may behave differently than chains if spirits
sales involve substantial fixed costs. For example, chains may be able to exploit
established relationships with suppliers and distributors. Indeed, the discontinuity
for chain stores is 86 percentage points, statistically indistinguishable from perfect
compliance. This suggests that the licensure threshold forecloses chain retail outlets
6
    Appendix table A1 reports the coefficients.

                                                      12
that almost surely would sell spirits absent regulation. In contrast, independent store
licensure exhibits no evidence of a discontinuity at the threshold. Measurement error
does not appear to drive this result, as the licensure probability hovers around 10%
on both sides of the cutoff. Therefore, we conclude that the licensure threshold does
not exclude independent stores from spirits sales; rather, it is not profitable for these
marginally-eligible independent retailers to sell liquor. Among the few exceptions
that do, monthly revenues from spirits sales amount to a meager $1, 780 a month
(SD = $5, 759).7
    To quantify the effect of license eligibility on liquor sales, in table 4 we present
results obtained from estimating equation (1) using total liquor revenues in 2012 as
the outcome variable. We do not report results for independent stores because there
is no first-stage for this subgroup. For chain stores, the sales discontinuity is on the
order of $70, 000 for this period, or $10, 000 a month.


II.B. Market-Level Entry Decisions and Empirical Strategy

Our regression of interest analyzes how a purchasing outcome y for unit u (which
could be a household, retail outlet, or ZIP code) in month t changes with the number
of firms in u's ZIP code, denoted z (u, t):

                  yut = 0 + 1 · N Lz(u,t) + 2 · N L2
                                                   z (u,t) + Xz (u,t)  +   ut         (2)

where N Lz(u,t) is the number of liquor-selling retailers and Xz(u,t) includes market-
level control variables. The quadratic term for the number of liquor outlets allows
for diminishing returns to the number of competitors, as in Bresnahan and Reiss
(1991).
     Because the number of liquor retailers in a ZIP code is likely correlated with
demand and cost unobservables, we construct instruments for N Lz(u,t) and N L2     z (u,t)
inspired by the licensure threshold. In particular, we condition on the number of retail
outlets within a ZIP code sized 5, 000 - 15, 000ft2 , and then employ the number sized
10, 000 - 15, 000ft2 as an instrument. The essence of our identification assumption
is that unobserved demand and cost characteristics are similar between markets with
7
    Among independents retailers sized 10, 000ft2 -15, 000ft2 .

                                                    13
different numbers of retail outlets above and below the threshold, conditional on the
number of firms in the bandwidth. Any differences in outcomes across these markets
we therefore attribute to differences in the number of spirits retailers.
   The first stage regressions specify the number of liquor outlets in ZIP code z at
time t and its square as:

                          10-15                          10-15        15+
      N Lz(u,t) =0 + 1 · Nz (u,t) +               ~ i · Nz
                                                           (u,t) × 1 Nz (u,t) = i              (3)

                   +       k · 1   Nz (u,t)   =k +           j · 1 N z (u,t) = j +   z (u,t)

sized 10, 000 - 15, 000ft . Controls include indicator variables for Nz           (u,t) , the
                                                         2
number of chain stores sized 5, 000 - 15, 000ft , so that k is a fixed effect for
ZIP codes that had k beer/wine licensees sized 5, 000 - 15, 000ft2 in 2011. We
also include fixed effects for the number of large retail outlets (above 15, 000ft2 )
                        15+
in the ZIP code (Nz      (u,t) ). Finally, we allow for interactions between indicator
variables for the number of large retailers and the number of retailers just above the
              10-15
threshold (Nz  (u,t) ). These interaction terms exploit variation in how pre-determined
market characteristics mediate the effect of a marginally-eligible retailer, and provide
additional instruments.
    Results of these first stage regressions are presented in appendix A. As an
example, in ZIP codes without a large beer or wine outlet, shifting a firm from
just-below to just-above 10, 000ft2 leads to an additional 1.27 liquor retailers. We do
not report the full set of interactions out of space considerations, but the effects are
smaller in ZIP codes with retailers above 15, 000ft2 , consistent with crowd-out.
    In Appendix D we repeat the previous covariate balance exercise, but now
at the market level. Overall, we do not find significant differences across ZIP
codes with different numbers of retail outlets sized just above and below 10, 000ft2 ,
conditional on having the same number of stores in the bandwidth. This also holds
for characteristics of the Nielsen households living in these ZIP codes, including
their pre-privatization liquor purchases. We interpret these results as strong evidence
that the proposed instrument is not correlated with underlying liquor demand.

                                                  14
    One potential concern is that the instruments described above might affect market
outcomes through channels beyond the number of retailers. For example, shifting
a firm above the licensure threshold could elicit an entry deterrence response by
larger firms. In that case, the two-stage least squares exclusion restriction will not
hold. However, the reduced form is still valid; it captures the net causal effect
of license-eligibility on equilibrium outcomes. In what follows, we find that the
economic magnitudes of the reduced form results are in line with the magnitudes of
the two stage least squares results, so we do not revisit this point further. Results for
these reduced form regressions are presented in Appendix A.
    Finally, it is important to mention that while our regressions are specified at
the ZIP code level, our estimation procedure does not assume that consumers only
shop in their ZIP code or that the game being played by retailers is contained within
a single ZIP code. Instead, we study whether consumers and retailers respond to
exogenous variation at the ZIP code level. Our interest in ZIP code level effects is
motivated in part by earlier work that demonstrates that most consumers shop within
a few miles of home (Ver Ploeg et al. (2015)).


                          III. Effects of Market Structure

III.A. Price Effects

We first examine whether and to what extent increasing the number of retailers puts
downward pressure on prices. We begin by estimating equation (3) at the retail
outlet-level, so that the dependent variable of interest is the average price of liquor
products offered by retailer u in month t. In column 1 of table 5, we present the
results of this baseline regression. The point estimate implies that moving from 1 to
2 retailers increases average price by $0.635. This effect magnitude is small relative
to the average pre-tax price in our sample, which is approximately $19.
    This specification exploits variation in price across retailers and variation in price
across UPCs, confounding how competition changes the price of a given product
with how it changes product assortment. To sharpen the analysis, columns 2 and 3
progressively add retailer and UPC fixed effects. Across the board, point estimates
are small and statistically insignificant, revealing that prices do not respond to an

increase in local competition. Figure 4 plots the effect of increasing the number
of retailers on price under our preferred specification, which controls for UPC and
retail chain fixed effects. It highlights the precision of our estimates, which preclude
a $0.04 price reduction at the 95% confidence level.
    Columns 4 & 5 of table 5 examine prices for products purchased by Nielsen
panelists. Because panelists record purchases at all stores, they allow us to test
whether retailers that do not participate in the Retail Scanner dataset change their
prices in response to enhanced competition. Again, we detect no effect of competition
on prices. Taken together, these results are inconsistent with textbook models of
retail price competition, but conform to the predictions of newer models where retail
chains engage in uniform pricing across broad geographical zones.8


8
    To be clear, uniform pricing models predict low covariance between prices and competition at the
    local level, but they still allow for competition to affect prices if it changes the average demand
    elasticity faced by a retailer within a zone.

III.B. Product Assortment Effects

The null price effects that we estimate beg the question of whether and how retailers
compete on other margins, as in Berry and Waldfogel (2001) or Wollmann (2018).
We begin to answer by exploring whether firms strategically alter their product
assortments in response to competition. Specifically, we estimate equation (3) with
dependent variables that capture features of the product assortments offered by
retailers in 2015. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 present results using the number of
unique products sold at retail outlet u in month t as the dependent variable. Column 3
presents results using the number of unique products in a ZIP code as the dependent
variable. We label this column union as it corresponds to the cardinality of the
union of UPCs offered across all retail outlets within a ZIP code. Column 4, in
contrast, reports results where the intersection of the product assortments offered by
retail outlets within a ZIP code is the dependent variable. Finally, column 5 reports
results of the effect of market structure on the number of unique UPCs purchased by
panelists.
   Both at the retail-outlet and ZIP code level, we find that competition increases

product assortment. Figure 5 plots the marginal effects implied by the coefficients
in columns 2 (store level) and 3 (ZIP code level). Focusing on the retail outlet
effects, we find that increasing the number of liquor retailers from 1 to 2 increases
the average number of products offered per retailer by approximately 20 UPCs. This
increase corresponds to 7.1% of the average number of products carried across all
Nielsen retailers that sell spirits. As expected, the effect exhibits diminishing returns.
For example, moving from 4 to 5 liquor retailers results in an increase of 8.8 UPCs
(2.9%). At the ZIP code level, we find an increase of 159 UPCs (35.1%) when
moving from 1 to 2 retailers. As before, the effect decreases when shifting from 4 to
5 retailers to 90 UPCs (19.8%).
    These two results imply together that the difference between the total assortment
in the market and the average assortment in a store increases with the number of
firms (see Proposition 1 in Appendix E for a proof). This finding is consistent with
competition inducing specialization among retailers. To provide additional evidence
of differentiation, column 4 presents estimates of how the intersection of products
offered across retailers in a ZIP code changes in the number of firms; the coefficients
imply that the number of overlapping products (products that are carried by all
stores) falls with entry.
   Differentiation in product assortment may occur for two reasons: first, the
marginally-eligible retailer may stock products that are new to the market and second,

                                                        19
infra-marginal retailers (sized above 15, 000ft2 ) may change their assortments in
response to competition. Based on the revenue regressions presented in table 4, it
seems unlikely that marginally-eligible retailers account for the totality of the new
products available in the ZIP code because these retailers earn less than $10,000 per
month in revenue from spirits. This revenue figure suggests that marginally-eligible
firms offer a limited selection of liquors.
     We also formally test whether infra-marginal retailers adjust their product of-
ferings in response to exogenous shifts in competition. To fix ideas, consider a
market with one infra-marginal retail outlet and one potentially-eligible retail outlet
(i.e. sized between 5, 000 - 15, 000ft2 ). Assuming that both retailers enter when
eligible, this market becomes a duopoly (monopoly) when the potentially-eligible
retailer's square footage exceeds (lies below) 10, 000ft2 . Our test compares the
product offerings of the infra-marginal firm across these two scenarios. To this end,
corollary 1 in Appendix E demonstrates that a combination of the retail outlet- and
ZIP code-level estimates presented in table 5 delivers a test for the null hypothesis
that the infra-marginal firm does not change the number of UPCs it stocks in response
to competition. The test is built on the observation that if the infra-marginal firm
does not respond, then the sum of the marginal change in the union and intersection
should be twice as large as the change in the average retail-level assortment. We can
reject this hypothesis at the 1% confidence level.9
   To summarize, we find that increasing the number of retailers increases the
number of UPCs offered by individual retail outlet and in the market as a whole.
Further, retail outlets within the same market differentiate in response to competition.
These results are consistent with models such as Champsaur and Rochet (1989),
where competition expands the product space.
    As a robustness check, in column 5, we examine whether we can detect similar
responses in panelist purchasing behavior. The results are consistent with our earlier
findings; they indicate that a shift from monopoly to duopoly increases the number of
unique UPCs purchased by panelists by 0.12 products per month (an 80.7% increase).
In table A3, we also provide evidence on the types of products that retailers stock
when facing increased competition; our results indicate an increase in large-format

III.C. Quantity and Revenue Effects

To recap, our results indicate that increasing the number of firm broadens product
assortment without affecting prices. In this subsection, we explore effects on con-
sumption. Table 7 presents estimates of specification (3) with several measures of
quantity as the left-hand side variable.
    At the retail outlet level (columns 1 and 2), the evidence on quantities is incon-
clusive. The point estimates indicate an increase of 9.23% (255 liter) and 8.37%
(231 liter), respectively, when moving from monopoly to duopoly. However, these
effects are imprecisely estimated and the 95% confidence intervals include a null
effect. At the ZIP code (column 3) level, the estimates imply that duopolies sell
28% (712 liters) more liquor than monopolists, which is significant at the 5% level.
The increase is 8.55% (214 liters) when moving from 4 to 5 firms in the market.
Finally, at the household level (column 4) we find a 59% (0.16 liter) increase when
shifting from monopoly to duopoly, and a 26.5% (0.07 liter) increase of moving
from 4 to 5 firms. Taken together, our results indicate that liquor sales increases with
an additional retailer, but the average retailer does not necessarily sell more liquor.
    As a robustness check, in table 8, we repeat the previous exercise with monthly
revenues as the outcome variable. As before, we find that increasing the number of
retailers within a ZIP code increases market-level sales considerably: as shown in
column 3, we find a 25.4% ($35,130) increase in revenue from a shift from monopoly
to duopoly, and a 16.3% ($22,530) increase when moving from 4 to 5 firms. We
also estimate the effect on revenues using administrative data from the Washington
State Liquor Control Board, which comprises quarterly sales from all stores. This
data includes, but is not limited to, stores in the Nielsen Scanner Dataset. As shown
in column 4 reports, the estimates suggest a 51.1% ($260,860) increase in yearly
revenues of a shift from monopoly to duopoly, and a 15.3% ($77,920) increase when
moving from 4 to 5 firms. In contrast to the ZIP-code level estimates, the effect of
retail outlet-level revenues is modest. Columns 1 and 2 present results at the store
level, where the latter includes chain fixed effects. We find that revenues increase by
4.52% ($2,030) and 6.84% ($3,070), respectively, when moving from monopoly to

duopoly, and the effects are even smaller for markets with more firms.
    Why do consumers buy more liquor in markets with an additional retailer? First,
consumers enjoy a broader product assortment. Second, for some consumers, the
marginally-eligible retailer is more convenient than the infra-marginal retailer. In
the markets that we study, marginally-eligible retailers are on average quite close
to infra-marginal retailers; however, some consumers may place a large value on
one-stop shopping for liquor and groceries, so that even small changes in distance
could deliver large changes in utility (Seo (2016)).
    At first blush, the result that average revenues per retailer increase (albeit mod-
estly) is somewhat puzzling, as we would expect that marginally-eligible firms steal
business from infra-marginal firms. Recall, however, that infra-marginal retailers
expand their product assortment in response to competition. In appendix F we show
through a simple model the incentive for a retailer to carry fewer products as a
monopolist than it would when facing a competitor. Further, we demonstrate that
under fixed prices, the monopolist can simultaneously earn less revenue and higher
profits than when competing as a duopolist.
   Taken together, our findings caution against a narrow focus on price in studies of

market structure. This case study highlights two other channels, convenience and
product assortment, through which retail competition benefits consumers.

III.D. Consumer Welfare Effects

In this section, we expand on our previous results by estimating the change in
consumer welfare that arises from the increases in product assortment that we
document above. To fix ideas, under the assumption that all consumers purchase
weakly more spirits as the number of firms in the market increases, a shift from
monopoly to duopoly will affect consumer welfare through four channels:

   1. Increases in utility for consumers who do not purchase liquor under monopoly,
      but purchase under duopoly at the marginal retailer;

   2. Increases in utility for consumers who do not purchase liquor under monopoly,
      but purchase under duopoly at the infra-marginal retailer;

   3. Changes in utility for consumers who purchase spirits under both market
      configurations, but switch to shop at the marginal retailer under a duopoly;

                                                     23
          and

      4. Changes in utility for consumers who shop at the infra-marginal store under
         both market configurations.

    Note that by revealed preference, (1) and (2) necessarily increase welfare because
the outside option remains under both monopoly and duopoly - that is, consumers
can always elect not to purchase spirits. In contrast, welfare for (3) and (4) depend
on the composition of product assortments under monopoly and duopoly. Further,
observe that both product assortment and convenience contribute to welfare changes
for consumer types (1) and (3), while changes in product assortment alone affect
welfare for consumer types (2) and (4).
    Traditional demand estimation tools can be used to quantify welfare under these
four scenarios, but its application poses two chief challenges. First, it requires
defining choice sets for individuals; in contrast to our earlier analyses, we must
now take a stand on which stores are considered by each individual. Second, it
requires data on prices and product assortments at retailers that do not participate
in the Nielsen RMS dataset. To circumvent these challenges, we focus on nineteen
mass merchandizers in the Nielsen dataset that are located in ZIP codes with a
potentially eligible retailer (a retailer sized 5, 000 - 15, 000ft2 ).10 For simplicity,
we assume that consumers who shop at these stores do not consider purchasing
liquor elsewhere. We can then estimate demand at the outlet level, and calculate the
change in consumer surplus when the mass merchandiser in question faces N + 1
rather than N competitors. Note that this welfare change stems solely from changes
in product assortment, as the mass merchandiser is infra-marginal. That is, under
these assumptions we are able to estimate a combination of the welfare changes for
consumer types (2) and (4).
    To be concrete, we estimate a store level nested logit demand system by two stage
least squares (Berry (1994)) and calculate welfare for every store-week. The nests are
(1) Bourbon, Whiskey, & Scotch, (2) Rum, (3) Tequila, (4) Vodka and (5) other liquor
10
     Although we do not know the exact identity of each RMS store (beyond 5-digit ZIP code), we are
     confident that mass merchandizers are not marginal to the 10, 000ft2 threshold because of their
     format. Further, we found a null effect of our instrument on the number of mass merchandizers that
     sell spirits in a ZIP code (using specification (3)).

                                                   24
(such as Gin). Following Miravete et al. (2018)), we instrument for prices using
input prices. However, we hesitate to use the number of products within a nest as an
additional instrument despite its ubiquity in the literature. This instrument violates
the exclusion restriction if retailers tailor their product assortments to unobserved
demand shocks in the way they adjust assortments to local competition. Thus, we
turn to the licensure square footage threshold as a source of identifying variation.
We employ the number of stores sized 10, 000 - 15, 000ft2 as an instrument for
nest shares, as we have previously documented that this shifts product assortment.
Appendix G provides additional implementation details and estimation results. We
calculate expected welfare using the demand estimates, and employ this measure
as the dependent variable in equation 3 to identify the effect of market structure on
consumer welfare. Standard errors are computed by block bootstrapping the whole
procedure, with store-weeks as blocks. Reassuringly, our estimates imply an average
own-price elasticity of -4.02, which is similar to Miravete et al. (2020), who peg the
average elasticity at -3.75.
    Results, presented in table 9, indicate that competition increases welfare, al-
beit with diminishing returns. Our estimates imply that an exogenous shift from
monopoly to duopoly increases consumer surplus $0.80-$1.40/week, depending on
the specification ­ roughly 3.1-5.5% of the average price of a bottle of liquor in
Washington in 2015.11 For comparison, moving from four to five firms increases
welfare by $0.16-$0.37/week. While these results may appear unsurprising given
our results on quantities, under the assumptions laid out above, this welfare increase
stems solely from changes in product assortment. Thus, this simple model highlights
the importance of product assortment responses to changes in competition.


III.E. Effects on Adverse Behaviors

To round out our study of market structure in retail liquor markets, we turn to
understanding the implications of increased competition for social welfare. These
implications are hard to nail down because total welfare depends on how society
trades off consumption utility and the adverse effects of liquor consumption, such
11
     The average pre-tax price bottle of liquor is $18.82. Excise taxes include a 20.5% proportional tax
     and a $3.7708 per liter tax, so that the final price for a 750ml bottle is approximately $25.50.

as addiction or domestic abuse. Some of these adverse effects might occur in the
future and may be hard to trace back to licensure restrictions and variation in market
structure. Nonetheless, these social ills were the precise motivation for the 10, 000ft2
licensure threshold.12
    We adopt four approaches to shed light on these issues: first, we analyze the
identities of complier households. In particular, we investigate whether the presence
of an additional spirits retailer encourages teetotal households to purchase liquor or
instead increases purchasing among households that were already at the high-end
of the purchasing spectrum. Second, we study the relationship between market
structure and heavy drinking, as defined by the Center for Disease Control (CDC).
Third, we analyze whether changes in market structure increase liquor purchasing
at the expense of alternative types of alcohol (such as beer and wine or purchasing
spirits at restaurants and bars). And fourth, we study the relationship between market
structure and alcohol-related car accidents.

 Notes: Observations in column 1-5 are at the panelist-month level for May 2012 - January 2015, and standard errors are clustered at the zip
 code level. Observations in columns 5-7 are at the zip code level, and standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust. Severe accidents
 include: "Dead at Scene," "Dead on Arrival," "Died in Hospital" or "Suspected Serious Injury." 2.66L of alcohol is the CDC definition of heavy
 drinking for men. "Heavy" in column 2 refers to households above the 75th percentile in average per-person consumption January 2010-May
 2012. Instruments are interactions between the number of marginally eligible firms and indicator variables for the number of stores above
 15,000 ft2.




    To understand which households respond to an increase in the number of firms,
we classify Nielsen panelists according to their spirits purchasing behavior from
January 2010 through May 2012­before privatization. Households are deemed
"non-drinkers" if they never purchase liquor and "heavy drinkers" if they are in the
top quartile of households in per-person ethanol purchases (among households who
buy liquor at least once). For each group, we separately estimate the effect of market
configuration on the likelihood of purchasing spirits using specification (3).
    Column 1 in table 10 reports results for the full population. Compliers are 5.8
percentage points more likely to purchase liquor each month in duopoly compared
to monopoly markets, and 2.8 percentage points more likely when moving from 4 to
5 firms. The effects for heavy drinking households are 14.8 percentage points and
5.1 percentage points, respectively. Finally, the effects for non-drinking households
are negligible. Clearly, the response is concentrated among the households who
purchased the most liquor before privatization.
    Market configuration appears to operate on the intensive margin, which is con-
cerning if it leads to excessive drinking and alcohol-related fatalities. To quantify
whether this is the cause, in column 4 of table 10 we study whether entry affects
the likelihood a household engages in heavy drinking, as defined by the CDC. 13
13
     Heavy drinking is classified by the Center for Disease Control as more than 15 drinks per month

                                                                      27
Results indicate that households in duopoly markets are 5.6 percentage points more
likely to engage in heavy drinking than those in monopoly markets. The effect is 2.6
percentage points when moving from 4 to 5 firms. We consider these to be sizable
effects.
    A corresponding reduction in beer and wine purchasing or a reduction in con-
sumption at bars could mitigate any adverse effects of higher spirits purchasing. In
column 5, we use the same Nielsen data to study beer and wine purchases, and find
no evidence of a change in response to the liquor licensure threshold. In column 8,
we estimate equation (3) using the number of bars operating in the zip code as of
January 2013 as the outcome variable, and also find noisy effects. While this last
regression is admittedly under-powered, it does not support either of these stories.
    Finally, we obtain a comprehensive dataset of alcohol-related accidents from
the Washington State Department of Transportation to directly examine whether
liquor market configuration affects car accidents. For every accident between 2010
and 2015, we observe location, date and time, as well as the sobriety level and any
resultant injuries. One challenge is linking accident locations to purchase locations;
we observe the ZIP code where an accident occurred, not the ZIP code where a driver
purchased liquor. We therefore estimate a modified version of equation (3) at the ZIP
code level, where the number of accidents in that ZIP code is the dependent variable.
Coefficient estimates for the number of firms and its square are economically small
and statistically insignificant. The estimates imply that a shift from monopoly to
duopoly does not change the likelihood of an accident at all.


                                      IV. Conclusion

This paper examines how market outcomes vary with the number of competitors,
a central question in Industrial Organization. We establish causality using a quirk
of Washington state's deregulation of liquor sales in 2012. Before 2012, only state
stores could sell spirits, although private retailers sold beer and wine. At privatization,
these retailers could apply for a spirits license, but only if their premises exceeded

 for adult men. We calculate whether a household's purchasing per adult member of the household
 exceeds this limit. https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/pdfs/excessive alcohol use.pdf

10, 000ft2 . This threshold leads to differences in the numbers of spirits retailers
across otherwise similar ZIP codes, which we exploit in an RD-inspired research
design.

    A first finding is a null effect of market structure on price, which contravenes
textbook models of competition but squares with a burgeoning literature on uniform
pricing in US grocery retail. Rather than compete in prices, our findings suggest that
firms compete by adjusting their product assortments. We find that an exogenous
shift from monopoly to duopoly broadens the product assortment of the average
retail outlet by 7% and the market-wide assortment (pooled across all RMS retailers
in the ZIP code) by 35%. Estimates from a stylized model of spirits purchasing
suggest that this wider assortment increases consumer surplus on the order of $3.20
per month, roughly 12% of the average price of a bottle of hard liquor.

    Our results have implications for antitrust analysis, cautioning against a narrow
focus on price that may significantly understate the consumer benefit of enhanced
competition. More broadly, models of retail competition that impose optimal pricing
while ignoring the assortment margin may poorly approximate how these markets
function. Finally, our findings speak to the success of Washington's licensure
threshold as an instrument to mitigate the negative externalities associated with
liquor consumption. Curbing entry does indeed reduce consumption, albeit only in
relatively concentrated markets. Even in these markets, where consumers are less
likely to engage in heavy-drinking, we observe no reduction in alcohol-related car
accidents. An important caveat, however, is that our findings speak to the marginal
effect of entry. Removing the licensure threshold altogether would constitute a much
larger shock to market structure. As an example, the current threshold forecloses
convenience stores, including 242 7-Eleven outlets. Perhaps it is unsurprising that
Costco, whose stores average 140, 000ft2 , spent $22 million on advertising to support
an incarnation of the referendum with this particular entry requirement.14
