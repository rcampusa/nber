                                            ABSTRACT

Does Japanese trade in manufactured goods differ from the rest-of-the world average and from the

U.S.? We use a simple industry-level gravity model and 1981-1998 data to answer this question. We

construct a measure of normalized imports by dividing bilateral industry-level imports by the

importer's aggregate absorption and the exporter's industry output. We find that Japan imports less

than other countries, but also exports less than other countries. Relative to the U.S., Japanese export

performance is half as strong today as it was in the mid-1980s. Bilaterally, Japan’s normalized

imports from the U.S. are greater than U.S. normalized imports from Japan.

1. Introduction
Japan is one of the world's great trading nations, accounting for 7.5% of
world merchandise exports in 19992. It is also one of the world's great
savers, with a cumulated current account surplus of over 1.6 trillion dollars
since 19773. Japan's export success combined with its frugality means that it
runs large trade surpluses, most notably with the United States, and these
surpluses have in the past been a source of political tension between the U.S.
and Japan. Many in the U.S. have claimed that Japan artificially keeps out
U.S. exports while taking advantage of the open U.S. market (see, for
example, Johnson et. al. 1989).
       While such mercantilist thinking makes little sense to economists, the
large and persistent trade imbalances between the U.S. and Japan have been
of interest to researchers, including Lawrence (1987), Leamer (1988),
Saxonhouse (1989), and Harrigan (1996). Most of the earlier literature on
Japan's openness looked at the mid-1980s, when the dollar was
exceptionally strong and U.S. manufacturing was struggling as a result. In
this paper we return to the question of Japan's openness, and ask, how does
Japan's trade differ from "normal"? We define "normal" with reference to a
simple and flexible model of bilateral trade, the gravity model, which has
been widely used by trade analysts. Using the model, we perform a detailed
but straightforward analysis of industry-level trade and production for a
group of OECD countries between 1981 and 1998, and reach some
surprising conclusions:
1. Japan does import less than most countries, including the U.S...

2. ...but Japan also exports much less than most countries, including the
   U.S.
3. Focusing on the U.S.-Japan bilateral relationship, we find that after the
   mid-1980s, Japan's relative export performance has been consistently
   weaker than that of the U.S.
4. As a result, far from finding evidence of Japan being closed to U.S.
   exporters, we find that the U.S. is comparatively closed to Japanese
   exporters.
       Our results have important implications for the policy debate. Many
analysts (most notably Svensson, 2001) have argued that Japan needs a large
nominal depreciation of the yen to rescue it from deflation. Such a nominal
depreciation would lead to an at least temporary real depreciation, which
would boost net exports to the U.S. The political risks of pursuing a weak-
yen policy are among the excuses given by Japanese policymakers for not
adopting Svensson's proposal. Our analysis suggests that such an adjustment
is warranted by the fundamentals of supply and demand for industrial
production in the two countries, since in a well-defined sense the U.S.
imports "too little" from Japan while Japan imports "too much" from the
U.S.
2. Methodology
Nobody is surprised that Germany exports more manufactured goods than
Uganda, nor does anybody suggest that Saudi Arabia's trade surplus in crude
oil is due to unfair Saudi restrictions on imports of oil. Similarly, no one
thinks that the small volume of imports by Iceland compared to France is
due to greater French openness. The perceived normalcy of such trade
patterns is rooted in basic notions of supply and demand: Germany exports a
lot of manufactured goods because it produces a lot of manufactures; Iceland

                                        2
doesn't import much because it has a small GNP; Saudi Arabia doesn't
import oil because it doesn't need any, etc.
        We believe that such common-sense reasoning can be applied to more
subtle questions about trade patterns. Since the purpose of our paper is to see
if Japan's trade is "different", we need a benchmark for "normal" trade. We
begin with an extremely simple benchmark for imports:
        micd = scyid                                                      (1)
where
        micd = the nominal value of imports of industry-i products by country
        c from country d
        sc = country c's share of world expenditure
        yid = country d's nominal output in industry i.
Equation (1) states that the value of imports is proportional to the exporting
country's output, with the factor of proportionality given by the importer's
country size. Microfoundations of (1) as the equilibrium of a free-trade
model are available from Helpman and Krugman (1985), Eaton and Kortum
(2002), and others, but the economic logic could not be simpler: imports
depend on supply (exporter output) and demand (importer size). Re-writing
(1) slightly gives normalized imports Mˆ icd as
                m
        Mˆ icd = icd = k                                                  (2)
                Ac yid
where Ac is country c's aggregate absorption (GDP minus the current
account surplus) and k is a constant (equal to the inverse of world GDP).
Note that by controlling for the level of industrial output, equations (1) and
(2) implicitly take account of anything that influences output, such as
relative factor supplies, technological differences, and economic policy.



                                        3
      Common observation and reams of statistical evidence show that
transport costs influence trade patterns, with (ceteris paribus) trade flows
decreasing in the distance between trading partners. This effect of distance
probably includes more than simple transport costs, and may reflect
differences in tastes, communication and coordination costs, and other trade-
impeding effects that increase with distance. The recent gravity literature
(for example, Deardorff 1998 and Harrigan 2002) emphasizes the
importance of relative as well as absolute distance between a pair of
countries (the simplest intuition comes from thinking about the example of
trade between Australia and New Zealand: these two countries trade a lot,
despite the great distance between them, at least in part because both are so
far from all their other trading partners). As shown by Harrigan (2002)
among others, the effects of relative and absolute distance in a standard
gravity model can be captured very simply with country intercepts and
information on distance:
       log Mˆ icd = γ c + γ d − σ log d cd                                  (3)
where the γ's are coefficients on indicator variables for country c as an
importer and country d as an exporter respectively, and σ is the elasticity of
trade with distance.
      A final consideration is that (3) implicitly asserts that the volume of
trade is the same for all goods. This is obviously an oversimplification, since
some goods and services are nontradeable (restaurant meals, hotel rooms)
while others are highly traded (transport equipment - see below for evidence
on this). A simple (if ad hoc) way to account for such product-level
heterogeneity is to introduce product-specific intercepts γi into (3):
       log Mˆ icd = γ i + γ c + γ d − σ log d cd                            (4)


                                              4
As discussed in Harrigan (1996), the product-specific intercepts γi can be
derived from a model of differentiated goods and home bias in demand,
where the degree of home bias differs by products. In the absence of
product-specific intercepts, (3) can be summed over industries i to give the
aggregate gravity equation which has served as the basis for innumerable
studies. As we show below, however, there are big differences across
industries in the share of goods that are traded internationally, suggesting
that aggregate gravity equations are misspecified.
      Equation (4) has two interpretations. The first is that equilibrium
imports depend not just on importer size and exporter output but also on
product characteristics and geography. The second interpretation is purely
descriptive, and regards the intercepts γ and the distance elasticity σ as
reduced form parameters that describe how actual imports differ from the
free-trade benchmark given by (2). Such differences might be due to
geography, national trade barriers, comparative advantage, or any other
unmeasured influences on trade which are country or product specific.
      An alternative way of describing deviations from the free-trade
benchmark is to add industry and country-pair intercepts to (2):
       log Mˆ icd = γ i + γ cd                               (5)
Equation (5) does not include a control for bilateral distance since such
effects are controlled for by the country-pair intercepts. It is more general
than (4) in the way that it allows bilateral factors to influence trade.
3. Data analysis
Our approach in the rest of the paper is to use equations (4) and (5) as a basis
for discovering how Japan's trade differs from that of the rest of the world.
This is a strictly reduced form, descriptive question, and we are not



                                        5
interested in any hypothesis other than "is Japan different?" This is a modest
goal, but a sensible answer to this question must precede any more in-depth
analysis of Japan's trade performance.
      We use a large database on industry output and bilateral imports,
primarily within the OECD, from 1981 to 1998. The data is assembled by
the World Bank, and is available from their website4. Our study builds on
the work of Harrigan (1996) in two ways: first, we include measures of
distance in (4), and second, we look at a long time series rather than a single
year (Harrigan (1996) looked only at 1985). We estimate (4) and (5) using
least squares, ignoring any endogeneity between trade, output, GNP and any
other unmeasured variables for the simple reason that our questions are
reduced form rather than structural questions.
      Table 1 lists the 26 3-digit ISIC industries and 24 countries used in the
analysis, although not all industry data is available for all countries for all
years. The countries include most of Japan’s major trading partners,
including the Asian Tigers of Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, but exclude
China. Figure 1 shows that the sample includes between 60 and 75 percent
of Japan’s trade in manufactured goods for most of the sample. The figure
also illustrates the growing importance of China as a source of imports, but
not as an export destination. Table 2 shows our first major finding, which is
the great heterogeneity across sectors in the share of industry output that is
traded. The table reports total bilateral imports within a group of countries
divided by total gross output within the same group; since the ratios exclude
imports by countries for which we have no output data, it is biased down as
a measure of total trade. Table 2 shows that Food is the least-traded large
industry, with less than 5 percent of output entering international trade (keep



                                         6
in mind that this category excludes raw agricultural products). The
machinery sectors (ISIC 382 to 385) are highly traded, with between 15 and
25 percent of output traded by 1993. The influence of tastes and transport
costs are clearly evident: Printing and Publishing (where language is key) is
the least traded sector, with (very heavy) cement second from the bottom.
There is also a clear upward trend in tradeability in most sectors between
1981 and 1993 (1997 is not comparable because of missing data for three
large countries). For our purposes, though, the main point of Table 2 is
heterogeneity: countries may differ in their aggregate trade-GDP ratio
merely due to a different composition of output.
         Table 3 shows our estimates of equation (4) for various years from
1981 through 1998. The dependent variable is normalized imports, as
defined in equation (2): gross imports divided by the importer's aggregate
absorption and the exporter's industry output. Normalized imports are
regressed on bilateral distance and importer, exporter, and industry fixed
effects for each year from 1981 to 1998. In each cross-section regression, the
U.S. is the excluded importer and exporter fixed effect, so each reported
fixed effect measures the proportionate difference with the U.S. The results
for Japan are summarized in Figures 2 and 3, and tell a simple story:
controlling for country size, industry output, bilateral distance, and industry
fixed effects, Japan imports much less than the U.S. does, but also exports
much less than the U.S. On the import side, Japan's openness to imports is
around 40 percent of the U.S. level, with not much change over the sample.
As an exporter there is a striking trend: in the mid-1980s, Japan was
exporting about 60 percent as much as the U.S., but this relative success

                                           7
deteriorated steadily until, by 1998, Japan was exporting just a quarter as
much as the U.S.
      As an aside, Table 3 contains some surprising results on the
importance of distance for trade. The distance estimates are illustrated in
Figure 4, and show no trend: the elasticity of trade with respect to distance is
-1.25 in the latter half of the 1990s, and this is not significantly different
from the level in 1981. So much for the death of distance.
      Table 3 is striking evidence that, after controlling for country size,
distance, and industry composition in a simple way, Japan is not a very open
country, if openness is taken to mean the share of output which is exported
and the share of consumption which is imported. But such a measure of
openness is not directly germane to the politically sensitive question of
bilateral trade imbalances. Figure 5 illustrates the U.S.-Japan manufacturing
trade balance, which has been consistently negative. Is this imbalance partly
due to Japanese import barriers (either explicit or implicit)? We address this
question by estimating equation (5), which regresses log-normalized imports
on product and country-pair fixed effects. The estimated country-pair effects
control for influences on bilateral imports that are specific to that importer-
exporter pair, such as average transport costs, import barriers, and taste
differences. There are two parameters estimated for any pair of trading
partners c and d, one each for c as an importer from d (λcd) and for d as an
importer from c (λdc). This suggests a natural test for bilateral symmetry in
the trading relationship: is λcd equal to λdc? This can be interpreted as a test
for trade balance in normalized imports, and answers the question: once
supply, demand, and common bilateral factors have been controlled for, is
there any difference in bilateral openness between c and d?



                                         8
      Table 4 reports the results of such a symmetry test for the U.S. and
Japan in each year of the sample. Equation (5) is estimated separately each
year using all available data for that year. The table reports the difference
between the fixed effect for U.S. imports from Japan and the fixed effect for
Japanese imports from the U.S., λUS,Japan - λJapan,US ; this is then transformed
by exponentiating the difference and subtracting one to give the
proportionate difference between U.S. imports from Japan and Japanese
imports from the U.S. The null hypothesis of equal bilateral openness is
tested using a t-test, and the results are graphed in Figure 6. Strikingly, in no
year is Japan less open to the U.S. than the U.S. is to Japan. The point
estimates for the mid-1980s suggest that Japan was slightly less open to the
U.S. than vice versa, but this difference is never statistically significant. A
decade later, however, the point estimate is that the U.S. is half as open to
imports from Japan as Japan is from the U.S., and this difference is
statistically significant from zero at the 10% level. In short, controlling for
industry output and country size, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in
manufactures with Japan!
      This is not a result that sits easily with the raw data of Figure 5, which
shows a large and persistent bilateral U.S.-Japan trade deficit in
manufactures. What accounts for our results? Two things:
1. Japan has a manufacturing sector which is larger as a share of GDP (24
   percent in 1988) than the U.S.'s (16 percent). This means that Japanese
   supply of manufactured goods is proportionately larger than U.S. supply.
2. Japan has large and persistent current account surpluses (3 percent of
   GDP in 1998), while the U.S. has large and persistent current account
   deficits (-2.5 percent). This means that the U.S. has a proportionately
   larger demand for manufactured goods than does Japan.

                                        9
These two factors together mean that normalized U.S. imports from Japan
are larger than normalized Japanese imports from the U.S. Actual U.S.
imports as a share of normalized imports are smaller than Japanese
normalized imports as a share of actual imports, and this is what accounts
for the results showing a "normalized" U.S. manufacturing trade surplus
with Japan.
4. Conclusions
This paper has addressed the question of its title using a lot of data and a
little bit of economics. We defined normalized imports as bilateral imports
adjusted for supply (exporter output) and demand (importer absorption).
Normalized imports are equilibrium imports in a free-trade model of trade in
differentiated goods such as that developed in Helpman-Krugman (1985),
but the motivation for such a normalization is nothing more than basic
supply and demand.
      Our results are striking. We confirm the conventional wisdom that
Japan imports relatively little, and verify the less-well known fact that Japan
exports relatively little - indeed, compared to the U.S., Japan's export
performance has been deteriorating for more than 15 years. Turning to the
perennially contentious U.S.-Japan bilateral relationship, we find that Japan
is more, not less, open to imports from the U.S. than the U.S. is to imports
from Japan.
