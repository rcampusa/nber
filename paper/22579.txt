The Derivation of Discount Rates with an Augmented Measure of Income.

                                            ABSTRACT

Most developed economies invest in public goods such as national defense, education,
infrastructure, and the environment. Expenditures on public projects entail a diversion of funds
away from investments in private capital. Discount rates used to evaluate such projects should
reflect the rate of return on the current mix of investment opportunities. The present paper derives
discount rates using an augmented measure of national income inclusive of non-market goods.
The discount rate reflects three key factors: the productivity of private capital, the opportunity
cost of direct expenditure on public projects, and the returns to public investment that accrete
outside of the market boundary. The difference between this social rate and the market rate
depends on the latter two factors. In the first empirical calculation of discount rates in this setting,
the paper reports that, in the U.S. economy, the difference between augmented and market
discount rates amounts to 1.24 percent from 1999 to 2002 and under 1 percent from 2002 to 2011.

Introduction.

Most developed economies invest in public goods such as national defense, education,
infrastructure, and the environment. Holding total investment fixed, expenditures on
public projects entail a diversion of funds away from market consumption or
investments in private capital. Such projects are often evaluated using Net Present
Value (NPV) analysis. The appropriate discount rate with which to evaluate public
projects must reflect the rate of return on social investment opportunities (Baumol,
1968). This provides the relevant benchmark against which NPV conclusions are drawn.
A government is likely to hold a mix of positions in private capital and a direct stake in
public projects. Calculating returns on such a portfolio requires the rate of return on
private capital and the yield on investments in public goods. Evaluation of the former
depends on readily available market data. Critically, determining the latter may
demand data that lies beyond the market boundary. Measuring only those returns to
public good investments that accrue within the market may produce biased estimates of
the yield on public projects. This bias would, in turn, manifest in the social discount rate.
In light of this, the present paper suggests using an augmented measure of income to
evaluate both market and non-market returns. This facilitates estimating an appropriate
social discount rate and conducting meaningful NPV analysis for public projects.

Economists tend to base estimates of the discount rate used in NPV calculations on
interest rates in financial markets, the rate of return on private capital, or the utility-
neutral rate of savings (Gollier, 2011). Despite these rather crisp recommendations,
estimating the social discount rate has long-occupied economists (Steiner 1959; Marglin,
1963a; 1963b; Baumol, 1968; Bradford, 1975; Mendelsohn, 1981; Weitzman, 1994). More
recently, the economics of climate change has rekindled the debate surrounding the
appropriate discount rate (Stern, 2007; Nordhaus 2007). While not proposing to settle
ongoing discussions regarding the “right” social discount rate, the present paper offers
a fresh perspective on this topic by deriving discount rates for public projects using an
augmented measure of national income inclusive of non-market goods. This tack


                                               2
permits expenditure on public goods to both (1) reduce the rate of return on saving by
diverting funds away from private capital (which earns a rate of return that is known
and measurable within the NIPAs), and, critically, (2) to affect the level of public goods
and services, which then, in turn, permutes augmented output. When calculated in such
a framework, the discount rate reflects three key factors: the productivity of private
capital, the opportunity cost of direct expenditure on public projects, and the returns to
public investment that accrete outside of the market boundary. The social rate is
compared to the more conventional return on private capital to show under what
conditions these rates differ and how.

This paper employs an analytical framework based on the National Income and Product
Accounts (NIPAs). The NIPAs are a widely-used and internationally accepted approach
to tracking economic activity (USBEA, 2007). By construction, they do not encompass
economic activity that occurs outside the market boundary. (Though the tools
developed in this paper apply to a range of non-market entities, because of the specific
empirical application that zeroes-in on environmental externality, the discussion here
focuses on this area.) 1 Using the empirical NIPAs and the Ramsey rule, private or
market discount rates for the United States (U.S.) economy from 1999 to 2011 are
estimated. Then an integrated assessment model is used to calculate pollution damage
and augmented discount rates for the U.S. economy over the same time period.

The analytical modeling in this study builds on the approach to distilling discount rates
from a NIPA framework developed by Weitzman (1994), who explored differences
between market rates of discount and rates that reflect the diversion of some investment
to pollution abatement expenditure. Intuitively, expenditures on maintaining
environmental quality necessitated by binding policy constraints effectively ratchet
back gains from saving (and, hence, the discount rate) because some of the returns from


1
 Broadly, the literature refers to environmental quality and natural resources as natural
capital and it is straightforward to extend the concepts raised herein to investments in
these other areas (see Heal, 2009; 2012; Maler, Aniyar, Jansson, 2008).
                                             3
investment in private capital are diverted to abatement. This result, reported by
Weitzman (1994), is a clear elicitation of the need to employ an augmented measure of
output in the presence of external economies; because a market-centered accounting
framework does not allow environmental damage to directly affect income, abatement
can only adversely affect the return to savings and lower the discount rate. This
approach assumes that abatement expenditure (investment in public goods) is less
productive than investment in private capital simply because the returns to investment
manifest outside the scope of income in the NIPAs. More broadly, if the outcome
measure does not include the services generated by a public good, then investments
made by society in such a good will appear to be unproductive. In marked contrast, the
present paper employs an income measure that includes non-market goods. This
enables one to more comprehensively calculate the rate of return on investments in
environmental quality, and hence, to more appropriately characterize the social
discount rate.

The paper also empirically estimates damages from air pollution and greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions in the U.S. from 1999 to 2011. Air pollutants included in the empirical
analysis are: fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx),
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ammonia (NH3). The air pollution damages
are estimated using an integrated assessment model (IAM) that is calibrated to the U.S.
economy over this 12 year period. The damages are computed by first estimating
pollutant-and-source-specific marginal damages, and then multiplying these pollution
“prices” times reported emission “quantities”. Thus, Gross External Damages (GED) are
computed in a manner that is directly analogous to how market indices such as GDP
are calculated (Nordhaus, 2006; Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, 2011). The IAM used
has been widely applied in peer-reviewed studies (Holland et al., 2015; Muller, 2011;
2014a; 2014b; Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, 2011; NAS NRC, 2011; Michalek et al.,
2011). The particular parameter values and assumptions that are embodied in the IAM
are quite standard and are discussed at length in section III.


                                             4
The inclusion of 2011, the most recent year for which comprehensive emissions
estimates are provided (USEPA, 2014), comprises the first post-Great Recession
observation of air pollution damage. The addition of this data year is an extension
relative to prior related research (Muller, 2014b). This in an especially important update
to prior work in the field because of the dramatic realignments and structural changes
that manifest in the U.S. economy after the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent
downturn.

The damage estimates are then subtracted from GDP to calculate a measure of adjusted
output. Growth in this augmented measure of output is computed and compared to
market growth. Using the Ramsey formula (1928) the paper estimates the difference in
discount rates that rely on market relative to augmented output.

       a. Summary of Key Results.

The national accounting approach is used to derive expressions for three discount rates:
market, environmental, and augmented discount rates. The market rate is simply the
rate of return on private capital. The “environmental” rate is derived by including an
explicit characterization of abatement expenditure in the accounting identity (Weitzman,
1994). It is the rate of return on capital less the drag due to diversion of investment
returns from output to abatement. If more output yields more abatement, the
environmental rate is lower than the market rate.

The augmented discount rate is derived by including both abatement and
environmental pollution damage into the national income identity. The augmented rate
is the rate of return on capital minus the partial effect of income on damages and
abatement. If we assume that additional output yields more abatement, then in an
economy with damages that rise with income, the augmented discount rate is less than
the market rate. All else equal, rising damages place a drag on augmented growth
(Muller, 2014a; 2014b). This effect reinforces the drag from abatement.



                                              5
In contrast, in a growing economy with falling damage, the effect of damages works
against the drag due to abatement. Since growth is enhanced by the attenuation of
damage the augmented discount rate will exceed the market rate if additional output
produces less additional abatement than damage reduction. In the case where more
output generates a greater expenditure on abatement than reduction in damage, the
augmented rate will fall short of the market rate.

The analytical model also reveals that for the idealized case of an economy subject to
efficient pollution control, the augmented discount rate will equal the market rate. The
drag on investment due to diversion of funds to abatement is exactly offset by the
reduction in damage. Since these two factors cancel out, we are left with the marginal
productivity of capital as the appropriate discount rate.

The empirical section of the paper reports that Gross External Damages (GED) from air
pollution and GHGs amounted to $770 billion in 1999 and that this fell to $423 billion in
2011, in real terms. Expressed relative to GDP, GED fell from 8.4 percent of output in
1999 to 3.6 percent in 2011. Thus, damages fell both in absolute and relative terms.
Connecting these empirical results back to the analytical results discussed above, the
U.S. economy exhibited an inverse relationship between the magnitude of national
income and pollution damage over the 12 year period covered by this analysis.

Employing reported GDP and the pollution damage estimates noted above, the
difference between augmented and market growth rates ranged from 0.6 percent (1999
to 2002) to 0.3 percent (2002 to 2011), (Muller, 2014a; 2014b). Employing a simple
characterization of the spread between augmented and market discount rates derived
using the Ramsey formula, along with a value of two for the elasticity of the marginal
utility of income, the difference amounts to 1.24 percent from 1999 to 2002. The
divergence then falls to under 1 percent for the remaining years under study. The social
discount rate exceeds the market rate because damage was falling over this time period.

       b. Related Literature.

In addition to the early literature on the social discount rate (Steiner 1959; Marglin,
1963a; 1963b; Baumol, 1968; Bradford, 1975; Mendelsohn, 1981), this paper builds on a
few areas of the more recent environmental economics literature. First, Weitzman (1994)
explores how discount rates are affected by including an explicit representation of
expenditures on pollution abatement in a national income accounting framework.
Importantly, Weitzman (1994) holds the level of environmental disamenity fixed
between two time periods. In the present paper, damages change endogenously based
on output, abatement levels, and the responsiveness of environmental quality to
abatement effort. This more flexible approach highlights that the difference between
market and augmented discount rates may be positive or negative depending on if and
how damages change. When damages are constant, as in Weitzman (1994), the
difference in the discount rates reduces to the opportunity cost of diverting savings
away from productive capital to abatement.

The paper also relates to the literature on endogenous discounting (see Epstein and
Hynes, 1983; Das, 2003; Le Kama and Schubert, 2007). Within this literature, Six and
Wirl (2015) explore endogenous discount rates with a focus on climate change. In
particular the authors assume that discount rates fall as environmental quality
decreases, and they derive steady state outcomes associated with this case. In contrast,
the present paper does not ex ante conjecture a relationship between environmental
pollution damage and discount rates. Rather, this paper permits damages to increase,
decrease, or remain fixed. Further, the present analysis allows society to choose
abatement investments which endogenously affect damages and, in turn, discount rates.
Thus, the Six and Wirl (2015) study focuses on a subset of relevant cases whereas the
current paper presents a more general analysis that permits damages to vary with both
output and abatement.




                                             7
Heal (2009) explores measures of growth in the Ramsey formula over a disaggregated
measure of consumption. The impetus for this disaggregation is the distinction between
conventional consumption goods and a measure of natural or environmental capital.
Heal (2009) notes the possibility that one type of consumption (market, for instance)
may increase while another (environmental services) may fall. The correspondence of,
or relevance to, the present paper is obvious. However, the main thrust of Heal’s (2009)
work lies in (i) distinguishing multiple types of consumption, and (ii) the nature of the
elasticity of substitution between natural and man-made capital.

One implication of the analytical modeling conducted herein is a variable term structure.
This relates to the literature focusing on declining discount rates (Weitzman, 2001;
Cropper et al., 2014). The paper also is linked to the work of Gollier (2008) who
explores the implications of uncertainty in future economic growth for the
determination of discount rates.

Another connection to the literature manifests in the area of environmental accounting.
Specifically, the calculation of air pollution and GHG damages builds on several papers
(Muller and Mendelsohn, 2009, Levy et al., 2009). The inclusion of such damages into an
augmented accounting system connects to earlier papers including: Bartelmus, 2009;
Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, 2011; Muller, 2014a. Estimation of augmented growth
rates links to Muller, 2014a; 2014b. There is also a literature exploring the idea of
inclusive wealth which is basically defined to augment conventional notions of wealth
with various measures of natural capital (Polasky et al., 2015). Aside from the obvious
conceptual connection to the present paper, the findings from this literature seem to
indicate that augmented measures of output decline relative to the market analogs. It is
perhaps noteworthy that the present analysis reports measures of augmented output
that grow more rapidly than market output.

The remaining sections of the paper include the following. Section I. which lays out the
structure of the analytical model and derives various expressions for the discount rates,


                                              8
and section II. which introduces the empirical model and data sources. Section III.
reports empirical results and IV. concludes.

      I.      Analytical Models.

This section proceeds in two parts. First, a national income accounting framework is
used to derive market, environmental, and augmented discount rates. These rates are
then compared and the differences are expressed in terms of the parsimonious structure
of the income accounting identity. Next, the Ramsey (1928) formula for discount rates is
used to derive an expression for the difference between augmented and market
discount rates that is directly applicable to the empirical section of the paper based on
available data.

              a. Discount Rates in the National Income Accounting Framework.

This section uses a national income accounting framework to derive three discount rates:
a market rate, Weitzman’s “environmental rate”, and an augmented rate based on an
augmented measure of output inclusive of pollution damage. In the market accounts,
without damages or an explicit treatment of pollution abatement, the (market) return to
savings manifests only through conventional channels: the productivity of private
capital, (1 + 𝑟) > 1. Next, in replicating Weitzman’s (1994) environmental discount rate,
some of the return from savings is diverted to abatement. So the augmentation in this
case is partial; abatement is in effect a distinct category of investment. And third, an
accounting framework that is inclusive of abatement and environmental damage is
constructed and used to derive the augmented rate of return on savings. The key
distinction between this third approach and the prior two (and the literature) is that the
latter permits the allocation of savings to abatement to reduce environmental harm.

The derivation proceeds in the following steps 2.

      1) Implement a shock to investment (savings) in period (t), denoted 𝜀𝑡 .

2   The mathematical appendix displays these steps more explicitly.

                                                     9
    2) In the market account, track savings through output (Yt).
    3) In the partial augmentation which includes abatement, track savings, through
        output, to abatement.
    4) In the fully augmented account, track savings, through output, to abatement and
        environmental damage.
    5) Solve for the income balancing level of consumption in all three accounts.
    6) Subtract consumption without savings from consumption with savings and
        divide through by 𝜀𝑡 in all three accounts.

Like Weitzman (1994) and ultimately Solow (1956), output is expressed in terms of one
commodity. Further, this homogeneous output (Yt) is expressed in terms of the
standard accounting identity 3 shown in (1).

𝑌𝑡 = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡                                                                             (1)


where:
      Ct = consumption of market goods.
      𝐼𝑡 = 𝐾𝑡 − 𝜆𝐾𝑡−1 : net investment in physical capital, where λ is the depreciation of
             physical capital.
      Gt = government expenditure.
      Xt = net exports.


Next, the standard framework is augmented in two ways that are pertinent to the focus
on environmental externality. Let At represent investment in environmental quality,
natural capital, or more specifically, expenditure on abatement of pollution. This is
defined as a linear function of income: 𝐴𝑡 = 𝛾𝑌𝑡 , where (0 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1). This extension is
shown in (2).

𝑌𝑡 − 𝛾𝑌𝑡 = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡                                                                       (2)



3
 In a Solow (1956)-type framework, output at time (t), denoted Yt, is expressed as a function of capital (Kt)
and labor (Lt). The thrust of the present paper, augmented measures of output, does not require the use of
a particular production function with distinct arguments for Kt and Lt.

                                                    10
Rather than a true augmentation of costs and benefits external to the market, (2) really
just separates 𝛾𝑌𝑡 from Ct or Gt. That is, expenditures on abatement (and, generally,
investments in natural capital) typically occur within the market boundary in the form
of investment in either physical capital or clean inputs.

The second extension features the inclusion of environmental damage in the expression
for income. Damage, or degradation of natural capital, is modeled as a linear function of
income and abatement: 𝐷𝑡 = 𝛼𝑌𝑡 − 𝛽(𝛾𝑌𝑡 ). The (𝛼) parameter represents the pollution-
intensity of output, while the (𝛽) parameter reflects the sensitivity of environmental
damage to investment in abatement. Mechanically, damage increases proportionally to
output through (𝛼), and decreases with income through investment in abatement (𝛾). A
large (small) value of 𝛽 suggests reducing damage requires relatively less (more)
investment in abatement. The partial effect of output on environmental damage,
𝜕𝐷𝑡
      = 𝛼 − 𝛽𝛾, depends on the difference between pollution intensity (𝛼) and the
𝜕𝑌𝑡

product of the propensity to spend on abatement (𝛾) and the effect of such expenditure
on environmental quality (𝛽). These two effects from income growth balance when
    𝜕𝐷𝑡                               𝛼
�         � = 0, which occurs if: 𝛾 = 𝛽.
    𝜕𝑌𝑡


With (Dt) characterizing environmental damage 4 in time (t), environmentally-adjusted
output is shown in (3).

𝑌𝑡 (1 − 𝛾 − 𝛼 + 𝛽𝛾) = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡                                             (3)

             a. Savings, and changes to income, abatement, and damage.

Expressions (4a) through (4c) show how savings propagate through the three different
characterizations of income in expressions (1), (2), and (3).

4
 It is important to emphasize that the augmentation of the market accounts manifests as
a deduction for damage due to environmental pollution. While there are many natural
capital-oriented adjustments that could be made to national income such as the value of
natural resources in situ, the paper is motivated by prior empirical evidence specifically
reporting monetary damages from pollution so that is the focus here.
                                              11
Output in period t, with an incremental increase in investment, denoted (𝜀𝑡 ) is shown in
(4a). Savings in productive capital yields (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 which is added to output.

𝑌𝑡 + (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡                                              (4a)

In (4b), the shock to income (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 boosts output and abatement expenditure.
Collecting terms results in:

�𝑌𝑡 + (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 �(1 − 𝛾) = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡                                    (4b)

Expression (4c) uses the augmented accounting identity in (3) to demonstrate how
investment affects environmental damage in addition to abatement. Collecting terms on
the left-hand side yields:

�𝑌𝑡 + (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 �(1 − 𝛾 − 𝛼 + 𝛽𝛾) = 𝐶𝑡+1 + 𝐼𝑡+1 + 𝜀𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡                       (4c)

         b. Derivation of discount rates.

The approach used to derive discount rates in the market accounts solves for
consumption with savings, using (4a), and without savings, using (1). Subtracting (1)
from (4a) yields the change in consumption (ΔC) due to savings: ∆𝐶 = (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 − 𝜀𝑡 .
Then dividing through by (εt) produces the familiar market rate of return on savings:
the marginal productivity of capital investment:

𝑖 𝑚 = (1 + 𝑟) − 1 = 𝑟.                                                               (5a)

Repeating this procedure with the accounts that recognize abatement yields:

                                             𝜕𝐴
𝑖 𝑒 = (1 + 𝑟) − (1 + 𝑟)𝛾 − 1 = 𝑟 − (1 + 𝑟) � 𝜕𝑌𝑡�.                                   (5b)
                                               𝑡



The increase in output, (𝑌𝑡 + (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 ), triggers additional abatement. Differencing (2)
from (4b) just with respect to abatement yields: 𝛾�𝑌𝑡 + (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 − 𝑌𝑡 � = 𝛾(1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 .
                                                     𝜕𝐴
Provided the reasonable assumption that 𝛾 = � 𝜕𝑌𝑡 � ≥ 0: (5b) ≤ (5a). In (5b), the −(1 +
                                                      𝑡

𝑟) � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� term reflects the opportunity cost of investment in abatement. These are the

                                              12
foregone returns from capital investment. This cost lowers the effective discount rate
relative to the marginal product of capital. This is akin to the “drag” term identified by
Weitzman (1994).

Thus far, channeling savings to pollution control is not productive because damage lies
beyond the scope of income in (1) and (2). The augmented measure of income (3)
accommodates pollution damage, and therefore, allows for abatement to yield returns
through changes in damage. Solving for ΔC in the augmented accounts framework of (3)
and (4c), and then dividing through by the savings shock (εt) produces (5c), the
augmented discount rate.

Intuitively, the rate of return to savings in the augmented accounts depends on the
partial effect of income on both abatement and environmental damage. As in (5b), the
shock to output increases abatement by 𝛾(1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 . However, in the augmented
accounting framework, the change in output from savings also changes damage:
𝛼(𝑌𝑡𝑐 + (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 − 𝑌𝑡𝑐 ) + 𝛽𝛾(𝑌𝑡𝑐 − 𝑌𝑡𝑐 − (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 ) = (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 (𝛼 − 𝛽𝛾). This is simply the
boost to output from savings times the partial effect of output on damages. The analysis
next compares these rates.

       c. Comparing the discount rates.

In this section, the focus is on the comparison between the market rate and the
augmented rate. Other comparisons are found in the appendix. Subtracting (5a) from
(5c), yields:

                        𝜕𝐷       𝜕𝐴
 𝑖 𝑎 − 𝑖 𝑚 = −(𝑟 + 1) �� 𝜕𝑌𝑡� + � 𝜕𝑌𝑡��.                                         (6)
                           𝑡       𝑡



The difference is comprised of both the partial effect of output on damage and
abatement. Mechanically this manifests because the market accounts (and, therefore, the
market discount rate) incorporates neither abatement nor damage. Whether abatement

                                              13
increases, decreases, or remains fixed with respect to income depends on social
preferences. Whether and how damages change with income depends on the intensity
of abatement expenditure (𝛾), the responsiveness of the environment to abatement (𝛽),
and the pollution intensity of output (𝛼). Although there are many combinations of
    𝜕𝐴           𝜕𝐷                                    𝜕𝐴
� 𝜕𝑌𝑡� and � 𝜕𝑌𝑡�, this discussion assumes that � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� ≥ 0. Then, in an economy with
      𝑡           𝑡                                     𝑡

damages that increase with income, (6) is unambiguously negative. In this case both
increasing abatement and rising damages attenuate the gains from savings. Thus, the
market rate exceeds the augmented rate 5.

In a setting where damages fall with output the sign of (6) depends on the relative
                       𝜕𝐷               𝜕𝐴
magnitudes of � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� 𝑎𝑛𝑑 � 𝜕𝑌𝑡�. The diversion of savings to abatement produces a drag
                           𝑡             𝑡

on the returns to investment. Falling damages counteract this effect because damage
itself is a drag on output. Thus, reductions in this non-market cost will, ceteris peribus,
enhance output. The comparison between the augmented discount rate and the market
rate hinges on which of these two effects dominates.

          d. Comparison of discount rates with efficient pollution control.

If an idealized economy were subject to efficient pollution control, it is well-known that
marginal abatement cost equates to marginal damage. In the present modeling context,
                 𝜕𝐷            𝜕𝐴
the terms � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� 𝑎𝑛𝑑 � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� reflect marginal pollution damage and marginal abatement
                  𝑡             𝑡

cost of additional output, respectively. Efficiency requires that the opportunity cost in
                                                                       𝜕𝐴
terms of foregone consumption due to investment in abatement, � 𝜕𝑌𝑡�, will just balance
                                                                         𝑡

the benefit of pollution reduction (the avoided environmental damage from one more

                                                  𝑡                                  𝑡

the �� 𝜕𝑌𝑡� + � 𝜕𝑌𝑡 �� term in (6) equals zero. At the margin, additional investment in

abatement produces a cost in terms of foregone consumption that is just balanced by
damage reduction. Thus, if pollution is efficiently regulated, the market and social
discount rates converge 6.

         𝜕𝐷        𝜕𝐴
If − � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� = � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� holds, then one can solve for the corresponding abatement intensity (𝛾)
           𝑡         𝑡

which is given by: 𝛾 = 𝛼�(𝛽 − 1). This expression is instructive in that it suggests three

dimensions of intuitive behavior related to abatement choice in the case of optimal
regulation of pollution. First, abatement is increasing in damage intensity of output (𝛼).
Second, 𝛾 is only positive if 𝛽 > 1. And, 𝛽 > 1 implies that for each unit of money spent
on abatement, damages fall by more than one unit of money. This also seems plausible
as a rational society probably would not invest in abatement if, for each dollar spent, it
is getting less than that back in environmental quality improvements. Third, as 𝛽
                            𝜕𝛾
increases, 𝛾 falls:           �𝜕𝛽 = − 𝛼�(𝛽 − 1)2 .That is, as the environment becomes more (or

                                                                                     𝜕𝐷   𝜕𝐴

condition falls (or rises).

Three results from the analytical model bear summarization. (1) While the literature
shows that investments in pollution control come at some opportunity cost, the
augmented measure of income recognizes that rerouting savings to abatement yields
benefits through reduced external costs. (2) The augmented discount rate may exceed or
fall short of the market rate. With non-negative investment in abatement, the difference
in rates depends on both the sign and the magnitude of the partial effect of output on
damage. (3) In an efficient pollution control regime, ia = im. This latter finding confirms
that the present formulation is in accord with the well-known result that, if an economy




6   This assumes that pollution externality is the only distortion in the economy.

moves along its optimal path, the social discount rate will equal the marginal
productivity of capital (Gollier, 2011).

        e. Discount Rates in the Context of the Ramsey Formula.

This section relies on the Ramsey (1928) formula to derive a discount rate based on
augmented income growth and to compare that with the rate based on market growth.
A secondary purpose is to serve essentially as a robustness check for section II. Because
of the relative parsimony of Ramsey (1928), this section provides a nice segue to the
empirical analysis which uses the formulation in (10) below to estimate the difference
between the market and augmented discount rates.

    The familiar Ramsey (1928) formulation is shown in (7).

𝑟 𝑅 = 𝜌 + ηg                                                                                (7)

The parameters in (7) assume their conventional meanings with ρ = the pure rate of time
preference; η = the elasticity of the marginal utility of income; g = annual, per capita
income growth. In the following (g) is replaced with a slightly more explicit
representation of income growth to facilitate a comparison between market and
augmented income 7. Thus, (8), relies on market income, where (Yt) denotes national
income in time period (t).

               𝑌𝑡+1 −𝑌𝑡
𝑟𝑚𝑅 = 𝜌 + η �             �                                                                 (8)
                  𝑌𝑡


Expression (9) employs the augmented measure of national output: (𝑌𝑡 − 𝛼𝑡 𝑌𝑡 ), where
𝛼𝑡 represents pollution damage intensity of output. Therefore, 𝛼𝑡 𝑌𝑡 = 𝐷𝑡 .

               (𝑌𝑡+1 −𝛼𝑡+1 𝑌𝑡+1 )−(𝑌𝑡 −𝛼𝑡 𝑌𝑡 )
𝑟𝑠𝑅 = 𝜌 + η �                                    �                                          (9)
                              𝑌𝑡 −𝛼𝑡 𝑌𝑡




7 The decomposition of growth into market output and pollution damage, or degradation of natural
capital, is akin to the characterization of growth over a vector of goods proposed in Heal (2009). In that
framework, Heal specifies consumption of market goods and services and natural capital. Heal (2009)
then permits growth rates to vary over these categories.

                                                     16
Then, taking the difference by subtracting (8) from (9) yields:

                    𝑌𝑡+1 (𝛼𝑡 −𝛼𝑡+1 )
Δ = 𝑟𝑠𝑅 − 𝑟𝑚𝑅 = η         �          �                                                 (10)
                     𝑌𝑡       1−𝛼𝑡


This expression reveals a few important relations. First, the pure rate of time preference
does not factor into the difference. Hence, views regarding the appropriate choice of the
pure rate of time preference based on positive versus normative positions held by the
analyst are irrelevant to the divergence in rates due to using market or augmented
income (Arrow et al., 1995). Second, the difference is increasing in η and in the gross
rate of change in market income. Third, the difference depends on the change in
pollution intensity between the time periods over which growth is reported, and how
the money value of environmental damage compares to aggregate output in the base
period.

The augmented discount rate will exceed the market rate provided the following two
conditions hold. First, the money value of environmental disamenity is less than output
in the base period: 𝛼𝑡 < 1. This seems likely to hold in many modern economies 8.
Second, pollution intensity is falling: 𝛼𝑡 > 𝛼𝑡+1. If pollution intensity is rising (and
𝛼𝑡 < 1) the augmented discount rate will fall short of the market rate.

Conversely, in severely degraded environments such that (1 − 𝛼𝑡 ) < 0, if pollution
intensity is falling, the augmented rate will fall below the market rate. If (1 − 𝛼𝑡 ) < 0,
and pollution intensity is rising, the discount rate tabulated using augmented income
growth will exceed that computed using market income.

The next step is to synthesize the results from the Ramsey framework with the national
accounting approach. Recall from (6) that the difference between augmented and
                                                       𝜕𝐷
market discount rates is inversely related to � 𝜕𝑌𝑡�. Expression (10), indicates that the
                                                        𝑡



8For example, the empirical section of the present analysis reports that, even as far back as 1999,
pollution and GHG damages amounted to under 10 percent of GDP in the U.S. Further, in Muller,
Mendelsohn, and Nordhaus (2011) a small fraction of industries were reported to have GED in excess of
value-added.

intensity suggests a higher augmented rate.

It is expected that both modeling frameworks suggest that the partial effect of income
on environmental pollution damage is central to the difference in the discount rates
because the augmentation to the market accounts is focused on damage. However, the
consistency in how damages affect the discount rates is reassuring. Rising damage
intensity over time (in the Ramsey model) and a positive partial effect of output on
damage (in the national accounting model) both imply augmented discount rates that
are lower than market rates. Conversely, damage intensity that falls over time and a
negative partial effect of output on damage suggest augmented rates that exceed
market rates. Hence, the differences between (6) and (10) come from the structure or
specification of the modeling framework.

The next section of the paper discusses the data and empirical modeling. Further,
section III. shows how the empirical model is calibrated to the U.S. economy.

      II.      Empirical Model and Calibration to U.S Economy.

This section calibrates the parameters in the Ramsey formula to the U.S. economy over
the period 1999 to 2011. Expression (10) is used to approximate the difference between
augmented and market rates. Many different data sources are required to execute this
calibration. Required are estimates of market output (GDP), the elasticity of the
marginal utility of income, and pollution damages.

The empirical analysis relies on economy-wide Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reported
by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (USBEA, 2014) and accompanying GDP
deflators. For environmental damage, empirical estimates of damages from local air
pollutants (GED) are produced using the AP2 model 11 (Holland et al., 2015; Muller,
2011; 2014a; 2014b, Jaramillo and Muller, 2016), which is an updated version of the
APEEP model (Muller and Mendelsohn, 2007; 2009; Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus,
2011; NAS NRC, 2010; Michalek et al., 2011). The AP2 model is an integrated
assessment model (IAM) for local air pollution that covers the following five pollutants:
ammonia (NH3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), fine particulate matter
(PM2.5), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). The model tracks emissions of these
pollution species that are reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) for the following years: 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011 (see USEPA, 2002; 2005;
2008; 2011; 2014). Emissions are reported by source type (mobile versus stationary, for
instance) and by the county of release.

An air quality model in AP2 converts emissions into annual average pollution
concentration estimates for each county in the contiguous U.S. Specifically, the model
employs a series of source-receptor matrices that characterize the effect of an
incremental emission (one ton, say) from source (j) on air quality in receptor county (i).
There are distinct matrices for each emitted pollutant and for four different source
classifications: ground-level emissions and point source emissions from 3 different
effective height classes. Ground-level emissions encompass discharges from vehicles,
households, and small commercial facilities without an individually monitored
smokestack. Point sources are divided into those with an effective height of emissions of
less than 250 meters, 250 – 500 meters, and those over 500 meters. The last category
consists of 656 of the largest industrial air pollution sources in the lower-48 states. Most
of these are fossil fuel fired power plants. The predictions of the air quality model in


11
  The current analysis consists of a mix of empirical results reported in prior papers (Muller, 2014b) and
new results for the most current model year (2011).

AP2 have been tested against ambient pollution monitors maintained by the USEPA.
(See Jaramillo and Muller, 2016 for the most recent diagnostic tests of AP2.)

With predicted concentrations, the model computes population exposures in each
county. This is accomplished using population estimates provided by the U.S. Census
Bureau (Census, 2015). Exposures to other sensitive “receptors” are also modeled.
Specifically, yields of crop and timber species that have been shown to be adversely
affected by local air pollution (USEPA, 2011) are gathered from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA, 2015) at the county level. Population and USDA data are gathered
for each model year.

Converting exposure into physical effects (cases of illness, tons of crop yield lost) relies
on dose-response or concentration-response functions. Paramount among these are the
functional relationships between adult mortality rates and exposure to PM2.5 and
tropospheric ozone (O3). The adult mortality-PM2.5 link is modeled using the function
reported in Pope et al., (2002), and for O3 exposure the results from Bell et al., (2004) are
used. These are fairly standard assumptions in the air pollution damage measurement
literature. Baseline incidence data is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC, 2015), and, as above, these data are provided for each modeled year.
Thus, as population size, spatial distribution, and vitals change, the model picks this
evolution up.

Each damage endpoint (health effects, crop and timber loss, etc.) are then converted to
monetary equivalents. For market effects (like crop and timber yields) current market
prices are used. For impacts on services not traded in markets, mortality risk for
example, values reported in the non-market valuation literature are employed. So, to
value changes in mortality risk due to differential pollution exposure, the AP2 model
employs the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) approach (Viscusi, Aldy, 2003). This is a
standard tack, and the particular VSL used herein is also typical: about $6 million (in
year-2000 USD).


                                             20
        a. Computing Marginal Damage and Integration into the National Accounts.

Because the damages from air pollution are ultimately integrated into an augmented
accounting system, the approach to estimating aggregate damages reflects the approach
to tabulating the gross value of production embodied in GDP. That is, total damage is
the product of emissions (quantity) times marginal damage (loosely, the price of
emissions). This approach is recommended in the environmental accounting literature
(Nordhaus, 2006).

Marginal damages are computed using the algorithm first developed and applied by
Muller and Mendelsohn (2007; 2009). This entails the following steps. First, for a given
time period (say, 2011) baseline emissions reported by the USEPA are processed
through the AP2 model to compute concentrations, exposures, physical effects, and
monetary damages. The baseline gross damage number is stored. Next, one ton of one
pollutant, PM2.5 for example, is added to baseline emissions from source (j). The AP2
model is re-run and new concentrations, exposures, physical effects, and money
damages are tabulated. The difference between the new damage figure and the baseline
gross damage constitutes the marginal ($/ton) damage for source (j) emissions of PM2.5.
This is captured in (11).

where: 𝐷𝑟,𝑡,𝑠 = damage in county (r), time (t), exposure to pollutant (s) after adding one
ton of pollutant (s) to baseline emissions.
  𝑏
𝐷𝑟,𝑡,𝑠 = damage in county (r), time (t), exposure to pollutant (s), conditional on baseline
emissions.
R = total number of receptor counties.


Note that the marginal damage is a spatial sum over receptor counties subsequent to
the additional ton emitted by source (j). The AP2 model then cycles through the
remaining (N = 9,983) sources and five pollutants to produce a total of 50,000 source-



                                             21
and-pollutant-specific marginal damage estimates for each of the five years covered in
the analysis.

Total damages, or GED, are computed as the product of emissions and marginal
damages, matched by source and pollutant. This is depicted in (12) which shows that
economy-wide GED is the sum across pollutants (S), sources (J), and sectors (I).

𝐺𝐸𝐷𝑡 = ∑𝐼𝑖=1 ∑𝐽𝑗=1 ∑𝑆𝑠=1 𝐸𝑗,𝑖,𝑡,𝑠 × 𝑀𝐷𝑗,𝑖,𝑡,𝑠                           (12)

In time period (t) the empirical estimate of the coefficient of pollution intensity in the
                            𝐺𝐸𝐷
Ramsey model is: 𝛼𝑡 = 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑡. The empirical analog to expression (3) is produced by
                               𝑡

subtracting the GED from GDP as shown in (13), where EVA denotes environmentally-
adjusted value added (Muller, 2014a; 2014b).

𝐸𝑉𝐴𝑡 = 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑡 − 𝐺𝐸𝐷𝑡                                                      (13)

        b. Damages from greenhouse gas emissions.

The damages from greenhouse gases are estimated using an analogous price times
quantity approach. This involves the application of a Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)
estimate which is essentially the present value of damage caused by emitting one ton of
carbon dioxide (CO2). The AP2 model is not a device that can compute the SCC. As such,
the analysis turns to recent meta-analyses for SCC estimates. In particular, the SCC
value reported by the U.S. Federal Government’s Inter-Agency Working Group on the
Social Cost of Carbon is used. The SCC is about $35/ton CO2. This SCC is multiplied
times emission estimates for the entire U.S. economy, because, unlike emissions of local
air pollutants, the damage from emissions of CO2 is independent of the location of
emission. Thus, one marginal damage is applied to all emissions.

        c. Deflation and Real GED.

Market macroeconomic aggregates are deflated using the GDP deflators reported by the
USBEA. GED is deflated using the techniques reported in Muller (2013). This entails the

                                                22
estimation of pollution specific fixed base (2005) price deflators. The pollution price
deflators assume the Fisher index form (see Muller, 2013). Real GED is:

                                                   𝑓
𝐺𝐸𝐷𝑡 = ∑𝐼𝑖=1 ∑𝐽𝑗=1 ∑𝑆𝑠=1 𝐸𝑗,𝑖,𝑡,𝑠 × (𝑀𝐷𝑗,𝑖,𝑡,𝑠 (𝑃𝑡,𝑠 )−1 )                      (14)

            𝑓
where: (𝑃𝑡,𝑠 ) = Fisher pollution price index for pollution species (s) at time (t).




    III.    Results.

The results section proceeds as follows. Part a. focuses on the macroeconomic
aggregates relevant to the study. These include GDP, GED, and the EVA measures.
Section b. focuses on the calculation of discount rates using the Ramsey formulation
generated in section II. Next, c. explores the implications of discount rates for discount
factors applied to future costs and benefits. Finally, part d. examines the GED when
calculated without GHGs. This isolates the relative effects of local air pollutants and
GHGs on the discount rates reported herein.

            a. Macroeconomic aggregate indices.

Table I summarizes some of the central empirical data that are subsequently used in the
model to estimate discount rates for the time periods under consideration. Column (1)
reports real GDP from 1999 to 2011. These results show that real GDP increased from
1999 to 2011. GDP is reported in three-year increments because this comports with the
years for which emission data are available and hence damage estimates are provided.
Column (2) shows the GED estimates (inclusive of both air pollution and greenhouse
gases). In 1999, GED amounted to $768 billion. The GED fell throughout the five years
under study. In 2011, GED was $423 billion which is just over one-half of GED in 1999.
Column (3) presents the augmented measure of output which is defined as GDP less
GED. The augmented output measure increased from $8.4 trillion in 1999 to $11.4




                                                       23
trillion in 2011. GDP, GED, and the augmented measure of output are shown in
appendix figure A1.

Column (4) reports the pollution intensity of output. Table I indicates that pollution
damage intensity fell from 1999 to 2011. In 1999, GED comprised over 8 percent of
market output. This metric declined to 6.7 percent in 2002, 6 percent in 2005, and then
just under 5 percent in 2008. Following the Great Recession, in 2011 the combined
monetary value of air pollution and greenhouse gas damage amounted to 3.6 percent of
total output. Figure A3 in the appendix shows the linear decline in pollution intensity in
the U.S. economy.

Table II reports the annualized rates of growth in GDP, GED, and the augmented
measure of output, EVA. The top panel of table II reports growth in absolute terms
whereas the bottom panel displays per-capita growth rates. Beginning with the top
panel of table II, annualized real GDP growth ranged between 1.2 and 2.8 percent. Note
that the annualized growth rate was lowest between 2005 and 2008 as the U.S. economy
approached the Great Recession. In contrast, annualized GED growth was consistently
negative. From 1999 to 2002 GED fell by 4.9 percent. From 2002 to 2005 GED growth
became less negative (-1.5 percent), and then from 2005 to 2008, GED fell by over 5
percent (Muller, 2014b). Between 2008 and 2011, GED fell by 7.5 percent on an
annualized basis. Because GED growth was less than GDP growth, EVA expansion
exceeded that of GDP. Specifically, column (3) of table II shows that growth in the
environmentally-augmented indicator outpaced market output 12 by between 0.6% and
0.3%.

The bottom panel of table II reports per capita growth rates. In terms of GDP,
normalizing by population ratchets back the rates of growth. GDP growth ranged from
0.2% to 1.9% over the time period under examination. In contrast, per-capita GED

New to this analysis is the finding that the spread between market and augmented
growth maintained at 0.3% from 2008 to 2011.
                                            24
growth fell by more than absolute GED growth. The per-capita EVA measure, like GDP
grew more slowly than absolute EVA. The difference, however, that expressing the
macroeconomic aggregate indices in per-capita terms exerts on the spread between
market and EVA growth rates is quite modest.

          b. Discount Rates.

Table III reports the discount rate analysis using the Ramsey formula. Note that (𝑟𝑠𝑅 )
denotes the augmented discount rate derived using augmented growth, whereas (𝑟𝑚𝑅 )
reflects the rate derived using market growth. For all values in table III, the pure rate of
time preference is set to 0.02. The first three columns (on the left-hand panel of the
table) assume that the elasticity of marginal utility with respect to income is 2. The
difference between the market discount rate and the augmented or augmented rate is
shown in the third column.

Employing growth estimates from 1999 to 2002, the difference between the augmented
discount rate and the market rate is 1.24 percentage points. The difference falls to 0.58
percentage points for 2002 to 2005. This convergence occurs because the difference in
growth (augmented less market) fell from 0.6 percent over 1999 to 2002 to 0.3 percent
from 2002 to 2005 as reported in table II. The augmented and market discount rates
differ by 0.77 percentage points from 2005 to 2008. And this divergence increases to
nearly 0.9 percent from 2008 to 2011. Since the other parameters in the Ramsey formula
(η, δ) are held fixed, the difference in discount rates is driven entirely by the difference
in growth rates.

In the Ramsey formulation, the spread between discount rates depends on the elasticity
of the marginal utility of income. As such, the right-hand panel of table III explores the
sensitivity of the gap between discount rates to two different values of (η). With (η = 1),
the gulf between the augmented and market discount rates shrinks to range from 0.62
percent (1999-2002) to 0.29 percent (2002 to 2005). The rank ordering of differences with
respect to time remains the same. Predictably, by setting (η = 4) the dissimilarity

                                             25
between the two rates grows. From 1999 to 2002, the differences increases relative to the
base case with (η = 2) to 2.48 percentage points. For each of the remaining time periods,
the gap between the rates exceeds 1 percent. Using growth estimates from 2008 to 2011,
the spread between the rates is over 1.75 percentage points.

           c. Implications for Discount Factors.

Figure I shows the results from a set of hypothetical calculations intended to
characterize how the difference between the augmented discount rate and the market
discount rate affect present value calculations. Specifically, these calculations report the
present value of $100 million (in either costs or benefits) at time (t), where (t) ranges
from zero to 100 years in the future. The discount rate value used to generate the figures
correspond to eta = 2, and the years 1999 to 2002. Figure I shows that the discount
factors begin to diverge significantly about twenty years in the future (t =20). The
dotted line plots the ratio of the present value computed using the augmented rate to
the present value computed using the market rate. This ratio falls steadily from unity at
t = 0 to 0.5 at about t = 50. At t = 100, the ratio is about 0.30. Thus, the present value of
$100 million occurring 100 years in the future computed using the augmented discount
rate is just 30% of that calculated using the market rate. While the calculations in this
example rely on a hypothetical $100 million future value, they are illustrative in
showing the drastic difference in present value stemming from the use of the two
different discount rates.

Figure II conducts a similar exercise to figure I. However, the thrust of figure II is the
exploration of different values of eta. The solid black line replicates the dotted line in
figure I. That is, it uses results for the case where eta = 2. The dashed line in figure II
employs eta = 4. In this case the present value of $100 million occurring 100 years in the
future computed using the augmented discount rate is just 10% of that calculated using
the market rate. Further, the dashed line presents the results for eta = 1. Using this
parameter value, the present value computed using the augmented discount rate is just


                                              26
under 60% of that calculated using the market rate. One conclusion that is readily
apparent given the results in figures 1 and 2 is that present value calculations over long
time horizons (like what one might encounter in the context of GHGs) are very sensitive
to the choice of whether to employ a market or an augmented discount rate.

          d. The Contribution of Local Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gases.

Table IV compares the macroeconomic aggregate indices, the GED and EVA, for the
case without GHGs to the default approach reported in table I which includes both
types of pollution. Intuitively, excluding GHGs from the analysis lowers GED and
raises EVA in all time periods. Beginning in 1999, GED excluding GHGs amounts to 77%
of GED inclusive of both GHGs and local air pollutants. The share falls to 72% in 2002,
70% in 2005, and 66% in 2008. In 2011, damages from just local air pollution amounted
to about 63% of damages from both GHGs and local pollution. The share of the GED
from local pollutants fell from 1999 to 2011. However, local pollution still contributed
nearly two-thirds of GED in 2011. Conversely, GED from GHGs began in 1999 at $179
billion. GHG damage increased to $190 billion in 2005 before falling to $155 billion in
2011. Damage from GHGs dropped by 16 percent from 2008 to 2011.

Table IV indicates that EVA with only local air pollution damage counted in GED was 2%
higher than EVA with both local pollution and GHGs counted in GED in 1999 through
2008. In 2011, EVA inclusive of only local air pollution was just 1.4% higher than EVA
with both GHGs and local pollutants in GED. Between 1999 and 2011, pollution
intensity fell from being about 2 percentage points lower without GHGs to 1.3
percentage points lower.

Table V displays the effect of excluding GHGs on the spreads between the augmented
and market discount rates from 1999 to 2011. For the case in which eta is set to 2, the
differences are on the order of 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points. However, this difference is
sensitive to eta. For example, with eta set to 4, the difference in discounts rate for 1999-
2002 is over 0.2. Both tables 4 and 5 reveal that (i) most of the GED is due to local air

                                             27
pollutants, and (ii) the impacts on growth and discount rates are mostly due to local air
pollution damage.

   IV.    Conclusions.

Many societies around the world invest in public goods which necessitate a diversion of
funds away from market consumption or investments in private capital. Evaluation of
such projects often relies on NPV analysis. In principle, the appropriate discount rate in
an NPV calculation should reflect the rate of return on the current mix of investment
opportunities. Estimation of such a rate depends on market data (to compute the
opportunity cost of capital) and it may also depend on data that lies beyond the market
boundary if public investments affect external costs or benefits. The present paper
derives discount rates for public projects using an augmented measure of national
income inclusive of non-market goods. The estimated discount rates reflect three key
components: the productivity of private capital, the opportunity cost of direct
expenditure on public projects, and the returns to public investment that accrete outside
of the market boundary. Though the specific empirical application zeroes-in on
environmental externality, the tools developed in this paper apply to a range of non-
market entities.

The analytical modeling derives three discount rates: the market rate, an
“environmental” rate, and an augmented rate. The analytical model yields the
following expressions for the three discount rates discussed above. The market rate is
simply the rate of return on private capital. The “environmental” rate is the rate of
return on capital less the foregone returns due to the diversion of investment from
capital to abatement. The augmented discount rate is the rate of return on private
capital minus the partial effect of income on damages and abatement. By extension, the
augmented rate departs from the market rate through two factors: the drag due to
abatement expenditure, and the partial effect of income on damages.




                                            28
To explore the difference between the augmented and market rates more deeply, we
begin by assuming, plausibly, that additional output weakly yields more abatement. In
that case, in an economy with damages that rise with income, the augmented discount
rate is less than the market rate. Because rising damages place a drag on augmented
growth (Muller, 2014a; 2014b), the effect of damages reinforces the drag from abatement.

Contrarily, in a growing economy with falling damage, the effect of damages
counteracts the drag due to abatement. Since growth is enhanced by the attenuation of
damage the augmented discount rate will exceed the market rate if damage is relatively
elastic in abatement; that is, if each unit expended on abatement yields more than one
unit in damage reduction. In the case where damage is inelastic with respect to
expenditure on abatement, the augmented rate will fall short of the market rate.

Figure III shows a plot of environmental damage relative to a conventional measure of
income, GDP. The graph is divided into three regions that correspond to stages of
development in which environmental damage is: increasing with income (I.),
decreasing with greater income (II.), and fixed, perhaps reflecting binding policy
constraints, in region III.. In regions I. and II., the graph assumes an inverted U-shape,
which is just one of many possible forms to this relationship. This suggests the
environmental Kuznets curve. In region I., an augmented discount rate is
unambiguously lower than the market rate. The partial effect of income on both
damages and abatement expenditure work in the same direction, dragging down the
return to savings and, hence, the discount rate. Conversely, in region II. the partial
effect of income on damages is negative. Expression (6) shows that this has the effect of
increasing the augmented discount rate relative to the market rate. In region III., this
hypothetical economy finds itself in the setting Weitzman (1994) modeled. Damages are
fixed due, perhaps, to binding environmental policy constraints. In region III. the
augmented rate falls below the market rate and is equal to Weitzman’s (1994)
environmental rate.



                                             29
The value in figure III is the ability to see how the magnitude of the augmented
discount rate would change relative to the market rate as GDP (and the link between
GDP and damage) changes. Lower augmented discount rates occur at levels of
development characterized by rising damages and income. Higher rates occur in
economies with damages that fall as income rises. In the context of climate policy (or
any long run policy characterized by benefits that lag costs), the use of an augmented
rate suggests more stringent policy in region I. and less stringent policy in region II.
                                                                     𝜕𝐷𝑡
Then in region III. augmented discount rates would fall again as �         � approaches zero.
                                                                     𝜕𝑌𝑡

For the relationship between income and GDP shown in figure III, this suggests a non-
monotonic term structure in discount rates. This stands in stark contrast to the recent
literature that argues for a declining term structure (Arrow et al., 2014). Of course, many
forms to the relationship shown in figure III are possible. This form may vary by
country or pollutant. Therefore, whether or not the term structure of discount rates
suggested by the results in this study would change (instead of just modifying) the
recommended use of a declining discount rate is a matter left to future empirical work.

The analytical modeling also reports that if the marginal opportunity cost from
investments in environmental quality just offset the marginal damage from additional
output, then the augmented discount rate and the market rate will coincide. Hence,
efficient management of environmental externality eliminates the difference in these
discount rates.

The empirical analysis reports that Gross External Damages (GED) from air pollution
and GHGs amounted to $770 billion in 1999 and that this fell to $423 billion in 2011.
GED fell from 8.4 percent of output in 1999 to 3.6 percent in 2011. This finding indicates
that the U.S. economy exhibited an inverse relationship between income and pollution
damage over this 12 year period.

Employing reported GDP and the estimated GED, the difference between augmented
and market growth rates ranged from 0.6 percent (1999 to 2002) to 0.3 percent (2002 to


                                             30
2011). Armed with the expression of the spread between augmented and market
discount rates based on the Ramsey formula, along with a value of two for the elasticity
of the marginal utility of income, the difference amounted to 1.24 percent from 1999 to
2002. The divergence then fell to under 1 percent for the remaining years under study.

As is well-known, the magnitude of the discount rate plays a central role in
environmental policy design for stock pollutants like GHGs. More broadly, any benefit-
cost analysis that spans a long time horizon is quite sensitive to the discount rate
because of the familiar mathematics of discounting. So, at least in principle, the
analytical and empirical results presented in this paper have far-reaching consequences
both for policy design and evaluation.

The framework developed herein is more general than merely applying to pollution
damage, natural capital investment, or environmental accounting. In fact, this
machinery is applicable to any context in which standard market measures of income
are augmented to include non-market entities. Consider investment in national security;
a society invests in physical capital and employs labor to reduce the risk of a terrorist
attack or an invasion by another country. Such diversions of investment (from
conventionally productive private capital investments to risk reduction measures)
reduce the rate of return on savings when viewed through a market-centric measure of
income. That is, if the return to such investments lies outside the scope of income, then
the only dimension of this choice that manifests in the accounts is on the expenditure
side – the opportunity cost of not investing in ordinary productive capital. By
construction, the allocation of resources to national security places a drag on the yield of
savings. In order to comprehensively capture the return to such expenditures, the
definition of national income must include non-market measures of safety or risk. This
paper shows generally how such investments affect comprehensive output and, in turn,
discount rates. As such, the paper is of potentially broad interest and applicability.




                                             31
This paper suggests research on a number of fronts. In no particular order, a logical
empirical extension of this analysis is to apply the framework to different countries.
That is, while the U.S. economy exhibits damages inversely related to output, other
contexts such as rapidly growing developing countries likely feature damages that have
increased with output. What would this imply for estimates of growth and discount
rates? Another area where the ideas set forth in this paper might be applied is by using
an IAM like DICE to characterize a dynamically efficient abatement policy with
endogenous discount rates of the type proposed herein. Finally, the issue of uncertainty
is not raised here. Of course, both market and augmented measures of output and
therefore growth are not measured with certainty. This implies that the discount rates
the depend on these aggregates are also estimated with some degree of imprecision. A
thorough treatment of uncertainty would be a worthwhile extension. In any event, the
proposed modification to more standard approaches to calibration of discount rates is
likely to have pronounced effects on policy design for GHGs or other long-lived
environmental challenges.

Mathematical Appendix.

This appendix shows the calculation of discount rates in a more explicit fashion than the
space constraints in the text permit.

   a. Accounting Framework.

A homogeneous output (Yt) is expressed in terms of the standard accounting identity
shown in (A1).

𝑌𝑡 = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡                                                              (A1)

where: Ct = consumption of market goods.
      𝐼𝑡 = 𝐾𝑡 − 𝜆𝐾𝑡−1 : net investment in physical capital, where λ is the depreciation of
      physical capital.
      Gt = government expenditure.
      Xt = net exports.


The standard framework is augmented in two ways. Let At represent expenditure on
abatement of pollution. This is defined as a linear function of income: 𝐴𝑡 = 𝛾𝑌𝑡 . This
extension is shown in (A2).

𝑌𝑡 − 𝛾𝑌𝑡 = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡                                                        (A2)

The second extension of (A1) features the inclusion of environmental damage (denoted
Dt) in the expression for income. Damage is modeled as a linear function of income and
abatement: 𝐷𝑡 = 𝛼𝑌𝑡 − 𝛽(𝛾𝑌𝑡 ). The (𝛼) parameter represents the pollution-intensity of
output, while the (𝛽) parameter reflects the sensitivity of environmental damage to
investment in abatement. Mechanically, damage increases proportionally to output
through (𝛼), and decreases with income through investment in abatement (𝛾). With (Dt)

       b. Derivation of discount rates.

This section derives the discount rates using the three accounting frameworks
presented above. Conditional on an investment shock, the approach solves for the
change in consumption that balances the accounting identity. Dividing the change in
consumption by the savings shock (εt) yields an expression for the rate of return on
savings. Using the market accounts to demonstrate, first, solve for consumption as
shown in (A4) and (A5).

𝑌𝑡 − (𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡 ) = 𝐶𝑡0                                                                                    (A4)

(𝑌𝑡 + 𝛿 𝑐 𝜀𝑡 ) − (𝐼𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡 ) = 𝐶𝑡𝑠                                                                   (A5)

Then take the difference (A5) – (A4) and divide through by (𝜀𝑡 ).

𝐶𝑡𝑠 −𝐶𝑡0       𝛿 𝑐 𝜀𝑡 −𝜀𝑡

Repeating this procedure with abatement:

(𝑌𝑡 − 𝛾𝑌𝑡 ) − (𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡 ) = 𝐶𝑡0                                                                           (A7)

(𝑌𝑡 + 𝛿 𝑐 𝜀𝑡 )(1 − 𝛾) − (𝐼𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡 ) = 𝐶𝑡𝑠                                                            (A8)

Repeating this procedure with abatement and environmental damage:

𝑌𝑡 (1 − 𝛾 − 𝛼 + 𝛽𝛾) − (𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡 ) = 𝐶𝑡0                                                                   (A10)

(𝑌𝑡 + 𝛿 𝑐 𝜀𝑡 )(1 − 𝛾 − 𝛼 + 𝛽𝛾) − (𝐼𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 + 𝑋𝑡 ) = 𝐶𝑡𝑠                                                   (A11)

                                                                 48
   c. Comparing the different discount rates.

With the expressions for the market, environmental, and augmented discount rates the
analysis next compares these rates.

𝑖𝑚 = 𝑟                                                                                (A13)

                       𝜕𝐴
𝑖 𝑒 = 𝑟 − (1 + 𝑟) � 𝑡 �                                                               (A14)
                   𝜕𝑌   𝑡


                            𝜕𝐴
𝑖 𝑒 − 𝑖 𝑚 = −(𝑟 + 1) � 𝜕𝑌𝑡�                                                           (A15)
                                 𝑡


              𝜕𝐴
The (𝑟 + 1) � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� term represents the reduction in the return on savings due to the
                   𝑡

diversion of some savings to pollution abatement. Thus, provided (𝛾) > 0, and
            𝜕𝐴
therefore � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� > 0, 𝑖 𝑒 − 𝑖 𝑚 < 0. This confirms Weitzman’s (1994) result in the present
              𝑡

framework.

                       𝜕𝐷            𝜕𝐴
𝑖 𝑎 = 𝑟 − (𝑟 + 1) � 𝜕𝑌𝑡 + 𝜕𝑌𝑡 �                                                       (A16)
                        𝑡             𝑡


                            𝜕𝐷
𝑖 𝑎 − 𝑖 𝑒 = −(𝑟 + 1) � 𝜕𝑌𝑡�                                                           (A17)
                             𝑡



The difference between the environmental and augmented rates reduces to (negative
one times) the rate of return on capital times the partial effect of output on damages.
The penalty on the rate of return due to additional abatement, (1 + 𝑟)𝛾, manifests in
both (A14) and (A16). So (1 + 𝑟)𝛾 falls out of the difference. However, the effect of
abatement on damage, 𝛽𝛾, occurs only in (A16) because only the augmented
accounting identity recognizes damage. The difference between (A16) and (A14) centers
on this additional term and its magnitude relative to (𝛼).

              𝜕𝐷                          𝜕𝐷
Recall that � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� = 𝛼 − 𝛽𝛾. The sign of � 𝜕𝑌𝑡�, therefore, depends on three parameters:
                  𝑡                        𝑡

the pollution intensity of output (𝛼), the responsiveness of abatement to output (𝛾), and

                                               49
the responsiveness of damage (environmental quality) to abatement (𝛽). If 𝛼 > 𝛽𝛾, then
 𝜕𝐷
� 𝜕𝑌𝑡� > 0, damages are increasing with income, and the rate of return is less than the
     𝑡

environmental rate. However, if the environmental improvement from abatement, or
                                                    𝜕𝐷𝑡
𝛽𝛾, is greater than pollution intensity then �            � < 0. In this case, damages decrease
                                                    𝜕𝑌𝑡

with output, and (A16) exceeds (A14).

The difference between Weitzman’s environmental rate and augmented discount rates
                             𝜕𝐷𝑡
depends on the sign of �           �. In an economy characterized by damages that decrease
                             𝜕𝑌𝑡

with income, the boost to output generated by saving in productive capital reduces
damage, on net. That is, while some output is diverted to abatement and that produces
a drag on returns, it also produces non-market benefits: the reduction in damage
coming from the 𝛽𝛾 term. Under the 𝛼 < 𝛽𝛾 condition, accounting for changes to
environmental damage resulting from diversion of savings to abatement increases the
rate of return on savings relative to simply deducting diversions of abatement costs
from savings. In economies where each additional unit of output generates more harm,
(𝛼 > 𝛽𝛾), there is an additional drag on investment due to the additional damage. Thus,
(A16) < (A14).

The conclusions above should be intuitive to the reader. Weitzman’s (1994) insight that
rerouting some savings to abatement reduces the return on savings only recognizes the
opportunity cost of the re-allocation: 𝛾(1 + 𝑟). In contrast, (A3), (A12), and (A16) also
include the change in damage from additional abatement. In the augmented accounts
(A3), prior empirical work has shown that reduced damages boost output, all else equal
(Muller, 2014a; 2014b). So, if damages fall with output, the return on savings must rise
relative to the case in which damages are ignored 13.




13This analysis assumes that the parameters (𝛼 ,𝛽, 𝛾) are fixed. Of course, each of these parameters may
change. One mway to explore the influence of such changes is through the term structure of the various
discount rates. A rudimentary analysis of the term structure is conducted in the appendix to this paper.

                                                   50
To contrast sharply, or directly, to Weitzman’s (1994) case in which damages are held
                                                                                𝜕𝐷
fixed despite the increase in output from savings, begin by noting that � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� = 0, if
                                                                                 𝑡
        𝛼                                                 𝛼
𝛾 = 𝛽. When expression (A17) is evaluated at 𝛾 = 𝛽, the difference between the
                                                                                     𝜕𝐷
augmented and environmental rates is zero. By holding damages fixed the � 𝜕𝑌𝑡� term
                                                                                      𝑡

and (A17) equals zero. Expression (A18) displays the difference between ia and im which
is shown in the main body of the paper.

       d. Term Structure.

Term structure refers to the time path of discount rates. The conceptual modeling above
and in the main body of the paper does not explicitly treat changes in the discount rates
over time. In order to explore the term structure of discount rates, the analysis begins by
taking the partial derivatives of ia and ie according to three model parameters: (𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛼).
That is, for fixed parameters, the partial effect of inter-temporal changes in output (Yt)
                       𝜕𝐷                  𝜕𝐴𝑡
on both ia and ie are: 𝜕𝑌𝑡 = 𝛼 − 𝛽𝛾, and         = 𝛾. However, it is likely that the three model
                        𝑡                  𝜕𝑌𝑡

parameters: (𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛼), may also change over time. The following section briefly explores
how such changes will affect ia and ie.

Beginning with expenditure on abatement (𝛾):

𝜕𝑖 𝑒
       = −𝛿 𝑐                                                                             (A19)
𝜕𝛾


𝜕𝑖 𝑎
       = 𝛿 𝑐 (𝛽 − 1)                                                                      (A20)
𝜕𝛾


Expression (A19) indicates that the partial effect of expenditure on abatement on the
environmental discount rate is negative, provided private capital is productive. Further,
the more productive is private capital (the higher the return to investment in capital)
the steeper is the gradient of ie with respect to additional investment in abatement. As


                                                     51
shown in (A20), the term structure of ia depends on both 𝛿 𝑐 and 𝛽, the responsiveness of
environmental quality (or natural capital) to investment in abatement – or natural
capital, more generally. Thus, if 𝛽 < 1, then the gradient of ia with respect to (𝛾) is
negative and is less steep than that of ie. Importantly, the term structure of ia with
respect to 𝛾 is rising if each monetary unit of investment in natural capital yields more
than one unit of damage reduction.

Expression (A21) indicates that the partial effect of pollution intensity (𝛼) on the
augmented discount rate is simply negative one times the marginal product of private
capital.

𝜕𝑖 𝑎
       = −𝛿 𝑐                                                                       (A21)
𝜕𝛼


Thus, if pollution intensity falls (rises), the term structure of ia will rise (fall).

𝜕𝑖 𝑎
       = 𝛿𝑐𝛾                                                                        (A22)
𝜕𝛽


Expression (A22) shows that the partial effect of the sensitivity of environmental quality
to abatement (𝛽) on the augmented discount rate is the marginal product of private
capital times the share of output invested in environmental quality. Thus, provided
𝛾 > 0 ia rises with greater responsiveness of natural capital to investment in natural
capital.

       e. Discount Rates in the Ramsey Model.

The familiar Ramsey (1928) formulation is shown in (A23).

𝑟 𝑅 = 𝜌 + ηg                                                                                (A23)

The parameters in (A23) assume their conventional meanings with ρ = the pure rate of
time preference; η = the elasticity of the marginal utility of income; g = annual, per
capita income growth. In the following (g) is replaced with a more explicit
representation of per capita income growth to facilitate a comparison between market


                                                52
and augmented income. Thus, (A24), relies on market income, where (Yt) denotes
national income in time period (t), while (Pt) is population in period (t).

                 𝑌𝑡+1 𝑌𝑡
                      −
                 𝑃𝑡+1 𝑃𝑡
𝑟𝑚𝑅   = 𝜌 + η�      𝑌𝑡     �                                                        (A24)
                    𝑃𝑡



Expression (A25) employs the augmented measure of national output: (𝑌𝑡 − 𝛼𝑡 𝑌𝑡 ),
where 𝛼𝑡 represents pollution damage intensity of output. Therefore, 𝛼𝑡 𝑌𝑡 = 𝐷𝑡 .

                  𝑌         𝑌       𝑌     𝑌
                 � 𝑡+1 −𝛼𝑡+1 𝑡+1 �−� 𝑡 −𝛼𝑡 𝑡 �
                    𝑃𝑡+1        𝑃𝑡+1        𝑃𝑡     𝑃𝑡
𝑟𝑠𝑅   = 𝜌 + η�              𝑌     𝑌                     �                           (A25)
                           � 𝑡 −𝛼𝑡 𝑡 �
                            𝑃𝑡         𝑃𝑡



Then, taking the difference by subtracting (A24) from (A25) yields:

                               𝑃𝑡 𝑌𝑡+1 (𝛼𝑡 −𝛼𝑡+1 )
      Δ = 𝑟𝑠𝑅 − 𝑟𝑚𝑅 = η 𝑃                   �           �                           (A26)
                               𝑡+1   𝑌𝑡          1−𝛼𝑡




      f. Growth in the National Accounting Framework.

This section derives growth rates in the market accounts, the accounts with abatement,
and the augmented accounting framework. Beginning with the market accounts growth
due to productive investment is characterized by:
(𝑌𝑡 +(1+𝑟)𝜀𝑡 )−𝑌𝑡
                                                                                    (A27)
        𝑌𝑡


With abatement expenditure, growth is shown in (A28).

�𝑌𝑡 +(1+𝑟)𝜀𝑡 −𝛾(𝑌𝑡 +(1+𝑟)𝜀𝑡 )�−𝑌𝑡
                                                                                    (A28)
               𝑌𝑡


Finally, growth in the complete augmented accounts is:

�𝑌𝑡 +(1+𝑟)𝜀𝑡 −𝛾(𝑌𝑡 +(1+𝑟)𝜀𝑡 )−�𝛼(𝑌𝑡 +(1+𝑟)𝜀𝑡 )−𝛽𝛾(𝑌𝑡 +(1+𝑟)𝜀𝑡 )��−𝑌𝑡
                                                                                    (A29)
                                     𝑌𝑡

                           𝜕𝐴
Replacing (𝛾) with � 𝜕𝑌𝑡�, the difference between (A28) and (A27) amounts to:
                                 𝑡




                                                            53
    𝜕𝐴𝑡
    �   �(𝑌𝑡 +(1+𝑟)𝜀𝑡 )
    𝜕𝑌𝑡
−             𝑌𝑡
                        .                                                           (A30)

Thus, provided private capital is productive, implying (𝑌𝑡 + (1 + 𝑟)𝜀𝑡 ) > 𝑌𝑡 , then (A30)
< 0, and abatement reduces growth relative to the case without abatement.

The difference between (A29) and (A27) is shown in (A31):

        𝜕𝐴𝑡    𝜕𝐷
    ��      �+� 𝑡 ��(𝑌𝑡 +(1+𝑟)𝜀𝑡 )
        𝜕𝑌𝑡    𝜕𝑌𝑡
−                                .                                                  (A31)
                   𝑌𝑡


The difference between augmented growth and market growth depends on both how
                                                           𝜕𝐴
abatement and damages change with output. Assuming � 𝜕𝑌𝑡 � > 0, rising damage
                                                             𝑡

ensures that augmented growth falls short of market growth. In contrast, when
damages fall with output, growth in augmented output may exceed or be less than
market growth. This depends on the relative magnitudes of damage reduction and
