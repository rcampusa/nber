                                           ABSTRACT

We survey 79 private equity investors with combined AUM of over $750B about their practices in
firm valuation, capital structure, governance, and value creation. Investors rely primarily on IRR and
multiples to evaluate investments. Their LPs focus more on absolute performance. Capital structure
choice is based equally on optimal trade-off and market timing considerations. PE investors anticipate
adding value to portfolio companies, with a greater focus on increasing growth than on reducing costs.
We also explore how the actions that PE managers say they take group into specific firm strategies
and how those strategies are related to firm founder characteristics.

1. Introduction

       The private equity (buyout) 1 industry has grown markedly in the last twenty years and

academic research has increasingly focused on the effects of private equity. What has been less

explored are the specific analyses and actions taken by private equity (PE) fund managers.

This paper seeks to fill that gap. In a survey of 79 private equity firms managing more than

$750 billion in capital, we provide granular information on PE managers’ practices in

determining capital structure, valuing transactions, sourcing deals, governance and operational

engineering. We also explore how the actions that private equity managers say they take group

into specific firm strategies and how those strategies are related to firm founder characteristics.

       Recent academic research has provided accumulating evidence that private equity

investors have performed well relative to reasonable benchmarks. At the private equity fund

level, Harris, Jenkinson and Kaplan (2014), Higson and Stucke (2013), Robinson and Sensoy

(2013) and Ang et al. (2013) all find that private equity funds have outperformed public equity

markets net of fees over the last three decades. The outperformance versus the S&P 500 in

Harris et al. is on the order of 20% over the life of a fund and roughly 4% per year.      Consistent

with that net of fee performance, Axelson, Sorensen, and Strömberg (2013) find outperformance

of over 8% per year gross of fees.

       At the private equity portfolio company level, Davis et al. (2014) find significant

increases in productivity in a large sample of U.S. buyouts from the 1980s to early 2000s. Cohn

and Towery (2013) find significant increases in operating performance in a large sample of U.S.

buyouts of private firms. Kaplan (1989) finds significant increases in public to private deals in

the 1980s. Cohn et al. (2014) and Guo et al. (2011) find modest increases in operating

performance for public to private buyouts in the 1990s and early 2000s, although Guo et al. find

large increases in company values.

  We classify private equity as buyout or growth equity investments in mature companies. Private equity
as we define it in this paper is distinct from and does not include venture capital investments.


                                                   1
       From Gompers and Lerner (1999), Metrick and Yasuda (2010), and Chung et al. (2012),

we also know that the compensation of the partners at the private equity funds creates strong

incentives to generate high returns, both directly and through the ability to raise subsequent

funds. Strong performance for some funds has led to very high compensation for those

investors.

       The high-powered incentives combined with the largely positive empirical results are

consistent with PE investors taking actions that are value increasing or maximizing. Kaplan

and Strömberg (2009) classify three types of value increasing actions—financial engineering,

governance engineering, and operational engineering. These value-increasing actions are not

necessarily mutually exclusive, but it is likely that certain firms emphasize some of the actions

more than others.

       In financial engineering, PE investors provide strong equity incentives to the

management teams of their portfolio companies. At the same time, leverage puts pressure on

managers not to waste money. In governance engineering, PE investors control the boards of

their portfolio companies and are more actively involved in governance than public company

directors and public shareholders. In operational engineering, PE firms develop industry and

operating expertise that they bring to bear to add value to their portfolio companies.

       Despite the growth in private equity and that evidence, only a few papers have studied

the actions private equity investors actually take. Early papers by Baker and Wruck (1989)

and Baker (1992) explored value creation in individual cases. More recently, Acharya et al.

(2013) study portfolio company performance and relate that performance to PE firm and

partner characteristics. There is still much that is unknown. In particular, no paper examines

detailed levers of value creation across financial, governance, and operational engineering.

       In this paper, we further explore what PE investors actually do by reporting the results

of a survey of private equity investing practices. The paper has two parts. First, we identify

and tabulate the key decisions that private equity investors make. The range of decisions is


                                                 2
significantly more detailed than has been examined in the prior literature. In particular, our

survey is structured around examining decisions that support financial, governance, or

operational engineering. Second, we attempt to categorize distinct strategies that private equity

firms employ.

       Our approach is to survey 79 private equity (PE) investors (with a total of over $750

billion of private equity assets under management as of the end of 2012). We obtain complete

answers from 64 of these firms (representing over $600 billion of private equity assets under

management). The sample represents private equity firms across a spectrum of investment

strategies, size, industry specialization, and geographic focus. We ask the PE investors

questions about financial engineering—how they value companies, think about portfolio

company capital structures, and management incentives; governance engineering—how they

think about governance and monitoring; and operational engineering—how they think about

value creation, both before closing the transaction and after the transaction. We also ask

questions about the organization of the private equity firms themselves.

       Despite the prominent role that discounted cash flow valuation methods play in

academic finance courses, few PE investors use discounted cash flow or net present value

techniques to evaluate investments. Rather, they rely on internal rates of return and multiples

of invested capital.   This contrasts with the results in Graham and Harvey (2001) who find

that CFOs use net present values as often as internal rates of return. Furthermore, few PE

investors explicitly use the capital asset price model (CAPM) to determine a cost of capital.

Instead, PE investors typically target a 22% internal rate of return on their investments on

average (with the vast majority of target rates of return between 20 and 25%), a return that

appears to be above a CAPM-based rate. We offer several potential explanations for this

seemingly ad hoc approach to investment analysis.

       We also asked the PE investors how their limited partners (LPs) evaluate the

performance of the private equity investors. Surprisingly, the PE investors believe that their


                                                3
LPs are most focused on absolute performance rather than relative performance or alphas. This

is also puzzling given that private equity investments are equity investments, some of which had

been publicly-traded prior to a leveraged buyout. Such investments carry significant equity

risk, suggesting that equity-based benchmarks like public market equivalents (PMEs) are

appropriate.

       Our results on capital structure are more consistent with academic theory and teaching.

In choosing the capital structures for their portfolio companies, PE investors appear to rely

equally on factors that are consistent with capital structure trade-off theories and those that are

consistent with market timing. The market timing result is consistent with the results in

Axelson, Jenkinson et al. (2013), henceforth AJSW (2013), although the capital structure trade-

off theory result is not. These results are, however, somewhat different from those in Graham

and Harvey (2001) who find that CFOs focus on financial flexibility.

       Financial and governance engineering also appear to be important. In terms of portfolio

company management, PE investors expect to provide strong equity incentives to their

management teams and believe those incentives are very important. They regularly replace top

management, both before and after they invest. And they structure smaller boards of directors

with a mix of insiders, PE investors and outsiders. These results are consistent with research on

value enhancing governance structures that have been identified in other settings.

       Finally, PE investors say they place a heavy emphasis on adding value to their portfolio

companies, both before and after they invest. The sources of that added value, in order of

importance, are increasing revenue, improving incentives and governance, facilitating a high-

value exit or sale, making additional acquisitions, replacing management and reducing costs.

On average, they commit meaningful resources to add value, although there is a great deal of

variation in how they do so.

       We take the responses to the various questions about individual decisions and analyze

how various decisions are “related” to each other by employing cluster analysis and factor


                                                 4
analysis. Essentially, we use cluster analysis to explore whether private equity firms follow

particular strategies. We find that the answers to our survey cluster into categories that are

related to financial engineering, governance engineering, and operational engineering—the levers

of value creation highlighted in Kaplan and Strömberg (2009).

       We then consider how those strategies are related to firm founder characteristics. Firms

whose founders have a financial background tend to focus more on financial engineering, while

those with a previous background in private equity and, to a lesser extent, operations, tend to

focus more on operational engineering.

       In what follows, we assume the PE investor responses are accurate and interpret the

survey accordingly. The PE investors filled out the survey with the assurance that they would

not be identified and that their responses would be aggregated so they could not be identified.

Accordingly, no individual firm has any incentive to report overly positive or otherwise

inaccurate responses. Doing so will not benefit any one individual firm directly. We recognize,

however, it is possible that some PE investors might report overly positively on some questions

in the hope that it will cast the PE industry in a better light. We discuss how such behavior

might affect our results.



2. Related Literature

       This paper is related to several strands in the literature. Our survey allows us to

evaluate whether and how different corporate finance theories are applied in practice by

investors with extremely high incentives to perform and who also have the highest level of

education from top business schools. In particular, there are large academic literatures on firm

valuation, capital structure and governance. Do what private equity investors say they do

conform to what researchers think “should be done”? Second, our paper explores how these

financial decisions are related to firm characteristics.




                                                   5
       Research on capital structure has spawned large numbers of papers that seek to explain

how firms set their debt and equity structures. Three primary theories receive prominence in

the literature. The trade-off theory of Myers (1977) predicts that the amount of debt that a

firm raises is a balance between the value creation of interest tax shields and the cost of

financial distress. It is optimal for firms to raise additional debt until the marginal tax shield

benefit of the additional dollar of debt equals the expected cost of financial distress. The trade-

off theory corresponds to what most introductory finance courses teach about debt policy. The

pecking order theory (Myers, 1984) predicts that firms prefer to raise as much safe debt as

possible. Once safe debt is exhausted, firms raise risky debt then equity to fund projects.

Finally, Baker and Wurgler (2002) propose a theory of capital structure that depends on firm

managers timing markets based upon the mispricing of debt or equity. When interest rates are

perceived to be particularly low relative to fundamentals, firms increase borrowing and when

equity markets are overvalued firms would tend to raise more equity. We seek to assess how

much of private equity firm managers’ leverage decisions are governed by each of these theories.

       Governance engineering has been another major area of research in corporate finance.

Jensen and Meckling (1976) were among the first scholars to note that agency conflicts exist

between managers (who typically own small fractions to equity in the firms that they manage)

and outside shareholders who may by quite fragmented. Governance engineering involves

creating a better alignment of incentives between managers and shareholders or providing better

oversight that can limit empire building and opportunistic behavior. Gompers, Ishii, and

Metrick (2003) demonstrate that broad measures of corporate governance are related to public

company performance and valuation.       Jensen and Murphy (1990) create a framework to

measure the incentive effects of equity ownership for firm managers. Kaplan (1989) examines

management ownership changes in a sample of leveraged buyouts from the 1980s and finds that

ownership substantially increases on average.




                                                  6
       Incentive compensation has been a particularly important area of governance research.

Jensen (1986) argues that managers of publicly traded firms typically own too little equity to

make them sensitive to maximizing shareholder value. Private equity managers who are aware

of these issues will seek to align incentives through increases in managerial equity ownership.

       Boards of directors are often viewed as an important governance tool to monitor

managers on behalf of shareholders. Fama and Jensen (1983) discuss the role of boards and how

boards should function. Hermalin and Weisbach (1998) examine the determinants of board

structure and argue that board structure tends to be endogenously determined to minimize

conflicts with shareholders. Coles, Daniels, and Naveen (2008) examine how board size is

related to both firm characteristics and then firm performance. In general, the literature argues

that small boards dominated by outsiders perform better. We examine board strategy issues for

private equity investors.

       We also examine specific strategies around improvement in operating performance.

Many private equity firms market to their investors and potential portfolio companies their

ability to increase value by improving operating performance. Kaplan (1989) was the first to

find growth in operating performance after firms undergo a leveraged buyout. Kaplan and

Strömberg (2009) summarize subsequent research that largely confirms that private equity

investments are associated with improvements in operating performance or productivity. While

little research has identified the key operating levers that private equity managers pull to

improve performance, several papers have examined the effects of private equity on the

operational performance of the companies they own. More recently, Davis et al. (2014) use U.S.

Census data to study a large sample of U.S. buyouts and finds that they are associated with an

improvement in productivity. Cohn and Towery (2013) use income tax data to study a large

sample of U.S. buyouts and find improvements in operating margins. The exception to these

positive results are public to private transactions. Cohn et al. (2014) and Guo et al. (2011) find

modest, but insignificant increases in operating margins in U.S. public to private transactions.


                                                 7
          In doing these analyses, we view this paper as a complement to the survey papers of

Graham and Harvey, beginning with Graham and Harvey (2001). 2 Graham and Harvey survey

chief financial officers to understand how they make capital budgeting, capital structure and

other decisions. They compare their survey findings of practice to the recommendations or

insights from different academic theories. In this paper, we do the same. We view this survey

as particularly interesting because private equity investors have been so successful (both in

terms of generating attractive returns for investors and compensation for their managers), have

strong incentives to maximize shareholder value, and, because of those incentives and

compensation, very likely attract talented individuals. As we show below, it also is the case

that a large percentage of private equity investors have been trained at prominent business

schools. In recent years, positions in private equity firms have been among the most coveted for

graduating MBA students.          A Pitchbook 2013 survey showed that a small number of elite

business schools accounted for the vast majority of new hires in private equity. As such, we

would expect that private equity investors’ practices would approximate what financial

economists believe is theoretically (and empirically) value maximizing.

          Finally, our paper is complementary to a recent survey by Da Rin and Phalippou (2014)

who survey a large sample of PE limited partners. Their survey includes questions on the

criteria PE limited partners use in choosing PE investments. Da Rin and Phalippou (2014),

however, have relatively little to say about the internal decision-making and strategies of the

general partner.



3. Sample and Design

3.1. Design

          We created the survey to determine what PE investors say that they do. We also

attempted to design the survey with the intent of comparing what those investors do relative to

2
    See also Brav et al. (2005) and Graham et al. (2005).


                                                      8
what is taught at business schools. We initially tested the survey on three PE investors in the

summer of 2011. We revised the survey to reflect some ambiguities in our questions and to add

some additional questions. The final survey includes 92 questions and is available on the

internet at Paul Gompers’ website.



3.2. Delivery and Response

       We began to distribute the survey to PE investors in the fall of 2011. We distributed it

to investors where one of the co-authors knew or was introduced to a senior investment

professional. We continued to identify potential PE investors in 2012. We received our last

survey response in the winter of 2013. The vast majority of survey responses, therefore, were

received in 2012.

       We contacted a total of 136 PE firms. We sent survey links to 106 of these who

expressed an interest in the survey. Of these, 79 filled out some part of the survey and 64

completely filled out the survey. The response rate of roughly 50% is much higher than the

response rate for other surveys. Graham and Harvey (2001) obtain a response rate of 8.9% for

CFOs while Da Rin and Phalippou (2014) obtain a response rate of 13.8% for PE limited

partners.



3.3. Private Equity Firm Characteristics

       Table 1 provides some summary statistics for the firms of the PE investors who

responded to the survey. We obtained assets under management (AUM), performance of the

most recent primary fund (if available), and age of each private equity firm in the sample as of

December 2012 from Preqin. Information on firms not covered by Preqin is taken from firm

websites and media articles.




                                                9
       The table shows that there is a large variation in the size of the firms as measured by

assets under management (AUM). The mean AUM is just under $10 billion. A quarter of the

firms have AUM under $750 million while a quarter have AUM above $11 billion.

       Our overall sample of 79 firms includes firms with a total of over $750 billion in AUM.

Our sample of 64 firms that completed the entire survey includes firms with a total of over $600

billion in AUM. In particular, we have solid coverage of the largest PE firms. Each year,

Private Equity International (PEI) Media ranks the top PE firms globally by AUM. Our (fully

completed) sample includes eleven of the top twenty-five in PEI’s 2012 list. Given this, our

results are reflective of a meaningful fraction of the PE industry.

       The table also indicates that Preqin has performance data for the most recent fund for

58 of the sample PE firms. The average fund in the sample has an IRR that is 2.7% above

Preqin’s benchmark IRR for the same vintage year. The median fund is 0.9% above. This

suggests that our sample is largely representative of the PE fund universe, at least in terms of

performance. If anything, we may have a small bias towards better performers. We do not

believe any bias towards slightly better performing PE firms would influence our results in any

way. If anything, our sample of firms would be expected to employ better practices than other

PE firms and as such their actions should conform more closely to what finance research and

courses prescribe.

       Despite the apparent representativeness of the sample and the relatively high response

rate, we recognize that the sample is potentially selected. This is unavoidable given our

requirement that we have an introduction to a senior person and given that PE firms have

limited disclosure requirements. Given the large total AUM our sample PE firms control, the

survey represents a meaningful fraction of the PE industry.

       Table 2 presents the distribution of enterprise values of the portfolio companies in which

the PE firms invest. The sample has good representation of many different PE firm enterprise

values and covers the broad spectrum of PE investing. The table suggests that almost one-sixth


                                                 10
of portfolio company investments by the sample PE firms have enterprise values exceeding $1

billion while almost 12% have enterprise values below $25 million.

       Table 3 confirms that the private equity investors in our sample are primarily buyout

and growth equity investors, not venture capital investors. Over 90% of the PE investors invest

in buyouts while almost 75% invest in growth equity. These add up to more than one because

many PE investors invest in both buyouts and growth equity. A minority of the sample

investors, particularly the older and larger ones, also invest in distressed investments and PIPEs

(private investments in public equities).

       Finally, consistent with our survey delivery method, table 4 indicates that over three

quarters of the surveys were completed by a senior PE executive—one with the title general

partner, managing partner or managing director. As such, we feel that the responses are very

likely indicative of firm practices employed within the PE organizations broadly.

       We also used the PE firm websites to collect the names and educations of all of the

partner level executives at our sample PE firms. We used the titles partner, managing partner,

managing director, senior managing director, founder, CEO, chairman, head, and principal. We

identified 767 such individuals. Of these, almost two-thirds either have an MBA or a JD—435

or 57% of these have an MBA while 54 or 7% have a law degree. Of those with an MBA, 167

(38%) are from Harvard, 52 are from Chicago Booth (12%), 39 are from Stanford (9%), 32 are

from Wharton (7%) and 23 (5%) are from Columbia. These figures indicate that the top

executives at these firms are highly educated and a very large fraction of them have degrees

from what would be considered the top graduate schools. Once again, we believe that given the

educational background of the sample, our PE firms would likely employ industry best practices




                                                11
in their investment process. At the same time, it is possible that we have oversampled Harvard

and Chicago alums while undersampling Wharton alums. 3



4. Financial Engineering

4.1. Valuation / Capital Budgeting

       In this section, we consider how PE investors value the companies in which they invest

or, equivalently, evaluate the attractiveness of those investments. A substantial corporate

finance literature has developed around capital budgeting. Firms decide which projects to

undertake based upon a variety of investment rules. Much of the early finance research

established that optimal decision making for firms should be based on net present value

analyses. 4 Finance theory is clear that estimating expected future cash flows from an

investment, then using a discount rate that is derived from an explicit asset pricing model (e.g.,

CAPM or Fama-French three factor model) leads to better investment decisions when compared

to alternatives like internal rate of return (IRR) or payback analysis (e.g., multiple on invested

capital (MOIC).) The theory, therefore, predicts or suggests that private equity investors

should be more likely to use discounted cash flow methods. Our results allow us to compare

how investment decision-making criteria at PE firms compares to the framework articulated by

finance theory.



4.1.1. Valuation / Evaluation Methods

       The survey asks the PE investors to identify different methods they use to evaluate the

overall attractiveness of a deal. We asked two different questions. First, we asked which

metrics they use, giving them the choice of gross internal rate of return (IRR), multiple of


3

  For example, see Brealey, Myers, and Allen (2011).


                                                12
invested capital (MOIC), adjusted present value (APV) discounted cash flow (DCF), weighted

average costs of capital (WACC) DCF, comparable company EBITDA multiples and free cash

flow return to equity. Table 5a reports the results. The vast majority of the PE investors rely

on gross IRR and MOIC. Over 70% also incorporate comparable company multiples. In

contrast, relatively few PE investors use DCF methods. In sum, fewer than 20% use APV or

WACC-based DCF methods to evaluate investments. Second, we also asked the PE investors to

rank their reliance on the different methods. Again, as Table 5b indicates, IRR (in particular)

and multiple approaches are the overwhelming favorites while net and adjusted present value

approaches lag far behind.

       We also directly asked private equity managers how they calculate their WACC. Only

eighteen (or 27%) of the PE investors describe performing a calculation that can be generously

considered to approximate a traditional, CAPM-based approach. At the same time, 27 said

they did not use WACC and another 10 said “not applicable,” indicating, that they, too, do not

use WACC. Overall, then, at least 55% of the PE investors appear not to use WACC at all.

       These results indicate that PE investors do not frequently use net present value or DCF

techniques. This contrasts markedly with the results in Graham and Harvey (2001) for CFOs.

In that paper, they find that CFOs rely on net present value techniques roughly as frequently as

IRR; and large company CFOs, in particular, rely heavily on the CAPM to determine their cost

of capital. Our results for PE investors also contrast with the methods taught in MBA finance

courses at all top business schools as well as typical valuation analyses seen in investment

banker fairness opinions for mergers and acquisitions. CAPM-based discounted cash flow

analyses are the primary method taught and used in those settings. It also is clear that in their

IRR calculation, the PE investors evaluate cash flows to leveraged equity. Arguably, this, too,

contrasts with the usual academic advice in MBA finance courses to evaluate and discount cash

flows to an all-equity firm.




                                                13
4.1.2. Years of Forecasts

       In evaluating any investment, investors typically forecast the cash flows of that

investment over some period of time. We asked the PE investors to tell us the time horizon of

the investment cash flows they evaluate. Figure 1 indicates that the great majority of PE

investors – almost 96% of our sample – use a five year forecast horizon. At the end of the five

years, they typically calculate a terminal or exit value. This indicates that PE investors do not

find it productive or valuable to forecast cash flows for more than five years.

       Graham and Harvey (2001) do not appear to have asked this question so we cannot

compare our results to theirs. While we did not explicitly ask why PE firms use five years as

the predominant forecasting horizon, most PE firms expect to hold their investments for

approximately five years. As such, forecasting cash flows over five years approximates the PE

firm’s time horizon. Several investors have told us that using a standard time period, like five

years, allows the PE firms to compare different investments on an equal footing. That, of

course, explains why each firm would use a standard horizon, but not why almost all firms

would use the same five-year horizon.



4.1.3. Discount of Management Forecasts

       When PE investors evaluate an investment, they usually begin with a set of

management forecasts. It seems natural to assume that the PE investors might view those

forecasts as optimistic. Accordingly, we asked the PE investors whether they typically adjusted

management’s forecasts. We asked them to measure this as a fraction of EBITDA – earnings

before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization – a measure of pre-tax cash flow.

       Table 6 shows that it is, indeed, typical for PE investors to discount management

forecasts. For the 44 PE investors who answered this question explicitly, the median and

average discount is 20%. Another 11 of the PE investors who did not provide a number

indicated that the discount varied with the circumstances of individual deals.


                                                14
4.1.4. Exit Value or Terminal Value

       In order to evaluate the economics of an investment, the PE investors need to estimate a

value for their investment (or, equivalently the portfolio company) at the expected time of exit.

As noted above, this is virtually always five years into the investment. There are (at least)

three possible ways to do this valuation: (1) using the (discounted) value of a growing

perpetuity of the final year cash flow in a CAPM-framework; (2) using the value of comparable

or similar public companies; and (3) using the value of acquisitions or transactions involving

comparable or similar companies.

       Table 7a indicates that PE investors are much more likely to use comparable methods—

both publicly traded companies and transactions—than discounted cash flow methods. Fewer

than 30% of the PE investors use a growing perpetuity methodology. The percentage increases

for larger PE investors, but remains below 35%. The other category is dominated by eleven

firms (or 16%) who indicate that they use the entry multiple—the EBITDA multiple the PE

investor paid for the company—to calculate the exit multiple.

       Table 7b explores how the PE investors choose the comparable companies they use.

Industry and firm size are the most important criteria they match on with growth, margins, and

geography next in importance. Setting the exit multiple equal to the entry multiple also is

consistent with matching on firm industry and size. Firm riskiness ranks seventh among the

different criteria. Again, PE investors appear to be skeptical of using measures of risk that have

strong foundations in academic finance.



4.1.5. IRR and MOIC Targets

        As the previous sections indicate, PE investors do not explicitly use DCF / CAPM-

based methods. Given their emphasis on IRR and MOIC, however, it is important to know




                                                15
what IRR and MOIC PE investors target and whether those targets bear any relation to

CAPM-related returns.



4.1.5.1. IRR Targets

       Table 8a indicates that PE investors (say) they target median IRRs of 25%. Smaller PE

firms and those with global investment operations tend to target higher IRRs. A rough

calculation suggests that this target exceeds a CAPM-based rate. In 2012, long-term Treasury

bond rates did not exceed 4%. Axelson, Sorensen, and Strömberg (2013) estimate an average

portfolio company equity beta of 2.3. Assuming an equity risk premium of 6%, these suggest a

CAPM-based discount rate of less than 18%.

       The fact that PE investors target returns exceed CAPM-based returns is not surprising.

PE investors pay their fees out of gross IRRs. PE limited partners (LPs) receive their returns

net of those fees. In other words, in order to generate a competitive CAPM-based return net of

fees, PE investors must target a greater return gross of fees. Similarly, many PE firms argue

that they generate returns in excess of the underlying riskiness of the portfolio. In order to earn

positive excess returns, the PE firms would need to target returns that are higher than the

return implied by the CAPM risk of the investment.

       We also asked two different questions to determine whether PE investors adjusted their

target IRR to reflect different risks in different deals. These are presented in tables 8b and 8c.

Table 8b indicates that over 85% of PE investors adjust their target IRRs for firm riskiness.

While most PE investors explicitly do not use a CAPM-based approach, this adjustment is

potentially somewhat consistent with one. Unfortunately, the survey did not explicitly define

firm risk. As a result, we cannot distinguish the extent to which firm risk refers to systematic

or unsystematic risk.




                                                 16
       At the same time, table 8b indicates that fewer than half of the PE investors adjust their

target IRRs for deal leverage. This suggests that the more than half of the PE investors who do

not make such an adjustment explicitly do not take a CAPM-based approach.

       Table 8c reports the fraction of deals that PE investors adjust cash flows or the IRR to

reflect different risks. These risks can be divided into macroeconomic or systematic risks

(unexpected inflation, interest rate, term structure, business cycle, and foreign exchange) and

firm-specific risks (distress, size, market-to-book, momentum and illiquidity). The results

indicate that PE investors are somewhat sensitive to macroeconomic risks, particularly GDP or

business cycle risk where PE investors make some adjustment in roughly half of their deals. This

is consistent with PE investors taking market or equity risk into account. This is also is

suggestive of PE investors having time varying hurdle rates. Firm-specific adjustments appear

less important, although there are a variety of firm-specific factors that at least some of the PE

firms use to adjust their target hurdle rates.



4.1.5.2. MOIC Targets

       Table 9 indicates that PE investors (say) they target median MOICs of 2.5 times their

investment. At a five-year time horizon, this implies a gross IRR of approximately 20%. The

mean MOIC of 2.85 times implies a gross IRR of 23%. The MOIC targets, therefore, imply

slightly lower gross IRRs than reported gross IRR targets. Smaller and younger private equity

firms generally tend to have higher MOIC targets.



4.1.6. Net of Fee Targets (Marketed to LPs)

       The previous sections describe the targets private equity investors use to evaluate their

investments. We also asked them how their limited partners (LPs) evaluate the performance of

the private equity investors.   Benchmarking of private equity returns has seen significant

evolution in recent years both from an academic and from a data vendor perspective.


                                                 17
       Table 10 reports the benchmark that the PE investors report is most important for their

LPs. Surprisingly, almost two-thirds of the PE investors report that an absolute measure of

performance—net IRR and net MOIC—is most important. In fewer than 8% of the cases do the

PE investors believe that LPs view performance relative to public markets as the most

important performance benchmark. This is surprising given the large attention paid to alphas

and relative performance in public market investments like mutual funds and hedge funds. An

additional 27% believe the performance relative to other PE investors is most important.       The

only difference among private equity firms appears to be that older private equity firms’

investors evaluate net IRR relative to fund vintage year more frequently and younger private

equity firms’ investors look to cash-on-cash multiples. Overall, the focus on absolute

performance is notable and surprising given the intense focus on relative performance or alphas

for public market investments.

       Table 11 reports the net IRR that the PE investors market to their LPs. The median

net IRR is between 20% and 25%. Consistent with the PE investors’ gross IRR targets, this

would correspond to a gross IRR of between 25% and 30%. And as with the gross IRR targets,

these net IRR targets seem to exceed what one would expect in a CAPM-based framework.



4.1.7. Discussion

       These somewhat surprising valuation results raise several potential alternative

explanations. First, it is possible that because private equity is viewed by many limited

partners (and marketed as such by some general partners) as an absolute return investment,

nominal hurdle rates are more meaningful than discounted cash flow valuation based upon

CAPM discount rates. Because underlying portfolio companies were typically only periodically

revalued (if at all), private equity fund returns are not risk-adjusted by limited partners in a

traditional sense. Alternatively, private equity investors may be skeptical of asset pricing




                                                 18
models that seek to measure risk. As such, far more of their energy is focused on estimating

reasonable cash flows.

       Our analysis of the factors that affect private equity firm hurdle rates also indicates a

deviation from what is typically recommended in finance research and teaching. It suggests that

while PE investors do not use a CAPM-based framework, they do use what appears to be an ad-

hoc multi-factor framework. Some of the underlying ad hoc factors appear related to systematic

risk and others relate to non-systematic risk, i.e., it appears that many private equity firms care

about the total risk of the investment when determining the hurdle rates. This would be

consistent with the lack of risk-adjusting investment returns on the part of limited partners. If

that is the case, then private equity managers would care about adjusting the hurdle rates for

both types of risk. Similarly, the diversity of criteria factored into a PE firm’s gross IRR target

means that unlike a CAPM-based discount rate which would be the same across different

private equity firms, PE firm hurdle rates are likely to vary significantly for similar investments

and are likely to be PE firm, time period, and portfolio company specific.

       Our results concerning exit multiples being based on comparable companies suggests

that PE investors are somewhat skeptical of CAPM-based methods for valuing companies

relative to the use of multiples-based approaches. This is at odds with methods taught in basic

finance courses in which terminal / exit values are calculated using growing perpetuity formulas

with comparable companies methods possibly used as a check on the CAPM-based approach.

       The IRR analysis also embeds the “action plan” of the private equity firm. Typical

holding periods for investments are centered around five years (the typical projection length)

and exit values are determined by industry multiples (what they hope to sell the company for at

exit.) As such, the effort put into the typical IRR model helps private equity firms manage

their portfolio more than DCF does. In essence, the framework of investment evaluation may

be tied to the investment fund structure that imposes limited holding periods and less

transparency on underlying valuation movements, i.e., systematic risk.


                                                19
4.2. Capital Structure

4.2.1. Results

       As Graham and Harvey (2001) among others note, it is a longstanding question in

corporate finance as to whether firms have a target capital structure that is determined by a

trade-off between the costs and benefits of taking on debt. Among the most taught factors that

finance educators argue should influence optimal debt levels is the trade-off theory in which

managers set debt levels to balance the tax of interest deductibility and disciplining of

management with the expected costs of financial distress. The costs of distress include the

inability to invest in valuable future projects, retain customers or retain employees because of

cash constraints or questions about long-term viability. In their survey, Graham and Harvey

find some support for the trade-off theory (as well as some support for pecking order theories).

They also find that CFOs place their greatest focus on retaining financial flexibility and a good

credit rating.

       AJSW (2013) contrast the trade-off theory of capital structure with a market-timing

view. In their view, the trade-off theory implies that industry factors play an important role in

optimal capital structure because industries vary in cash flow volatility—affecting the

probability of distress and agency costs—as well as investment opportunities and tangibility—

affecting the costs of distress. They argue that this implies that buyout firm leverage should be

related to the leverage of public companies in the same industry. In the market timing view, in

contrast, leverage and capital structure respond to economy-wide debt market conditions.

When interest rates are “low,” firms tend to raise more debt. When equity prices are “high,”

firms raise capital by issuing more equity. For a large sample of buyouts, they do not find any

support for the trade-off theories. Buyout capital structures are not related to capital structures

of similar public companies. Instead, consistent with market-timing, leverage is highly related

to economy-wide debt market conditions.


                                                20
       In our survey, we asked the PE investors how they determine the initial capital structure

of their portfolio companies. We included both trade-off and market-timing related factors.

Table 12 reports the typical capital structure that PE investors target at closing. They target a

median debt-to-total capital of 60% and a median debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.0 times. Some

observers will view these ratios as surprisingly low. They are much lower than the ratios that

were common in the 1980s. They also are somewhat lower than the median ratios of 70% and

5.2 times, respectively, in AJSW (2013).

       There are two likely reasons that explain why these survey ratios are lower. First, we

conducted our survey in 2012, a year in which debt ratios and debt availability were lower than

the historical average. Second, a number of the investors in our survey invest in growth equity

as well as buyouts. As their name suggests, growth equity investments are likely to use less

leverage than buyouts.

       We also find that larger and older private equity investors tend to target more levered

capital structures. This is perhaps not surprising given that larger private equity firms target

investments in larger companies that can sustain greater leverage.

       The survey asks what factors the PE investors consider in determining capital structure.

The trade-off theories suggest a role for firm industry, tax benefits, default risk and the ability

to generate operating improvements / reduce agency costs. The Tables 13a and 13b present the

key results. Table 13a reports whether the PE investors consider a particular factor while table

13b reports the rankings of those factors. Both tables 13a and 13b suggest that the trade-off

theory and market timing are equally important. Almost all of the PE investors consider both

industry factors and current interest rates in determining capital structure. These two rank well

above the others in importance. Roughly two-thirds of the PE investors explicitly think about

the trade-off between tax benefits and default risk while the same percentage also say they raise

as much debt as the market will bear. These factors tie for third in importance. Just under

40% consider the ability of debt to force operational improvements in the manner suggested by


                                                 21
Jensen (1989).      Finally, only six firms, or less than 10%, mention financial flexibility as an

important determinant of capital structure. This contrasts sharply with the strong emphasis

on financial flexibility among CFOs in Graham and Harvey (2001).



4.2.2. Discussion

       Our market timing result is very consistent with the result in AJSW (2013). The finding

that PE investors do consider trade-off related factors is not. The question is how can the PE

investor and AJSW results be reconciled? One possible explanation is that it is very difficult for

outside observers like AJSW to measure optimal capital structure. It is unlikely that all public

companies in the same industry have the same optimal capital structure and it also is unlikely

that all public companies are optimizing. In addition, the companies that PE investors select to

invest in are likely to be those that were not optimizing and for whom there is room for

improvement. Both of these factors will introduce noise into the tests conducted by AJSW.

       The fact that most private equity firms do not consider financial flexibility when setting

capital structure is potentially explained by the private equity firm’s ability to inject capital in

the future. Because most private equity firms “own” the company and have access to inside

information, there is no asymmetric information that would create an equity financing

constraint. The private equity firms typically have existing funds with undrawn capital and can

always invest additional equity. In fact, we often see such follow-on equity investments in

situations where portfolio companies make roll-up acquisitions. In these settings, the typical

concern about financial flexibility that were identified in Graham and Harvey (2001) would be

less of a concern.

       Overall, then, the survey indicates that PE investors consider both trade-off theories and

market timing. This is arguably favorable both to the traditional instruction at business schools

and to the more recent advances in behavioral finance.




                                                    22
4.3. Incentives

       Management incentives are supposedly an important piece of financial engineering.

Table 14 is consistent with this. It confirms previous work by Kaplan (1989), Kaplan and

Strömberg (2009) and Acharya et al. (2013) that PE investors provide strong incentives to

portfolio company management. On average, PE investors allocate 17% of company equity to

management and employees. The CEO obtains an average of 8%. The percentages are slightly

lower, at 15% and 6%, respectively, for the larger PE investors who invest in larger companies.

This is significantly higher than equity ownership of senior management in public companies.

For example, Page (2011) finds that the average CEO of a public company between 1993 and

2007 held 3.58% of the company’s equity and the median CEO held only 1.57%.



5. Governance Engineering

       In this section, we consider PE investors’ attitudes towards corporate governance. We

ask two types of questions. First, we consider the structure of the boards of directors of their

portfolio companies. Second, we consider their attitudes towards monitoring, hiring, and firing

top management.

       Table 15a confirms previous work in showing that PE investors prefer small boards of

directors with over 90% including between 5 and 7 members. Larger private equity firms tend

to have portfolio companies with larger boards. Table 15b indicates that PE investors will take

roughly 3 of the board seats while allocating one or two to management and one or two to

outsiders who are not affiliated with the PE firms. Again, the results for board composition are

consistent with previous work and with conventional wisdom.

       Table 16 indicates that PE investors are actively involved in advising their companies in

the great majority of their deals. In fact, the median PE investor claims to be actively involved

in all of his or her deals. Again, it would be surprising if we found otherwise.




                                                 23
       Tables 17 and 18 explore how active the PE investors are in recruiting senior

management teams in their portfolio companies. Table 17 indicates that the majority of PE

investors, almost 70%, invest in the existing management team. They do not recruit their own

senior management team before the investment. This is consistent with the notion that many

private equity firms want to be seen as remaining “friendly” when pursuing transactions.

Management is often critical to successfully executing transactions.

       At the same time, however, a meaningful fraction of PE investors, 31%, do recruit their

own senior management teams before investing. This suggests that different PE investors have

very different investment strategies. It also suggests that the PE investors who bring in their

own team do not place a great deal of weight on the value of incumbency.

       After the investment, roughly 50% of the PE investors end up recruiting their own

senior management team. This is consistent with some of the PE investors becoming more

actively involved in the governance of their companies after the investment. When we combine

the PE investors who recruit their own teams before, after, or both before and after investing,

we find that almost 58% of the PE investors recruit their own senior teams. Again, this

suggests that the PE investors are actively involved in monitoring and governing their portfolio

companies.

       Although it is not possible to ascribe any causality at this point, the cross-sectional

results suggest that the PE investors who recruit their own teams have experienced better past

investment performance. Similarly, larger and global private equity firms are more likely to

recruit their own management teams at some point.



6. Operational Engineering / Value Creation

       In this section, we attempt to explore the ways in which the PE investors attempt to

create value for their investments and add value to their portfolio companies.




                                                24
6.1. Deal Sourcing

       PE investors claim that an important determinant of value creation is the ability to find

or source deals that are proprietary in some sense. Accordingly, we asked several questions

concerning deal sourcing. Table 19 reports the deal funnel experience of our PE investors. For

every hundred opportunities, considered, the average PE investor deeply investigates fewer than

24, signs an agreement with fewer than 14 and closes on only 6. This suggests that PE investors

devote considerable resources to evaluating transactions despite the fact that they will

ultimately invest in only a very few. When we compare the deal funnel at different types of

private equity firms, larger and older private equity firms pass a greater fraction of their deals

through to the next stage. There are two possibilities that can explain this result. First, larger

and older private equity firms may just have higher quality initial deal sourcing and hence do

not need to weed out as many deals at all stages. Alternatively, the larger fund sizes may

reduce the stringency of the deal funnel.

       Table 20 considers the source and proprietary nature of the deals that the PE investor

actually closed. According to the PE investors, almost 36% of their closed deals are

“proactively self-generated,” 7.4% are provided by management and 8.6% come from their

executive network. These arguably have the potential to be proprietary. In contrast, 33% are

investment banking generated, 8.6% come from deal brokers and 4.3% come from other PE

firms. These are unlikely to be proprietary. Smaller and younger private equity firms generally

tend to source more proprietary deals. This likely reflects smaller target deal sizes. Firms that

invest in large and mega deals are less likely to be able to generate proprietary deals given that

their targets are probably more likely to be sold in an auction process. Finally, younger private

equity firms tend to utilize their executive networks more frequently.

       When asked to summarize these sources, the PE investors considered almost 48% of

their closed deals to be proprietary in some way. Unfortunately, we have no way of evaluating




                                                 25
exactly what proprietary means nor can we validate the extent to which the deals truly are

proprietary or advantaged.

       Nevertheless, we think these results indicate that the PE investors explicitly consider the

extent to which their potential investments are proprietary, and attempt to invest in deals that

are.



6.2. Deal Selection

       In order to better understand how PE investors select and differentiate among

investments, we asked them to rank the factors they considered in choosing their investments.

Table 21 reports these results. The most important factor in choosing an investment is the

business model / competitive position of the company. The management team, the PE

investor’s ability to add value and the valuation are the three next most important factors and

are roughly of equal importance. The industry or market of the company and the fit with the

PE investor’s fund are of least importance.

       Two of these results are notable. First, the PE investors put somewhat more weight on

the business than on the management team. This result is highly consistent with the work of

Kaplan, Sensoy, and Strömberg (2009) that shows that at least within the venture capital world,

the business strategies of firms remain far more stable (and hence are more important) than the

stability of management. Second, the importance of the ability to add value suggests that PE

investors take operational engineering and adding value seriously. This also suggests that

different private equity firms are likely to target and value investments differently. Private

equity firms often have particular industry experience and focus. A successful track record in a

particular industry is likely to lead to greater investment focus on a particular sector.

       The survey asked the selection question in another way by asking what drivers of return

PE investors bet on in making investments. Table 22a reports the percentage of PE investors




                                                 26
who view a return driver as important while table 22b reports the ranking of those return

drivers.

           Growth in the value of the underlying business is mentioned as a return driver by 100%

of the PE investors and is the highest ranked return driver. Operational improvements are close

behind, ranked second and mentioned by 97% of the PE investors. Leverage and industry-level

multiple arbitrage—selling at a higher multiple than buying—are mentioned by 76% and 65%,

but rank well-behind growth and operational improvements. These results suggest that PE

investors invest with the expectation or hope of growing the value of the business and improving

operations. Leverage as well as buying low and selling high are viewed as less important.

           Once again, these views may be a reflection of the current private equity environment.

Historical leverage ratios (both during the financial boom as well as in the 1980s) were

substantially higher than they are today for the typical private equity deal. Also, the sheer

growth in the number of private equity firms and capital under management means that there is

more competition for deals and, hence, less ability to buy companies at a cheap price.



6.3. Value Creation

           Given the emphasis on growing the value of the business, our next questions asked the

PE investors to identify the sources of that value creation. We asked them to distinguish

between expected sources of value creation identified before the deal is closed, pre-deal, and

actual sources of value creation, post-deal or after the investment is made.



6.3.1. Pre-investment

           Table 23 lists the pre-investment sources of value creation. There are a large number of

sources of value for each deal. Hence, the total expected sources of value add up to well over

100% indicating that PE investors rely on several sources of value creation.    The most

frequently mentioned source of value is increasing revenue, identified by PE investors as being


                                                  27
important in over 70% of their deals.   Smaller private equity firms identified increasing revenue

more often than larger private equity investors. This is not surprising given that there may be

more room to increase revenues for the smaller deals targeted by smaller private equity

investors. Follow-on acquisitions are also important in more than 50% of their deals. Reducing

costs is identified as being important in only 36% of their deals. Introducing shared services—

where the PE investors help their several portfolio companies aggregate demand for services or

supplies to improve their bargaining power with suppliers—is also related to reduced costs and

is important in 16% of the deals.

       Both increasing sales and reducing costs would fit under operational engineering. If

these answers are accurate (something we discuss in section 7), growth is more important than

reducing costs, suggesting a shift in emphasis from the cost cutting and agency cost reduction in

the 1980s as emphasized in Jensen (1989). It’s possible that the presence of merger and

acquisition activity has led many firms to be more efficient on the cost side, i.e., there may be

less corporate waste today than in the past (Kaplan, 1997).

       Private equity investors also expect to create value in roughly one-third of their

investments by redefining or changing the company’s strategy / business model. In roughly

one-third of their investments, they expect to create value by changing the CEO or CFO and by

changing other members of the senior management team. All of these also would fit under the

rubric of operational engineering. Presumably these actions, if successful, would lead to greater

growth, reduced costs or both. Private equity investors also expect to create value by

improving incentives (61%) and improving corporate governance (47%). These would fit under

the categories of financial and governance engineering discussed in the previous section.

       In slightly under half of their investments, private equity investors expect they are able

to buy at attractive prices, both absolutely (44.3%) and relative to the industry (46.6%). In

roughly half of their investments, they also expect they can facilitate a high value exit. This

suggests that private equity investors believe they create a meaningful amount of value by being


                                                28
able to buy low and sell high. For smaller and younger private equity firms, the ability to

engage in “multiple expansion” is higher. This may reflect the greater frequency of proprietary

deals for these types of private equity firms and the potential to complete transactions at lower

valuations. Among practitioners and limited partners, this would usually be considered a type

of financial engineering, particularly buying low. From an academic perspective, this is difficult

to characterize. It is potentially consistent with taking advantage of asymmetric information,

superior bargaining ability, market timing and an efficient allocation of resources (i.e., selling to

the right buyer).

       We can say that, overall, the answers indicate that PE investors expect to create value

pre-investment from a combination of financial, governance and operational engineering.

Different private equity firms typically express different value drivers. Private equity firms

appear to engage in differentiated investment strategies with different sources of expected value

creation.

       We also asked the PE investors who in their organization is involved in identifying the

(pre-investment) sources of value creation. Table 24 indicates that deal team members—i.e.,

the financial partners—are involved in virtually every deal. Perhaps the more interesting result

is that operating partners—i.e., those primarily with operating rather than financial

experience—are involved in identifying value sources in 45% of the deals. In addition to relying

on operating partners, Table 24 indicates that the PE investors involve outside consultants in

almost 37% of their deals. Smaller and younger private equity firms are less likely to engage

outside consultants in their transactions. Overall then, table 24 suggests that the PE investors

have made a meaningful investment in operational engineering although that investment is

highly variable across firms.




                                                  29
6.3.2. Post-investment

       Table 25 lists post-investment sources of value creation. The third column reports the

difference in the mean result for pre- and post-investment for each variable. The same sources

identified as important pre-investment remain important post-investment except that many of

them increase in importance.

       Increased revenue remains important in roughly 70% of the deals. Reduced costs

increase in importance, rising to 47% of deals, but remain below increased growth. The use of

shared services, redefining the strategy, changing the CEO or CFO, changing other members of

the senior management team also increase by 6% to 14% relative to the pre-deal expected

sources of value. If anything, then, operational engineering sources of value appear to be more

important post-investment than they are identified as or expected to be pre-investment.

Improving incentives and improving corporate governance also remain important sources of

value, increasing by 4% and 5%, respectively, relative to pre-investment expectations.

       Facilitating a high-value exit also becomes somewhat more important with almost 60%

of the PE investors citing this as a post-investment source of value. This may reflect the

historical perspective of private equity firms that were able to take more proprietary deals

public or sell at a higher valuation.

       Post-investment, then, the PE investors continue to claim they create value from a

combination of financial, governance and operational engineering. Overall, the post-investment

sources of value they realize are somewhat greater than the sources of value identified pre-deal.

       We again asked the PE investors who in their organization is involved in identifying the

(post-investment) sources of value creation.   Table 26 indicates that the participants are similar

to those involved pre-investment. Deal team members are involved in virtually every deal.

Operating partners are involved in identifying value sources in 51% of the deals, slightly higher

than the 45% pre-deal, while consultants are involved in 27%, somewhat less than the 37% of

pre-deal.


                                                30
6.4. Exit

       Our final questions relating to value creation concern the exit strategy of PE investors.

Table 27 indicates that PE investors expect to exit roughly one-half of their deals through a sale

to a strategic buyer, i.e., to an operating company in a similar or related industry. In almost

30% of deals, they expect to sell to a financial buyer, i.e., to another private equity investor. In

fewer than 20% of deals, do PE investors expect to exit through an IPO. These percentages

are consistent with, in fact almost identical to, the exit results in Strömberg (2008) that 53% of

deals with known exits are to strategic buyers, 30% are to financial buyers and 17% are through

IPOs. Not surprisingly, there is a significant difference between larger and smaller PE investors.

Larger PE investors expect to exit through an IPO more than 26% of the time while smaller PE

investors expect to do so less than 11% of the time. For the largest deals, it is less likely that

there are many strategic buyers large enough to sell to.

       Tables 28a and 28b report, respectively, the presence and the ranking of factors that PE

investors consider in deciding when to exit. In particular, we are interested in whether private

equity firms believe that they can time the exit markets (either IPO or M&A markets) or if

exits are driven by firm-specific performance. Achieving the expected operational plan and

capital market conditions are the most important and are ranked roughly equally.       They are

important for more than 90% of the PE investors. As with capital structure decisions, this

suggests that PE investors put roughly equal weight on fundamentals and on market timing.

Management’s opinion, competitive considerations and hitting a return target are the next most

important considerations and are ranked roughly equally. They are considered by more than

75% of the PE investors. Considering management’s opinion is consistent with a cooperative /

advisory relationship between PE investors and management. The requirement to hit a return

target is potentially suggestive of an agency problem between the PE investors and their limited

partners in which the private equity firm’s limited partners cannot adjust investment


                                                 31
performance for risk and, hence, the private equity managers maintain nominal return

thresholds.



7. Private Equity Firm Organization

       Up until this point, the survey questions have asked the PE investors to describe what

they do with respect to their portfolio company investments. In this section, we report the

answers to questions about the organization of the PE firms themselves with the idea of

shedding additional light on how they operate and attempt to create value. Historically, private

equity firms were small organizations. Over the past fifteen years, private equity firms have

grown substantially. In this section, we seek to understand how this growth translates into

organizational choices.

       In Table 29, we report how the PE firms are organized. The notable result here is that

only 37% of the PE investors are organized as generalists. This is very different from the

organization of the PE firms in the 1980s when most firms and most individual PE investors

were largely generalists. At the same time, more than 50% of the firms are organized by

industry. Organization by industry likely carries three advantages – PE investors who specialize

in an industry are more likely to be able to find an opportunity in that industry, to be able to

evaluate the opportunity when it appears, and to understand whether and how it is possible to

add value to that opportunity.

       In Table 30, we report the percentage of investment professionals in different

specializations. A majority of employees in our sample firms are deal professionals. An

additional 20% also can be considered deal related because they are involved in deal sourcing

and deal execution, bringing to almost 75% the percentage of employees who are deal oriented.

At the same time, 8.7% of employees are operating professionals, 1.2% are consulting

professionals, 5.7% are shared service professionals and 0.4% are HR professionals for a total of

16% who can be considered exclusively concerned with operational engineering. While this


                                                32
percentage is much lower than the percentage of employees that are deal oriented, it does

indicate that meaningful employee resources are devoted to value creation.

       Table 31 considers the extent to which PE investors make use of other advisors to help

with deal sourcing and with value creation. Almost 50% of the PE investors utilize senior

advisors, a CEO council, or its equivalent. In general, these advisors provide non-financial

advice on businesses. Almost 40% of the PE investors have an advisory board of such advisors.

When we put these together, almost 66% of the PE investors have an advisory board or utilize

senior advisors. The PE investors describe these advisors or executives as helping with deal

flow, assisting with investment due diligence, providing industry-specific information, serving on

boards post-investment, as well as advising on operating and managerial issues post-investment.

Consistent with the earlier evidence on operational engineering, this suggests that many of the

PE investors have made meaningful investments in obtaining operating advice.

       Almost 32% of the PE investors hire strategy consultants to help with operating plans.

When we combine these with the senior advisors and CEO councils, we find that 72% of the PE

investors employ an advisory board, CEO council or strategy consultants. Many employ a

combination of these. Again, this suggests that many of the PE investors have made

meaningful investments in obtaining operating advice. This is perhaps not surprising given the

growth and increased competitiveness within the industry and the expected sources of returns.



8. Concerns

       In our analyses, we have assumed that the PE investor responses are accurate and

interpret the survey accordingly. The PE investors filled out the survey with the assurance that

they would not be identified and that their responses would be aggregated so they could not be

identified. Accordingly, no individual firm has any incentive to report overly positive or

otherwise inaccurate responses. Doing so will not benefit any one individual firm directly. We

recognize, however, it is possible that some PE investors might report overly positively on some


                                                33
questions in the hope that it will cast the PE industry in a more positive light. In this section,

we discuss where we think those incentives and behaviors might affect our results.

       Any reporting biases should have a minimal effect on how PE investors report the

methods they use to value companies. Whether a PE investor uses net present value or IRR

seems uncontroversial. The determinants of target IRR also seem uncontroversial. One area in

valuation where there might be some incentive to overstate is on target IRR. PE investors may

want their limited partners to believe they are targeting higher IRRs than is really the case.

The countervailing factor is that if the target IRR is overstated, limited partners ultimately will

be disappointed and the ability to continue to raise new (and potentially larger) funds may be

reduced.

       We also think it unlikely that the PE investors gave biased answers to the questions on

capital structure. If anything, one might expect them to understate the extent to which they

time the market and use as much leverage as they can. Inconsistent with this, most of the PE

investors claim that debt availability and current interest rates are important considerations.

       It also seems unlikely that PE investors have an incentive to give biased answers to the

questions concerning incentives and boards. Alternatively, one might argue that they have an

incentive to downplay the extent to which they replace incumbent management. To the extent

that PE investors need to partner with incumbent management, it would not be in their interest

to report that they frequently replace incumbents. Inconsistent with this incentive, the majority

of PE investors report that they bring in their own top management at some point.

       The section where there is potentially an incentive to be overly positive is the section on

value creation. To the extent the PE investors want their LPs to believe that they have access

to “proprietary” deals, PE investors may have an incentive to overstate the extent to which

their deals are proprietary. Consistent with this, our PE investors do say that roughly 50% of

their investments are proprietary in some way. As mentioned above, we do not have any way

to evaluate the extent to which this is true. At the same time, however, proprietary deal


                                                34
sourcing suggests that PE investors are able to buy low. One might expect PE investors to

have an incentive not to say they can buy low because it does not reflect operating value

creation on the part of the PE investors. In fact, the PE investors do identify buying low and

selling high as an important source of value.

       To the extent that PE investors want to be known for growing their investments (and

creating jobs) rather than reducing costs (and cutting jobs), they may have an incentive to

overstate the extent to which they rely on growth and understate cost cutting.    The result that

PE investors identify increasing revenue as the most important source of value both pre- and

post-investment is potentially consistent with this. On the other hand, the fact that PE

investors identify reducing costs as more important post-investment than pre-investment is less

consistent with understating cost cutting. Again, a countervailing force here is limited partners

expect to see growth and look for that value creation.

       Overall, then, while the PE investors may have some incentives to shade their survey

answers in some areas, particularly regarding deal sourcing and growth, the answers they

provided do not give us strong reasons to believe that they acted consistently on those

incentives.



9. Firm Types

       The previous sections of this paper examined private equity investor practices in

financial, governance and operational engineering. The analyses consider each practice

separately. In this section, we examine the extent to which certain practices are correlated

across GPs. In doing so, we attempt to measure whether we can classify different groups of GPs

as having different strategies. Our approach is to use the grouping of answers for a given private

equity firm to extract “types” through cluster and factor analyses. We then examine how these

“types” map into our notion of operational, financial, and governance engineering. Finally, we




                                                35
look for variation in firm founder backgrounds and how the types identified above are influenced

by the career histories of the individuals which started the various private equity organizations.



9.1. Variables

       In this section, we create a variety of variables that help identify GP practices using

measures that embody financial, governance and operational engineering. In order to capture

difference in investment selection methods, we create a variable that equals one if the GP’s

primary deal evaluation measure is IRR. We create a measure of proprietary deal sourcing that

sums the fraction of deals that GPs say are self-generated, inbound from management and from

their executive network.

       We create four capital structure / financial engineering variables that help us

characterize the various private equity firms. CSTIME, a variable that measures market

timing behavior, is calculated as the sum of the rankings GPs give to timing factors—“as much

as debt as the market will allow” and “current interest rates and how much the company can

pay”—as important determinants of capital structure. Similarly, CSTRADE explores marketing

timing behavior and is sum of a private equity firm’s rankings for “maximize trade-off between

tax benefits and risk of default” and “industry that the firm operates in” —as important

determinants of capital structure. We also create two variables that measure the overall

targeted debt levels that the private equity firms say the typically employ. DTCAP is simply

the typical debt to total capital ratio that the private equity manager states they seek while

DTEB measures the typical debt to EBITDA ratio.

       Two variables measure management change that private equity managers engage in both

before and after the investment. First, we define a variable RECRUITB that equals one if the

GP typically recruits its own senior management team before investing. Second, we define a

variable RECRUITBA that equals one if the GP recruits its own senior management team

before or after investing.


                                                36
       The next set of variables is associated with sources of value that private equity firms say

they identify or look to provide. COSTRED measures the fraction of deals for which the GP

expects prospective cost reductions prior to the investment to be an important source of value.

REVGROW measures the fraction of deals for which the GP expects prospective revenue

growth prior to the investment to be an important source of value. CHCEO is the fraction of

deals for which the GP expects that changing the CEO will be an important source of value

prior to the investment. BUYLO is a measure of the general partners’ belief that they can

create value prospectively by purchasing a company at a low price. The variable is calculated

as the sum of the fraction of deals a GP expects that buying low, buying low relative to the

industry, or facilitating a high-value exit will be important sources of value. OPPART is simply

the fraction of deals that involve operating partners.

       We also create variables that measure the factors that GPs find most important in an

investment decision. INVBUS is the sum of the ranks given to the business model and the

industry in an investment decision. INVMGMT is the rank given to the management team.

INVADDV is the rank given to the ability to add value.

       Related to these, we create variables that measure the return drivers that GPs bet on.

GROWTH equals one if the GP’s top ranking is growth in the value of the business. OPIMP

equals one if the GP’s top ranking is operating improvements. MULTARB equals one if the

GP’s top ranking is industry level multiple arbitrage.

       Some univariate correlations are worth noting (although they are not reported in a

table). High debt to total capital and to high debt to EBITDA are positively correlated with

capital structure timing, cost reductions and multiple arbitrage while negatively correlated with

proprietary deals, revenue growth, and investing in management. Investing in adding value is

positively correlated with operating improvements, cost reductions, operating partners, and

changing CEOs, but negatively correlated with investing in management. Recruiting a CEO

beforehand is correlated with proprietary deals, revenue growth, and buying low / selling high.


                                                37
Finally, proprietary deals use less debt, less market timing, less cost reduction, and more

growth.



9.2. Cluster Analysis

       We first use cluster analysis to divide the firms into groups that allow us to explore how

different firm characteristics co-vary. Cluster analysis groups answers in such a way that the

private equity firms within a given cluster are more similar to each other than they are to

private equity firms in other clusters. We use partition clustering which divides “the

observations into a distinct number of non-overlapping groups” (kmeans in Stata). We restrict

the sample to the 58 firms with complete data responses. We report our results with three

clusters. The results are qualitatively similar with four or five clusters.

       Table 32 reports the results. The second cluster is characterized in terms of our notions

of operational, financial, and governance engineering. The firms in this cluster are more likely

to say they choose capital structure using trade-off considerations, are more likely to recruit an

outside CEO / change the CEO, are more likely to focus on operating improvements including

cost reductions and revenue growth, and are more likely to use operating partners. Many of

these differences are statistically significant (in univariate tests) between clusters 1 and 2. In

sum, cluster 2 firms seem to say that they focus more heavily on implementing operating

improvements and bringing in new management.

       Cluster 1 includes firms that say they engage in the most financial engineering and least

operational engineering. They are less likely to use capital structure tradeoffs, less likely to

mention adding value, operating improvements, cost reductions and operating partners, and are

more likely to buy low and sell high. The firms in this cluster also tend to be smaller than those

in the other two clusters. Firms in the first cluster also tend to give their management teams a

larger equity stake in the business. The third cluster is intermediate between the first two on

financial and operational engineering.


                                                  38
9.3. Factor Analysis

       As an alternative to cluster analysis, we use factor analysis to extract the main

dimensions of variation in the characteristics of our sample firms. In factor analysis, one seeks

to identify correlations among observed variables in terms of underlying unobserved factors of a

smaller dimension. Essentially, factor analysis models the observed variables as a function of

the unobserved factors.

       Table 33 reports the factor loadings. The first three factors explain almost two-thirds of

the variance in the data and have natural interpretations. The first factor has positive loadings

on debt levels, operating improvements, cost reductions, operating partners and adding value

and negative loadings on growth, revenue growth, proprietary deal and investing in the business.

As with the cluster analysis, this suggests that some firms focus on operating improvements

while others focus on buying good businesses where they have some proprietary sourcing

advantage.   The second factor has its highest positive loadings on changing the CEO, recruiting

a CEO before the deal closes while having negative loadings on investing in management and

operating improvements. This suggests a strong tendency for firms to differ in the extent to

which they invest in new management versus incumbent. The third factor has high positive

loadings on debt levels, capital structure timing and assets under management while having

negative loadings on adding value and operating improvements. This suggests a factor that is

operating improvements versus financial engineering.

       Both the cluster analysis and the factor analysis appear to divide firms into those that

have a focus on operating improvements versus financial engineering and those that have a focus

on investing in new management versus the incumbent. These results provide one expected and

one unexpected result. First, we do not find it surprising that private equity firms pursue

strategies that are largely based on financial engineering and others pursue strategies based on

operational engineering. In the next section, we explore whether these differences result from


                                                39
variation in the career history of the private equity firm founders. The different firm strategies

towards incumbent management, however, are surprising. The importance of people and

incentive alignment has been well established within the private equity industry. What has not

been explored are the distinctive approaches to solving these people issues. Future research

should explore the effectiveness of these various approaches.



10. Founder Types and Firm Types.

       In this section, we consider whether PE firm strategies are related to the characteristics

of the founding general partners. We classify the founding general partners of each of the PE

firms in our sample. In our sample of firms, we gathered information on the identity of firm

founders from the private firms’ web pages or news articles. Education and career histories were

then gathered from the same sources or via LinkedIn.

       A founding general partner is classified as “financial” if the GP worked in investment

banking, commercial banking, investment management, or had previously been a chief financial

officer. We “Operational” GPs are those founders that had prior work history in consulting,

operations, or general management. Finally, we classify a founding general partners has having

a “private equity” background if the GP came from another PE or venture capital firm prior to

founding this one. For each firm, we calculate the average background of the firm by simply

classifying the fraction of founders with each type of career history. We then perform a cluster

analysis on those three variables (fraction of each career history) and classify 27 firms as having

a finance background, 25 firms as having an operational background, and 9 firms as having a

private equity background.

       In Table 34 we explore how these types relate to specific strategies. Private equity firms

founded by financial general partners appear more likely to favor financial engineering and

investing with current management. Private equity firms that have founders with private

equity experience appear to be the most strongly engaged in operational engineering. They are


                                                 40
more likely to invest with the intention of adding value, to invest in the business, to look for

operating improvements, to change the CEO after the deal, and to reduce costs. Firms founded

by general partners with operational backgrounds have investment strategies that fall in

between the other two groups.

       These results, while preliminary, do seem to indicate that career histories of firm

founders have persistent effects on private equity firm strategy. This result is similar to the

work of Bertrand and Schoar (2003) that demonstrate persistent effects of senior management in

organizations they lead in terms of firm strategy. The strategies identified for private equity

firms clearly aligns with the firm founders careers. While these results are rather preliminary,

future research should explore whether investments that align with the “strength” of the firm

founders do better or worse in the long-run than do investments that deviate from these

“strengths.”



11. Conclusion

       Over the past decade, academic finance has explored the impact of PE firms in a number

of areas by examining sometimes limited sets of data. In this paper, we attempt to highlight

the impact of PE investors utilizing different data. We report what PE investors say they do

by tabulating the results of a survey of PE investing practices. Because PE investors are highly

educated, have strong incentives to maximize value, and have been very successful, it seems

likely that their practices also have been successful. In particular, we are interested in how

many of their responses correlate with what academic finance knows and what it teaches. Do

private equity investors do what the academy says are “best practices?”

       We find that very few investors use DCF or net present value techniques to evaluate

investments, contrary to what one might expect. Rather, they rely on internal rates of return

and multiples of invested capital. This contrasts with the results in Graham and Harvey

(2001) who find that CFOs use net present values as often as internal rates of return.     The


                                                 41
result also conflicts with the focus on net present value in most business school finance courses.

Furthermore, few PE investors use the capital asset price model to determine a cost of capital.

Instead, PE investors typically target a return on their investments well above a CAPM-based

rate. Target IRRs also seem to be adjusted by different PE firms utilizing different factors.

Hence, it seems likely that PE firms will have different target IRRs for the same deals.

       The fact that they do not use DCF techniques is interesting. It may indicate that IRR

and MOIC techniques are sufficiently robust or effective that DCF techniques are not necessary.

Alternatively, it may indicate some practical deficiency with DCF techniques, especially in the

private equity setting where fund structures limit investment horizons and there is considerable

asymmetric information between general and limited partners. These settings may make

managing via IRR-based investment decisions better.

       The fact that PE investors target returns that exceed CAPM-based returns is consistent

with their believing that they add meaningful value to their investments and that they need to

do so in order to generate their compensation. As the industry becomes more competitive, it

will be interesting to see if target hurdle rates come down.

       We also find that PE investors believe that absolute, not relative performance is most

important to their LP investors. The focus on absolute performance is notable given the intense

focus on relative performance or alphas for public market investments. There are two possible

explanations for this. First, LPs, particularly pension funds, may focus on absolute returns

because their liabilities are absolute. Alternatively, the chief investment officers of the LPs

choose a private equity allocation based on relative performance, but the professionals who

make the investment decisions care about absolute performance or performance relative to other

PE firms. We believe that the advent of greater dissemination of risk-based performance

benchmarks like PMEs is likely to affect the view of limited partners and potentially trickle

back down to the private equity general partners.




                                                 42
       In choosing the capital structures for their portfolio companies, PE investors appear to

rely equally on factors that are consistent with capital structure trade-off theories and those

that are consistent with market timing. Again, these results are somewhat different from those

for the CFOs in Graham and Harvey (2001). The market timing result is consistent with the

results in the finding in AJSW (2013). This result is arguably favorable both to the traditional

instruction at business schools and to the more recent advances in behavioral finance.

       PE investors expect to provide strong equity incentives to their management teams and

believe those incentives are very important. They also structure smaller board of investors with

a mix of insiders, PE investors and outsiders.

        Finally, PE investors say they place a heavy emphasis on adding value to their portfolio

companies, both before and after they invest. The sources of that added value, in order of

importance, are increasing revenue, improving incentives and governance, facilitating a high-

value exit or sale, making additional acquisitions, replacing management and reducing costs.

Consistent with adding operational value, the PE investors make meaningful investments in

employees and advisors who provide advice and help in implementing operating improvements.

       While we recognize that it is possible that some PE investors might report overly

positively on some questions in the hope that it will cast the PE industry in a more positive

light, particularly in some aspects of deal sourcing and value creation, the answers they

provided do not give us strong reasons to believe that they have a meaningful impact on our

findings and conclusions.

       We finish with exploratory analyses to consider how financial, governance and

operational engineering practices covary within PE firms. The analyses suggest that different

firms take very different strategies. For example, some focus much more heavily on operational

engineering while others rely heavily on replacing incumbent management. These investment

strategies are strongly influenced by the career histories of the private equity firm founders. It




                                                 43
will be interesting (and, with these data, possible) to see which of these strategies, if any,

exhibit superior performance in the future.
