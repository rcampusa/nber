        LIFE-CYCLE EFFECTS ON CONSUNPTION AND RETIREMENT

                             ABSTRACT


        The effects on consumption and retirement of characteristics of

 the life cycle, especially the length of the horizon, are examined.

 At any given age people will work more and consume less if they expect

 to live longer. This and other propositions are tested on several sets

 of data. The Terman sample of gifted individuals (320 in 1972, 228 in

 1977) is used to relate work status to the length of the horizon, as

proxied by parents longevity. The results suggest the expected positive

effect on effort, but its magnitude is quite small. The panel from the

Retirement History Survey is used, and life—cycle effects on consumption

and retirement are estimated jointly for 1973 and 1975. There is a weak

small effect of a more distant horizon (proxied by the number of living

parents) in increasing work effort and a stronger, but still fairly small

effect in reducing consumption; goods and leisure are consumed jointly,

suggesting their complementarity in household production; and spending

propensities out of Social Security wealth are far below those out of

pension wealth. The small effect of changes in the horizon on work effect

suggests the rapid secular increase in longevity has produced a dispropor-

tionate increase in people's lifetime demand for leisure. The implied

small increase in lifetime income and the slight reduction in consumption

among persons with longer horizons indicate that increased longevity has

not been met with sufficient spending cuts to enable people to maintain

real consumption over their longer lifetimes.

 I.   Introduction


         There has been a boom in empirical research on life—cycle models

 of choice about consumption and labor supply. Yet with very few exceptions

 (Feldstein, 1977, and Skinner, 1981) these studies exclude variables

 that even implicitly represent such crucial life—cycle factors as

 length of horizon, number and spacing of children, other family members

who must be supported, etc. This study attempts to remedy these defects

by adding such life—cycle measures to empirical models of consumption and

labor supply of older workers, a group for which such variables may be

especially important.

        I examine here whether there are differences in the propensity

to retire among individuals with different life expectancies. If so, we

may infer that the tremendous increases in life expectancy that have

occurred have led to lower labor force participation rates among older

persons (because there are more very old people).21 This finding should

carry over into the consumption function: People with greater expected

lifetimes should consume less, other things equal, if they choose to consume

most of that greater lifetime as leisure.

        Most recent empirical work on life—cycle behavior has concentrated

on savings (or asset accumulation) and retirement              I consider

consumption and retirement decisions ointly for several reasons.-'

Information on current saving in the available micro data sets appears to

be subject to very large errors. Also, the social insurance programs

whose effects provide much of the impetus for recent empirical work on

life—cycle models are aimed at maintaining consumption (Hamermesh, l982a);

that being the case, it seems worthwhile to examine consumption directly


                                    1
                                   2



rather than to make inferences about the need for such programs by looking

at asset holdings. Finally, jointness in decisions about goods consumption

and labor supply is implicit in the theory of household production; the

analysis of what determines these choices should thus be aided by

considering this jointness in empirical work.

       Section II below provides the motivation for the empirical work

with a brief derivation of how the horizon affects choices about consump-

tion and retirement. Section III examines retirement choices in the

Terman sample of gifted individuals, while Section IV reports on estimates

of consumption functions and labor supply using data from the Social

Security Administration's Retirement History Survey. These two data sets

are the only ones available that include information on consumption and/or

labor supply along with data that allow us to form proxies for the

respondent s horizon.


II. The Horizon, Wealth and Optimal Consumption and Labor Supply


       Let the typical individual maximize discounted lifetime utility

over goods consumption, C, and fraction of time spent at leisure, L:


         U [C(t), L(t)} e   dt,                                           (1)



where p is the rate of time preference. He faces a lifetime wealth

constraint:


       werT + wJ [l_L(t)]eTt] dt =       B +J C(t) er[T_tl dt,            (2)



where W is initial wealth, B is a planned bequest, w is the wage rate

and r the real rate of interest. Let:
                                                          3

                      n+l                 n+l
               -    kC              akL
                     n+l                 n+1

where a, k, n > 0 are parameters. Then the first—order conditions for

maximizing (1) subject to (2) are:


          kChlePt + Xe1T_t] =                   0;                                              (3)


          akLnePt + wer[Tt] = 0;                                                                (4)



and (2), where A is a Lagrangean multiplier indicating the increment to

lifetime utility of another dollar of, for example, initial wealth, and

I have dropped the t indexes from C and L.

          Solving (2)—(4) for C and L in terms of the parameters of the

utility function, W, w, B, p and r, yields:


          C = 6e6t[WerT_B]/[l_e_6T](l_w[l_(l/a)hIf]),                                           (5)


where 6 =          [r—p}/n,       and:

                       1/n
          L = [1]             C     .
                                                                                                (6)

One can demonstrate, albeit messily, that aC/ST < 0; since -                          > 0,
aL/aT < 0 also. Given the same wealth, wage rate and planned bequest,

a more distant horizon lowers consumption of goods and leisure at each age.

          Consider the effect of                 greater planned bequests on consumption

of goods and leisure. It is easily seen from (5) and (6) that aC/3B <                          0,
aL/aB <   0.       Also, ac/aw, aL/aW >              0:       Given the specific utility function

needed to derive analytic results, leisure is a normal good.

      Writing each individual's leisure and consumption choices generally:


      L. = F(X..,            T., B.., W) + Oily
                                    4


and

       C. = G(Z.,,   T., B,, w.)
                      1   1   1 + e.i2
                                         ,                               (8)
        1      1


where the X. and Z. are vectors of other factors affecting individual l's
           1      1
leisure and goods consumption. The e. are stochastic error terms,

present in (7) and (8) because there are components of leisure and goods

consumption that are affected by unmeasured factors. Perhaps the major

consideration on these disturbances is the failure of (7) and (8) to

account for household production. To the extent that this is important,

goods and leisure are complements in the production of commodities. Thus

an individual with unusually large amounts of leisure at a point in time

will consume larger amounts of goods, other things equal; we should thus

observe E(O. 0. ) > 0.

III. Evidence on Retirement: The Terman Sample, 1972 and 1977


       In this section I study retirement behavior among male participants

in the Terman study of gifted individuals, people interviewed at Irregular

intervals over more than fifty years. I use data from 1960, 1972, and

1977 interviews to examine retirement status in 1972 and 1977. Members

of the sample were chosen on the basis of their outstanding performance

on intelligence tests; while the sample is not representative of the

population as a whole, it should be ideal for testing predictions of life—

cycle theory, insofar as these people presumably have an above—average

ability to make the calculations implicit In that theory. (See Leibowitz,

1974, and Tomes, 1981, for further description and uses of this sample.)

       The sample is uniquely suited for some of my purposes. In addition

to the usual demographic information, it contains data on each respondent's
                                    5


 parents' ages or, if they are deceased, ages at death, as well as on the

 respondent's age when each parent died. Also available are data on the

 respondent's living children and siblings. Unfortunately, no consumption

 or spending data exist in the sample, nor is there any information that

 allows us to construct measures of wealth.

        Of the 654 men who completed interviews in at least one of the years

 1960, 1972, and 1977, only 320 could be used in the estimates for 1972 and

 only 228 in 1977. The criteria for inclusion were: 1) Complete informa—

 tion on all the relevant variables (see below); 2) Between ages 55 and 70

 in the year under study; 3) Worked in each year between 1956 and 1959;

and 4) Both parents deceased in the year under study. The final sample

decreases sharply in size between 1972 and 1977, chiefly because the

passage of time removes many respondents from the range of ages included.V

       With the exception of data available only in 1977 on the presence

of a requirement for mandatory retirement on the respondent's current or

last job, the variables included in the vector X are measured

identically in the 1972 and 1977 samples. Because no wealth measures are

available, I include a vector of age measures designed to proxy for

provisions of pension and Social Security programs. This includes the

respondent's age, and dummy variables for whether he is less than 62 or

is at least 65. Similarly, under the admittedly restrictive assumption

that the respondent's earnings capacity throughout his later working life

is a constant fraction of the average for his age, I use his average

earnings between 1956 and 1959 to measure his market opportunities in
              4j
1972 (or 1977).— Also included as reflecting the market opportunities

facing the respondent are dummy variables for his occupation, equalling

one if he is a professional worker, or one if he is a manager. Reflecting
                                     6

differences in potential labor supply is a dummy variable equalling one if

the man's self—assessed health status is good or very good. and another

equalling one if he has a working spouse.-'

           To measure differences in the horizon among individuals I form

an explicit measure of the subjective horizon, T, as defined as:

              =   e0   + 3NOLD. — 2NYNG.   ,                              (9)

where e0 is the actuarial life expectancy of a white male the same age

as person i; NOLD (NYNG) are the number(s) of parents who lived to age

80 or beyond (did not live to age 60). These latter variables are multiplied

by factors that roughly reflect the transformation people make from their

parents' objective length of life to their forecasts of their own horizons

(see Hamermesh, l982b). While much of the variation in T is due to age, a

substantial amount is also due to variation in parents' longevity."

       The role of bequest motives is represented by the number of living

children the respondent has. Assuming that additional children increase

total net transfers from parents to children——either by increasing the

total planned bequest or decreasing the respondent's lifetime wealth

available for his own use——persons with more children will consume less

leisure."1 The coefficients on this measure thus provide an indirect

test of whether the expected net transfer is from older to younger

persons.

       The final life—cycle variable is the respondent's age when his

latter remaining parent died. If his parents left a bequest later in his

life, the annuity value of the bequest will be greater. Greater age when

the second parent dies will produce a positive income effect on the

probability of being retired, so long as the bequest was not completely

expected. On the other hand, if on net the respondent supported his
                                    7



 parents for a greater part of his own adult life, the fraction of his

 lifetime wealth available for his own consumption later will be lower.

 In that case the variable proxies below—average wealth and should produce

 a negative effect on the probability of being retired. Here too we can

 test for the direction of net intergenerational transfers, in this case

                                         8/
 between older workers and their parents.—

        I proxy the consumption of leisure by the respondent's self—reported

 work status. I combine the responses into three choices:   not working,

working part—time, or working full—time. Alternatively, I form the

 dichotomous variable, working full or nearly full time, or not. The

probability of being in each of the three categories (two in the second

case) is estimated as a multinomial (binomial) logit function.

       In the first columns of Table 1 and 2 I list the means of the

life—cycle and economic variables. How atypical the sample is is shown

by these: Only ten percent of the respondents were not professional or

managerial workers; and average earnings in 1956—59 were over $16,000 per
annum.-9 The sample is clearly far more affluent than the population

and has far more human capital embodied in it.   Despite these economic

differences, though, the indicators of the respondents' demographic status

are not unreasonable. The average respondent's father died at age 70,

his mother at age 74. These figures are quite consistent with differences

in life expectancy between the sexes for persons who survive to the age

of child—bearing and rearing. The number of children living is low but nearly
                                         10/ In
consistent with observed population figures.—   short, though their

economic opportunities differ sharply from those of the general population,

their demographic characteristics do not. Not surprisingly, given the

aging in the Terman sample, the mean age of persons included in the
                                         8

estimates rises from 62.5 almost to 66 between 1972 and 1977. Finally,

the fraction of respondents not working full—time rises sharply between

1972 and 1977, with most of the shift being from full—time to part—time

work rather than to complete retirement.

       The estimated logit coefficients and their accompanying t—statistics

for the money and life—cycle variables are shown for 1972 and 1977 in

Tables 1 and 2, columns (2)—(4). (lalso list the derivatives evaluated at

the means of the other variables for each of the life—cycle variables.)

Nearly all the estimates are consistent with expectations about the impacts

of the X variables' Aging increases the probability of being fully

retired, and seems to have (in 1972 at least) some effect in increasing

that of being partly retired as well.

       Those with greater full—time earnings during their peak earnings

years are significantly less likely to be completely retired, and less

likely, but not significantly so, to be partly retired.   The effects are

not large, though: In 1972 someone with potential earnings 10 percent

above the mean is 1.4 percent less likely than average to be fully retired,

and .2 percent less likely to be partly retired. In 1977 the corresponding

differences are 2.3 percent and .4 percent.

       Consider now the effects of the respondents number of children

and the age when his second parent died, variables designed to reflect the

impact of expected intergenerational transfers on labor   supply?' In
both samples persons with more children have a lower probability of being

partly or completely retired. The effects are almost always significant,

and they are also fairly sizable: At the sample means a two standard—

deviation increase in the number of children decreases the probability of

being fully retired by nearly 10 percentage points in 1972 (15 percentage
                                       11


  points in 1977). The presence of additional children
                                                            clearly represents
  a negative wealth effect on the demand for leisure in this older population;

  on net, persons in this sample appear to expect less support in their old

 age from their children than the sum of their planned bequest and their

 support of those children while rearing them.      Implicitly the net transfer
 is from members of this older generation to their children.

        In the 1972 sample the coefficients on the individual's age when

 his second parent died are positive but not significantly different from

 zero; in 1977, though, these coefficients are negative and nearly

 significant. Accounting for all transfers from their parents to this

 generation of older persons, the results imply at least that the net

 transfer was not positive. If we interpret this coefficient as a wealth

 effect, we may infer that the respondents transferred at least as much

 wealth to their parents (presumably
                                       supporting them in their old age) as
 they received in the form of bequests.

       How can one explain the apparent anomaly that members of this

sample implicitly have made or expect to make positive net transfers to

their children, yet did not receive positive net transfers from their

parents? Several alternatives seem consistent with the nature of the

sample. First, persons in the sample are unusually successful relative

to others of their cohort; insofar as there is some regression to the

mean ability, neither their parents nor their
                                                  offspring are likely to have
been or be so well off relative to others in their cohorts. If they

behave altruistically, they would have made net transfers both to their

parents and their offspring. A second rationale is based on unobserved

changes in net wealth. This sample reached retirement age at the time

when the rate of return on one's Social
                                            Security contributions and the
                                  12



lifetime Social Security wealth net of taxes were greatest in the program's

history. Because this group is implicitly receiving a large subsidy from

members of its children's generation, the net wealth transfer from their

children may in fact be small and thus of the same magnitude as transfers

from the respondents to their parents. A third rationale is provided by

Caidwell (1978) and Willis (1981): In a demographic transition net wealth

flows cease going from children to parents and begin moving in the other

direction. To demonstrate that the sample is in the transition generation

I would have to show that their parents had many siblings, but that they

and their children have few. As Tables 1 and 2, and footnote 8, show, the

latter two conditions exist. Unfortunately, there are no data on the
                             13'
respondents' aunts and unc1es.

       In 1972 there is fairly good evidence supporting the hypothesis

that a farther horizon reduces the probability of retirement. This is

consistent with life—cycle theory, and is even stronger when we remember

that we include age separately in the equations and do not attribute

 its effects on retirement to maximizing behavior. Despite this

 consistency the magnitude of the effect is small. A two standard—deviation

 difference in T at each age 55 and up results in a difference in the

 expected years of full— and part—time work remaining to a 55—year—old of

 only 1.7 years. Since the extra longevity implied by such an increase

 is 4.2 years, most of the extra longevity that people with longer—lived

 parents project is consumed as leisure.1 The fraction of the extra

 lifetime spent working is far less than would be consistent with a simple

 Modigliani—Brumberg (1954) model that makes leisure time a fixed fraction

 of total lifetime. In 1977 a more distant horizon increases the

 probability that the respondent is retired. Though the effect implies
                                       13


  only a small reduction in working life
                                            as a fraction of the extra years
  of longevity implicit in a two standard—deviation rise in
                                                            T, it is in the
                      15/
  unexpected direction.—

         This striking difference in the
                                            results——estimated coefficients
  significantly different from zero but of
                                             Opposite signs—_clearly requires
  some explanation. One possibility is that I have misspecif led
                                                                 the model
 by interpreting the age variables
                                      as proxying the provisions of the Social
 Security system, when they
                              may Instead partly be representing the horizon.
 To account for this
                       Possibility, the !nultlnomial logit was reestimated

without the age variables; the results are shown in the last
                                                             two columns
of Tables 1 and 2.
                    This respecification Increases
                                                   the negative effect of
the horizon on the
                   Probability of retirement in the 1972 sample, so much
so that an extra year of life
                              expectancy adds nearly a year to the expected
work life. In the 1977
                        sample, though, the effect on retirement is still
very small, though it becomes negative.

       Another possible explanation is that the results on T differ
                                                                    as
people age. However, interacting T with age did not change the
                                                                 sharp
difference between the
                       samples in the effects of T on retirement
probabilities. Yet another
                            Possibility is that a few outliers in each

sample are producing the anomaly. To test this the equations in columns

(2)—(4) were reestimated using the 183 men who appeared in both samples.

In the binomial logit equations the
                                      partial derivatives of the probability
of retirement with respect to T were —.019 and .049 ——
                                                          less   negative than
the results in Tables 1 and 2.
                                 (The multinomial logit results were
similar.) Randomness in the sample did not cause the difference in the
results between the two years)1

      A final, though not testable
                                      possibility rests on the changes in
the Social Security system that took place as the sample aged between
                                                                      1972
                                     14


and 1977. The value of Social Security wealth increased sharply between

1972 and 1977 because of the one—time increase in benefits in 1972 and

the double—indexing of them thereafter. These presumably unexpected

increases represented a much larger increase in wealth to persons with

longer horizons (since Social Security benefits are paid to eligible

recipients until their death). That being the case, the proxy for the

length of the horizon may in 1977 also be a proxy for windfall Social

Security wealth, though it would not have been such in 1972. If so, I would

expect the horizon variable to produce a positive effect on the probability

of being retired even though it produced a negative impact in 1972.

       At the very least we may conclude that the people in this sample

consume a very high fraction of additional subjective years of remaining

life as leisure; differences in the length of the horizon produce only

small differences in the length of the working life.    This finding is

inconsistent with the simplest versions of life—cycle theory.    It may

 though, stem from a lack of data on wealth that a specification grounded

 properly in that theory requires, or from a similar lack that prevents

 estimation of the effects on goods consumption jointly with those on

 leisure.


IV.   Evidence    on Consumption and Labor Supply: The Retirement History
            Survey, 1973 and 1975


        In this section I address many of the same issues discussed in the

 previous section, as well as the additional ones involved in testing for

 the effects of life—cycle variables on consumption and for the nature of

 the jointness between consumption and retirement.    I use the Retirement


 History Survey (RHS) data, available biennially beginning in 1969 on a
                                        15



  sample of over 11,000 persons ages 58—63 in 1969.          This sample is the only
  one that has data on labor.force behavior and
                                                     a large part of consumer

  spending; physical and pension wealth; and on the life status of the

  parents of the respondent and his wife. Further, the data have been linked

  to Social Security wealth,

            I focus the analysis on the respondent's behavior in 1973 and 1975,

 when they were 62—67 and 64—69 years respectively, Of the over 8,000

 persons alive in the sample in 1975, 4,008 were white men married to the

 same spouse from 1969-75, Disqualifications
                                                    that 1) The wife be at least
 age 56 and less than 80 in 1975; 2) The man not be
                                                          self.-employed, in the
 military or in the public sector on his current and most recent job: and

 3) Information be available on family
                                             earnings, retirement status, spending
 in the various consumption
                               categories, and the life status of the couple's

 parents, reduced the sample to 1,798 in 1973, and 1,422 in 1975,

           All of the life—cycle variables are included in both the

 consumption and leisure.-demnd equations. In addition to the three wealth

measures and the horizon (all discussed below),
                                                      both spouses' ages
household size and number of children
                                         are also included. Departing from the
standard linear expenditure system
                                      framework, I include duimny variables for
residence in large or inediumsize S}ISAs only in the consumption equation,

to reflect differences in product prices facing persons in the sample.

Also included are the household's aftertax
                                                 earnings.

          Clearly, earnings cannot be included in the leisure.-demand
                                                                             equation.
Rather than attempting to use a direct measure of the market opportunities

facing older workers, I proxy these b.y a vector of human capital variables.

(See Gordon—Blinder, 1980, for an attempt to circumvent the simultaneity

between wages and retirement status us;ing a more complex econometric
                                   16



methodology.) Included in this vector are occupational dummy variables

f or professional and managerial workers and for clerical and sales workers.

(These are based on the man's current or most recent job.) Dummy variables

for persons with a college degree or more, and for those with a high—school

diploma, are included, as is the individual's selfreported health status

two years before the survey date. Also included to measure the man's

reservation wage is a dummy variable equalling one if he is at least 65,

and another equalling one if the wife works.

          In both the goods and leisure demand equations I include measures

of the household's total wealth. In the former these enable us to infer

how rapidly the household is depleting its assets over its remaining

lifetime; in the latter they can show the size of income effects, In each

year 1973 and 1975 I use the wealth measure computed as of two years

earlier (except for financial and real estate wealth, for which data are not

available in 1973). The lagged values are chosen to avoid a simultaneity

between them and consumption and labor supply. The three wealth -measures

included are:   1) Social Security wealth. This is computed using the Social

Security earnings records that have been appended to the RHS, The benefit

formula for 1971 or 1973 is used along with the formula that relates past

earnings to the monthly benefit. Total benefits include dependents' and

survivors' benefits (and account for actuarial reduction for workers who

retired before age 65))21 The benefit stream is assumed constant in real

terms, and is discounted using a rate of 2 percent, Each household's Social

Security wealth is based on the 1969-7l mortality tables, then adjusted

proportionately to differences in individual's horizons (based on (10) below).

The longer the horizon, the greater the present value of the indexed annuity

that constitutes Social Security benefits; 2) Pension wealth, The variable is
                                        17


   calculated using the ages when the man and his wife
                                                              expect to receive, or
   actually began receiving a pension, and the amount of that
                                                              pension. Each
   spouse's pension (if there is one) is projected to remain
                                                             constant in nominal
  dollars; the real stream of benefits
                                        is assumed to erode at 6
                                                                 percent per year,
  and IS discounted back
                          at 2 percent per year, It too is based on life
                                                                           tables,
  adjusted for differences
                            among households in the length of the horizon.
  3) Other wealth. Reported
                                debts are subtracted from reported assets.
  The net value of
                     owner—occupied housing is included, as are the net values
  of any businesses or farms that are owned by the
                                                          couple. There is no
  measure of human wealth.
                             Instead, I use after—tax
                                                            earnings, which include
  both permanent flows out of human wealth and
                                                      transitory effects, in the goods
  consumption equations.

        The life—cycle variables
                                   are less adequate than those used in the
 previous section because of the lack of data. As before,
                                                           I use the number
 of living children to represent possible bequest/early
                                                        support motives
 or to represent expectations
                              about support in old age. The proxy for the
 length of the horizon is:


        T. =   .5[e°     + e0 + 3(NOLD -
         1

any surviving parent is at least 80, so that the couple projects its

longevity as assumed in (9). The fraction of time spent at leisure,

one minus the product of hours worked per week on the most recent job

and weeks worked in the past two years, divided by 40 hours times 120

weeks, is used to represent demand for leisure)' Consumption, or, more

accurately, spending, contains all those categories for which usable data

were available. In both years these include food consumed at home and

away from home; nonfood grocery items; vacations, and the cost of renting

or owning a house (including utilities, taxes and debt service). In 1973
                                                          in 1975 also adds
the data also include transportation expenses; spending

funds allocated for charity, gifts, "fun," "chores," and dues. (See

Hamermesh, 1982c, for description of the construction of these spending

flows. As I show there, despite their incompleteness

half of spending is covered), they represent both the means and individual

variation in total spending quite well.)

       The wealth figures are quite reasonable, as suggested by their

means, shown in Tables 3 and 4.   The equations describing goods consumption

 and leisure demand are estimated jointly as a system of seemingly unrelated

 equations. The estimates of the parameters describing the responses of

 consumption of goods and leisure to the life—cycle, wealth and earnings

                                     (Presumably these people report their
  wealth and earnings more carefully.)      However, an increase from the
  minimum to the maximum T in the reduced
                                              1975 sample (a 36 percent increase)
  only reduces current consumption by 17 percent. (The effect is smaller

  still in the reduced 1973 sample.) The effect of the horizon on the

  demand for leisure differs in the two samples and is never significantly

  different from zero.—1

        Before drawing any conclusions about the role of the horizon in

 affecting the demand for goods and leisure, it is worth reestimating the

 model deleting the variables
                                measuring head's and spouse's ages, as these
 may reflect the horizon rather than the reservation wage. In systems

 like those for which the results are presented in columns (1) and (2)

 of Tables 3 and 4, but from which the head's age and that of his

 spouse have been deleted, the coefficients on T are —
                                                       .0012 (t  —.30) and
 —.087 (t = —4.22) for 1973, —.015 (t =
                                        —2.96) and —.108 (—3.78) in 1975.
 These are all in the expected,
                                  negative direction. In the leisure—demand
equations they still are very small, though; and even the effects on

consumption fall far short of what a simple
                                                life—cycle model, with
equal rates of time preference and
                                     interest, would predict.
       The number of children has
                                    no significant effect on spending or on
the fraction of time spent at leisure.
                                            These results contradict the

findings in Tables 1—2, suggesting that these may be due more to the

peculiar nature of the respondents in the
                                              Terman sample than to persons
in this cohort being in the "transition"
                                            generation. At the very least,
these results suggest that the bequest motive is not very important in
                                                                       a
random sample of older couples, at least judging from its reflection in
                                   22


labor supply and consumption behavior. Given the relatively small lif time

incomes in this sample compared to the Terman sample, this result should

not be surprising.

       Spending propensities out of after—tax earnings seem a bit low

compared to those out of financial, pension and Social Security wealth.

The weighted averages of the MPC's from the three wealth measures are .025

and .015 in columns (2) of Tables 3 and 4 respectively. If earnings are

solely a flow from human wealth, the implied returns on human wealth are

23 and 11 percent in the two years, about twice what is generally found.

One may infer from this that a large part of extra earnings are transitory

and are saved for retirement.

       Spending propensities out of the three wealth measures differ

sharply.   (When the NPCs out of the three wealth measures in the goods
demand equation are constrained to equality, the weighted R2 for the

system falls from .347 to .332 in the 1973 sample, from .300 to .294 in

the 1975 sample.) The difference between spending propensities out of

Social Security and pension wealth is negative and small in 1973, but

significantly negative in 1975; in both years the propensity to spend

out of other wealth is less than that out of pension wealth, and is less

than that out of Social Security wealth in 1973, though not in 1975.

Similar differences can be inferred from the estimates for the reduced

samples (columns (4) of the tables); indeed, in these subsamples in which

the respondents supplied all the required information in both years, the

differences between the MPCs out of Social Security and pension wealth

are somewhat more negative. Similarly, when the consumption equations

are reestimated by OLS on subsamples of people who did not work during
                                                                          21/
the year before the interview date (Table 5), this result still holds.

         Differences in other wealth induce no significant differences in

the fraction of time spent at leisure. That the effects are small is

completely consistent with the low income elasticity of labor supply of adult

males.-' Pension wealth induces large positive effects on the demand for
                                                         benefits are not
leisure time. Unlike Social Security benefits, pension

usually earnings tested, so that extra benefits produce a pure income

effect on the demand for leisure. The results on other wealth suggest the

(Lazear, 1979).

       The most surprising result in this section is the negative impact

of Social Security wealth on the fraction of time spent at leisure.

The effect is significantly negative in 1973, though not in 1975.

Compared to the other two studies that have considered the effects of

this measure on retirement, the results completely contradict those of

Pellechio (1981), though they are not inconsistent with the finding of
                                                                      23 /

       Are the results to be believed? I would argue in the affirmative,

on a number of grounds: 1) The X variables in the leisure demand

equations have effects similar to those observed in previous studies,

suggesting that the results are consistent along most dimensions with

what has been found before; 2) The results are not an artifact resulting

from the peculiarities of one sample of people. Over half the individuals

in the 1973 sample are not in the 1975 sample; 3) The sample is much more

homogeneous than those used in other work on the effect of Social Security

  on retirement. I exclude unmarried males and
                                                    women, the self—employed and,
  most important, government workers (whose Social Security wealth is often

  zero because their industry is not covered by the law); 4) The wealth

 measures are constructed exactly as those used by others (e.g., Feldstein4

 1980) to examine the effects of the
                                        program on private saving; 5) blinder
 et al (1980) have argued that Social Security provides an incentive to

 remain working for persons below 65.       Insofar as the biggest negative

 effects are in the 1973 sample, when 54 percent of the respondents are

 below 65 (only 19 percent are in the 1975 sample), the results may merely

 demonstrate that older people respond
                                         as if they are aware of the incentives
 facing them.

        Though the effects of Social Security wealth on the demand for

 leisure are negative, they are not large. Using the estimates in column

 (1) of Table 3, even a two standard—deviation
                                                   (59.3 percent) increase in
Social Security wealth produces
                                  only an 11.1 percentage point decrease in
the fraction of time spent at leisure.
                                             (The elasticity at the means is
—.44.) In the 1975 sample an analogous increase
                                                      in Social Security wealth
(.61.1 percent) decreases the fraction of time spent at leisure by only

3.2 percentage points. (The elasticity at the means is —.08.)

       The jointness of leisure and goods consumption in household

production is demonstrated by the positive correlation of the residuals

within each pair of equations. With the exception of p0
                                                                  for the first

pair of equations describing the 1975 sample, all of these are positive

at the 99 percent level of significance. In households in which

the amount of leisure consumed is
                                    greater, other things equal, so too
is goods consumption. That this correlation is significant
                                                            suggests
there is some payoff to
                        studying goods and leisure demand jointly.

V. Conclusions


      Using several sets of micro data, I have tested some empirical

implications of the life—cycle theory of consumer behavior. The major

novel aspects of the work are the inclusion of explicit proxies for the

length of an individual's horizon, the use of data on actual consumption

spending, and the recognition of the jointness of goods consumption and

labor supply in the life—cycle context. I find that on net goods

consumption and leisure are complements. Also, there is some weak

evidence that the length of the horizon does affect the timing of retire-

ment decisions. Even the strongest effects, though, are fairly small,

suggesting that increasing life expectancy alone will not lead to

substantial lengthening of the average person's work life. Instead, the

extra length of life will b.e consumed as   leisure."

       Annual consumption spending is lower among persons with longer

horizons. The reduced consumption with the lengthened horizon is too

small, though, to enable older households to maintain consumption as

they age. Thus we should expect, and I do find (Hamermesh, 1982c) that

households reduce real consumption spending as they age. People behave

myopically, consuming more than their knowledge of their horizon would

 enable them to and still keep a constant standard of living.   That they

 ignore this knowledge suggests that the decline in consumption as people

 age should not be viewed as imposed by liquidity constraints; rather, it

 is the result of lifetime utility—maximization with a high rate of time

 preference and substantial knowledge of the length of the horizon.

        Spending propensities out of Social Security wealth are less than

 those out of pension wealth. A reasonable interpretation is that
                                       27


  certainty about flows of income from these
                                                assets differs, with older
 couples being more sure of their pension wealth than of the value of their

 Social Security benefits. Since Social Security wealth is computed on

 the assumption of indexed benefits, it may be the complete indexation

 about which beneficiaries are uncertain. Viewed in this light,
                                                                 anything
 that increases the uncertainty of current and prospective
                                                           recipients about
 the future stream of Social
                               Security benefits reduces the program's
 ability to maintain consumption.

        Overall the results suggest the
                                            importance of considering life—
cycle variables, especially the length of the horizon, when examining

retirement and consumption, phenomena that are the central outcomes of

life—cycle behavior. Care has to be given to interpreting the effects

of aging upon these decisions:     Part are due to a shortened
                                                                 horizon, part
to changes in market and reservation
                                       wages. The way in which income streams
that are paid as annuities, such as pensions and Social Security, affect

retirement and consumption depends on how people view their survival

prospects. Using actuarial survival probabilities to form measures of

wealth from these annuities produces
                                       misspecifjcations of the determinants
of consumption and labor supply.

       i"White males have experienced the smallest increase in life expect—
ancy among the four race—sex groups; yet even their life expectancy at age
20 increased from 50.2 years remaining in 1969—71, to 52.3 years of
remaining life in 1979.

       --'Feldstein (1980) and Kotlikoff—Summers (1981) examine the wealth—
holdings of a sample of older persons. Gordon—Blinder (1980), Pellechio
(1981) and many others have estimated determinants of the probability of
being retired.

       ---'Nost of the exclusions resulted from incomplete information: Only
394 males responded in all three years.

      'To remove any differences resulting from individuals being at
different points along their age—earnings profiles, I adjusted the earnings
data before using them in the logit equations. The adjusted figures are
actual less predicted earnings (from an equation with age and age squared as
independent variables) plus the sample mean of earnings. Because the range
of ages in the sample was fairly narrow, this adjustment made very little
difference.

       'Parsons (1977) found that the wife's hours of work had a positive
effect on the husband's hours of work in data on older males from the National
Longitudinal Survey.

       -'For example, 43 (31) percent of the 1972 sample had mothers (fathers)
who survived to 80, while 16 (23) percent had mothers (fathers) who died
before 60. Comparable figures in the 1977 sample are 50 (32) percent and
16 (24) percent.

       —'To ensure that this variable does not just reflect children still
at home (and presumably requiring support), a variable measuring the number
of children under age 18 was also included in 1977, the only year such data
were available. Its addition had little effect on the coefficients of the
measure of total number of children, undoubtedly because very few respondents
still had children under age 18. (The mean number of such children in the
1977 sample was .05.) The presence of a young child did, though, lower the
probability of being retired by .37 (t = —1.74).

       —'These effects may vary depending upon how many siblings the
respondent has. An imperfect control for this problem, the number of living
siblings, was entered into the logits for retirement status in 1977, the only
year for which these data were available.  (The measure is clearly imperfect:
Its mean was 1.29, while in 1922 males in the Terman sample reported an
average of 1.85 siblings; Leibowitz, 1974.) It produced only minute changes
in the other coefficients; its coefficients were tiny (with t—statistics
below .7), except for a negative effect on the probability of partial
retirement (t = —1,29).

            1959 the median earnings of male professional workers ages 45—54
were only $7854. (Census of P2pulation, 1960, PC (2) — 7A).

       — For
       10/  example, the number of children ever born among married women
age 45 in 1959 was 2.39. (       noLationReportS,     P—20, No. 107).

                                      these are surprising, the coefficients are
   small enough that, together with the
                                        continuous age variable, thy imply that

  being retired in 1972, but no effect in 1977. Persons who consider themselves
  healthier are less likely to be
                                   retired, though this effect is smaller in
  1977, when the average respondent is
                                        older. Professional and managerial
  workers are less likely to be retired.

died before 1977. In an

the big—city dummy being larger than that on the variable representing
residence in a medium—size city. Spending increases significantly with
household size and with the age of the household head, but the wife's age
has no effect on total spending. In the equations for leisure demand, the
dummies for professional/managerial and sales/clerical workers, for the
college—educated, men with a working wife, and with a larger household produce
the expected negative effects, as does household size. Bad health two years
before the survey, being 65 or over, and aging increase the fraction of time
 spent at leisure. Only spouse's age and the dummy variable for completion
 of high school produce no significant effects.

             a further test of the proxies for horizon interaction terms
between T and the wealth measures were entered into the equations. These
too did not add to the equations' explanatory power. To test whether the
formulation in (10) is masking information, a vector of four dummy variables
(one for each living parent) was substituted for T. In both years the
weighted mean square error was increased by this substitution. Each of the
four variables has a negative effect on goods consumption in each year; the
effects on leisure demand are mixed.

       —'The differences between the spending propensities are not
attributable to my use of lagged assets: Substituting current for lagged
values does not change the conclusion qualitatively. Nor are they due to
the inclusion of owned housing in the measure of other wealth: Exclusion of
this part of other wealth from the equations in columns (2) and (4) also does
not affect the conclusions. Finally, reestimating the equations excluding
households with zero Social Security pension or other wealth in various
combinations also does not change the conclusions.

       -'1Inclusion of each worker's average covered earnings from 1954—59
did not greatly affect this conclusion, though it did reduce the significance
of the Social Security wealth variable (since this is a complicated nonlinear
transformation of earnings).

          Wolfe  (1982) finds that people who retire early have higher than
average mortality rates, and interprets the causation as running from a
shorter horizon inducing early retirement. This is not inconsistent with my
results, for I concentrate implicitly (by holding health status constant)
only on the effects of the horizon on the demand for leisure of the healthy
older population (87 and 91 percent in the two Terman samples, 59 and 68
percent in the two RHS samples.)
