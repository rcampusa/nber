1.   Introduction

      Recent research into the behavior of the stock market reports evidence

that returns are negatively serially correlated.     Poterba and Summers (1987)

find that variance ratio tests reject the hypothesis      that stock prices

follow a random walk, and Fama and French (1988) show that there is

significant autocorrelation   in long—horizon returns.1     It is well known

[see Leroy (1973), Lucas (1978), and Mlchener (1982)1 that serial

correlation   of returns does not in itself imply a violation of market


efficiency.2 Nevertheless,    there is a tendency to conclude that evidence of

mean reversion in stock prices constitutes a rejection of equilibrium models

of rational asset pricing.    Fama and French suggest this interpretation     as a

logical possibility,   while Poterba and Summers argue that the serial

correlation   in returns should be attributed   to "price fads".   In this paper

we demonstrate that the empirically estimated serial correlation of stock

returns is consistent with an equilibrium model of asset pricing.

         The method and organization of the paper is as follows.      The next

section discusses   the equilibrium asset pricing model that we study.     We




 1. Poterba and Summers find negative serial correlation for stock returns
over long horizons using monthly and annual data.  Interestingly, Lo and
MacKinlay (forthcoming) find that stock returns are positively correlated,
using weekly observations.

 2. Grossman and Shiller (1981) make this same point in showing that the
"excess" volatility implied by variance bounds tests can be partly explained
by risk aversion in a consumption beta model. More recently, Black (1988)
has discussed the relation between mean reversion and consumption smoothing.
                                              —2—


begin with Lucas' (1978) model of an exchange economy and adopt parametric

representations    for preferences and the stochastic process governing the

exogenous    forcing variable (i.e., the endowment stream) which admit a closed

form solution to the asset pricing problem.             The period utility function we

work with is the constant relative risk aversion function.               For preferences

of this sort, the coefficient of relative risk mversion is also the inverse

of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption so that                it is

difficult    to seperate agents' tolerance for risk from their desire to have

smooth consumption.      However,   in a setting where agents confront an

intertemporal    consumption/investment       problem It makes more sense to

interpret    the concavity    of the utility function in terms of the consumption

smoothing    motive, and that is the interpretation we make.            The exogenous

forcing variable is assumed to obey Hamilton's (1988) Markov trend in

logarithms    model.   This model conveniently incorporates important business

cycle properties which are characteristic of many economic time series.                 In

particular, Hamilton's       representation    is able to capture stochastic

switching between positive and negative growth regimes of the time series

and its asymmetric growth over the course of the cycle [Neftci (1984)1.

           Next, the parameters of the Markov trend in logarithms           nodel are

estimated by maximum likelihood using annual observations on the U.S.

economy.     This is done so that we can calibrate the asset pricing model by

setting the parameters of the exogenous forcing process equal to these

maximum likelihood estimates.        Unfortunately,      the theory provides little

guidance regarding the appropriate time series on which to calibrate the

model because in the Lucas model, equilibrium consumption equals output

which also equals dividends.        Empirically, none of these tine series appear

to be more appropriate than the others          !   priori,   so we calibrate   the model
                                          —3—



seperately    to each of the three series.      It turns out that our results are

robust to variations in the time series on which we calibrate          the model.

The maximum likelihood estimates of the Markov trend in logarithms model for

dividends, consumption,    and GNP are reported in section 3.

           In section 4, we study the measures of mean reversion which have

appeared    in the literature.     These are the variance ratio statistics used by

Poterba and Summers and the regression coefficients calculated         by Fama and

French.3     First, we caluclate    these statistics from historical   data on the

Standard and Poors 500 returns.       Next, a Monte Carlo distribution of these

statistics    is generated under the assumption     that our equilibrium model of

asset pricing is true.     Inferences    regarding the equilibrium model are then

drawn using classical hypothesis testing procedures and the Monte Carlo

distribution as the null.        We are principally interested in two hypotheses.

The first is the random walk model of stock prices, which is an implication

of the Lucas model when agents have linear utility.         The second hypothesis

is that observed asset prices are determined in equilibrium but agents

attempt to smooth their consumption.        In this setting, asset returns can be

negatively serially correlated even though they rationally reflect market
fundamentals.

           To summarize our results, we find, for all return horizons longer

than one year, that the variance ratio statistics and regression

coefficients    calculated from the actual Standard and Poors returns lie near




 3. We might also have examined variance bounds tests. But as Campbell and
Shiller (1988) point out, there is an equivalence between variance ratio
tests of the type in Poterba and Summers and variance bounds tests pioneered
by Shiller (1981).

the 60 percent confidence band of the median of the Monte Carlo distribution

generated under the linear utility (random walk) model.         When investors

display only a moderate desire to smooth their consumption,         these same

statistics    calculated    from the data lie at or near the median of the Monte

Carlo distribution.        When we test the null hypothesis against a diffuse

alternative, we cannot reject the random walk model at the standard 5

percent significance level.        However, the marginal significance      levels of

the test are much smaller when the null distribution         is generated assuming

the utility function is concave.        We conclude that much of the serial

correlation    in actual stock returns can be attributed to small sample bias

but a full explanation requires concavity of the utility function.



2.   The Equi1ibriu Model.



2.1 A Case    of   the Lucas Model.

         Consider the economy studied by Lucas (1978) in which there are a

large number of infinitely lived and identical agents and a fixed number of

assets which exogenously produce units of the same nonstoreable consumption

good.   Let there be K agents and N productive units.         Each assec has a

single perfectly divisible claim outstanding on it, and these claims are

traded in a competitive equity market.          The first—order necessary conditions

for a typical agent's optimization       problem are,




         Pj,U'(Ct)         tU'(C+i)[P,t+i+      D+i]         j=1,2,...,M         (1)




where              = The real price of asset j in terms of the consumption good.

        U'(C) —    Marginal      utility of consumption, C, for a typical

                   available      at time t.




        In equilibrium, per capita ownership of asset j is 1/K.                  It follows

that equilibrium per capita consumption, C, is the per capita claim to the


total endowment        in that period,            Now, make this substitution in

the theoretical value weighted market indices adjusted for population.

where —o < y < 0 is the coefficient of relative risk aversion.              Now (2)

simplifies      to a stochastic difference    equation which is linear in    PD.      That

is,




           PD = 6 EP          1D1   +                                               (3)


Iterating      (3) forward, the current market value,           can be expressed as a

To obtain a closed form solution, we must specify the stochastic process

governing             and this is done in the next subsection.     We will refer to

the exogenous forcing variable as dividends in the next two subsections.                  We

do this because it helps to clarify the exposition, not because we restrict

our attention to dividends when assessing the performance of the model.                   In

fact, we consider alternative processes as well.



2.2   A   Nonlinear Stochastic Model for      the Exogenous Forcing Process.
           Hamilton (1987)      has suggested modeling the trends in nonstationary

time series as Markov processes, and has applied this approach            to the study

of post—World War II real GNP.          One of the attractive    features of this

approach is its ability to account for the asymmetric behavior that many

macroeconomic         time series display over the business cycle.     Hamilton reports
                                                —7—


estimates    of the U.S. economy's growth state which coincide closely with

NBER dating of postwar recessions, and Lam (1988) shows that the model

forecasts real GNP better at short horizons than either the random walk

model or autoregressions         of low order.           Since the observations we use are

cyclical and display asymmetries             characteristic of economic time series over

the cycle, they are natural candidates for this specification.                         Let
                                                                                             dt

denote the logarithm of the exogenous forcing variable                           The Karkov trend

in logarithms model can be written             as,




                             +      +                                                             (5)

The exogenous forcing process thus follows a random walk in logarithms

a normalization      by requiring       >    0 and           < 0.    We are said to be in a high
                                            —8—


growth (boom) state when      sO,    and in a low growth (depression) State when

sl.   The probability of a boom next period given that the economy currently

enjoys a boom is q, while      the probability of a depression next period given

a current depression      state is p.    The probabilities of transition from boom

to depression and depression        to boom are then l—q and i—p respectively.          The

exogenous    forcing variable grows at the rate            during a boom, and      +


during   a depression.     The process
                                         {s}
                                               can be represented as a first—order


autoregression    with an autocorrelation coefficient of (p+q—l) which can be

interpreted as a measure of persistence in the forcing process.

         It is also useful to think of the process loosely within the

following context.       The theory relates dividends to asset prices.          In actual

economies,    future nominal dividend payments are announced in advance so a

good deal of next period's dividend growth is currently known.               This is

captured by the timing of the state in the Markov trend and in the next

subsection, agents in the artificial economy will be assumed to observe the

current state of the economy.        From   (5),   the forecastable part of dividend

growth during period t—l is          +
                                            5_'    which is revealed at t—l.      The


unforecastable    part of real dividend growth,            might be thougbt of as a
                                                      c,
combination of unanticipated      inflation and productivity shocks.

         We note at this point that it is the data, and not the discretion of

the Investigator which will choose the regime.           That   is,   when we calculate

the Monte Carlo distributions       implied by the model, the parameters

                 of the forcing process will be set equal to maximum likelihood


estimates    obtained from the data.

ratio takes on one of two values, p(O) or p(l). This is a consequence of
assuming that agents observe      In the more realistic case in which

Second, the factor of proportionality depends on investors' the inverse of

the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and whether the economy is

currently    in the high-growth state or low growth state according                         to,




                 >                       <

          p(O)   =     p(l)     as   y   =   —1.
                  <                      >




         The interpretation          of this is straightforward.                For a giwen level of

current dividends,       suppose that the economy is known                 to   be in a high growth

state
        (s=O).       By (6), this implies that the economy is likely to remain in

a high growth state into the future, and hence anticipated future dividends

are high.     This has two effects on asset prices that work in opposite

directions.      First, there is what we refer to as a wealth effect in which

higher expected future dividends cause agents to want to increase their
asset holdings.        The increased asset demand arising from the wealth effect

works   to raise current asset prices.               Working in the opposite direction is a

substitution effect arising from agents' attempts to smooth their

consumption paths.        When expected future dividends are high, the consumption

smoothing motive leads agents to want to increase current consumption in

anticipation of higher future investment income.                     To finance higher current

consumption, agents attempt to sell off part of their asset holdings, which,

in equilibrium results in falling asset prices.                      Log utility      (-y   = —1) is a

borderline    case in which the wealth effect and the substitution                          effect

exactly cancel out.           This can be seen, perhaps, more clearly from (4) in

which the solution for y = —l is                    =   (8,'[l—ØJ)          In this case, the
                                              Pt                     Dt.

factor of proportionality            relating prices to dividends               is a constant.       When
                                           —11—


the concavity    of the utility     function is less than it is in the log case,

the wealth effect assumes greater importance, so that p(O) > p(l).             In the

                                                           all that
limiting case of linear utility (yO), the wealth effect is

matters,   since agents have no desire to smooth consumption.         Conversely,

when the utility function is more concave than is implied by log utility,

the intertemporal    substitution effect dominates the wealth effect causing

p(l) > p(O).

           From (5) and (7), equilibrium gross returns are computed as,



                                                        +
  R   =
          (P+ D)/Pt   1
                          =
                              ([P(5)441/P(st_i)}exp(0          5i+                  (8)




Notice that because the gross return depends on             it is a continuous random


variable on [O,), and not a two point process.



3.    1axi.u Likelihood       Estimates of the flarkov Trend in Logarith.s Process.

           This section presents estimation results for the Markov trend in

logarithms model of the exogenous forcing variable. The Markov trend model

is nonlinear    in the sense that current values of the forcing variable cannot

be expressed as a linear function of past values.           Even though the state, s,

is unobservable to the econometrician,        given the normality assumption on the

t's, the parameters of the process,                         can be estimated   by
                                           (p,q,a,a1,a)

maximum likelihood.       The Interested reader is directed to Hamilton (1987)

for details on estimation or Lam (1988) who generalizes           the Hasilton niodel.

When we proceed to generate the Monte Carlo distributions           from which we draw

statistical     inference regarding    the model, the parameters    of the model will
                                        —12—


be set to the maximum likelihood estimates to match the process driving our

model to U.S. historical data.

          The theory offers little guidance regarding the appropriate

empirical    counterpart to the exogenous forcing variable.    That is because

equilibrium    consumption of section 2.1 equals output which also equals

dividends.    Consequently,   we consider three time series, all in per capita

terms5:     real dividends, real consumption, and real GNP.

          The dividend data are annual observations from the Standatd and

Poors 500 index deflated by the CPI from 1871 to 1985.6       We use these data
as a benchmark because they represent the longest available time series, and

we believe that the characteristics of these data are representative of

equity returns and dividend disbursements in general.     Also, the Standard

and Poors 500 index is one of the data sets used by Poterba and Summers, so

a direct comparison can be made with some of their results.      We follow both

Poterba and Summers and Fama and French in deflating returns by the CPI.7




 5. In an earlier version of this paper, the adjustment for population
growth was not made. There is virtually no difference between the results
with and without this adjustment.

 6. This is the Standard and Poors historical data used by     Summers and
Poterba. Observations on returns and the CPI from 1871 to      1926 are from
Wilson and Jones (1987), and from Ibbotson and Sinquefield     (1982) from 1926
to 1985. Observations on nominal dividends are those used      by Campbell and
Shiller (1987).

 7. The choice of deflator is not innocuous. As both Poterba and Summers
and Fama and French state, there is little difference between using nominal
returns and real returns deflated by the CPI. However, we found little
evidence of mean reversion in the Standard and Poors data when returns were

The consumption data are constructed by splicing the Kendrick          consumption

series, published    in Balke and Gordon (1986), from 1889 to 1928 to the

National Income and Product Accounts data from 1929 to 1985.          The real GNP

data is constructed by combining observations from 1869 to 1908 from Romer

(1989) with data from 1909 to 1928 from Rouser (1985), and observations          from

1929 to 1985 from the National Income and Product Accounts.           per capita

observations on each of these time—series are then obtained by dividing them

                                  from the Historical       Statistics of the United
by annual population estimates

States and the Economic Report of the President.

           The estimation results and some summary statistics are reported in

Table 1.     For the most part, the parameters are accurately estimated.         When

the economy is in a boom this year, the estimated          probability that it

continues    in a boom next year is   q.    As can be seen, this   is .95 for


dividends,    .98 for GNP and .98 for consumption.       The estimated rate of

growth during a boom,        is .013, .016, and .015 for dividends,

GNP, and consumption,    respectively.      When in a boom, the estimated

probability of a transition    to a negative growth state next period, 1—q, is

.05 for dividends,    and .02 for GNP and consumption.        This implies that we

                                                    or so for dividends,           and
might expect to observe a crash once every 20 years

every 50 years for consumption and GNP.           While in a depression state,

deflated by the FF1. This is not surprising given the difference between
the two measures of inflation.  It is well known that the CPI tends to be
very persistent, while the PPI, which behaves more like an asset price,
tends to be very noisy.

                             ,   is   -.36   for   dividends, —.16   for   GNP and —.08 for

                   At first glance, the expected rate of decline in dividends

seems quite large.       Sut, negative growth rates of        this    magnitude have

actually occured with some degree of regularity.              In fact, real dividends

fell by more than 36 percent during 4 of the 116 years of our sample.8

           Once the economy finds itself in a depression, the probability that

it will be in a depression the following year, p, is estimated                  to be .1748

for dividends, .5096 for GNP and .5279 for consumption.                   We note that the

likelihood      function is flat for variations         in p in estimation of the process

using the dividend data.         This is not surprising given the asymmetric

behavior of dividends over the business cycle.              That    is,    downturns have

generally been short lived, lasting between 4 and 6 quarters.                   This makes it

difficult       to obtain a good estimate of p using annual observations.9

           We nov turn to the study of equilibrium asset prices implied by this

nonstationary      dividend process.




4.   The   Serial Correlation of Equilibrium          and Actual   Returns.
           In   this section, returns obtained from the equilibrium model of

Section 2 are used to generate Monte Carlo distributions of the variance




 8. There were 9 years in the sample in which dividends fell between 10 and
20 percent, and 4 years in which they fell between 20 and 30 percent.

 9. These estimates also appear reasonable in that they produce artificial
sample paths (generated as described in the next section) that look
remarkably like the actual time series.

ratio statistic used by Poterba and Summers, and the regression coefficients

calculated by Fama and French.         These distributions are generated both for

the case of linear utility and for a case in which the utility function is

concave.     They are then used to draw inference about the equilibrium model

and the model driving the exogenous forcing variable.            For each assumption

about the degree of investor risk aversion,           the model is calibrated   to the

estimated dividend,      consumption, and GNP processes reported in table 1.

The subjective discount factor           is assumed to be 0.98 throughout.      The

procedure is as follows:          First, given p and q, we generate a sequence of

                          to (6).    Second, given a, we 116 independent draws from

of the distribution for the statistic under investigation.                A median is also

calculated       from 1,000 time series samples of 1160 returns each to get an

idea of the "true" or large sample value of the variance ratio or regression

coefficient statistics.          We refer to this as the "large" sample median.        In

the case of linear utility, the true values are known, and this calculation

gives us a loose idea of the rate of convergence of these statistics to
their true values.       When the utility function is concave, analytic

calculation of the true values is difficult and we take this calculation                to

be the true large sample values.             Each figure displays the large and small

sample medians, the 60 percent confidence intervals about the small sample

median and the point estimates calculated from actual Standard and Poors

returns.

      Given the Monte Carlo distributions of the variance ratio statistic
and the autocorrelation        coefficient on returns, we can determine the

likelihood       that the estimates obtained from actual data were drawn from the

Monte Carlo distribution implied by equilibrium returns.



4.1 Variance Ratios.

                                              —17—


It is easy to show that the the variance ratio can be expressed             in terms of

the return's autocorrelations.           That     is,




                                k-i
                          2

where         is the jth autocorrelation      on returns.   When returns are serially
        Pj

uncorrelated,      the variance ratio is equal to one for all k in large


samples)1       This is usually taken as the null hypothesis         in tests of "market

efficiency,"      corresponds    to the case where stock prices follow a random

walk, and is true in the equilibrium model of Section 2 only when investors

have linear utility.          Stock prices are said to be "mean reverting" If

returns are negatively correlated and evidence of mean reversion             is inferred

from variance ratios which lie below unity.              This is the finding of Poterba

and Summers.

             We consider first the case of linear utility.         Figures 1—3 display

the results under linear utility for models calibrated             to the dividend,

GNP, and consumption processes           respectively.    Since these returns are

uncorrelated      by construction,      all of the deviation of the median of the

variance ratio's distribution from unity is due to small sample bias.                 The

serial correlation of returns, and hence their predictability             is only

apparent.       This result can be viewed in the same light as the business cycle




11. In small samples, as Poterba and Summers point out, the sample
autocorrelations of returns are biased so E[VR(k)J   1 even when returns are
independent.
                                        —18—


in which recessions occur with random periodicity.         Although real GNP may

appear to be mean reverting, this does not imply that business cycle turning

points are predictable.      In the equilibrium model of asset prices, the

exogenous    forcing variable has a business cycle interpretation.      Since

equilibrium    asset prices are proportional to the forcing variable, and its

stochastic    process implies that a boom is usually followed by a boom, the

appearance    of mean reversion in asset prices is produced, but this does

not mean that returns are predictable.         In the large sample (T=l160), most

of the bias has dissappeared.      In Figure 1, it is seen that the variance

ratios calculated from the Standard and Poors data fall within the 60

percent confidence    interval of the Monte Carlo distribution except at the 7,

8, and 9 year horizons when the model is calibrated        to the dividend


process.12 However, these outliers are still within the traditional 95
percent confidence    interval.   The evidence is more favorable to the model

when the forcing process is matched to consumption and GNP.         Figures 2 and 3

display variance ratios calculated from the actual data which lie uniformly

within the 60 percent confidence interval of the median of the Monte Carlo

distribution.

        When agents' utility function is concave, the results        re   even more

favorable    to the model.   Figure 4 reports the results of the above

calculations assuming concave utility with y = —1.4 and the forcing process

matched to the dividends.      Now the median of both the small and large sample




12. These estimates of the variance ratios are smaller than those reported
by Poterba and Summers because they make a bias correction assuming a null
hypothesis of a homoskedastic random walk for asset prices.  The bias
correction is irrelevant for our purposes.
                                        —19—


distributions    of the variance ratio statistics are well below 1.0 at every

horizon.     The median of the small sample (T=116) distribution is actually

below the variance ratios calculated     from the annual returns on the S & P

500, which implies that the equilibrium model with y
                                                     =     -1.4   generates   more


negative serial correlation in returns than is found in the actual data.13
We find that the general pattern of the variance ratios calculated from the

data is replicated rather well by the large sample median of the Monte Carlo

distribution at all but the first horizon.      The discrepancy at the first

horizon occurs because there is almost no first order serial correlation in

the annual returns data, while the equilibrium model produces some negative

first order serial correlation.

                                                                        is
           Figures 5 and 6 display the results when the forcing process

calibrated    to the GNP process where the coefficient of relative risk

aversion is —1.6, and the consumption process where the coefficient of

relative risk aversion is —1.7 respectively.       Here, the variance ratios

calculated from the S & P returns lie close to the median of the

distribution,    and are uniformly   within the 60 percent confidence   interval


about the median)4 We conclude that the model cannot be rejected at less

than the 60 percent level whether the consumption smoothing motive is

present or not.

4.2   Regression Coefficients on Returns of Varying Horizons.

on i—period returns          b running         the following regression:

period returns and the autocorrelation of the i—period return                            is,

Using monthly returns on           the CRSP index, Fama and French find that the slope

coefficient
                  b is negative            for t greater than one year.           From this they


infer that stock prices are mean reverting.                   Ve examine their result by

computing     the empirical distribution               of these regression coefficients

implied by the model in Section 2.

          We begin with the linear utility (y=O) case.                        Figures 7-9 display

for the model calibrated           to dividends, GNP, and consumption respectively,

the median and 60 percent confidence intervals of the Monte Carlo

distribution of the regression coefficient b, the large sample (T=1160)

median,   the estimates obtained from the Standard and Poors returns, and the

Monte Carlo distribution function evaluated at these estimated values.

Again,    the deviation of the median of the small sample (T=116) distribution
                                           —21—


from zero is due to small sample bias.            This bias increases as t   gets
larger, because the effective       sample size, as measured by the number of

independent     pieces of information    (non—overlapping observations),     decreases

with   t.    For   example, at the 10 year horizon, there are only 10 non—

overlapping     observations available    in the Standard and Poors data, and 6

non-overlapping       observations available   in the CRSP returns!   The median of

the large sample distribution       (T=1160) on the other hand, Is reasonably

close to the true value of zero.         The regression coefficients calculated

from the Standard and Poors data generally lie below the median of the small

sample Monte Carlo distribution.         For the dividend model, they are within

the 60 percent confidence       interval about     the median except for the estimate

obtained using 2 year returns.        For the consumption and GNP models, the

estimates lie uniformly within the 60 percent confidence Intervals.

            Figures   10—12 display the details of the Monte Carlo distributions

of the regression coefficients obtained from the equilibrium returns when y
is —1.4 in the dividend model, —1.6 in the GNP model and —1.7 in the

consumption model.        Here, it is the regression coefficient for one year

returns which falls outside the 60 percent confidence           Interval of the small

sample median of the dividend model but lie uniformly within this interval

for the consumption and GNP models.         The distance between the small sample

medians and the actual estimates         tend to be smaller here than when agents

have linear utility.



4.3 Mean Reversion, S.al1 Sample Bias, and Consumption Smoothing.

            The results of the previous two subsections       show that small sample

bias and concavity of the utility function work to generate returns which

appear mean reverting.        Table 2 isolates the contribution of each of these
                                         —22—


effects.     For each of the forcing processes on which the model is

calibrated,    we report the deviation   of the small sample median from the

theoretical value when agents have linear utility (column 1), and the

difference of the median generated under concave utility from the median

generated    under linear utility (column 2).     When the model is calibrated to

the dividend process, consumption smoothing seems to be the dominant effect

in the calculation of the variance ratio.       In every other case, however, the

small sample bias dominates at the longer horizon while consumption

smoothing    dominates at the short horizons.



5. Conclusion.

           Is mean reversion in stock prices evidence of market inefficiency?

We investigate this question by asking whether the empirically observed time

series properties of stock returns can be generated by an equilibrium model

of asset pricing.     Monte Carlo distributions    of variance ratio statistics

and long horizon return regression coefficients are generated using

equilibrium returns derived from the Lucas (1978) model and a nonstationary
Markov process governing dividends, consumption, and GNP.        We conclude that

the equilibrium model cannot be rejected in the sense that the estimates of

serial correlation in stock returns using actual data could reasonably have

been drawn from our Monte Carlo distribution.        This result is stronger when

agents in the equilibrium model care about smoothing their consumption

paths.     In fact, if the coefficient of relative risk aversion is betveen 1.4

and 1.7, implying an intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption

is between    .58 and .71, the median of the simulated distributions     conforms

very well to the actual estimates.       Perhaps surprisingly,   a reasonably   high

elasticity of intertemporal substitution has substantive effects on the
                                       —23—


serial correlation exhibited by simulated return series.      It does not take

much for the desire to smooth consumption to dominate any wealth effects

produced by changes in dividends and lead to mean reversion in asset prices.

Furthermore,    our results are robust to a variety of assumptions regarding

the properties of the exogenous    forcing variable.

           We make two final points regarding our results.   The first concerns

the time series properties of the exogenous forcing variable.      We believe

that this process, whether it be dividends,     consumption, or GNP, is properly

modeled as a nonlinear    stochastic process.   If we are correct, this induces

the standard specification    error into computations that are based on


assuming that this time series is some sort of linear process.15     While this

error could lead an investigator to find either too much or too little

serial correlation, given the process which we estimate, it is more likely

the error will lead to too little.

           The second point concerns small sample bias and the implications of

this bias for power in hypothesis    testing.   When computing statistics based

on returns at five or ten year horizons, 116 annual observations is very

little data. The bias is also seen to grow as the effective sample size gets

smaller.     The implication for testing the null against local alternatives     is

complementary    to Summer's (1986) point that most tests of market efficiency

have virtually no power against what he calls fad alternatives.      Since we

have shown that a properly constructed equilibrium model can generate

rational asset prices which exhibit a very wide range of time series




15. The recent paper by West (1988) is an example.
                                      -24—


properties,   it follows that, given the available data, the test of any fad

model will have very little power against the rather wide class of

equilibrium alternatives.   More precise estimates and more powerful tests

can only come through the passage of time and not by sampling the data more

frequently.16   If there had been a well functioning asset market since the

time of the Norman invasion (1066 A.D.) and we had all the necessary price

and dividend data, then we might begin to distinguish among some of the

competing theories.




16. That is, in computing the autocorrelation of ten year returns, what is
needed is more ten year time periods and not weekly or daily observations.
All we can do is wait.

         In this appendix we derive the equilibrium price function (7).

Lower case letters are used to denote variables in logarithmic                        form (i.e.,

• log(X)).   Given the stochastic process for the exogenous                       forcing variable

in equations (5)—(6), the problem is to find the solution to (4), which we

reproduce here for convenience.
