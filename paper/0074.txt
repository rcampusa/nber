I.   Introduction and Summa

        This   paper reports on an empirical investigation of the distri-

bution of inflation rates across households. The study uses a large

cross—sectional survey of households to obtain information on the

composition of the market bundles of goods and services purchased by

each of several thousand households in the U.S. It also uses published

data for the U.S. on monthly changes in the separate indices of prices

of some fifty expenditure items which comprise consumers' market bundles.

With information on price changes for these fifty items and the composition

of households' consumption bundles, a price index is computed for each

of some 11,000 households separately for several recent periods of time.

The distributions of these price indices are studied and the relationships

between household characteristics and these price indices are investigated.

        The empirical estimates indicate the magnitude of the effect of

recent periods of inflation on the relative prices of various households'

market bundles. The study also investigates which types of households

have experienced the largest price increases. The findings should be of

interest in light of the frequent discussion of the distributional
                                   2




impact of inflation. The study also provides information relevant to

the public discussion of the usefulness of income group specific consumer

price indices.

        As with every study, there are important limitations to be

noted. The price indices computed here are Laspeyres indices with fixed

weights, hence we observe how the price of a fixed bundle of goods

changes for each household, but we do not observe how the composition

of the bundles themselves change in response to the relative price changes

in the market place. Furthermore, since prices actually paid for

specific goods and services are not observed for each household separ-

ately each month, it is assumed here that the same observed average

price change for a specific item Is experienced by all consumers. Hence

only the differences in the composition of consumption bundles can

generate dispersion in the calculated price indices.

        There is another limitation, perhaps of greater importance.

Inflation may affect real income not only by a differential impact on

consumers' price indices but also by affecting, say, money earnings and

the value of financial assets. But this study does not investigate these

influences. Said differently, the study reported here yields answers

to such questions as, "have the consumption bundles typically purchased

by the elderly risen in price more rapidly in recent years than the

bundles typically purchased by middle—aged couples?"; but the study does

not address such questions as, "has the inflation in recent years affected

the money incomes of the elderly differently than the money incomes of

prime—working aged couples?" Without answers to both these (and addi-

tional) questions one cannot conclude anything about the net impact of
                                      3




inflation on the relative position of one group or another in the distri—

butlon of real income. In this important sense, the study reported

here is a partial analysis.

        By way of summary, the study finds the following:

            (1) There is considerable dispersion among households in the

computed price indices. For the first six months of 1974, for example,

the average price index for the more than 11,000 households rose by

6.0 percent, but one in ten households experienced a price increase of

less than 4.6 percent in that six—month period, while another one in

ten households experienced a price rise greater than 7.4 percent. These

household—specific price indices for this period ranged from a low of

2.0 percent to over 13.0 percent, and the standard deviation across

households was 1.2.

        (2) There is an observed tendency for the relative dispersion

In the price indices across households to be smaller when calculated

over longer time periods.

        (3) In several particular time periods there are sizable and

statistically significant relationships between the increase in the

household's price index and certain demographic and economic character-

istics of the household. For example, over the year 1973 or the

month of January 1974, the price index rose relatively rapidly for

households with low after—tax family income, or low levels of schooling

of the household head, or older aged household heads. However, the

importance of these, and other, observed relationships between the price

changes and the household characteristics is diminished by two other

findings:
                                   4



        (4) When the households are combined into relatively homogeneous

groups defined by income, education, age, city size, marital status,

race, etc., the within—group dispersion in price indices is still very

substantial. The dispersion within groups tends to dominate the differ-

ences in group means.

        (5) While sizable and significant relationships between the

price change and household characteristics are observed in specific

time periods, none of these relationships appears to be stable over time.

None of the household characteristics studied exhibits a consistently

positive or negative simple or partial relationship with the price

changes over the several time periods investigated. One of the rela-

tionships which did exhibit some stability, qualitatively, is with the

schooling level of the household head. On average, and holding marital

status, city size, race, family size, and age constant, the market bundles

characteristic of households with college educated heads rose in price in

the first six months of 1974 (in which the average rise was 6.0) by about

one—half a percentage point less than the market bundles of the households

with grade school educated heads. A roughly comparable result is observed

for the year 1973 in which the group's mean price rise was 9.8 percent

and in which the market bundle of the college educated rose by about

1.2 percentage points less than the bundle of the less educated. But

this consistency is not observed in an earlier five—year period from

1967 through 1972, in which the education level is positively related to

the rate of price change. Nor is the relationship negative in each of

the first six months of 1974. In April and June, the schooling level is

positively, and statistically significantly, related to the rate of
                                     5




price increase while for the other four months, and the six months as a

whole, the relationship is negative.

          (6) There is, however, evidence of a positive covariation over

time in the rates of price change across households. That is, the

correlations across households between the rates of price increase from

one time period to the next are positive. For example, among the nearly

9,000 married couples in the study, the simple correlation between the

household's price change in the year 1972 and its price change in the

year 1973 was +0.63. Those couples that experienced higher than average

increases in the price of their market bundle in 1972 tended to have the

same experience in 1973. Of course, evidence from successive months

or even years does not necessarily constitute independent evidence if one

considers an episode of price adjustments as a single, relevant "observa-

tion." That is, the recent rises over several months in the prices of

oil products and perhaps food might constitute one observation or one

degree of freedom in considering serial correlations or time—dependent

covariation in price rises. Thus the month—to—month, and recent year—to—

year, positive covariation over time should be interpreted with caution.

It would be inappropriate to generalize to covariation over long time

periods from the results presented in this paper.

          (7) It is not the case that the mean price, indices for specific

types of households are consistently more highly correlated over time

than the within—group deviations from the groups' mean price indices.

Indeed, as with the dispersion at any point in time, standardizing for

household characteristics does not appreciably affect the dispersion or

the covariation over time in the household—specific rates of change of

prices.

II. Dispersion in Consumers' Price Indices

        Price changes are pervasive in a dynamic economy. An observed

change in the nominal market price of a good reflects either (or both)

a change in the rate of exchange among marketed goods and services——a

relative price change——or a change in the rate of exchange between

goods and services on the one hand and the medium of exchange on the

other hand——a price level change. Since one cannot identify what portion

of an observed price change is attributable to a change in the price

level, one typically computes some weighted average of many observed

nominal price changes and    uses   that average price change as an index of

the change in the price level. Commonly used weights for this computa-

tion are the relative proportions of various market goods and services

In the consumer's market basket; thus the calculated change in the

average market price reflects the change in the price of that bundle of

market goods and services.

        For the U.S. economy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the

U.S. Department of Labor publishes monthly an index of the price of a

fixed—quantity bundle of market goods and services. The official name

of the Index is the "Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and

Clerical Workers," but the index is generally referred to as the

Consumer Price Index. One of the principal focuses of this paper is

to assess how adequately "the CPI" reflects the price changes experienced

In the marketplace by different consumers.1


              issue is underscored and the limitations of the index are
emphasized frequently by the BLS itself. For detailed statements about
the nature and definition of the CPI, as well as of the BLS's assessment
of its uses and limitations, see The Consumer Price Index: History and
Techniques, BLS Bulletin 1517, 1966; also see the BLS Handbook of Methods,
BLS Bulletin 1711, 1971, and Julius Shiskin, "Updating the Consumer Price
Index——An Overview," Monthly Labor Review, July 1974, pp. 3—20.

        Consider how two consumers who shop in the same economic market

may, in a given time period, experience different changes in the price

of their market bundles. Suppose the market in which they shop is

characterized at one point in time by a large array of specific items

each offered for sale at some distribution of prices varying from vendor

to vendor. At a subsequent time period, the market might be characterized

by a somewhat different set of marketed items, each offered at a somewhat

different distribution of prices. Were we to compute a separate "price

index" for two different consumers, these two price indices might differ

for at least three reasons.

        (1) If we computed a fixed—weight price index, the appropriate

weights might differ for the two consumers. That is, if we use, say, the

consumers' expenditure shares for various market goods and services——food,

clothing, medical care, etc.——as weights, the weighted average for one

consumer might differ from the weighted average for the other consumer.

        (2) The market prices at which the two consumers purchase goods

and services may differ, and the changes from period to period in the

relevant prices may also differ.   There are at least two reasons for

this.   If the economic market in which the consumers shop is not

characterized by perfect and costless information about the nature and

price of each marketed item, some dispersion may exist in the price at

which any particular item is sold. If the distribution of market prices

for a particular itemdoes not change from one time period to the next,

the price used in constructing the individual. consumer's price

index may, nevertheless, reflect a change if the index is based on the

price at which the consumer actually purchased the item. That is, if the
                                   8




consumers independently sample prices from a stable distribution of

prices for a specific item, the prices paid will in general vary from

time period to time period, and may vary differently for different

consumers. If the consumer samples randomly from the distribution of

prices for each particular Item, it may be more appropriate to use the

change from period to period in some measure of that price distribution

——e.g., its mean, its median, etc.——as the market price which each

consumer faces. However, if a consumer routinely purchases the item at

a price which is located at some particular position in the distribution

of prices for that item——e.g., if he or she always purchases the item at

a price at the lowest ten percentile——then the movement through time in

the central tendency of the price distribution may not accurately reflect

the movement of the relevant price for that consumer.

        Alternatively, if we disregard the price dispersion for a particular

item in a given market, at any practical level of disaggregation of

items, differences may exist between the two consumers in the nature and

the price of the item purchased. No matter how detailed the expenditure

categories used in constructing the price indices, e.g., whether "food"

or "vegetables" or "brussel sprouts", the freshness, size or other

characteristics of the item may differ from consumer to consumer. These

differences are typically referred to as the "quality" of the item. If

prices change differentially from period to period for these various

items within an expenditure category, the relevant price change for that

expenditure category may differ from one consumer to another.

        (3) In general, the consumer's price index need not be a

fixed—weighted index. As relative prices of market goods and services
                                   9




change, the consumer adjusts his relative demands for various goods. If

consumers differ in their demand elasticities, then any fixed—weighted

price index may inadequately reflect the price change for the relevant,

shifting bundle of market goods, and it may do so differently for differ-

ent consumers. When we introduce changes over time in the composition of

the consumption bundle which result from the changes in relative prices

(or, by extension, the introduction of new products or the changes in

product quality), we approach the concept of an index of the cost of

living rather than an index of the cost of a fixed bundle of market goods

and services. Estimates of systems of demand equations can be used to

perform the compensations necessary to estimate, for a given change in

market prices, the change in the outlay required to keep the consumer

at the same level of utility. If one had data on the shifts in the

individual consumer's consumption bundle which resulted from observed

changes in the relative prices he or she faced, or if one had the consumer's

utility function explicitly, then the consumers' cost of living indices

could be computed.

        I have suggested three reasons why the price indices for two

consumers shopping in the same economic market might differ——because

of differences in the proportions spent on various goods and services,

differences in the rates of change of the prices paid for the goods and

services purchased, and differences in substitution elasticities) In



        'There are, of course, other reasons why the relevant price index
may differ from consumer unit to consumer unit. The addition and deletion
of items sold in the marketplace, differences in the substitution elas-
ticities of consumption between time periods, differences in the ability
or willingness to substitute nonmarket effort for intermediate or final
production of certain Items are but a few complications ignored here with
respect to an index of the price changes of consumer goods and services.
                                      10



the empirical work which is reported below, only the first of these

three is investigated. Specifically, a base—period fixed—weighted price

index (a Laspeyres price index) is computed for each consumer unit for

several successive time periods. Since the expenditure weights are

estimated only once for each consumer unit and are constant thereafter,

this study does not investigate differences among consumers in their

responsiveness to changes in relative prices. Since I have used the same

estimate of the price change for a particular good over a particular

period of time for all consumer units, differences among consumers in

the rates of change of particular market prices are also ignored. The

observed differences in computed price indices among consumers, then,

result solely from the differences in the composition of their consump-

tion bundles, or more precisely from the correlation between these

differences and the observed price changes.

        A Laspeyres price index is defined as




          0    =   _______                                                (1)

items indexed over I for the reference base period zero. Equivalently,

         L° =                                                             (2)

 item I. Then



                 =
                     wO Pi,O =        Wü    P11 P1,_1

and the index of price changes from period j—k to j for the reference

base period zero Is


                      L°
            L° ——    ____ —•0  —
          j—k         L°           Wij_k ij ,j—k
                     0 i-k

where
        wj.k 10P1J.../ 0P11_. These latter weights use reference
base period quantities and i—k period prices. Of    course, w =             =   1.

         Notice that if one starts with a set of known or directly

estimated expenditure weights w, I1,...,n, in successive periods the

weights can be modified to keep the quantities but not the expenditure

shares constant over time. Given the expenditure share from an expendi-

ture survey in period zero, x0 P010 the expenditure weight in

period zero is w10 =
                          x0/I x0. With an independently estimated price
change from period zero to period i—k, ij—k,O' one can estimate the

fixed—quantity expenditure on item I at price         by



         ij—k q10 = x10 1J—k,O


Thus, the base—period, fixed—quantity weight using i—k prices is
estimated by



         WIi_k       X0    ij-kO' x10 ij-kO•                          (6)
                                   12




Even though the cross section survey of spending patterns may not yield

information on the q10 and p10 separately, by using equation (5) one

can construct a fixed—quantity price index. Its construction requires

the assumption that the independently observed price change in item i

from period zero to another period, i—k, reflects the appropriate price

change for that item. Its use implicitly assumes a zero price elasticity

of demand.

        The fixed—quantity weights used by the BLS in computing the

published monthly CPI were most recently revised in December 1963 on

the basis of information obtained from the 1960—1961 Consumer Expenditure

Survey (CES) of the spending patterns of some 13,700 consumer units)

From this survey the BLS calculated an average set of expenditure weights

for the subset of consumer units which qualified as "urban wage earners

and clerical workers."2 Since December 1963 the weights for the monthly

CPI have been adjusted each year by the method outlined in equations (5)

and (6), but the weights have not been re—estimated since the 1960—61

expenditure survey.


        'For a description of the 1960—1961 Consumer Expenditure Survey,
see the BLS Handbook of Methods for Surveys and Studies (BLS Bulletin
1711), Chapter 8, written by Kathryn R. Murphy, 1971.

        2This subset of about 4,900 families and single persons included
consumer units living in urban places of populations of 2,500 or above
with (a) at least one family member earning wages and salary from the
occupations of clerical or sales workers; craftsmen, operatives or kindred
workers; services workers or laborers; or enlisted personnel in the Armed
Forces; (b) the total income from the above occupations equaled at least
one—half of the total family income before taxes; and (c) at least one
family member was employed a total of 37 weeks or more in the survey year
(1960 or 1961), regardless of occupation. The publicly available data
tape of the CES does not permit one to identify this subset of 4860
"CPI households" from the 13,728 households in the complete survey.

        3A large resurvey of consumer spending patterns was undertaken in
1972—73 and will be incorporated in an updated set of expenditure
                                    13




         In the empirical work reported below, I have estimated a price

 index for each separate household using the expenditure weights observed

 for that household in the BLS's 1960—61 Consumer Expenditure Survey.

 Since the expenditure data used here are based on the same survey used

by the BLS in its most recent (1963) revision of the definitions of

expenditure items, the conformity between the available information on

the expenditure weights (from the CES data) and on the price changes

from month to month (as published routinely by the BLS) is quite good.

I was able to decompose the consumer's total consumption expenditure into

fifty—two categories of expenditure for which separate price series were

available. Thus for each consumer unit,   an   index is computed which

estimates the change in the price of that consumer unit's fifty—two

item consumption bundle over some particular period of time.    That price

index is computed for 11,761 separate consumer units. In the tables and

figures which follow, the distributions of these indices across house-

holds for several specific time periods are featured.1

tations in April 1977. See Shiskin, Monthly Labor Review, for a dis-
cussion of the revisions underway.

        1The appendix includes information on the definitions of the
fifty—two expenditure categories (Tables A—l and A—2), and on the
expenditure weights for these fifty—two categories in the official BLS
CPI in 1963 and their relative importance or fixed—quantity weights in
the CPI by December 1973, as well as their average weights for the 11,761
consumer units based on the 1960—61 expenditure patterns (Table A—2).
The CPI weights indicated in Table A—2, part A, have been adjusted to
sum to unity while excluding the items in the CPI which
                                                         are not included
in my estimates of individual consumer's bundles. The items included
in the official CPI but excluded from my estimates of the consumption
bundles are itemized in part B of Table A—2; their relative weights in

        The price indices computed in this paper for separate consumer

units or households are not defined in precisely the same manner as

the BLS's CPI. The major difference in the definition of the consump-

tion bundle involves the owner—occupied housing expenditures. While

the BLS's CPI includes the purchase price of a house in the series, and

assigns it the observed average expenditure share across the urban wage

and clerical workers (a share of 5.9 percent of the consumption bundle

in the 1973 weights), the price indices computed here for separate

consumer units exclude that item from the consumption bundle.' Another

difference between the price indices estimated here and the CPI is

that the former use fixed expenditure weights (i.e. constant 1960—61

expenditure shares) while the CPI adjusts these shares annually to




        'The most convincing rationale for excluding that item from the
definition of the individual consumer unit's price index is that its
weight in the consumption bundle for most consumers would be zero while
for those consumers who purchased a house during the survey year the
weight would have been extremely large. These differences in the rela-
tive weights between home—purchasers and all other consumer units
might well have dominated all other observed differences. Of course,
it may be that the composition of the remainder of the consumption bundle
is also affected during the year in which a house is (first?) purchased,
and these differences may affect the observed distributions of price
indices. Likewise, the expenditures related to the acquisition of any
relatively expensive and durable item——e.g. an automobile, a wedding,
a child, a funeral, etc.——may affect the consumer's spending pattern.
One might amortize the expenditures of durables over the expected
life of the item and use the amortized value to calculate the appropri-
ate expenditure share in the yearly consumption bundle, but that was
not done for each of the 11,761 consumer units and for each of the
durable goods. Instead, the home purchase was excluded from the defini-
tion of the bundle and all other durables were included. The expendi-
tures on housing—related items such as rental expenditures, mortgage
interest payments, property insurance, and taxes and repairs were
included in the definition of the bundle.

estimate fixed quantity weights.1 To emphasize that there are defini-

tional differences between the official CPI and the price indices

estimated here, in this paper the latter will be referred to as "expendi-

ture price indices" (EPI's).

         Expenditure price indices have been computed for each consumer

unit   for   ten separate recent time periods. These time periods vary in

length from a five—year period to a one—month period; they span the

time from 1967 through June 1974 inclusively.2 The EPI for each period

for each household Is the percentage change in the price of that

household's bundle of goods over the time period covered. The ten time

periods are:

         1967—1972 (defined as the percentage change in prices from the

                year—average 1967 prices to the year—average 1972 prices

                ——a 5—year price change).

         1972 (defined as the percentage change   in   prices from December

                1971 through December 1972——a 12—month price change);



        'The price indices computed In this paper have also been computed
using the fixed—quantity weights for several of the specific time
Intervals. The observed differences between the fixed quantity and
fixed expenditure weighted price indices are discussed briefly below.

        2While the price changes studied pertain to recent periods of
time, the expenditure shares are computed from a cross—section survey
in 1960—61. So the implicit assumption is made that the
differences In the composition of consumption bundles in 1960 or 1961
adequately reflect the differences which exist in the later period
covering 1967 through 1974. The discussion in Section III of the rela-
tionship between household characteristics and observed differences in
household's price indices alsoassumes that the differences in the com-
position of market bundles among various types of households observed
In 1960 and 1961 adequately reflect the differences which exist in the
later period. Differences In the composition of consumption bundles
between 1960 and 1970 surely exist, but these are ignored here.

          1973 (defined as the percentage change in prices from December

               1972 through December 1973——a 12—month price change);

          January 1974 (defined as the percentage change in prices from

               December 1973 through January 1974——a one—month price change);

          February 1974 (defined as the percentage change in prices from

               January 1974 through February 1974——a one—month price change);

          March 1974 through June 1974 separately (defined analogously

               to January or February 1974);

          January—June 1974 (defined as the percentage change in prices

               from December 1973 through June 1974——a six—month price

               change).

The   expenditure price index was calculated for each of the 11,761
nonfarm   consumer units for each of these ten time periods. The distribu-

tions of the EPI's are summarized in Table 1 (part A), and    are shown in
Figures 1—7.

          The most significant fact to note about these distributions is

the magnitude of the dispersion. Consider the distribution of EPI's for

1973 (Figure 3). The estimated average percentage increase in the price

of   the bundle of goods purchased was 9.8   percent, but the standard

deviation   across   households in the percentage increase in the price was

2.3 percent. The price of the bundle of goods purchased by about 10 per-

cent of the households rose by less than 7 percent, while about 10 percent

of the households experienced a price rise in excess of 13 percent.

Said differently, only 32 percent of    the households are estimated to
have experienced a rise in the price of their bundle of market goods
which was within 10 percent of the mean price     rise of 9.8 percent    (i.e.

within the range 7.84 percent to 11.67 percent). Likewise for the other

time periods, the variation across households in the estimated rates

of price increase is considerable.

           In general, given one set of price changes attributed to all

household bundles, the absolute variation in the EPI's across households

is greater the larger the variance across households in the share of

each item in the consumption bundles, the larger the covariances in the

shares between items, the larger the differences across items in the

rates of price change, and the greater the correlation between these

variances (or covariances) and these differences in the rates of price

change.1



           1The EPI for household j is


                       EPI       =

where w        is the ith good's weight in the ith household's bundle and P
is the Ith good's price Increase. Imposing the constraint that     w.                           =
with good n as the redundant item we can rewrite equation (Al): -1
                                 n-i
          EPI      =   P     +          w •(P. — P )

and hereafter replace i — P                   by P. Then the variance across households
is

since there is no variation across households in the price change for
any item. The term Var(w14) is the variation across households in the
                     I
ith good's share in the consumption bundle. (Appendix Table A—2 shows
the standard deviations and the coefficients of variation of these shares
for the 52 items across the 11,761 households in the CES data.) The
covariance term is the covariatjon across households in the weights of
item i and item k.
                                   26




        The relative variation in the EPI's for these ten time periods

ranged between 13 percent and 45 percent. There is a tendency for the

relative variation in the estimated EPI's to be smaller over the longer
time periods. Of course, the longer time periods considered here happen

to be the earlier periods during which the rates of price increase were

relatively less. But even within the first half of 1974, while the

average coefficient of variation for the six months separately was about

29 percent, the coefficient of variation for the six—month period as a

whole was only about two—thirds as large, 20 percent. There is not

evidence, judging from the price variations in the first six months of

1974, that the coefficient of variation in the price indices is posi-

tively related to the level of the price increase.'

        The differences reflected in Table 1 between the mean level of

the EPI's and the official CPI for the comparable periods deserve comment.

These differences are not of much analytical interest, since they result

primarily from the differences in the methods of calculation. Most

importantly, as discussed above, the EPI's exclude certain consumer

items which are included in the CPI, notably house purchases. When

comparable sets of items are priced, the mean EPI and the "adjusted"

CPI differ very little.2


        'The most atypical month in this regard appears to be April, which
exhibited a considerably lower price rise than the other months and a
relatively large coefficient of variation. My casual impression is
that the exceptionally large decline in the relative price of food and
automobile purchases during that month resulted in the observed level
and distribution of EPI's.

        2For example, for the 1967—72 period the mean EPI was 22.5 and
the official CPI was 25.3. During that time period the house purchases
item rose in price by 40.1 percent; it Is excluded from the EPI's for
reasons discussed above. When I recomputed the change in the price index

        Another methodological difference between the calculated EPI's

and the CPI is the use of fixed expenditure weights in calculating the

former and fixed quantity weights in calculating the CPI. This differ-

ence appears to have little effect on the indices over the interval of

time considered. The EPI's for several of the time periods were recoin—

puted using fixed quantity weights for each household, estimated from

equation (6). The means and standard deviations of the EPI's for four

time periods for the 11,761 households are shown in Table 2 calculated

using the fixed expenditure weights and the fixed quantity weights.

Also indicated are the simple correlations across households between

these two estimates of the EPI's.

        Figures 1—7 document the considerable dispersion among households

in the impact of a given set of observed market price changes on the


for the 52 items included in the EPI and weighting by the CPI weights
 (normalized), the "adjusted CPI" was 22.1. Likewise, In the 1973 period
in which the mean EPI exceeded the official CPI (9.82 compared to 8.8),
the home purchase item which is included in the latter rose in price by
only 7.7 percent. When it and the smaller weighted items which have
been excluded from the EPI's were deleted from the CPI, the "adjusted CPI"
for 1973 rose by 9.8 percent. These calculations were performed not with
the intention of suggesting that the "adjusted CPI" is in any way prefer-
able to the official CPI, but only to emphasize that the difference in
mean EPI and the CPI simply reflects the difference in the definitions of
the bundles of goods priced.

prices of the various households' bundles of purchased goods and services.

One question raised by this observed dispersion is: does the dispersion

imply that it would be useful to construct a separate price index for

several different bundles of goods, or for bundles which characterize

the spending patterns of different economic or demographic groups in the

economy? Its usefulness would depend, of course, on the purpose for

which it is intended. The figures make clear that price indices of

different bundles of goods would indeed differ substantially in many

specific time periods. If the intention were to describe how a given

change in the set of market prices affected the prices of various bundles

of goods, several such indexes would be useful. But if the intention

were to calculate a price index which more accurately reflects the costs

to households within particular economic groups, the issue becomes the

dispersion in household—specific price indexes within household—

characteristic—specific groups compared to the dispersion between

groups. Furthermore, if the underlying concern is to track over time

the impact of price changes on the prices of different groups' bundles

of goods, even if significant differences exist in the various bundles'

price indices for one time period, it may not imply a divergence over

time in the price indices for different groups.

        The EPI's calculated here can shed some light on these issues.

It must be stressed that in calculating the EPI's all households were

assumed to confront the same changes in market prices for a particular

time period (e.g., the BLS estimated that the price of alcoholic bever-

ages rose 1.8 percent in 1972 and that price rise was then assumed to

be the price rise experienced by each of the households in the sample).
                                    29



 The discussion which follows does not address the question of the dif-

 ferences in (or uses of) group—specific price indices when group—specific

 prices as well as group—specific bundles of goods are estimated.

        Table 3 indicates means and standard deviations of EPI's for

 four time periods for various demographic and economic subgroups in the

sample. Part A lists several one—way groupings each of which utilizes

all observations while part B cross—classifies a far more demographically

homogeneous subgroup. We will consider the results from the classifica-

tion by 1960—61 after—tax money income. It appears that the mean EPI is

negatively related to the level of money income in 1973 and January 1974

and more nearly U—shaped in the earlier periods. Consider in more detail

the 1973 EPI's for the two groups with income levels of $l—2,000 and

$l0—15,000 (the mean EPI's for these two groups, as seen in column 5,

are 111.0 and 108.9). If we ask whether these two group means are

different from each other, by conventional standards of statistical

significance, they are.1

        But there Is considerable dispersion of EPI's within each of

the groups. The differences between group means are, in general in

Table 3, small relative to the within—group standard deviations. To

illustrate the point, suppose we asked what additional information is

acquired about the impact of the 1973 price changes on the EPI's of

the $10—l5,000 income households by using the percentage increase in



       1The test of a difference of these two means yields a test
statistic equal to 16.6 which is highly significant, statistically.
With large enough samples, any observed difference in the means Is
significant since the standard error of the difference varies Inversely
with the square root of the sample sizes.

 its own mean EPI (8.9) rather than the percentage increase in the mean

 EPI for the entire sample or, for that matter, the mean EPI for the low

 ($l—2000) income group. The group's own EPI is the best estimate of

the central tendency of the group's distribution of EPI's, but if we

define an interval around that mean of plus or minus 10 percent of the

mean, the interval captures only 31 percent of the high income house-

hold's EPI's! A comparable interval of plus or minus 10 percent around

the entire sample's mean EPI of 9.8 captures 32 percent of the high

income household's EPI's and a comparable interval around the low income

group's mean EPI of 11.0 captures 25 percent of the high income house-

hold's EPI's. An interval defined by the mean plus or minus 30 percent

of that mean captures 77 percent of the $lO—15,000 Income group's EPI's

if its own group's mean EPI is used, but again 78 percent (or 70 percent)

of that high income group's EPI's are captured by a comparable interval

around the entire sample's mean EPI (or around the low income group's
             1
mean EPI).




        1These calculations assume that the household—specific EPI's
within the group are distributed normally around its own group mean. The
figures quoted are obtained by calculating the interval (O.9Opi to l.lOiij)
using group l's mean EPI (11.0 from the low income group, 9.8 for the
entire sample, and 8.9 for the high income group) and then determining
from a standard normal table the percentage of observations from the
high income group (distributed normally with mean 8.9 and a2.2) within
that Interval.
        The comparable figures for the estimated proportion of the low
income group's EPI's encompassed by an interval defined by plus or minus
10 percent of the group's mean EPI are: 25 percent of the observations
if the own group's mean is used, 21 percent if the entire sample's mean
is used, and 17 percent if the high income group's mean is used.

        Table 3 suggests that the within—group variation in EPI's is

substantial, whether grouped by some single demographic or economic

variable or by a cross—classification of several variables (see part B

of Table 3). There is dispersion in the individual household's price

indices, and none of the grouping schemes which I have attempted (and

of which Table 3 is representative) appears to reduce substantially that

dispersion. A more straightforward approach to the question of the

relationship between certain soclo—economic characteristics and the

variation in the computed EPI's is a regression analysis. The following

section presents some results from regressions and also considers

briefly evidence on the covariation over time in the individual house-

hold's EPI's.

 III. Systematic Differences in the EPI's

        The preceding section indicates that there is considerable

dispersion among households in the impact of a given change in the price

vector of market goods on the price of the households' bundles of

purchased goods. The evidence of that dispersion gives force to the

question of whether there are systematic differences by soclo—econoinic

characteristics in the observed dispersion in these price changes. That

is, do certain types of households experience systematically larger

or smaller changes in their price indices than other types of households?

        This question gets to the heart of the recently intensified

social concern about the distributional impact of inflation on various

groups in the economy——the elderly versus the young, the wealthy versus

the poor, etc. While there has been much discussion of this issue,

there is, I think, surprisingly little evidence on the nature or magni-

tude of the effect of changes in the price level on the personal distri-

bution of real income. There have been several studies in the past few

years of the impact of inflation on the distribution of wealth among

household groups, firms and governments via the nature of the debtor—

creditor positions and the fixed and variable priced assets held by

these groups.' To other recent studies, one using data for the United

States and the other the United Kingdom, have considered the distribu-

tional effects of inflation among specific economic groups via differ-

ences in the groups' consumption bundles.

        A study by Nuellbauer investigates the differential impact of

changes in the price structure in the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1972

on the cost of living of consumers.' Muellbauer uses an estimated

system of linear demand equations (a Stone—Geary system of demand

functions) calculated for nine expenditure items with expenditure data

from 1954—1970. The system yields estimates of price and time—dependent

income (total expenditure) coefficients. Assuming a specific form of

the utility function Muellbauer computes a cost of living index which

is a function of levels of income (total expenditure), the price vector

and the coefficients from the demand equations. He finds that his

estimated cost of living index rose more during the 1964—72 period for

lower income consumers (for example, the percentage increase over the



        'John Muellbauer, "Prices and Inequality: The United Kingdom
Experience," The Economic Journal, 84 (March 1974).
        Muellbauer's procedure emphasizes the systematic differences in
the price index by income level, and incorporates estimated price elas-
ticities. By contrast, the procedure I have followed emphasizes the
dispersion——whether systematic or not——in the price indices. Said
differently, if we consider nine expenditure items and, say, 20 "repre-
sentative" consumer units and one period of price change, Muellbauer's
method involves 45 "degrees of freedom" ( 9 price changes + 8 price
coefficients + 8 expenditure coefficients + 20 expenditure levels)
while the procedure I have followed involves 169 "degrees of freedom"
(= 9 price changes + 20 [8 expenditure shares]). In fact, Muellbauer
employs 9 priced items and 9 expenditure levels while the data here
utilize 52 priced items and about 11,000 consumer units. Despite the
differences in methods the qualitative systematic differences in price
indices do appear to be rather comparable. In both studies the recent
increases in food and fuel prices appreciably affect——if not dominate——
the results.

nine years for the highest income group was 45 percent and for the

lowest income group 51 percent).

        On the basis of his own study of cost of living indices in the

1960's and other studies of the relative movement of fixed—weighted

price indices for groups in the United Kingdom since the late 1940's,

Muellbauer concludes that "for more than twenty years relative consumer

price changes [in the United Kingdom] have had an inegalitarian bias."

        By contrast, the study of the U.S. experience in recent years

shows no such consistency over time in the impact of price changes on

the relative position of the poor. Hollister and Palmer constructed a

1960—61 fixed—weighted price index for several categories of consumers

(e.g. the aged poor, the urban nonaged poor, all poor, all wealthy, and

a middle income group) using the same cross—section data set used in my

study, the 1960—61 BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey. On the basis of

the movement in those price indices for the various groups from 1953

through 1967 estimated annually, Hollister and Palmer concluded that

"the expenditure effects of the type of inflation we have experienced

since World War II, in general, have not been adverse for the poor.

Particularly in the 1960's the expenditure effects of rising price

levels have fallen somewhat less heavily on the poor than on other

income groups."1 An extension of these group—specific price indices

from 1967 through July 1974, however, showed a relatively higher rate

of growth of the "poor person's price index" than of the "high income

person's price index," especially in the time period since 1972.1 For

the period from 1967 through 1972 the ratio of the rise in the poor

person's price index to the rise in the rich person's price index was

1.03, for the period from 1972 through July 1974 the ratio was about 1.09.

        The present study is similar to these U.K. and U.S. studies in

several respects. While the Muellbauer procedure estimates the changes

in the composition of consumption bundles resulting from relative price

changes, it and my study restrict the focus of analysis to the impact

of price changes on the households' index of price changes. Neither

study considers the relationship between consumer price increases and

the value of flows or stocks of income or wealth. Both are partial

analyses. While the Hollister/Palmer and Palmer/Barth papers make esti-

mates of the relationships between inflation and earnings and assets,

they, and I,   use a fixed—weighted (Laspeyres) price index. None of

these studies, including mine, use price change data specific either to

the household or to the household type. Economy—wide observed price

changes for consumption categories are assumed to reflect the changes in

prices actually confronted by all households.2

        2Snyder reports some evidence that within some broad categories
of consumption, e.g. food, from the late 1930's through the mid—1950's,
items with lower income elasticities rose relatively more in price.
(See Eleanor M. Snyder, "Cost of Living Indexes for Special Classes of
Consumers," in The Price Statistics of the Federal Government, George J.
Stigler, chm., NBER, GS73, 1961).

        The nature of the evidence presented below differs substantially

from the Muellbauer and Hollister/Palmer and Palmer/Barth evidence in

other respects. These studies compute price indices for groups of

households directly. Yet the discussion in the preceding section empha-

sized that within such groups the expenditure bundles and the price indices

exhibit considerable dispersion in any particular time period. The

within—group variation appears to be large relative to the between—group

differences in means of price indices. With indices computed for each

individual household we can determine not only what statistically signif i—

cant relationships exist between the indices and the groups' characteris-

tics, but also how much of the individual variation is systematically

related to its groups' characteristics.

        In Table 4 the data set is partitioned into three groups defined

by marital status. For each of the groups (married spouse present,

divorced—widowed—separated, and single (whites only)), the table indi-

cates the means and standard deviations for a set of dummy variables

describing the demographic and economic characteristics of the group,

for the after tax 1960 family income of the group and for the 10 EPI's

for the group. For example, the table indicates that 36.5 percent of

the married couples lived in cities larger than 50,000; in 89.4 percent

of these households the race of the head was white, their average

family income in 1960 was $6,452, etc. Table 5 shows the simple

correlation matrix for each of these three groups. The correlations

between the price indices themselves will be presented and discussed

below (in Table 10). First, consider the relationship between the

demographic/economic variables and the expenditure price indices.

          From these three independent simple correlation matrices notice

that none of the demographic or economic variables has the same sign

for its correlation with the EPI's for all nine of the time periods

considered. Schooling level and family income appear to be negatively

related to the rate of change of prices in the period from 1972 through

early 1974, but less consistently so in the preceding five—year period

and rather consistently positively related in the second quarter of 1974.1

The age of the head of the household appears to exhibit just the opposite

pattern. Sex and race of the head of the household generally have

weaker correlations with the price indices while households in larger

cities appear to have experienced somewhat milder price increases in

1973 and the first half of 1974.2

          In order to see the partial relationships with the EPI's,

ordinary least squares regressions were run for each of these marital

status groups separately on each of the EPI's. The linear regressions

used individual households as units of observation. Results for the

first four time periods——the five—year period 1967—72, the year 1972,

the year 1973, and the month January 1974—for each of the marital

status groups are shown in Table 6. These regressions generally show



        1Palmer and Barth observe the same pattern in comparing their
"poor person's price index" and "high income person's price index."
The former rose more rapidly than the latter from mid—1973 through
February 1974 but rose less rapidly from February through their last
observation in July 1974. Of course, this consistency is not surprising
since their evidence and mine are not independent.

          2Recall that the procedure here uses the same price change for
all   households, so this statement pertains to systematic differences in
the   composition of the consumption bundle, not to direct evidence on
the   differential rates of changes in specific market prices in large
and   small cities.

 statistically significant and quantitatively sizable relationships

between the demographic variables and the EPI's. The relationships tend

to be relatively weakest (in terms of explained variance) in the five—

year period 1967—1972.

         Since the units in the regressions in Table 6 differ from five

years (in column one) to one month (in column four), it is not useful

to compare the magnitudes of the coefficients from period to period

without annualizing (or in some other way normalizing) them. To compare

the implied relationships between schooling level and EPI's and age of

head and EPI's, Table 7 is useful. Here the comparisons for the separate

marital status groups and separate time periods have been annualized

and we compare the estimated EPI's for college graduates versus grade

schooled heads and the estimated EPI's for households with the head

aged 70 or over versus the head aged 40 to 49. These figures are derived

from the slope coefficients in Table 6. The left—hand number in the

second row, —0.21, for example, indicates that the annual rate of price

increase over the year 1972 was about two—tenths of a percentage point

lower for single persons with 13 or more years of schooling than for

single persons with 8 or less years of schooling. In all the periods

except the first, the better educated experienced a less rapid rate of

price increase, holding constant the other household characteristics

in the regressions in Table 6. Since the annual rates of price increase

varied considerably among these four time periods, the education differ-

entials and age differentials are also expressed in Table 7 as a per-

centage of the average price rise for that period. I.e. that two—tenths

of a percentage point is six percent of the annualized average rate of

price increase for singles in 1972. Not only were the absolute

differentials by education and by age greater in the 1973 and early 1974

periods, the differentials expressed as percentages of the rates of

price rise also were considerably higher in the 1973 and January 1974

periods.

           Although the signs of the relationships in Table 7 are rather

persistent——the higher educated experienced generally lower rates of

price rise and the elderly experienced higher rates of price rise,

ceteris paribus, this consistency Is unusual. As with the simple cor-

relations, one sees few If any consistently positive or negative slope

coefficients in Table 6. Furthermore, the consistencies which do seem

to be exhibited are not in evidence when regressions for the subsequent

five months in 1974 are also considered. Table 8 shows these regres-

sions for the married couples only. While many of the household charac-

teristics are significantly and appreciably related to differential

rates of price rise in various time periods, these relationships are not

stable in sign or magnitude from period to period.

        Since these relationships did not appear to be stable, no effort

was made to refine the regression equations by introducing interaction

terms, other variables, etc. While the education level and age of the

household head presumably quite adequately reflect the household's relative,

long—run income position, these regressions were reestimated with the

1960 nominal after—tax income of the family included in the regression.

Table 9 indicates the results for the three marital groups for the 1973

EPI's; the table also shows the simple regression of the EPI on the

family income variable. The inclusion of the income variable in the six

separate 1974 monthly EPI regressions for the separate marital status

groups yielded the same pattern of relationships as the simple correla-

tions——the partial effect of income was negative in the first two or

three months and positive in the final three or four months. In the

six—month period as a whole the partial coefficient on income was posi-

tive (and statistically insignificant) for the single and divorced/widowed

groups but negative and statistically significant for the married

couples. Here too, then, the partial (and simple) relationship with

the rates of price rise is not a persistent one.

        The regression analysis has shown that in several recent time

periods of varying lengths, there are quantitatively important differences

in the rates of price Increase experienced by different demographic!

economic groups. These differences however are not stable from time

period to time period. But the stability of these relationships is

obviously very relevant for any generalization about the relative impact

of "inflation" on, different groups. Consequently, consider the following

evidence on this stability over time. The first question to be addressed

is whether there is evidence of a positive covariation over time across

households in the rates of price increase. The second question which

will be considered is whether the observed covariation Is systematically

related to the demographic/economic variables.

        A useful nonparametric test of the strength of the covariation

over time in the observed rates of price rise involves a simple contingency

table.1 Suppose we array all households by their percentage price

increases in say 1972 and then partition that distribution into quintiles.

So quintile #1 contains the 20 percent of the households with the lowest

EPI's for 1972, quintile #2 contains the 20 percent with the next lowest

EPI's, etc. We could do the same for the 1973 EPI's. Now, if there

were perfect stability in the relative impact of inflation on the house-

hold's EPI between those two years, we would expect to find that 100 per-

cent of the households in quintile #1 (the lowest EPI's) in 1972 would

also be in quintile #1 in the distribution of 1973 EPI's. So a contin-

gency table of the proportions of households In each quintile for 1973

 conditioned on its quintile in 1972 would contain 100 percent of the

 1972 quintile-specjf Ic group in the corresponding quintile for 1973, If

there were perfect stability. The matrix of transition probabilities

would have 1.0 along the principal diagonal and zeros in all other cells.

This circumstance will be referred to as "perfect stability." The

alternative extreme is the circumstance of "perfect instability" in

which the household's quintile for 1973 EPI's is independent of Its

quintile in the distribution of 1972 EPI's. In this case the expected

contingency table would have 20 percent of the households in each of the

cells in every row.

        Such contingency tables have been computed for several pairs of

EPI's. The table for the 1972 and 1973 EPI's for the entire sample of

11,761 households is shown here.

The table indicates that 57 percent of those households among the lowest

20 percent of the observed 1972 EPI's also had observed 1973 EPI's

which were among the lowest 20 percent. Another 24 percent of those

households with the lowest 20 percent of the 1972 EPI's had 1973 EPI's

in the second lowest quintile, and so forth. Neither the "perfect

stability" nor "perfect Instability" circumstance adequately characterizes
                                   54



this transition matrix.1 There does appear to be considerable consistency

in the household's relative position in these two distributions. I will

note only one qualification to this table. The relevant consideration

might be the transition matrix from one inflationary period to another——

from one price—rise episode to the next——and my partitioning by calendar

year probably does not accomplish the appropriate comparison. This

point might be emphasized with respect to all of the results regarding

stability over time in this paper——it is not clear how many degrees of

freedom or how many independent periods of price rise these several

EPI's represent.2 So seeing considerable consistency in the transition

matrix from 1972 to 1973——or from one month in 1974 to successive months

in 1974——does not constitute strong evidence of the stability of relative

price increases across households over time.

        Another measure of the covariation in EPI's over time is the

simple correlation between the EPI's for period t and period t+1.

Table 10, panel A, indicates the simple correlations between each pair

of EPI's for the 8802 households of married couples. The simple



        1Chi—square tests were conducted to test the observed array
against each of the two hypothetical arrays consistent with "perfect
stability" (an identity matrix) and "perfect instability" (a matrix
with each element equal to 0.2). Both null hypotheses were rejected——
the test statistic in each case exceeded the critical value of Chi—square
by a factor of at least one hundred—fold! With a sample size as large
as the one used here, practically any observed difference is a statis-
tically significant difference.

        2One of the important contributions to the study of business
cycles by the NBER research was the emphasis on the reference cycle as
the relevant unit of observation rather than the calendar year as the
unit of observation. In the study of inflation episodes as well,
several successive monthly surveys on the same several—month adjustment
in relative prices does not constitute several independent observations
on the relationships studied.

 correlation between the 1972 and 1973 EPI's was .63; the correlation

 between successive months in 1974 ranged between .38 and .68.   However,
 there were pairs of months in the first half of 1974 for which the

 simple correlation was negative and sizable——e.g. the correlation between

 the February EPI and the April EPI was —.26, or between February and June

 the correlation was —.45. So over these six months, and in fact over

 the two and one—half years from January 1972 through June 1974, house-

holds which experienced relatively large increases in the price of

 their consumption bundle in one subperlod tended to experience rela-

tively large increases In other subperIods as well.

        Panel A of Table 10 indicates a positive covariatjon over time

in the households' price indices. Since we observed above that at any

one period of time the variation across households in EPI's was related

to several demographic and economic variables, we can ask if the compon-

ents of the EPI's which are related to these demographic and economic

variables are more or less highly correlated over time than the compon-

ents of the EPI's which are unrelated to this set of variables. To

explore this issue the regression equations estimated for each time

period separately, for the 8802 households of married couples, were

used. First a predicted EPI, EPI.t, for household j in time period t

was computed using the regression equation for EPIC, and the household's

observed residual was also computed, u = EPI. — EPI. . The correla—
                                     it      Jt      jt
tion between EPI. and EPI     is the covariation over time between
                         jt+l
the component of EPI which is related to the explanatory variables (the

systematic components); the correlation between u. and uj÷1 is the

covariation over time In the component of EPI's which is not related to

the explanatory variables.
                                     57




        Panel B of Table 10 shows the simple correlations of the EPI's

and Panel C shows the simple correlations of the residuals. From these

 figures one cannot conclude that the systematic components are consist-

ently more or less highly correlated than the residual components. For

example, consider the covarlation between two successive pairs of months

in early 1974:



            Correlation            January—February        February—March
            Total                           .68                    .62
            Regression—related              .82                    .45
            Regression—residual             .66                    .64




The simple correlations between the EPI's was of the same order of

magnitude in these two periods, .68 and .62. But the portions of those

EPI's which were systematically related to the household's age, educa-

tion, family size, city size, and race were considerably more highly

correlated between the months of January and February (.82) but consider-

ably less highly correlated between the second pair of months (.45))


        10f course the overall covariance is a weighted sum of the
within—regression covariance and the residual covariance. An analysis
of covariance can be performed to test if the within—regression covari—
ance is statistically significant. Computing the sums of squares from
the simple correlation matrix, the F—test for the analysis of covariance
between the February and March 1974 EPI's is:

                                   S.S.           D.F.    M.S.             F
        regression—related        .003738           20   .000187         29.06

        total                     .060110         8800
                    =   1.88
Here, too, with so many degrees of freedom any relationship between the
regression—related components will exhibit statistical significance since
F varies directly with the residual degrees of freedom. In all the pair—
wise comparisons for which analyses of covariance were performed, the F
statistic exceeded the critical value manyfold.
                                    58



 So the covariation over time in the EPI's is not persistently greater

 for the household—characteristic—adjusted indices than for the residual

variation in EPI's.

        The decomposition of the covariance over time suggests that the

group—specific bundles did change in relative price somewhat persistently,

but not more so than the components of the consumption bundles which

were not related to the group's characteristics. In Section II the

evidence suggested that while group—specific consumption bundles differed

in relative price increases, standardizing for household characteristics

reduced the dispersion in EPI's among households very little; in Section III

a similar finding emerges that while group—specific price indices tended

to move with a positive correlation over time, this correlation is, in

general, not greater than the positive correlation over time in the

within—group residuals.

        So is there evidence that "inflation" systematically raises the

price index for certain types of households relative to other types?

There is evidence here that in particular, recent time intervals, there

have been statistically significant and quantitatively large differences

among types of households in the average rates of price change. But these

effects are not stable over time, and they are not large in comparison

with the dispersion among households in the estimated rates of price

change. Other recent studies of the distributional impact of inflation

have focused on differences in the price changes of household group

averages only, and have focused on the cumulative effects of price

changes over time. While Important, these focuses disregard the consider-

able dispersion in rates of price change among households of any particular
                                   59



type, and deemphasize the erratic nature of the relative price changes
                1
through time.

        To pursue the question of systematic differences one step

further, should one expect a persistent, systematic relationship between

household characteristics and changes in the relative prices of market

bundles? One would exist between income level and inflation, for example,

if, say, necessities (items with income elasticities less than unity)

invariably experienced relative price increases in periods of inflation.2



       11n his recent analysis of price changes in the United Kingdom
Muellbauer emphasizes the "inegalitarian bias" in consumer price changes
in recent years. He deals with the impact of the observed yearly price
changes in an eight—year period from 1964 through 1972 during which he
estimates that the cost of living for the low income group rose 15 percent
more than the cost of living for the high income group (51.4 percent
compared to 44.7 percent). However, for two of the eight year—to—year
changes in costs of living over this time period the estimated cost of
living for the poor rose less rapidly than for the wealthy (in the 1967—
1968 period, the former rose 30 percent less than the latter). Likewise
in the Palmer/Barth study (.   cit.), the "poor person's price index"
and the "high income person's price index" were computed monthly from
June 1973 through July 1974 and the former rose by 6 percent more than
the latter over that period. However, in six of the 13 monthly price
changes the "high income person's price index" rose relative to the "poor
person's price index." So there is not evidence from any of these three
studies of consistent effects on the price index of any income group.

             investigate this specific question empirically I computed an
unweighted Spearman rank correlation coefficient, r, and an unweighted
Person correlation coefficient, r*, between relative price changes over
the period 1967 to January 1974 and income elasticities for a set of
eleven aggregated expenditure items. (The income elasticities are taken
from R. Michael, The Effect of Education on Efficiency in Qnsumption,
NBER, 1972, p. 47.) The rank correlation was r = —0.28; the Pearson
correlation coefficient was r*    —0.31. A negatIve correlation implies
that necessities rose in relative price. For the same set of items,
however, for the observed price change for a preceding period of time
from 1958 to 1967, the comparable correlation coefficients were r = 0.32
and .r* = 0.17.  So while the relative prices of necessities rose most
rapidly in the past six years, the relative prices of luxuries rose most
in the preceding decade. A comparable correlation for the U.K. price
changes for 1963—72 from data on income elasticities and price changes
in Muellbauer (.
r = —0.41, r*
                    cit.) reflected a stronger negative relationship
                 —0.52.

But aside from built—in short—run lags in price adjustments, I know of

no economic reason why certain market goods or services would consist-

ently experience either an increase or a decrease in its relative price
                                              1.
as a result of a change in the price level.        Over time, persistent

relative price changes do occur, of course, as a result of relative

changes in production technology or in the costs of factor inputs, and

as a result of differences in the organization of product markets and

In various elasticities of product demand. But if "Inflation" is

something different from the aggregate impact of these various influences,

its relationship to them is not clear. If inflation is simply the

aggregate result of these several factors, then the policy—relevant

question is not "does inflation affect the price level for some groups

relative to other groups?" but rather, "do 'technology', specific bottle-

necks in supply, and specific natural resource scarcities adversely

affect the relative price of the market bundles of certain groups?" The

thrust of this latter question seems quite different from the former.




        'Do the demand or supply schedules of any consumer goods suffer
disproportionately from money illusion? Do increases in the money supply
tend to have their first—round price effects in certain product markets?

                                Appendix



        1. It was necessary in this study to match information on

expenditures for detailed items by individual consumer units from the

BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey 1960—1961 General Purpose Tape (CES)

with information on price changes for detailed items from monthly BLS

Consumer Price Index bulletins. Since the CES data were collected and

used by the BLS in selecting the appropriate market items to price

routinely, the conformity of definitions and coverage between these two

series was quite good. Table A—l lists the priced items selected to

match an expenditure category for those items in which the matchings

were not self—evident.

        2. Table A—2 indicates the relative weights of the detailed

expenditure items in various price indices. Panel A indicates the

weights in the official CPI at the time of its most recent revision,

December 1963, of the items which are used in the calculation of the

EPI's. Column 2 indicates the relative weights in the CPI by December

1973, which are computed by BLS following the procedure outlined in the

text in equatIons (5) and (6). The weights indicated for these two

columns have been adjusted to sum to unity. The third column in Panel A

indicates the mean weight of each item in the consumption bundles of the

11,761 nonfarm households used in calculating EPI's; the fourth column

indicates the standard deviation in each item's weight across the house-

holds. Column five shows the standard deviation relative to the mean

for each item, while the final column measures the degree of skewness

in the distribution of each item's weight among these 11,761 households.
                                      62



        Far and away the largest item in the consumption bundle is food.

It would have been far preferable to decompose that item into several

types of food expenditures, but the publicly available CES data tape

contains no breakdown of that item. The other relatively large items

are rent, food away from home, auto purchase, women's clothing, and

automobile gasoline and oil. The items displaying the greatest relative

variation in weights across households and the largest positive skews

tended tobe durables or luxuries such as owned vacation homes, medical

appliances, music lessons, or other lumpy expenditures such as hospital-

ized illnesses, and clothing for infants, while necessities such as

food, utilities, household supplies and personal care supplies had the

smallest coefficients of variation.

        Panel B lists the items included in the CPI but excluded from

the EPI computations because of lack of price data or the extreme

lumpiness of the purchase (in the case of the home purchase item).

Panel B also lists a few items not explicitly included as separate items

in the CPI but for which expenditure data from the CES exist although no

price data are available.

        3. Table A—3 lists the reported changes in the price Indices

for the 52 items included in the definition of the EPI's. These price

data are obtained from the monthly publication The Consumer Price Index,

BLS, U.S. Department of Labor (recently renamed CPI Detailed Report).

Notes:        (1)   In January 1972 the BLS altered the composition of its "hospital daily service charges" item,
                    renaming it "hospital service charges." These two series have been matched in order to obtain
                    the 68.8 percent price rise for 1967—1972.

           (2)      The BLS does not report a price index change for "women's clothing" in February and March since
                    some of the components of this item are Out of season. The price changes listed here are cal-
                    culated on the assumption of a constant rate of change in the price of that item from January
                    to April.
