                                               ABSTRACT

This paper asks how well Okun’s Law fits short-run unemployment movements in the United States
since 1948 and in twenty advanced economies since 1980. We find that Okun’s Law is a strong and
stable relationship in most countries, one that did not change substantially during the Great Recession.
Accounts of breakdowns in the Law, such as the emergence of “jobless recoveries,” are flawed. We
also find that the coefficient in the relationship—the effect of a one percent change in output on the
unemployment rate—varies substantially across countries. This variation is partly explained by idiosyncratic
features of national labor markets, but it is not related to differences in employment protection legislation.

       In 1962, Arthur Okun reported an empirical regularity: a negative short-run
relationship between unemployment and output. Many studies have confirmed this finding,
and Okun’s Law has become a fixture in macroeconomics textbooks. For the United States,
many authors posit that a one percent deviation of output from potential causes an opposite
change in unemployment of half a percentage point (for example, Mankiw, 2012).
       Yet many economists question Okun’s Law. A number of recent papers have titles
like “The Demise of Okun’s Law” (Gordon, 2011) and “An Unstable Okun’s Law, Not the
Best Rule of Thumb” (Meyer and Tasci, 2012). Observers have suggested that each of the
last three U.S. recessions was followed by a “jobless recovery” in which unemployment did
not fall as much as Okun’s Law predicts. Studies of international data suggest that Okun’s
Law is unstable in many countries (for example, Cazes et al., 2011). Some find that the
relationship broke down during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, when there was little
correlation across countries between the changes in output and unemployment (for example,
IMF, 2010).
       These claims matter for the interpretation of unemployment movements and for
macro policy. Okun’s Law is a part of textbook models in which shifts in aggregate demand
cause changes in output, which in turn lead firms to hire and fire workers. In these models,
when unemployment is high, it can be reduced through demand stimulus. Skeptics of Okun’s
Law question this policy view. McKinsey (2011), for example, argues that Okun’s Law has
broken down because of problems in the labor market, such as mismatch between workers
and jobs. They stress labor market policies such as job training, not demand stimulus, as the
key to reducing unemployment.
       This paper asks how well Okun’s Law explains short-run unemployment movements.
We examine data for the United States since 1948 and for twenty advanced countries since
1980. Our principal conclusion is that Okun’s Law is a strong and stable relationship in most
countries. Deviations from Okun’s Law occur, but they are usually modest in size and short-
lived. Overall, the data are consistent with traditional models in which fluctuations in
unemployment are caused by shifts in aggregate demand.
       There is one important qualification to the universality of Okun’s Law. While a stable
Law fits the data for most countries, the coefficient in the relationship–the effect of a one-
                                                2

percent change in output on the unemployment rate–varies across countries. We estimate, for
example, that the coefficient is –0.15 in Japan, –0.45 in the United States, and –0.85 in Spain.
These differences reflect special features of national labor markets, such as Japan’s tradition
of lifetime employment and the prevalence of temporary employment contracts in Spain.
       Section II of this paper introduces Okun’s Law and alternative approaches to
estimating it. The rest of the paper demonstrates the good fit of the relationship and points
out common flaws in analyses that report breakdowns of the Law.
       Section III considers U.S. data. We find that the U.S. Okun’s Law has a coefficient of
–0.4 or –0.5, with an R 2 in the neighborhood of 0.8. This finding is robust: it holds for
different time periods, for both quarterly and annual data, and for various methods of
measuring short-run movements in output and unemployment.
       Section IV examines the common claim that U.S. recoveries since the 1990s have
been “jobless.” We find no evidence that Okun’s Law broke down during these episodes.
Confusion on this issue has arisen because output grew more slowly in recent recoveries than
in earlier ones, causing high unemployment to linger. (Gali et al. 2012 make a similar point.)
       Section V extends our analysis to international data. Okun’s Law fits most advanced
economies, although the typical R 2 is somewhat lower than for the United States. The
coefficient in the Law varies across countries, but it is relatively stable within a given country.
We generally do not find that the coefficient has risen over time, as some studies suggest (for
example, IMF 2010).
       Section VI examines the Great Recession of 2008-2009. A number of international
studies suggest that Okun’s Law broke down during this period, but once again we find that
the Law holds up well. Apparent anomalies mostly disappear if we account properly for
cross-country differences in the Okun coefficient and in the lengths of recessions.
       Section VII seeks to explain the cross-country differences in Okun coefficients, with
limited success. We propose explanations for the largest outliers, such as Spain and Japan,
but we have not found a variable that explains the coefficients more generally. In particular,
they are not correlated with the OECD’s measure of legal employment protection, a variable
suggested by previous authors. Section VIII concludes the paper.

II. ESTIMATING OKUN’S LAW

       Here we introduce Okun’s Law and discuss how we assess its fit to the data.


A. Okun’s Law

       We presume there exist some long-run levels of output, employment, and
unemployment. We use the term “potential output” for long-run output, and the “natural rate”
for long-run unemployment. Potential output is determined by the economy’s productive
capacity, and it grows over time as a result of technological change and factor accumulation.
The long-run level of employment and the natural rate of unemployment are determined by
the size of the labor force and by frictions in the labor market. When output is at its long-run
level, employment and unemployment are also at their long-run levels.
       Following Okun, we assume that shifts in aggregate demand cause output to fluctuate
around potential. These output movements cause firms to hire and fire workers, changing
employment; in turn, changes in employment move the unemployment rate in the opposite
direction. We can express these relationships as


(1)    Et – Et* = γ (Yt – Yt *) + ηt, γ > 0;
(2)    Ut – Ut* = δ (Et – Et *) + μt, δ < 0;


where Et is the log of employment, Yt is the log of output, Ut is the unemployment rate, and *
indicates a long-run level.
       We can derive Okun’s Law by substituting (1) into (2):


(3)    Ut – Ut* = β (Yt – Yt *) + εt, β < 0,


where β = γδ and εt = μt + δ ηt. The coefficient β in Okun’s Law depends on the coefficients
in the two relationships that underlie the Law.
       Past research provides guidance about the values of the parameters in equations (1)-
(3). To see this, suppose first that changes in output and employment are movements along a
neoclassical production function: more labor produces more output. For the United States,
                                               4

economists believe that the elasticity of output with respect to labor is about 2/3, based on
factor shares of income. If we invert the production function, we get equation (1) with γ = 3/2
= 1.5.
         However, as pointed out by Okun and by Oi (1962), labor is a quasi-fixed factor. It is
costly to adjust employment, so firms accommodate short-run output fluctuations in other
ways: they adjust the number of hours per worker and the intensity of workers’ effort (which
produces procyclical movements in measured productivity). Because of these other margins,
we expect that γ, the response of employment to output, is less than the 1.5 suggested by a
production function.
         In equation (2), we expect the coefficient δ to be less than one in absolute value:
unemployment moves less than one-for-one with employment. As Okun discussed, an
increase in employment raises the returns to job search, which induces workers to enter the
labor force. Procyclical movements in the labor force partly offset the effects of employment
on the unemployment rate.
         Combining these ideas, the coefficient in Okun’s Law, β = γδ, should be less in
absolute value than the coefficient γ in the employment equation, which itself is less than 1.5.
Aside from these bounds, it is difficult to pin down the Okun coefficient a priori. It depends
on the costs of adjusting employment, which include both technological costs such as
training and costs created by employment protection laws. The coefficient also depends on
the number of workers who are marginally attached to the labor force, entering and exiting as
employment fluctuates.
         The error term εt in Okun’s Law captures factors that shift the unemployment-output
relationship. These factors include unusual changes in productivity or in labor force
participation. Saying that “Okun’s Law fits well” means that εt is usually small.


B. Estimation

         In estimating Okun’s Law, we take two approaches that Okun introduced in his
original article. The first is to estimate equation (3), the “levels” equation. In this case, the
tricky problem is to measure the natural rate Ut* and potential output Yt*. In most of our
analysis, we use the most obvious method: we smooth the output and unemployment series
with the Hodrick Prescott (HP) filter. However, we also try a number of alternatives given
                                               5

the imprecision of the HP filter.
       The other approach is to estimate the “changes” version of Okun’s Law:


(4)    ΔUt = α + β ΔYt + ωt,


where Δ is the change from the previous period. Notice that this equation follows from the
levels equation if we assume that the natural rate U* is constant and potential output Y* grows
at a constant rate. In this case, differencing the levels equation (3) yields equation (4) with α
= –β ΔY *, where ΔY * is the constant growth rate of potential, and ωt = Δ εt.
       Equation (2) looks easier to estimate than equation (1), because it does not include the
unobservables Ut* and Yt*. For many countries, however, the implicit assumptions of a
constant U* and constant long-run growth rate are not reasonable. We think it is better to
estimate Ut* and Yt * as accurately as possible than to assume the problem away. In any case,
both equations (1) and (2) fit the data well, but in most countries the fit is somewhat closer
for the levels equation.
       We estimate Okun’s Law with both annual and quarterly data. With annual data, our
specifications are exactly equations (3) and (4): we assume that the output-unemployment
relationship is contemporaneous. With quarterly data, we find that the fit of our equations
improves if we include two lags of the output term. These lags capture the idea that it takes
time for firms to adjust employment when output changes and for individuals to enter or exit
the labor force.


III. OKUN’S LAW IN THE UNITED STATES

       This section estimates Okun’s Law for the United States over 1948-2011, checking
robustness along several dimensions.


A. Annual Data: Main Results

       Table 1 reports estimates of the levels equation (3) and the changes equation (4). We
examine two versions of equation (3) with different series for Ut* and Yt*, which we create by
choosing different smoothing parameters in the HP filter. We try smoothing parameters of λ
= 100 and λ = 1,000, the most common choices for annual data.
                                                       6

         Our three specifications yield similar results. The estimates of the coefficient β are
around –0.4, and the R 2 s are around 0.8. The levels equation with an HP parameter of λ =
100 yields the best fit, by a small margin (coefficient = –0.41 and R 2 = 0.82). 2 Figure 1
illustrates the fit of Okun’s Law by plotting Ut – Ut* against Yt – Yt*, and the change in U
against the change in Y. No year is a major outlier in the graphs.3
         Some economists suggest that Okun’s Law is non-linear, with different
unemployment effects of increases and decreases in output (for example, Knotek, 2007). The
scatter plots in Figure 1 suggest that a linear Okun’s Law fits the data well. To confirm this
result, we estimate separate coefficients for positive and negative output gaps in the levels
equation, and for positive and negative output growth in the changes equation. We find no
evidence of non-linearity. For example, for the levels equation with an HP parameter of λ =
100, the estimated coefficients are –0.37 for positive output gaps and –0.39 for negative gaps;
the p-value for the null of equality is 0.61.
         Previous researchers also suggest that the coefficient in Okun’s Law varies over time
(for example, Meyer and Tasci, 2012). Once again, we find no evidence against our simple
specification with a constant Okun coefficient. As Figure 2 reports, the sup-Wald test for a
break in the Okun coefficient at an unknown date fails to reject the null of parameter stability
for all three of our baseline specifications. The maximal F statistics are 5.30, 3.99, and 4.49
for the three specifications (λ = 100, λ = 1,000, and changes), well short of the 10 percent
critical value of 7.12 calculated by Andrews (2003). We also estimate our equations
separately for the first and second halves of our sample (1948-1979 and 1980-2011), and
cannot reject equality of the two coefficients. For the levels specification with λ = 100, the
coefficients are –0.35 for the first half and –0.41 for the second, and the p-value for the null
of equality is 0.20. Finally, we estimate separate coefficients for each decade in our sample



2
  For all our regressions, we report ordinary least squares (OLS) standard errors. It is not clear whether robust
standard errors are more reliable for our samples, many of which are small. In any case, we have also computed
robust standard errors and they are generally close to the OLS standard errors.
3
 When data for 2009 were released, a number of observers suggested that unemployment was significantly
above the level implied by Okun’s Law. Subsequently, this anomaly disappeared because output data for 2009
were revised downward (Elsby et al., 2011).
                                                     7

and cannot reject equality of all coefficients (p-value = 0.38).4


B. Annual Data: Robustness

        The biggest problem in estimating Okun’s Law is that it includes the unobservable
variables Ut* and Yt*. Here we explore alternative approaches to this problem.


Addressing the Endpoint Problem

        It is well known that the HP filter, which we have used so far, is unreliable at the end
of a sample. This problem is salient because the economic slump starting in 2008 has large
effects on the HP estimates of Ut* and Yt*. For a smoothing parameter of λ = 100, the rise in
actual unemployment pulls the estimated Ut* from about 5 percent in the early 2000s to 8.7
percent in 2011. The growth rate of Yt* over 2008-2011 is 1.3 percent, well below the 2-3
percent rate considered normal before the Great Recession.
        Some economists find such estimates plausible, believing that “structural” problems,
such as mismatch between workers and jobs, have increased Ut* and reduced Yt*. Yet many
disagree, believing that recent movements in Ut and Yt are mostly cyclical, and that Ut* is
lower and Yt* higher than the HP estimates. For example, both the Council of Economic
Advisors and the Congressional Budget Office estimate that Ut* was under 6 percent in 2011.
        Therefore, to check robustness, we use a different approach to calculate Ut* and Yt* at
the end of the sample. We first estimate these variables from 1960 through 2007 by applying
the HP filter to that period, with a smoothing parameter of λ = 100. In 2007, the estimated Ut*
is 4.9 percent, and the growth rate of Yt* (the change from 2006 to 2007) is 2.8 percent. We
assume that Ut* and the growth of Yt* remain constant at these levels over 2008-2011. That is,
we attribute all of the increase in unemployment and growth slowdown after 2007 to
transitory deviations from Ut* and Yt*. Figures 3a and 3b compare the Ut* and Yt* paths
constructed this way to those based on the HP filter through 2011.
4
  In this exercise, we include 1948-1949 in the decade of the 1950s and 2010-2011 in the decade of the 2000s.
Authors including Meyer and Tasci, Owyang and Sepkhposyan (2012), and Daly et al. (2012) use rolling
regressions to argue that Okun’s Law is unstable over time. Our findings suggest that time-variation in the
estimated Okun coefficient is not statistically significant. Future work could compare our results to rolling
regressions in more detail.
                                                      8

        The scatter plot in Figure 3c shows how our alternative measures of Ut* and Yt* affect
the fit of Okun’s Law. Compared to the plot based entirely on the HP filter (Figure 1a), the
observations for 2008-2011 move up and to the left. That is, unemployment is higher relative
to the natural rate, and the output gap is more negative. But the regression has a coefficient of
–0.40, which is close to our baseline value of –0.41, and the 2008-2011 observations are still
near the line. Thus, Okun’s Law fits the data regardless of whether we interpret recent
movements in unemployment and output as changes in long-run levels or deviations from
long-run levels.


Forecast Errors

        Another approach to testing Okun’s Law avoids the need to measure Ut* and Yt*.
Instead, we measure short-run fluctuations in Ut and Yt with forecast errors. Specifically, we
examine deviations of four-quarter changes in output and unemployment from forecasts
published by the Survey of Professional Forecasters. We assume that forecast errors reflect
unanticipated shifts in aggregate demand, which should move unemployment and output in
the proportion given by Okun’s Law.
        The sample covers forecasts made in Q1 of each year from 1971 through 2011.
Figure 4 shows a scatter plot of the forecast errors. When we regress the forecast error for
unemployment on the forecast error for output, the coefficient is –0.32 (standard error =
0.03), not too far from the Okun coefficients estimated by other methods.5 The R 2 is 0.68.


CBO Estimates

        For completeness, we estimate Okun’s Law one other way: we estimate the levels
equation (3) with Ut* and Yt* measured with estimates of the natural rate and potential output
from the Congressional Budget Office. Economic commentators sometimes take this
approach, and it produces a good fit. For the period 1980-2011, when the CBO series are



5
 For the same sample, a regression of the actual four-quarter change in Ut on the actual change in Yt yields a
coefficient estimate of –0.37 (standard error = 0.04).
                                                              9


available, the estimated Okun coefficient is –0.55 and the R 2 is 0.89. This R 2 is higher than
those from our other methods of estimating Okun’s Law.
       We should be cautious, however, in interpreting this result. The CBO’s method for
estimating Ut* and Yt* uses a macro model that includes a version of Okun’s Law as one
assumption. Because Ut* and Yt* are derived from Okun’s Law, estimates based on these
series are not independent evidence that Okun’s Law holds.


C. Quarterly Data

       Table 2 presents estimates of Okun’s Law in levels and changes based on quarterly
data. For the levels specification, we again estimate Ut* and Yt* with the HP filter; we try
smoothing parameters of λ = 1,600 and λ = 16,000, which are common choices for quarterly
data. We present results with only the current output variable in the equation, and also with
two lags included.
       For the levels specification with no lags, the estimated Okun coefficients are –0.43
and –0.41, near the estimates with annual data. When lags are included, the coefficients on
the current Yt – Yt* are smaller, and the two lags are significant, implying modest delays in
the full adjustment of unemployment to output. The sums of the coefficients on current and
lagged output are –0.49 and –0.45. When the lags are included, the R 2 s are a bit higher than
those for annual data ( R 2 = 0.87 for λ = 1,600).
       For the changes specification, the quarterly results are slightly less robust. With no
lags, the coefficient on the change in output is only –0.29; when lags are included, the sum of
coefficients is –0.43, close to the results for the levels specification. The R 2 is on the low
side with no lags (0.49), and rises to 0.66 when lags are included. Evidently, the Okun
relationship in quarterly changes is somewhat noisier than the levels relationship or the
changes relationship in annual data.
       We illustrate the fit of our levels specification by calculating fitted values for the
unemployment rate. With lags included, these fitted values are


(5)    Uˆ t  U t*  ˆ0 (Yt  Yt* )  ˆ1 (Yt 1  Yt*1 )  ˆ2 (Yt 2  Yt*2 ) ,
                                                    10


where Ut* and Yt* are long-run levels from the HP filter, and the ˆ s are estimated
coefficients on the current and lagged output gaps. In this exercise, we use a smoothing
parameter of λ = 1,600 in the HP filter. Figure 5 compares the paths over time of Û t and of
actual unemployment Ut. We see that unemployment is close to the level predicted by
Okun’s Law throughout the period since 1948.


D. Comparison to Okun (1962)

        We find that Okun’s 50-year old specification fits our sample from 1948 through
2011. Yet our coefficient estimates differ somewhat from those in Okun’s original paper. The
absolute values of Okun’s estimates are close to 0.3; inverting this coefficient, he posited the
rule of thumb that a one point change in the unemployment rate occurs when output changes
by three percent. Our coefficient estimates, by contrast, are around –0.4 or –0.5. These
estimates fit roughly with modern textbooks, which report an inverted coefficient of two.
        Why do our coefficient estimates differ from Okun’s? The natural guess is differences
in data—either the sample period or the vintage of the data. But that is not the case; instead,
the differences in results arise from differences in the specification of Okun’s Law.
        This point is easiest to see for the changes version of the Law, where the key
specification issue is lag structure. Okun estimates the changes equation, our equation (4), in
quarterly data with no lags. Based on data for 1947Q2 through 1960Q4, he reports a
coefficient of –0.30. When we estimate the same specification for our longer sample, the
coefficient is almost the same: -0.29. For the changes equation, we obtain larger coefficients
only if we use annual data or include lags in our quarterly specification (see Tables 1 and 2).
        To pin down this issue, Table 3 reports quarterly estimates of the changes equation
with and without lags of output growth. We compare estimates for two periods: our full
sample, and 1948Q2-1960Q4, which is our best approximation of Okun’s sample with
currently available data. For Okun’s sample, we use 1965Q4 vintage data for output, which
should be close to the data that Okun used.6 With no lags, the estimated coefficient is –0.31


6
 The 1965Q4 vintage data is the earliest vintage of data for real GNP/GDP available from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia Real-Time Data Set for Macroeconomists (http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-
                                                                                              (continued)

for Okun’s sample (column 1) and –0.29 for our full sample (column 3). When two lags are
included, the sums of coefficients are, respectively, –0.44 and –0.43 (columns 2 and 4). Thus
we confirm that lag structure rather than data differences explains the variation in results.
         Since lags are significant when they are included, we interpret their absence from
Okun’s quarterly equation as a modest mis-specification. Okun underestimated the effects of
output on unemployment because he assumed that they are fully contemporaneous at the
quarterly frequency.
         It is more difficult to compare our estimates of Okun’s Law in levels to Okun’s
estimates, because of differences in the series for U* and Y*. Okun assumed that U* is 4.0
percent (Okun, 1962, p. 3) even though unemployment averaged 4.6 over his sample, and he
constructed a Y* series that usually exceeds actual output. Our estimation of U* and Y*
imposes the modern assumption that unemployment and output equal their long run levels on
average. Presumably this issue, along with lag structure, helps explain why our levels results
differ from Okun’s.


E. Output, Employment, and Unemployment

         We derived Okun’s Law, equation (3), from underlying relationships between
employment and output, and between unemployment and employment (equations (1) and (2)).
To check the logic behind the Law, we now estimate it along with the underlying
relationships. We use annual data for 1948-2011 and estimate the long-run levels of all
variables—employment as well as unemployment and output––with the HP filter and λ = 100.
We estimate equations (1), (2), and (3) jointly as a system of seemingly unrelated regressions
(SUR).
         Table 4 presents the results. The estimate of the coefficient γ in equation (1), which
gives the effect of output on employment, is 0.54. We confirm the prediction that this
coefficient is less than 1.5 but greater in absolute value than the coefficient in Okun’s Law.
The estimate of the coefficient δ in equation (2), which indicates the effect of employment on
unemployment, is –0.73, confirming the prediction that its absolute value is less than one.

data/real-time-center/real-time-data/data-files/ROUTPUT/). The results are similar if we use the 1948Q2-
1960Q4 sample and current (revised) data.
                                              12

(As discussed in Section II, these predictions follow from costs of adjusting employment and
procyclical labor force participation.) The R 2 s are 0.61 for equation (1) and 0.80 for
equation (2). The scatterplots in Figure 6 confirm that these equations fit well, with no major
outliers. The SUR estimate of the coefficient β in Okun’s Law is –0.41, the same as the OLS
estimate for the same measures of Y* and U* (see Table 1). We test the non-linear restriction
that β = γδ, which arises in our derivation of Okun’s Law, and fail to reject it (p-value = 0.38
based on the delta method).


IV. JOBLESS RECOVERIES?

       Many observers suggest that Okun’s Law has broken down in a particular way:
recoveries following recessions have become “jobless,” with weaker employment growth and
higher unemployment than Okun’s Law predicts (for example, Gordon, 2011). The
recoveries from the last three U.S. recessions––those of 1990-91, 2001, and 2008-2009––
have all been called jobless. Many economists treat the emergence of jobless recoveries as a
fact to be explained. In 2011, for example, Barcelona’s Center for International Economic
Research held a conference on “Understanding Jobless Recoveries” that focused on the three
U.S. episodes.
       We have found no evidence of a breakdown in Okun’s Law. As Figure 5 shows, the
path of U.S. unemployment consistently fits the predictions of Okun’s Law, and recent
recovery periods are no exception. This finding raises a puzzle: why do so many observers
think that something in the employment-output relationship has changed?
       To see why recent recoveries might appear jobless, we examine the recovery from the
Great Recession of 2008-2009. Figure 7 shows the paths of output, unemployment, and the
employment-population ratio from 2007 through 2011. We also present estimates of the
long-run levels of the three variables based on their pre-recession behavior. As in Figure 3,
we estimate trends with the HP filter through 2007, and assume that Ut*, the growth of Yt*,
and the growth of the long-run employment-population ratio remain at their 2007 levels over
2008-2013.
       Many interpret the experience shown in Figure 7 as a jobless recovery. For example,
the website of National Public Radio (2011) presents similar graphs under the headline,
“Output Came Back, Employment Didn’t.” These statements are true in the sense that the
                                              13

employment-population ratio has been steady at a low level, while the growth rate of output
has returned to normal (the paths of actual and potential output are roughly parallel) and the
level of output surpassed its pre-recession peak in 2011.
       Yet, as the Figure makes clear, Okun’s Law has not broken down. Okun’s Law is a
relationship between deviations of unemployment and output from their long-run levels.
Since a large output gap has persisted, Okun’s Law predicts large deviations of employment
and unemployment from their long-run levels. From 2009 through 2011, the output gap as
measured in Figure 7 averaged –10.8 percent and the unemployment gap averaged 4.4
percentage points. The ratio of the two gaps, –0.41, is close to our earlier estimates of the
Okun coefficient.
       Why have the last three recoveries been viewed as jobless, while previous recoveries
were not? Gali et al. (2012) give the answer: since the 1990s, the speed of recoveries (which
they measure with output growth in the three years after a trough) has been slower than
before. In the early 1990s and early 2000s, as well as after the Great Recession, slow growth
meant that sizable output gaps persisted well into the recovery. In contrast, in most earlier
recessions, the output trough was followed by a period of above-normal growth that pulled
output back to its previous trend. As Okun’s Law predicts, employment and unemployment
also returned to normal, and that made the recoveries look job-full.
       Figure 8 illustrates this point with data for the early 1980s. After the recession of
1981-82, output growth averaged 5.9 percent over 1983-84, with the result that output,
employment, and unemployment were all close to their previous trends by 1984. Based on
experiences like this one, observers came to expect that the end of a recession would lead
quickly to a full recovery of employment. They were surprised when this did not happen
more recently, even though Okun’s Law has not changed.
       To be clear, we explain the behavior of employment in recent recoveries taking as
given the fact that output growth was slow. Gali et al. (2012) discuss possible explanations
for slow growth, such as the zero bound that has constrained monetary policy since 2008.


V. OKUN’S LAW IN 20 ADVANCED ECONOMIES
                                                  14

        Here we examine the fit of Okun’s Law in 20 countries: those with populations above
one million that were members of the OECD in 1985. We use annual data on output and
unemployment from the OECD.7


A. Basic Results

        We examine the period from 1980-2011. We start our samples in 1980 because, in a
number of countries, unemployment was very low in earlier periods. An extreme example is
New Zealand, where unemployment rates between 1960 and 1975 ranged from 0.04 percent
to 0.66 percent. Evidently, some countries’ economic regimes in the 60s and 70s differed
from those of more recent decades, or unemployment was measured differently.
        For each country in our sample, Table 5 reports estimates of Okun’s Law in levels,
with Ut* and Yt* measured with an HP parameter of λ = 100. The fit is good for most
countries, though usually not as close as for the United States. The R 2 exceeds 0.4 in all
countries but Austria and Italy. Spain’s R 2 of 0.90 is the highest.8
        The estimated coefficients on the output gap vary across countries. Most are spread
between –0.23 and –0.54, but two are lower in absolute value (Austria and Japan), and Spain
is an outlier with –0.85. Countries with higher R 2 s generally have higher coefficients,
although Japan is an exception: it has a fairly high R 2 (0.74) but a low coefficient (–0.16).
Japan’s unemployment movements are small and are well explained by its output movements
and a low coefficient in Okun’s Law.
        We have also estimated Okun’s Law with an HP parameter of λ = 1,000 for Ut* and
Yt*, and Okun’s Law in changes. The results are qualitatively similar to those in Table 5,
although the fit is not as close for some countries. Averaging across the 20 countries, the R 2
is 0.63 for the λ = 100 results in Table 5, 0.59 for λ = 1,000, and 0.49 for the changes
equation. The average coefficients for the three specifications are –0.40, –0.37, and –0.33.

 We present results for OECD data based on national definitions of unemployment. The results are similar
when we use the OECD’s harmonized unemployment series.
8
 We estimate the Okun coefficient for each country with OLS. The results are similar if we estimate the
coefficients jointly in a panel framework with Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR).
                                               15


B. Stability Over Time

       We now ask whether the Okun’s Law coefficient is stable over time in a given
country. Previous studies have suggested not: Cazes et al. (2012) find that the coefficient
varies erratically in many countries, and IMF (2010) finds that it has generally risen over
time. The IMF study’s explanation is that legal reforms have reduced the costs of firing
workers.
       As with the United States, we do a simple check for stability in each country by
estimating separate coefficients for the first and second halves of the sample: 1980-1995 and
1996-2011. Table 6 presents the results.
       We find some evidence of instability: for seven of the 20 countries, we can reject
equality of the first-half and second-half coefficients at the five percent level. However, in
five out of these seven cases, the coefficient is lower in absolute value in the second half of
the sample. The average coefficient for the 20 countries is –0.43 in the first half of the
sample and –0.36 in the second. Our data generally do not support the view that the Okun
coefficient has risen over time.
       The differences in coefficients across countries are similar in the two time periods.
For example, Spain’s coefficient is the highest in both periods, and Austria and Japan’s are
the two lowest. Overall, the correlation of coefficients across the two periods is 0.49.


VI. OKUN’S LAW IN THE GREAT RECESSION

       Skepticism about Okun’s Law has grown in the wake of the Great Recession of 2008-
2009. One reason, emphasized by IMF (2010) and McKinsey (2011), is that there is little
correlation across countries between decreases in output and increases in unemployment
during the countries’ recessions. Once again, we believe that claims of a breakdown in
Okun’s Law are exaggerated.


A. Output and Unemployment from Peak to Trough

       We can see why a quick look at the data might suggest a breakdown of Okun’s Law.
Nineteen of the countries in our sample (all but Australia) experienced a recession that began
in either late 2007 or 2008, according to Harding and Pagan’s (2002) definitions of peaks and
                                              16

troughs in output. For these countries, Figure 9a plots the change in output from peak to
trough against the change in unemployment over the same period. This Figure is similar to
one in IMF (2010).
       The Figure shows that changes in output and unemployment are uncorrelated across
countries. When the change in U is regressed on a constant and the change in Y, the R 2 is
–0.03. Commentators have used subsets of the observations in Figure 9a as evidence against
Okun’s Law. McKinsey, for example, points out that Germany and the United Kingdom had
larger output falls than the United States and Spain, yet unemployment increased by less in
the U.K. and fell in Germany.
       Such evidence has led researchers to propose novel factors to explain unemployment
changes. IMF (2010) suggests that financial crises and house price busts raise unemployment
for a given level of output. McKinsey suggests that output growth may fail to decrease
unemployment because workers lack the skills for available jobs.


B. Correcting for the Length of Recessions

       It is misleading to compare output and unemployment changes during different
countries’ recessions, because recessions last for varying lengths of time. For the set of
recessions in Figure 9a, the period from peak to trough ranges from two quarters in Portugal
to seven quarters in Demark. Okun’s Law implies a relationship between the changes in
unemployment and output only if we control for this factor.
       To see this point, suppose that the changes version of Okun’s Law holds exactly in
quarterly data:


(6)    ΔUt = α + β ΔYt , α > 0, β < 0,


where for the moment we assume the parameters α and β are the same for all countries. Let T
be the number of quarters in a recession. Cumulating equation (6) over T quarters gives


(7)    Σ ΔU = α T + β Σ ΔY,


where Σ indicates the cumulative change over a recession.
                                               17

       Recall that α > 0 because potential output grows over time. Thus, holding constant the
change in output, a longer recession implies a larger rise in unemployment. With potential
output on an upward path, a given absolute fall in output translates into a larger output gap
and higher unemployment if it occurs over a longer period
       We examine the fit of equation (7) across countries by regressing the cumulative
change in U during a country’s recession on the cumulative change in Y and the recession
length T (without a constant term). This regression yields estimates of α = 0.70 (standard
error = 0.30) and β = –0.12 (standard error = 0.25). Figure 9b plots the cumulative change in
U against the fitted values from this regression. We see that the version of Okun’s Law in
equation (7) explains a substantial part of the cross-country variation in Σ ΔU: the R 2 is 0.54.
Notice that Spain is less of an outlier than it was in Figure 9a. The large increase in Spanish
unemployment is partly explained by the length of Spain’s recession––six quarters, the
second-longest in the sample.


C. Adjusting for Country-Specific Coefficients

       We saw in Section V that the coefficient in Okun’s Law varies substantially across
countries. We now ask whether changes in unemployment during the Great Recession fit the
Law, given the usual coefficient for each country. That is, we examine the fit of


(8)    Σ ΔU = αi T + βi Σ ΔY,


where αi and βi are the parameters of Okun’s Law for country i.
       We compute the fitted values of Σ ΔU implied by equation (8). For αi and βi , we use
estimates of Okun’s Law in changes for annual data over 1980-2011 (with αi divided by four
to fit the current exercise with quarterly data). The αi’s average 0.87 across countries (0.22
once we divide by four), and the βi’s are highly correlated with the Okun coefficients in
Table 5 (which are estimated with the levels version of Okun’s Law).
       Figure 9c compares the actual and fitted values of Σ ΔU. We see that equation (8) fits
well: the R 2 is 0.76. Again, Spain is a good example. Its large rise in unemployment is
explained almost entirely by the fact that its Okun coefficient βi is unusually large, along
with the length of its recession. In other words, Spain did experience a larger rise in
                                             18

unemployment than other countries, but that is what we should expect based on its historical
Okun’s Law.


D. A German Miracle?

       When economists discuss deviations from Okun’s Law, many stress the recent
experience of Germany. As Figure 9 shows, Germany is the one country where
unemployment fell during its recession, an outcome that is often called a “miracle” (for
example, Burda and Hunt, 2011). Many economists explain this experience with work-
sharing—decreases in hours per worker—encouraged by government subsidies to employers
who retained workers.
       Figure 9c confirms that Germany deviated from Okun’s Law during its recession. Its
predicted change in unemployment was 2.2 percentage points, and its actual change was –0.3
percentage points. This episode reminds us that Okun’s Law does not explain 100 percent of
unemployment behavior. Yet “miracle” may be an exaggeration of Germany’s experience.
The residual in Germany’s Okun’s Law is modest compared to cross-country differences in
unemployment changes.



VII. EXPLAINING CROSS-COUNTRY VARIATION IN OKUN’S LAW

       We have seen that most countries have a well-fitting Okun relationship, but that the
Okun coefficient differs across countries. What explains these differences?


A. Looking for Explanatory Variables

       We can gain some insight about the Okun coefficient from Figure 10, which plots the
estimated coefficients for our 20 countries against the average level of unemployment over
1980-2011 (left panel). We see an inverse relationship: in countries where unemployment is
higher on average, it also fluctuates more in response to output movements. This result is
driven primarily by a cluster of countries with low unemployment and low coefficients––
Switzerland, Japan, Austria, and Norway––and by Spain, which has very high unemployment
and a very high coefficient. It appears likely that the underlying factors that determine the
Okun coefficient also influence average unemployment.
                                                   19

        We have looked for the underlying determinants of the Okun coefficient, but our
results are largely negative. A notable failure is the OECD’s well-known index of
employment protection legislation (EPL). In theory, greater employment protection should
dampen the effects of output movements on employment and therefore reduce the Okun
coefficient. In Figure 10 (right panel), we test this idea by plotting the coefficient against the
OECD’s overall EPL index (averaged over 1985-2008, the period for which it is available).
The relationship has the wrong sign, and it is statistically insignificant.9


B. Individual Countries

        We can also learn about the Okun coefficient by examining individual countries. It
appears that the labor markets of many countries have idiosyncratic features that influence
the coefficient. These features––not one or two variables that we can measure for all
countries––probably account for most of the variation in the coefficient. To support this idea,
we examine the country with the highest estimated coefficient, Spain, and the three countries
with the lowest coefficients.


Spain

        This country’s Okun coefficient, –0.85, is much higher in absolute value than any
other country’s. The natural explanation is the unusually high incidence of temporary
employment contracts. Labor market reforms in the 1980s made it easier for Spanish
employers to hire workers on fixed-term contracts, without the employment protection
guaranteed to permanent workers. Over the 1990s and 2000s, such contracts have accounted
for around a third of Spanish employment. Temporary contracts make it easier for firms to
adjust employment when output changes, raising the Okun coefficient.
        Notice that the OECD’s EPL index assigns a fairly high number to Spain, suggesting
that it is not easy for Spanish employers to adjust employment. However, close observers of
Spain argue that the OECD index is not a good measure of flexibility in this case. One reason


9
 For New Zealand, the EPL index is available over 1990-2008. We also find no relationship between the Okun
coefficient and the various components of the EPL index.
                                               20

is that the OECD does not account for the non-enforcement of de jure restrictions on fixed-
term contracts (Bentolila et al., 2010).


Japan

        This country’s Okun coefficient, –0.16, is the second smallest in absolute value. The
likely explanation is Japan’s tradition of “lifetime employment,” which makes firms reluctant
to lay off workers. This feature of the labor market is a choice of employers, not a legal
mandate, and therefore is not captured by the EPL index.
        Ono (2010) reports that the lifetime employment tradition has weakened somewhat
over time. This suggests that Japan’s Okun coefficient may have risen––and indeed, Japan is
one of the two countries with a statistically significant increase in the coefficient from the
first half of our sample period to the second (see Table 6). However, the coefficient is low
compared to other countries––under 0.2––in both parts of the sample.


Switzerland

        This country’s coefficient, –0.24, is the third smallest. A likely explanation is the
large use of foreign workers in Switzerland. When employment rises or falls, migrant
workers move in and out of the country. Changes in employment are accommodated by
changes in the labor force, and unemployment is stable.
        Recall that Okun’s Law is derived from an employment-output relationship, equation
(1), and an unemployment-employment relationship, equation (2). We estimate these two
equations for our 20 countries and examine where Switzerland lies in the ranges of
coefficients. Switzerland’s coefficient in the E-Y equation, 0.46, is near the middle of the
range for the 20 countries. Switzerland’s coefficient in the U-E equation, –0.17, is the second
smallest, and it is statistically insignificant. These results confirm that Switzerland’s unusual
feature is the non-responsiveness of unemployment to employment.



Austria

        Austria’s data are puzzling. Its Okun coefficient, –0.14, is the smallest for our 20
countries, and we have not found an explanation for this result. When we estimate the E-Y
                                               21

and U-E relationships, the coefficients in both are implausibly small—less than 0.02 in
absolute value. We leave further investigation of Austria for future research.


VIII. CONCLUSION

       It is rare to call a macroeconomic relationship a “law.” Yet we believe that Okun’s
Law has earned its name. It is not as universal as the law of gravity (which has the same
parameters in all advanced economies), but it is strong and stable by the standards of
macroeconomics. Reports of deviations from the Law are often exaggerated. Okun’s Law is
certainly more reliable than a typical macro relationship like the Phillips curve, which is
constantly under repair as new anomalies arise in the data.
       The evidence in this paper is consistent with traditional macro models in which shifts
in aggregate demand cause short run fluctuations in unemployment. At this point, we do not
claim that the evidence is not consistent with other theories of unemployment, such as those
based on sectoral shocks or extensions of unemployment benefits. The usefulness of Okun’s
Law in testing macro theories is a topic for future research.
       A possible starting point is the fact that the Okun coefficient is far smaller than one
would expect from an inverted production function (even when we put employment rather
than unemployment on the left side of the Law). Traditional macro explains this fact with
costs of adjusting employment to aggregate demand shifts. It is not clear whether a small
Okun’s coefficient arises naturally in other models of unemployment.
