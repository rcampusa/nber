                                         ABSTRACT

This paper uses a natural field experiment to examine the effectiveness of specific nudges on tax
compliance amongst firms and the self-employed in the Dominican Republic. In collaboration
with the Dominican Republic's tax authority, we designed messages for more than 28,000 self-
employed workers and over 56,000 firms. Leveraging administrative tax data, we find evidence
that our nudges (increasing the salience of prison sentences or public disclosure of tax evaders)
have large effects on increasing tax compliance, primarily working through the channel of
decreasing claimed tax exemptions. Interestingly, we find that firms are more impacted than the
self-employed, and that firm size is critically linked to nudge effectiveness: larger firms are
considerably more influenced by nudges than smaller firms. We find this latter result noteworthy
given the paucity of evidence showing significant behavioral impacts of nudges amongst the
largest players in a market. Overall, our messages increased tax revenue by $193 million (roughly
0.23% of the Dominican Republic's GDP in 2018), with over $100 million constituting income
that the government would not have received without our field experimental nudges.

1.     Introduction

Encouraging tax compliance has been central to governments at least since the
ancient states of Persia, Greece, Egypt, and Rome began collecting taxes. Over
the years, tax collectors as far removed as the Ottomans to the English, have de-
veloped clever schemes, such as "tax farming," whereby the government awarded
the right to collect taxes to the highest bidder in competitive auctions. For their
part, economists have long understood the essential role of financing the provi-
sion of public goods for economic growth, especially in developing economies
(Smith, 1776; Besley and Ghatak, 2010; Besley and Persson, 2014). Higher tax
evasion rates in developing countries generally lead to governments raising sub-
stantially lower tax revenue as a share of GDP than higher-income countries
(Besley and Persson, 2014). As such, understanding the determinants of tax
compliance is a primary objective for governments and policy makers (Slemrod,
2019).
     Within economics, tax evasion is understood through the model of (Alling-
ham and Sandmo, 1972), who adapted (Becker, 1968) to the tax compliance
context. In this model, taxpayers weigh the financial benefits of evading taxes
with the financial penalties they face if their evasion is detected. Experimental
studies varying the audit rates or financial penalties generally find effects that
align with the model's predictions (Blumenthal et al., 2001; Slemrod et al., 2001;
Hasseldine et al., 2007; Kleven et al., 2011; Hallsworth, 2014; Harju et al., 2014;
Slemrod, 2016). However, Alm et al. (1992) point out that astronomical levels of
risk aversion are necessary to justify the level of compliance observed in most
nations and B´
             ergolo et al. (2017) find evidence consistent with firms exhibiting
probability neglect in feared situations.
     In response to this criticism, a rich literature on tax morale has attempted
to understand non-pecuniary motives for tax compliance (Luttmer and Sing-

                                            1
hal, 2014). This literature typically focuses on sending potential tax payers mes-
sages that highlight the public goods provided by tax dollars (Bø et al., 2015);
increase the salience of tax compliance norms (Hallsworth et al., 2017); change
the framing of the message (Hallsworth et al., 2015), or appeal to the morality of
the taxpayers (Torgler, 2004). The effect of these messages on tax compliance is
inferred from differences in taxes paid between treatment and control groups.
Overall, the evidence on the existence of non-pecuniary benefits of tax compli-
ance is mixed while nudges focusing on traditional or social deterrence tend to
be more effective (Antinyan and Asatryan, 2019; Slemrod, 2019; Perez-Truglia
and Troiano, 2018; Dwenger and Treber, 2018).
   Despite the abundance of evidence in favor of using deterrence messages,
there are several important gaps in the literature. A key gap involves firm-level
compliance. Given that in most countries the tax burden across large and small
firms is typically quite disproportionate, a unique feature of our analysis is an
exploration of nudge effectiveness across the distribution of firm sizes. In do-
ing so, a natural comparison involves how nudges impact firms versus the self-
employed. To lend empirical insights into these areas, we partner with the in-
ternal revenue service in the Dominican Republic (IRSDR hereafter). We sent
nearly 84,000 messages to self-employed individuals and firms who collectively
paid about $800 million in income taxes in FY2018.
   In sum, we randomly allocated subjects into one of six groups. Our control
group is a simple reminder message sent to taxpayers before the tax deadline.
Before our partnership, this was standard practice for the IRSDR. To augment
this baseline, we include two deterrence messages. One message increased the
salience of potential prison penalties instituted under a new law while the other
increased the salience of potential social punishments by emphasizing potential
public disclosure of punishments. Then, we interact all 3 of the messages types


                                        2
with a reframing of tax mistakes as voluntary choices on the part of the taxpayer
(Hallsworth et al., 2015). Using administrative tax data, our key outcome variable
is the change in the taxes paid by subjects across the 6 experimental cells.
   We report three main results. First, difference-in-differences estimates of the
treatment effects suggest that both the threat of public disclosure and prison
sentences substantially increase tax compliance. For firms, the public disclo-
sure message increases the amount of taxes paid by an average of $2,200 while
the prison message increases taxes paid by $5,300 (all monetary figures are mea-
sured in USD). These effects are primarily driven by declarations: firms that
would have declared exempt levels of taxable income are nudged to report posi-
tive taxable income. Self-employed workers also increase taxes paid in response
to the deterrence messages. However, the measured effects are smaller than for
firms: both message types increase tax revenue from self-employed workers by
roughly 12% relative to a simple reminder message. In contrast, the public dis-
closure and prison messages increase tax revenue from firms by 18% and 44%,
respectively.
   Second, the effects of commission framing depend greatly on the perceived
underlying punishment and subject pool. When accompanying the control mes-
sage alone, telling subjects that the IRSDR may view mistakes as an active choice
has a negligible effect on tax compliance. Adding the commission message to the
public disclosure treatment has a similar negligible effect. However, adding the
commission frame to the prison message doubles its magnitude. In this case,
firms in our sample increase tax compliance by roughly 100% while the treat-
ment increases the tax compliance of self-employed workers by 21%. The sen-
sitivity of the commission language treatment effect to the underlying punish-
ment suggests a possible explanation for the disparate findings in (Hallsworth et
al., 2015), who find that commission framing doubles taxes paid, and (De Neve


                                        3
et al., 2019) who find no effect.
      Third, we find that nudge effectiveness is critically related to firm size. While
both types of deterrence messages increase the taxes paid from small firms, the
nudge effect on large firms is a magnitude higher. Indeed, we find that smaller
firms are the least likely to respond to our deterrence messages. This result com-
plements the insightful literature on the tax compliance of small or medium-
sized firms1 by showing that a key contributor to the tax base (large firms) can
be moved by behavioral nudges. This finding has import more generally in that
it is rare to experiment on the largest entities in a market, be it a tax, charitable,
service, or goods market. In this case, we can observe firms from the entire distri-
bution of sizes. Understanding how large firms react to these types of messages
is of great interest to policymakers since the largest firms bear a disproportion-
ate amount of the tax burden (in the DR, 20% of firms pay over 85+% of corporate
income taxes). In this spirit, the finding that the largest firms are those that re-
spond most strongly to nudges from the tax authority represents a new insight
in the literature, and opens up the potential for even broader uses of behavioral
nudges.
      Considering the benefits and costs from this exercise, we find that, overall,
treatment messages increased tax compliance by $193 million (0.23% of the Do-
minican Republic's GDP in 2018). After accounting for subsequent audits by
the IRSDR, we find that more than half of this revenue constitutes income the
government would not have received without our treatments. Of course, the
marginal costs of our field experiment are trivial since the operational frame-
work was in place when we started and the extra content in the letters repre-
sented minimal additional cost
      In terms of generalizability of our empirical results, we follow the List (2020)

meyer et al. (2019).

SANS conditions in our reporting. First, in terms of selection, our sample is a
subset of the firms and self-employed taxpaying entities in the Dominican Re-
public. In particular, the IRSDR sent messages to a sample of more than 84,000
self-employed and firms that reported earning more revenue than the average
firm in the Dominican Republic in the previous year. In terms of attrition, our
compliance rates are 100%, as we have records of the amount of taxes paid for
everyone in our sample. Considering naturalness of the choice task, setting, and
time frame, we use a natural field experiment (see Harrison and List (2004)), thus
our setting is one in which subjects are engaged in a natural task and are not
placed on an artificial margin. Finally, in terms of scaling our insights, the re-
sults suggest that the benefit cost profile should shrink slightly as the program
is extended to the remaining population of the Dominican Republic. This is be-
cause we have slightly larger firms in our experiment compared to the overall
firm population. Since we view the firm size results as a WAVE1 insight, in the
nomenclature of List (2020), replications need to be completed to understand
if the size result can be applied to other tax paying populations as well as large
players in other markets.
     The remainder of our paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the in-
stitutional context, subjects, and experimental design. Sections 3 and 4 describe
the empirical results. Section 5 concludes.



2.     Background and Experimental Design

In this section, we describe the institutional context of our experiment, the sub-
ject's included in the experiment along with their incentives, and the experimen-
tal design.



                                        5
2.1       Institutional Context

The Dominican Republic is a Caribbean country with GDP per capita of $8,341
in 2018, and tax revenue was 13% of GDP, much lower than the 22.8% average for
all Latin American and Caribbean countries, or the 34.2% average for all OECD
countries. The plurality of tax revenue in the Dominican Republic comes from
value-added taxes (35.3%). The next largest categories are excise taxes (22.7%),
corporate income taxes (16%), individual income taxes (9%), international trade
(7.4%) and property taxes (1.4%).
       Estimated tax evasion in the Dominican Republic was 61.8% in 2017 (4.22%
of GDP) for the corporate income tax and 57.07% for the individual income tax
(1.68% of the GDP). This level of tax evasion is higher than other Latin American
and Caribbean countries.2 To fight high tax evasion, the Dominican Republic's
IRS launched an ambitious plan to increase the number of audited taxpayers in
2018. As part of this plan, which involved the matching of taxpayers reported
information with third-party information, the audit probability increased from
8% in 2017 to 12% in 2018 (Direcci´
                                  on General de Impuestos Internos, 2020).
       While prevalent, tax evasion is seen as a socially undesirable activity in the
Dominican Republic. The 1995-1999 World Values Survey shows that 68.6% of
the respondents in the Dominican Republic answered that tax evasion is "Never
Justifiable," compared to 73% in the United States, 78.3% in Uruguay, 71.7% in
Argentina, 52.9% in Mexico, and 46.5% in Brazil. More recent information on
tax morale is available for Latin American countries from Latinobar´
                                                                   ometro. The
most recent available wave from year 2016 indicates that 43.6% of the respon-
dents in the Dominican Republic find tax evasion unjustifiable, compared to
58.1% in Uruguay, 62.1% in Argentina, 32.0% in Mexico, and 49.2% in Brazil (Lati-
   2
   Tax evasion for the corporate income tax was 39.6% in Uruguay, 49.7% in Argentina, 31.4% in
                                                ´
Mexico, and 26.6% in Brazil (Gobierno de la Republica Dominicana: Equipo Interinstitucional,
2018).

      In 2018, The Dominican Republic followed regional efforts to combat money
laundering and terrorism financing, enacting a law that severely increased the
punishment for tax evasion. Law 155-17 against Money Laundering and Ter-
rorist Financing was approved by the parliament in June 2017, regulated by the
presidency in November 2017, and further regulated by the Dominican Republic
IRS during 2018. It included tax evasion and other tax-related infractions within
a list of offenses penalized with severe criminal punishment including prison
and stiff monetary fines.3
      As this law substantially changes the historically low tax enforcement, the
IRS commissioner and high-profile political figures have extensively and fiercely
discussed its merits in the media. The media has also discussed cases of taxpay-
ers who have been jailed due to tax evasion and fraud. Recently, for example,
21 taxpayers were sentenced to prison or have spent time in preventive deten-
tion awaiting trial, 3 have been placed under house arrest, 7 were ordered to use
electronic monitoring devices, and 12 have faced travel restrictions. This list in-
cludes business owners, managers, and accountants.
      In this paper, we focus on corporate and individual income taxes. In the Do-
minican Republic, employers are responsible for filing the individual income tax
for employees, so we only use individual income taxes paid by self-employed
individuals. This portion represents 22.2% of the total amount collected by the
individual income tax. Table 1 shows that the corporate income tax has a flat
rate of 27% and the tax rate on self-employed individuals increases with taxable
income reaching 27% for the top income bracket. Taxable income is computed
from subtracting expenses and exempted amounts from gross income. In addi-
tion to the low-income tax exemption, there are some special regimes providing

   Because this law was discussed in the media before the tax deadline in 2018; the law might
have affected tax compliance in both 2018 and 2019.

tax exemptions (e.g., individual educational expenses, firms located in free trade
zones, social welfare organizations, charities, and sports). Married couples must
file the individual income tax separately.



2.2      Subject Pool

We conducted our field experiment in collaboration with the IRS of the Domini-
can Republic (IRSDR). In the months before the experiment, there were 43,973
self-employed workers and 168,497 firms in the agency's database.45 From this
set, the IRSDR sent messages to 28,180 self-employed workers who collectively
paid 100 million USD in taxes in FY2018, along with 56,130 firms who collec-
tively paid nearly 700 million USD in FY2018. We randomly split both the self-
employed and the firms into six different groups to receive different treatment
messages (see Table 3).6
       The subjects in our experiment tend to be larger than those excluded from
the experiment. On average, self-employed workers included in the sample pay
54% more in taxes than those that were not in the experiment while included
firms pay 154% more than excluded firms (see Tables 13 Column (6) and 14 Col-

   4
     The database only includes self-employed workers who filed taxes in FY2018. All other self-
employed workers are excluded from the experiment and analysis.
   5
     Not included in our data are the revenues from some micro-sized firms and
self-employed workers who opt to use a simplified tax regime based on an es-
timated minimum tax instead of based on a percentage of the actual income
(https://dgii.gov.do/contribuyentesRegistrados/regimenesEspeciales/RST/Paginas/default.aspx),
the revenues from one large firm in a mining sector that uses a special tax form to file taxes
(form DPUN-01), and the revenues from income taxes collected on capital gains. There are also
some differences between the yearly amounts of tax declared and collected, since the IRSDR
collects tax debts from previous years.
   6
     Our original intent was to send messages to all 43,973 self-employed workers and 168,497
firms in the IRSDR's sample. However, due to technical issues, the IRSDR sent messages to only
the 28,180 self-employed workers and 56,130 firms who we refer to as our experimental sample.
Nevertheless, balance was maintained, as treatments in our experimental sample are balanced
on observable characteristics (see Tables (9), (10), (11), (12).

                                              8
umn (5)). This does not affect our ability to measure a treatment effect, but if
there is heterogeneity present this will impact how our program will scale, or
likewise generalize to the non-included group.


2.3   Experimental Design

Each subject's experience follows six steps. First, in FY2018, self-employed in-
dividuals and firms decide whether to supply goods and services to the market-
place. Second, at the end of FY2018, the DRIRS sends a message to the subjects
with a randomized text. Third, each subject decides whether and when to file
their tax return. Fourth, subjects decide how much of their income to report and
hence the amount of taxes to pay. Fifth, subjects face the risk of a tax audit by
the tax authority. Finally, audited subjects experience the consequences of their
decisions while unaudited subjects do not.
   As messages were sent shortly before the tax deadline, subjects did not have
time to adjust their production decisions before the tax date. Therefore, any
changes in the gross-income or losses reported to the DRIRS represent changes
in the firms evasion or avoidance decision. In Step 2, the DRIRS sends one of six
potential messages to the subject's e-mail address and their "virtual office" that
almost all taxpayers use to file taxes. These messages were sent three days before
the tax deadline for self-employed workers. Firms received the messages twice,
thirty and fifteen days before their tax deadline.
   Table 2 summarizes the natural field experimental design. Our control mes-
sage is a simple reminder about the tax deadline. Thus, our treatment effects
are measured relative to a counterfactual in which the DRIRS reminds subjects
about the tax date. The reminder message allows us to control for the poten-
tial effect of receiving a letter from the tax authority, which past work has shown
in and of itself increases tax compliance (Del Carpio, 2013; Perez-Truglia and

                                         9
Troiano, 2018; Kettle et al., 2016; Mascagni et al., 2017). Accordingly, our mea-
sured treatment effects likely understate the effect of the treatment messages
relative to an environment in which the tax authority does not contact subjects
before the tax deadline.
   The experimental variation induced by our five treatments was the inclusion
of short phrases after the reminder message. We constructed the phrases to per-
suade the recipient to correctly report and pay their tax burden by highlighting
either the potential for incarceration or public disclosure of punishments. We
also interacted both the control message and deterrence messages with an ad-
ditional paragraph that informed subjects that the tax authority may interpret
misreporting as an active choice.
   The public disclosure message reminded subjects about the new law and in-
formed them that any punishments levied for tax evasion will be public record
available to the population of the Dominican Republic. This message was con-
structed to vary the subject's perceived probability of their malfeasance and iden-
tify concerns for social punishments. This type of punishment may reduce so-
cial image utility (B´
                     enabou and Tirole, 2006; Bursztyn and Jensen, 2017; Butera
et al., 2019) or raise concerns about losing customers or employees who prefer
to work for civically-minded firms (Hanlon and Slemrod, 2009; Du and Vieira,
2012; McDonnell and King, 2013; Servaes and Tamayo, 2013; List and Momeni,
2017; Hedblom et al., 2019). However, since there is no threat of a formal or cen-
tralized list meant to shame tax evaders, this message constitutes a weaker form
of shaming than countries commonly practice (Hasegawa et al., 2012; Bø et al.,
2015; Hoopes et al., 2018; Dwenger and Treber, 2018) or what has been done with
experiments targeting individuals (Perez-Truglia and Troiano, 2018).
   The second strategy attempted to use the potential deterrence effects of newly
implemented prison sentences for tax evasion. To operationalize these treat-


                                        10
ments, we included a phrase reminding subject's of the newly passed law and
that prison sentences are now a potential punishment for tax evasion. This mes-
sage stands in stark contrast with previous papers on tax compliance which in-
vestigate the deterrence effects of financial penalties.7 Imprisonment, especially
of firm owners, is a rare punishment. Given the scarcity of research on the de-
terrence effects of prison sentences, it is unclear whether this type of deterrence
should be viewed as stronger or weaker than traditional deterrence nudges.8
       We interacted these main messages with a statement that informed subjects
that inaccurate information in the tax return may be viewed as an active choice
rather than an oversight. These messages are meant to change the behavior of
subjects who are evading taxes using an "omission strategy" by increasing the
expected punishment for evasion, essentially moving the act of omission to one
of commission (Spranca et al., 1991; DeScioli et al., 2011; Hallsworth et al., 2015).
       After receiving the messages, subjects proceed to Step 3. Given that we have
observed the universe of self-employed workers and firms who choose to file
taxes, we have no attrition at this stage of the experiment. However, we can only
observe the declarations of firms who file taxes. Therefore, treatment compar-
isons of gross and net income can only be made for subjects who choose to file
their return. On the other hand, we consider firms who chose not to file taxes in
FY2019 as paying no taxes in that year.
       In Step 4, subjects must determine their tax bill. Table 1 displays the tax
brackets for the subjects in our natural field experiment. Firms face a flat tax of
27% of their taxable income. Self-employed workers, on the other hand, face a

     Lee and McCrary (2017) note that, unlike fines, prison sentences tend to be dispersed across
time. This reduces the deterrence effect of prison sentences relative to fines if individuals heavily
discount the future or are hyperbolic discounters. However, since firm decisions are made in
groups, rather than individually, they may discount future prison sentences less than individuals
would (Charness and Sutter, 2012; Denant-Boemont et al., 2017).

progressive marginal tax system. Workers earning less than $8,324.40 in taxable
income are exempt from paying income taxes. Those earning between $8,324.40
and $12,468.58 pay 15% of their taxable income. Every dollar earned between
$12,468.58 and $17,342.46 is taxed at 20% and every dollar earned above $17,342.46
is taxed at 25%. Both self-employed workers and firms are exempt from paying
any taxes if their taxable income is less than or equal to zero.
   After making their filing decision, subjects proceed to Step 5, where they face
the risk of an audit by the tax authority. Generally, the DRIRS uses two different
types of audits. The first is automatic audits that occur when tax entities submit
suspicious tax returns. The second type of audit is a full audit where the DRIRS
probabilistically chooses some firms to investigate thoroughly. The FY2018 fre-
quency of both types of audits appears in Table 4. Historically, there have been
low audit rates for both types of subjects. However, this has increased substan-
tially in the past few years.
   Finally, the DRIRS may punish audited subjects based on the audit results.
Since the enactment of Law 155-17, more than twenty individuals have been
sentenced to prison or spent time in pre-trial detention. About two dozen oth-
ers have been placed under house arrest, ordered to use electronic monitoring
devices or faced travel restrictions. This list includes business owners, managers,
and accountants. Because the law substantially affected the historical context of
low enforcement tax compliance, it has been discussed in the media. The media
has also discussed cases of taxpayers who have been sentenced to prison due to
tax evasion.

3.       Results

We employ a difference-in-differences model as our main specification. In par-
ticular, we estimate models of the following form:


  Yi,t =  +          g 1[G = g ]i + t 1[F Y 2019]t +          g 1[G = g, F Y 2019]i,t +    i,t .   (1)
               g G                                      g G


       Here, each subject i either receives a reminder message or one treatment
message g  G = {commission, public, public + commission, prison, prison
+ commission}. There are two time periods, T = {F Y 2018, F Y 2019}. Out-
comes observed in FY2018 are measured pre-treatment and outcomes observed
in FY2019 are measured post-treatment. The indicator 1[F Y 2019]t is equal to
one when the outcomes are after receipt of the treatment messages and the sum
  g G    g 1[G = g ]i is a set of indicators representing treatment status. Thus, the
interaction of each treatment group with the post variable allows us to estimate
the causal parameters, g , the intent-to-treat effect of receiving a letter with con-
tent g relative to the counterfactual of receiving a reminder letter.9
       The primary outcome of interest is the amount of taxes paid in FY2019. We
also consider several intermediate outcomes to learn more about behavioral
changes leading to changes in tax evasion. These intermediate outcomes in-
clude: whether the subject chose to file, the amounts of gross revenue and net
revenue reported conditional on filing, whether the subject chose to declare an
exempt-level of income, and whether the subject received an automatic audit
   9
     The identifying assumption needed to interpret g as causal effects is that the time trend in
outcome Yit for each treatment group would have been the same as the control group had the
DRIRS sent the reminder message to those subjects. This condition is satisfied by randomization
of the treatments. Estimates of g represent pre-treatment differences in Yi,t between group g
and the control. These estimates provide evidence on the validity of the identifying assumption.
If these values are not statistically different from zero, then the treatments are well-balanced and
we can conclude that the randomization was successful.

for their reporting behavior. We cluster standard errors at the individual level, as
this was the level at which we assigned treatments.


3.1   Effect of Treatment Messages on Tax Revenue

Table 5 presents empirical results of this specification using taxes paid as the
outcome variable. Column (1) displays estimates for the pooled self-employed
and firm sample, Column (2) displays the estimates for self-employed workers
only, and Column (3) displays the estimated treatment effects for the firm sub-
sample. The negative coefficients on the 2019 indicator in both regressions show
that, despite the stricter rules against tax evasion, the control group reduced the
amount of taxes paid relative to the previous year. This, of course, can be for a
variety of reasons that are beyond the scope of this study.
   More importantly, overall, both deterrence treatments increase the tax com-
pliance of the subjects. The results in Column (1) show that the public disclosure
message increases the amount of taxes paid by $1,616 on average relative to the
same change in the control group. The effect for prison messages is about dou-
ble the public disclosure effect. Both the public disclosure and prison time de-
terrence messages increase the taxes self-employed workers pay by about $450,
or 13% of the baseline mean. However, the effect of the public disclosure mes-
sage is imprecisely estimated for self-employed workers. Firms are much more
responsive to deterrence messages. Relative to the baseline mean, the public
disclosure message increases taxes paid by firms by 19% ($2,190) and the prison
time message increasing taxes paid by 45% ($5,330).
   In aggregate, the control group paid $13.37 million less in taxes in FY2019
than they did in FY2018. Relative to this change, the public disclosure treat-
ment increased taxes paid by $22.81 million and the prison message increased
tax compliance by $52.17 million (See Figure 1). This result highlights the im-

                                        14
portance of having a control group in FY2019, rather than treating all subjects in
FY2019 and using FY2018 as the control (as many tax regulators may desire once
they are convinced that the treatment will work).
   Potentially at odds with Hallsworth et al. (2015), we find that framing the sub-
ject's decision as an active choice did not affect the tax compliance of either self-
employed workers or firms. Intuitively, this discrepancy may result from differ-
ences in the perceived probability of detection or the uncertainty of taxes owed.
In Hallsworth et al. (2015), for example, the tax agency knew the debt owed by
each of the subjects. In contrast, the tax burden is not known in either De Neve et
al. (2019) or by the DRIRS in our study. Therefore, subjects may not feel unduly
threatened by this message.
   Adding the commission message to the public disclosure weakly decreases
the effectiveness of the deterrent for both self-employed workers and firms. This
is likely the result of counter-veiling forces induced by the treatment. On the one
hand, the commission frame increases the perceived harshness of punishments
conditional on their realization. Alternatively, punishing those who make errors
dilutes the signal peers receive about the subject's type, conditional on punish-
ment. These counter-veiling forces could be working against each other in a way
that ends up canceling out their effect.
   After accounting for the $13 million reduction in taxes from FY2018 to FY2019,
adding the commission frame alone decreased total taxes paid by $4.4 million.
The effect of adding the commission frame message to the public disclosure
message had a similar effect, reducing the effectiveness of the public disclo-
sure message by $3.94 million. In contrast, the prison + commission message
increased taxes paid by $103.36 million, $51.19 more than the prison message
without the commission frame. In total, the experiment increased tax com-
pliance by $192.79 million, 0.23% of the Dominican Republic's gross domestic


                                           15
product in 2018.
       Next, we estimate the portion of the revenue yield that is new, rather than ac-
celerated. To do this, we use the information on 2019 audits. All of the debt owed
by subject's receiving full audits is likely to be recovered by the DRIRS. Therefore,
the increase in taxes generated from this group represents accelerated, rather
than new revenue. Subjects who receive an automatic audit from the DRIRS
will likely have some of their debt recovered. Subjects who are never audited by
the DRIRS are unlikely to end up making additional payments to the DRIRS.10
Thus, we measure the additional yield generated from treatments as the yield
from subjects who are never audited and the accelerated yield generated from
treatments as the yield from subjects who receive either type of audit.
       Figure 1 shows the total change in revenue for each treatment relative to the
control group. Overall 54% ($104.8 million) of the tax revenue raised by the treat-
ments constitutes new revenue. Up to an additional $43.02 million from firms
receiving an automatic audit is also new revenue. The $44.97 million raised by
firms who will receive a full audit represents revenue the Dominican Republic
would have received absent treatments.11


3.2       Behavioral Channels at Work

In order to better understand how subjects choose to evade taxes, we turn our
attention to the behavioral changes that resulted in higher tax revenue. In princi-
ple, there are several ways in which the treatments could have changed revenue.
Table 1 shows the mapping from taxable income to tax burden for firms and the
  10
      The treatment messages may also change the composition of audited firms. Indeed, we do
find that self-employed workers in the commission, public, and prison with commission treat-
ments are less likely to receive automatic audit than those in the control group.
   11
      The calculation of new and accelerated revenue relies on the assumption that there will be
no future audits that bring in revenue. If new audits occur, the total amount of money raised by
the treatments may fall.

                                              16
self-employed. Higher levels of taxes must come from higher reported levels of
taxable income which could be due via changes in the (i) propensity to file, (ii)
gross income, (iii) amount of deductions, and propensity to be audited by the
DRIRS.
       The intent-to-treat effects for each of these outcomes are presented in Table
6 and Table 7. Columns (1) in these tables show that both firms and the self-
employed are less likely to file taxes in 2019 compared to 2018. However, this is
to be expected as 100% of our self-employed worker sample filed in the previous
year and some firms exit and those who enter the market are not in the database.
None of the treatment messages attenuate this decrease, suggesting that this is
not a primary means through which subjects choose to evade taxes.12
       Column (2) in Table 6 shows that self-employed workers also do not respond
to the treatments by changing their reported gross revenue, but instead report
higher taxable revenue. Interestingly, Column (4) shows that self-employed work-
ers in the prison with commission frame treatment are less likely to receive an
automatic audit. This means that the treatment may create additional cost sav-
ings for the IRSDR through a reduction in enforcement costs. Self-employed
workers in the commission frame and public disclosure treatments are also less
likely to trigger an automatic audit despite not paying additional significantly
higher taxes. This is a bit of a puzzle and could imply that firms in these treat-
ments are finding more creative ways to conceal their evasion. Columns (2) and
(3) in Table 7 show that firms respond to treatment by increasing both gross rev-
enue and net revenue, reporting nearly $200,000 additional gross revenue and
$80,000 net revenue in our most effective treatment.
       While the treatments do not affect the subject's propensity to file taxes they

  12
    Only self-employed workers who chose to file taxes in FY2018 were included in the experi-
ment. This group may be more or less responsive to deterrence messages than those who did
not file previously.

                                             17
do affect the portion of subjects who report a level of income exempt from taxes.
Figure 2 displays the portion of subjects declaring non-exempt levels of income
in 2019. Recall that negative net income is exempt for firms while income below
$8,324.40 is exempt for self-employed individuals. Difference-in-differences es-
timates of Equation 1 using the propensity to declare an exempt level of taxable
income as the outcome measure are presented in Table 8.
     Conditional on filing, over 60% of self-employed workers in the control group
and 70% of firms in the control group declare net income exempt from taxation.
Each treatment message reduces the probability that self-employed workers de-
clare exempt income levels with deterrence messages being more effective than
the commission frame. Commission frames augment the effect of both the pub-
lic disclosure message (p < 0.072) and the prison message (p < 0.007) on the
extensive margin for the self-employed.
     Despite earning higher gross revenue in FY2019, control group firms are 15
percentage points more likely to declare an exempt level of income in FY2019
relative to FY2018 (See column (3) of Table 8). All treatment messages reduce
the probability that firms declare non-positive taxable income. Both types of
deterrence messages reduce the portion of firms declaring exempt levels of in-
come by about 20 percentage points. Again, commission frames augment the
effect of both the public disclosure message (p < 0.001) and the prison message
(p < 0.001) on the extensive margin. The effects are even larger after condition-
ing on firms who declared positive earning in FY2019.




4.     Firm Heterogeneity

A common feature of tax systems is the disproportionate fraction of total rev-
enue paid by the largest firms. For instance, in FY2018, the largest 20 percent of

                                        18
firms in the Dominican Republic paid over 85% of all corporate income taxes.
However, previous experimental research on tax compliance has focused on in-
terventions with small and medium sized firms (see, e.g., Ariel (2012), Pomeranz
(2015) and B´
            ergolo et al. (2017)).
       It is not obvious whether the largest firms will respond to deterrence nudges
in the same way smaller and more well-studied firms have responded. Kleven
et al. (2016) argue that tax evasion is more difficult in large firms with accurate
business records as the threat of whistleblowing increases with the number of
employees. In line with this argument, Kumler et al. (2013) find that tax compli-
ance in Mexico is higher in larger firms. Similarly, Pomeranz (2015) finds that the
measured effects of threatening random audits are decreasing in firm size.
       Alternatively, if there are high fixed costs to tax evasion, larger firms may
evade more, absent treatment, and have greater ability to respond to these in-
terventions. Moreover, Pomeranz (2015) notes that priors about audit probabil-
ities, risk aversion, and other characteristics of the firm may vary with firm size.
Importantly, firms in the Dominican Republic primarily operate in the tertiary
sector of the economy. Kumler et al. (2013) and Pomeranz (2015) note that firms
with a large share of sales going to final consumers will have an easier time evad-
ing taxes. Table (16) shows that while a smaller portion of top firms in our sample
operate in the tertiary industry, the vast majority of our sample sells directly to
customers in every quintile.
       To understand the potential heterogeneous effects of nudge treatments across
the distribution of firm sizes, we separate firms for whom we observe the num-
ber of workers into quintiles.13 Then, we estimate the treatment effects on the
growth in taxes paid within each of these quintiles. The difference-in-difference

  13
    We create quintiles using the full sample of data, before sub-setting the data into the ex-
perimental sample. The discreteness of the data along with the skewed distribution means that
quintiles do not have exactly 20% of the observations.

                                              19
values are presented in Figures 4 and 5. Similar patterns emerge for both types
of deterrence messages. If we would have conducted the experiment only on
small and medium sized firms (those in the bottom 60% of firm size), then the
treatment effects estimated from the experiment would have been economically
small and only marginally significant at best. However, we find that the observed
effects are much larger for the top two quintiles of firm size.
   A key result is that we find that the top 20% of firms have the largest treatment
effect. The average taxes paid by control firms for this quintile fell by $13,643.
During this same period, taxes paid by the public disclosure group increased
by $9,171 when used alone and $3,324 when combined with the commission
treatment. The prison deterrence messages were much more effective also, in-
creasing taxes paid by $42,299 when used alone and $95,846 when combined
with commission. These effects contrast with Pomeranz (2015) and Kumler et
al. (2013) who find that tax compliance is lower in smaller firms. This discrep-
ancy may be due to differences in the paper trail associated with the corporate
income taxes compared to VATs, or the large portion of firms in our study who
sell to final consumers. More work is necessary.
   In a general sense, we view our firm size results as potentially novel in the
sense that we are unaware of large sample findings showing that the biggest play-
ers in a market are affected the deepest by behavioral nudges. While the modal
research insights from behavioral and experimental studies are derived from in-
dividuals and smaller players in a market, in this sense, our results open up a
potential avenue for future research using behavioral interventions on market
players that can impact prices and allocations at the most fundamental level.

5.     Conclusions

Taxation is one of humankinds oldest and most contentious activities. In mod-
ern economies, it continues to play a central role in the development of states
(Besley and Persson, 2014). Over the past decade, there has been a surge of liter-
ature attempting to increase tax compliance and understand the determinants
of evasion. We contribute to this literature by partnering with the Dominican Re-
public and experimentally evaluating how prison sentences and non-pecuniary
motives influence tax compliance (Luttmer and Singhal, 2014). We present the
first evidence from a natural field experiment on whether increasing the salience
of public disclosure of penalties affects tax compliance behavior in firms. More-
over, in contrast to many earlier experiments on tax compliance, we leverage ad-
ministrative data to shed insights into how behavioral nudges affect firms across
the entire size distribution.
     We find that messages highlighting the potential for incarceration for tax eva-
sion are highly effective in increasing tax compliance. Increasing the salience of
potential incarceration increases the amount of taxes paid by 45% for firms and
13% for self-employed workers. Messages that increase the salience of public
disclosure are less effective. These messages do not significantly increase the
amount of taxes self-employed workers pay, but increase the amount of taxes
firms pay by 19%. The channel for the observed effects is primarily driven by
dramatic reductions in the propensity of firm's to declare exempt levels of tax-
able income.
     The effect of commission messaging depends greatly on the perceived pun-
ishment regime. The framing effect greatly augmented the prison time mes-
sage, while weakly backfiring when used with a reminder or when increasing
the salience of public disclosure. Overall, the treatments increased the amount
of income taxes paid by $193 million, with a little over half of this revenue esti-

                                         21
mated as "new," rather than accelerated revenue. That is, the government would
not have raised this revenue without our treatment messages.
   A final insight is that we find that behavioral nudges increase the amount of
taxes paid by the largest firms the most. While this result is consistent in our data
set, we know less about why this result holds. More specifically, are larger firms
responding to reputational concerns from customers, or do larger firms exhibit
greater social image concerns than smaller firms? Are there certain institutional
facts that cause this asymmetry in treatment effects? We trust that future re-
search will replicate our insights and build theoretical frameworks to enhance
our understanding of tax compliance across the firm size dimension.

 Note: Table displays coefficient estimates of Equation (1) using amount of taxes paid as the outcome variable. Treatment indicators represent the average
change in the additional taxes paid in each of the treatment groups relative to the change control group. The coefficient on the 2019 indicator represents the
annual change in average taxes paid for the control group. The five pre-treatment indicators represent differences between the amount of taxes paid by each of
the treatment groups and the control group before the experiment. Subjects who did not file taxes are assigned a value of 0 for the outcome. Standard errors are
clustered on the individual level. Baseline Balance row displays the p-value from an F-test evaluating whether all pre-treatment indicators are simultaneously
equal to zero.  p < 0.10, p < 0.05, p < 0.01.

 Note: Table displays coefficient estimates of Equation (1) using various outcomes. Treatment indicators represent the average change in the outcome in
each of the treatment groups relative to the change control group. The coefficient on the 2019 indicator represents the annual change in the outcome for
the control group. The five pre-treatment indicators represent differences between each outcome by each of the treatment groups and the control group
before the experiment. Subjects who did not file taxes are assigned a value of 0 for the outcome. Columns (2) and (3) are reported conditional on filing
taxes. Standard errors are clustered on the individual level. Baseline Balance row displays the p-value from an F-test evaluating whether all pre-treatment
indicators are simultaneously equal to zero. Pre-treatment values in column (1) are all equal to zero because 100% of the sample filed taxes in FY2018.

 Note:Table displays coefficient estimates of Equation (1) using various outcomes. Treatment indicators represent the average change in the outcome in each
of the treatment groups relative to the change control group. The coefficient on the 2019 indicator represents the annual change in the outcome for the control
group. The five pre-treatment indicators represent differences between each outcome by each of the treatment groups and the control group before the experi-
ment. Subjects who did not file taxes are assigned a value of 0 for the outcome. Columns (2) and (3) are reported conditional on filing taxes. Standard errors are
clustered on the individual level. Baseline Balance row displays the p-value from an F-test evaluating whether all pre-treatment indicators are simultaneously
equal to zero.  p < 0.10, p < 0.05, p < 0.01.

 Note:Table displays coefficient estimates of Equation (1) using propensity to declare an exempt level of taxable income as the outcome variable. Treatment
indicators represent the average change in the propensity to declare an exempt level of taxable income in each of the treatment groups relative to the change
control group. The coefficient on the 2019 indicator represents the annual change in the outcome for the control group. The five pre-treatment indicators
represent differences between each outcome by each of the treatment groups and the control group before the experiment. Only subjects who filed taxes are
included. Standard errors are clustered on the individual level. Baseline Balance row displays the p-value from an F-test evaluating whether all pre-treatment

 Note: Figure displays the difference between the total tax revenue growth in each treatment less the tax revenue growth in the control group, pooling self-
employed workers and firms. Values are calculated separately for each of the three subgroups. These groups are (i) subjects who are never audited, (ii) subjects
who received an automatic desk audit, and (iii) subjects who received a full audit. Revenue in the control group fell by $13.37 million to $114.43 million in 2019.
Additional $192.79 million raised by treatments.
