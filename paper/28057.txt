Asymmetric Demand Response when Prices Increase and Decrease: The Case of Child Healthcare

                                          ABSTRACT

This study tests whether demand responds symmetrically to price increases and decreases--a
seemingly obvious proposition under conventional demand theory that has not been rigorously
tested. Exploiting rapid expansion in municipal subsidies for child healthcare in a difference-in-
differences framework, we find evidence against it: when coinsurance, our price measure,
increases from 0% to 30%, the demand response is more than twice that to a price decrease from
30% to 0%, a result consistent with loss aversion. This result indicates that, while economists and
policymakers pay little attention, the price change direction matters, and that welfare analysis
should incorporate this direction.

1. Introduction
      Under conventional demand theory, a movement along the demand curve between two prices
will have the same impact on the quantity demanded regardless of the direction of the movement.
That is, the absolute value of the change in demand should be the same whether the price increases
from P1 to P2 or decreases from P2 to P1. The aim of this study is to examine this seemingly
obvious proposition, which, in our view, has not been rigorously tested.
      We believe this is an important question to study. Such asymmetry--if it exists--provides a
cautionary note against applying price sensitivity estimates derived from a price change in one
direction (e.g., a price increase/decrease) to a price change in the opposite direction (e.g., a price
decrease/increase), as a welfare calculation can be substantially biased if such asymmetric responses
exist. However, economists and policymakers rarely pay attention to the direction of a price change
when they report estimates or use estimates from existing studies. This omission may be due to a
lack of data and evidence, as it is quite rare to observe exogenous price changes in opposite
directions in a single market. Thus, few studies credibly show that demand responses differ
depending on the direction of a price change.
      We test asymmetric demand responses in the context of demand for child healthcare using
individual-level claims data from Japan. In the last decade, municipalities in Japan have rapidly
expanded subsidies for child healthcare, which typically reduce patient cost-sharing from 30%
coinsurance to 0% (free care). Because many municipalities introduced such subsidies for different
age groups at different times, we observe the same price change in opposite directions (either from
0% to 30% or from 30% to 0%) even for children of the same age. These price variations allow us to
examine whether children (and consequently, their parents) react to price increases in much the same
way as they do to price decreases.
      As noted before, traditional demand theory proposes that a movement along the demand curve
between two prices will have the same impact on the quantity demanded regardless of the price
change's direction. However, insights from behavioral economics raise the possibility that this might
not be the case. In particular, if individuals are loss averse (Tversky and Kahneman, 1991) and feel
more loss from a price increase than gain from a price decrease, the change in healthcare spending
can be larger in response to a price increase (from 0% to 30%) than to a price decrease (from 30% to
0%). Thus, whether the demand responses are symmetric in price direction is ultimately an empirical
question.
     Exploiting the unique price changes owing to municipal subsidies in a difference-in-differences
framework, we find strong evidence against conventional demand theory. When the price is reduced
from 30% to 0%, outpatient spending per month increases by USD 8.9. In contrast, when the price is

                                                     2
increased from 0% to 30%, outpatient spending per month decreases by as much as USD 20.0. The
difference between these two estimates is statistically significant at the 1% level. The loss aversion
parameter, which is the ratio of the two estimates, is 2.26 and is statistically different from one at the
5% level. These results imply that conventional demand theory is rejected in favor of prospect
theory. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that rigorously tests symmetric demand responses
when prices increase and decrease.
     This result has substantial policy implications for optimal design of health insurance and policy
evaluation in general. If policymakers determine policy based on a parameter estimated using a price
change in the opposite direction, they may overestimate or underestimate the demand response by
more than a factor of two.
     To further understand what drives the asymmetric demand response, we divide demand based
on the type of service received: medication, consultation fees, laboratory tests, and nonsurgical
procedures. We find that most of the asymmetric demand response is driven by medication:
outpatient spending per month increases by only USD 5.7 for price decreases, while it decreases as
much as USD 10.2 for price increases.
     Finally, as a separate note, we observe substantial intertemporal substitution before and after the
price change. This pattern reveals that some children (and hence, parents) anticipate the upcoming
price change and behave strategically by delaying or rushing visits; this intertemporal substitution is
concentrated within one month around the price change. We observe larger intertemporal substitution
when the price increases (rushing) than when the price decreases (delaying), which is also consistent
with short-term loss aversion.
      Ours is not the first study to examine asymmetric demand responses. In particular, using
scanner or sales data, studies in the marketing literature examine how price increases and decreases
from a reference price impact the quantity demanded (e.g., Kalwani et al., 1990; Krishnamurthi et
al., 1992; Putler, 1992; Kalyanaram and Winer, 1995; Bell and Lattin, 2000; Han et al., 2001;
Mazumdar et al., 2005). In general, these studies find that consumers are more sensitive to price
increases (losses) than price decreases (gains). However, our study has several advantages. First,
because patients face only two prices (either 0% or 30%) that stay the same without a policy change,
the reference price in our case is clearly defined; past studies arbitrarily use a past price as the
reference price (e.g., Hardie et al., 1993). Second, the magnitude of the price change in our study is
exactly the same in both directions (= 30%), which is particularly helpful for directly testing
conventional demand theory's prediction. Third, we can distinguish the short- and long-term demand
responses. In contrast, past studies were able to examine only short-term demand fluctuations
because prices in a retail context frequently go up and down. Fourth, to our knowledge, ours is the

                                                     3
first study to examine asymmetric demand responses in terms of healthcare. In this regard, this study
broadly contributes to the literature on behavioral health economics (see Chandra et al., 2019 and
Rice, 2013 for reviews).
      Finally, this study also contributes to the small but growing body of literature that examines
intertemporal substitution in healthcare (Einav et al., 2015; Cabral, 2017; Lin and Sack, 2019). Since
these studies exploit the non-linear structure of health insurance (either the deductible or coverage
maximum), they can only examine intertemporal substitution for price changes in one direction. 1 In
contrast, we can examine intertemporal substitution for price changes in both directions.


2. Theoretical Underpinnings
      This section discusses theoretical considerations that explain (a)symmetric demand responses
when prices change by the same amount but in opposite directions.
      Classical demand theory: As noted in the Introduction, classical demand theory implies that a
price change of the same size will have the same impact on demand (with opposite signs) regardless
of the direction of the price change. Figure 1 illustrates the textbook case of a consumer's decision,
where the consumer chooses the amounts of two goods, healthcare service  and a composite good
 , given the prices of the two goods ( and  ) under a budget constraint. The initial prices and
                                          0   0
quantities of the two goods are given by (  ,   ) and (0 , 0
                                                             ), respectively. If the price of
                                  0    1                                   0    1
healthcare service increases from   to   , its quantity will decrease from   to   based on the
income and substitution effects. Now, suppose that the change in the price of healthcare service is
              1    0
reversed from   to   . Then, based on classical demand theory, the quantity of healthcare service
                                      0        1
will return to the original quantity,   , from   . That is, the absolute value of the impact of the price
change on demand should be the same regardless of the direction of the price change.
      Prospect theory: A notable alternative to classical demand theory is prospect theory
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), which incorporates psychological factors into decision-making.
Unlike classical demand theory, prospect theory suggests that the magnitude of the demand response
may not be symmetric. The basic assumption of prospect theory is that perceived utility or value
depends on a "reference state," and the utility loss from being in a worse state is greater than the
utility gain from being in a better state, even when the magnitude of the deviation from the reference
state is the same in both directions. This phenomenon is known as loss aversion. In our context, this
implies that the utility loss from a price increase is greater than the utility gain from a price decrease


1For example, Lin and Sack (2019) document that people who reach their deductible, leading to low cost-sharing,
spend more in the last month of the coverage year as they anticipate the price will increase the next month when the
deductible is reset.
                                                         4
even when the size of the price change is the same. This, in turn, leads to a prediction that the
                                                                               0    1
magnitude of the quantity change will be greater when the price increases from   to   than when it
               1    0
decreases from   to   .
      Alternative explanation--asymmetry in price information: The information that consumers
have about price changes may also result in asymmetric demand responses. For example, suppose
those with free care visit doctors often and, as a result, learn about price increases (from 0% to 30%),
but those who face 30% cost-sharing do not visit doctors often and are unaware of price decreases
(from 30% to 0%). If this is true, demand may respond more quickly to price increases than price
decreases because of asymmetric information among consumers.
      We believe that this is less likely to be a major factor in our case for two reasons. First,
children visit doctors very often whether they are fully subsidized or not; in our data, children visit
doctors an average of 9.92 times per year even when they do not receive subsidies. Second, it is
common for municipalities to inform parents in advance by mail if there is a change in subsidy
coverage. Thus, parents in this market are generally well informed about price changes in both
directions.


3. Background
      3.1. The Japanese health insurance system
      We briefly summarize the Japanese health insurance system as it relates to our study (see,
Ikegami and Campbell, 1995; Kondo and Shigeoka, 2013 for details). Residents in Japan are covered
by the national health insurance scheme. Because enrollment in this scheme is mandatory, there is no
issue regarding selection into health insurance in this market. Medical providers are paid by fee-for-
service for outpatient services, and all receive the same fee for the same service based on the national
fee schedule set by the government. Patients pay coinsurance, which is set nationally at 30%, except
for those above age 70 and below age 6. As we discuss in the next section, many municipalities
provide subsidies for child healthcare that cover the patient's out-of-pocket costs, which often reduce
children's cost-sharing to zero. There is a stop-loss after a child spends approximately 800 USD per
month out-of-pocket for those in the regular income category, but less than 0.1 % of the person-
months in our data exceed the stop-loss. This is because costly hospitalization is rare among children
in this age group. Private health insurance that covers patients' out-of-pocket costs is virtually non-
existent in Japan (OECD, 2004). As a result, municipal subsidies affect the price of care faced by
children.




                                                    5
      3.2. Municipal subsidies and price variations
      Over the last decade, municipalities in Japan have drastically expanded subsidies for child
healthcare, which typically reduce children's out-of-pocket costs from 30% to zero. 2 Figure 2 plots
the share of municipalities in our insurance claims data described later by maximum age for
outpatient care subsidy eligibility in the period April 2005­March 2015, illustrating the rapid
expansion. The figure clearly shows that the subsidy expanded rapidly to older individuals in the last
decade. For example, none of the municipalities provided a subsidy up to 15 years of the age in April
2005, the beginning of the sample period. However, this number reached nearly 80% by the end of
our sample period a decade later. 3
      These municipal subsidies provide ideal price variations for testing the implications of the
alternative theories discussed in Section 2. First, since each municipality determines whether and
when to provide a subsidy and the ages it covers, prices faced by children substantially vary by
municipality, time, and the child' age. Second, there are price changes in both directions, as subsidies
expand (prices "decrease" from 30% to 0%) and expire (prices "increase" from 0% to 30%). Among
a total of 2,604 changes in subsidy status in the municipality-age-time cell in our insurance claims
data, 1,858 changes are subsidy expansions (price "decreases"), whereas 746 changes are subsidy
expirations (price "increases"). Third, the magnitude of the price changes is exactly the same in both
directions, which is particularly helpful for directly testing conventional demand theory's prediction,
as discussed in Section 2.


4. Data
      4.1. Description of data
      We use two main data sets in this study.4 The first is information on municipal subsidies. For
each municipality, we hand-collected the subsidy details, including the subsidy amount (e.g., free
care), maximum age for which the subsidy is provided, whether the subsidy is in kind or a refund,
and whether there is an income eligibility requirement, through a variety of sources, including
municipality web pages, local newspapers, and municipal ordinances. The data cover the period from
April 2005 to March 2015 at the monthly level and include all municipalities in Japan's six largest



2
  In this study, we focus on the most common form of child healthcare subsidy, which reduces patient cost-sharing
from 30% to 0%.
3 The small jump in April 2008 is explained by the fact that the central government expanded the eligibility age for

the national-level subsidy from three to six years (the start of primary school). This national-level subsidy
expansion eased the budgetary burden on municipalities, as part of the cost to provide free care for children below
age six was covered by the central government, allowing municipalities to expand coverage to higher ages.
4 These are the same data used in Iizuka and Shigeoka (2018, 2020).

                                                         6
prefectures, resulting in a total of 294 municipalities. 5 In this study, we focus on 165 municipalities
that have either 0% or 30% coinsurance rates. 6
      The second data set includes individual outpatient spending drawn from monthly insurance
claims data provided by JMDC Inc. JMDC Inc. collects and analyzes administrative insurance claims
data on behalf of large insurers. These data have been used in previous studies, including Iizuka
(2012), Fukushima et al. (2016), and Iizuka and Shigeoka (2018, 2020).
      JMDC data consist of administrative enrollment data and claims data. For each person,
enrollment data consist of patient ID, gender, age, and municipality of residence. The age and
municipality of residence in each month are crucial in this study because the level of cost-sharing is
uniquely determined by municipality, age, and time. The claims data report monthly outpatient
spending, including months of no utilization. 7 Specifically, the claims data contain the year-month of
the visit and line-by-line medical services received, including diagnoses (ICD10), types of services,
quantity of each service, and fees charged for each service based on the national fee schedule. The
unit of claims data in Japan is monthly, as medical institutions are reimbursed on a monthly basis. A
unique patient ID links the enrollment and claims data. One drawback--albeit common for insurance
claims data--is that, except gender and age of children, the data do not include individual
characteristics such as parental education, household income, and family structure (e.g., number of
children or siblings).
      Our data cover a period of 10 years between April 2005 and March 2015 (120 months). We
limit our sample to 6­15-year-olds since we have few observations without subsidy below age 6 and
with subsidy above age 15. This is because most municipalities already provided a subsidy up to the
age of 6 years (start of primary school) at the beginning of our sample period, and most
municipalities do not provide a subsidy beyond the age of 15 years (end of junior high school) at the
end of our sample period (see Figure 2).


      4.2. Summary statistics
      Table 1 presents the summary statistics of selected variables in the main sample at the
individual and person-month levels in Panels A and B, respectively. There is a total of 59,775
individuals at the individual level (Panel A). At least one subsidy change is experienced by 16.6% of
them: 15.5% experience at least one subsidy expansion (from 30% to 0%) and 5.2% experience at
least one expiration (from 0% to 30%). Panel B of Table 1 reports some key variables at the unit


5
  There was a total of 47 prefectures and 1,719 municipalities in Japan as of January 2015.
6 Iizuka and Shigeoka (2018, 2020) utilize other types of price variations, including small copayments (e.g.,
2USD/visit and 5USD/visit) and 10% and 15% coinsurance rates.
7 The data do not, however, include dental claims or inpatient food and housing costs, which are relatively small.

                                                         7
level of our analysis (person-month); there is a total of 2,027,910 person-months over the sample
period of 120 months. Children spend 60.8 USD per month, including zero-spending, and 149.9 USD
per month conditional on at least one visit. Out-of-pocket payment per visit without subsidy is 22.3
USD, which gauges the magnitude of the financial burden on individuals if no subsidy is available.


      4.3. Event study
      We first graphically explore the pattern of demand responses using an event study. We
normalize the spending data around the change in the subsidy status separately for price increases
and price decreases. Then, using individuals who experience price increases and those who
experience no price change, we run a simple individual-level fixed effects model that includes
interaction terms between the subsidy status and a series of dummies for each month, ranging from
12 months prior to the price increase to 12 months after the change (T= 12 to +11, where T=0 is the
month of the price increase). 8 We then plot the estimates of the interaction terms in a figure. The
regression model additionally controls for age and time fixed effects (both in months). We follow the
same process for price decreases.
      Figure 3 presents the results of the event study for outpatient spending separately for price
decreases (subsidy expansion) and price increases (subsidy expiration). The reference month is three
months before the change in subsidy status (T= 3). The scales of the y-axis are set as the same so
that the two figures for opposite price change directions are visually comparable.
      We summarize three important facts shown by these figures. First, there are long-lasting
demand responses to price changes in both directions, and the estimates take completely opposite
signs for opposite price change directions. The long-term estimate for price decreases is roughly
USD 10, whereas that for price increases is roughly USD 20. This simple figure already indicates
that the long-term demand response is larger for price increases than price decreases.
      Second, there are short-run demand responses in both price change directions, as indicated by a
surge (in the case of price increases) and a drop (when prices decrease) in outpatient spending just
before T=0. Interestingly, we also observe offsetting spending immediately after T=0. These patterns
reveal that some children (and hence, parents) anticipate upcoming price changes and behave
strategically by delaying or rushing visits. As we include age and time fixed effects (both in months),
this difference is not driven by a particular age or year-month effect, such as expiration of a subsidy
after graduation from junior high school.
      Finally, the short-run demand response immediately before a price change appears


8 We exclude observations if there is another price change within two months of the observation. For example, if
there is another price change at T=10 for an individual, we include data only up to T=7 for the individual.
                                                         8
substantially larger than that immediately after a price change, as if demand overshoots before a
price change. This "overshooting" is especially larger for price increases (graph on the right); the
surge before the price increase at T=0 is much larger than the drop just after the price increase. This
may imply that children purchased healthcare services more during the pre-price change period than
they could intertemporally substitute between the pre and post periods.


5. Empirical Framework
      5.1. Stylized demand responses and hypotheses to be tested
      The event study presented in Section 4.3 indicates that 1) price changes in both directions have
long-lasting effects on demand, 2) there is a short-term demand response immediately before a price
change, and 3) the short-term response is greater before than after the price change. The goal of our
empirical model is to estimate parameters relevant to these observations in a parsimonious way.
Towards this end, Figure 4 presents a stylized model of demand responses that incorporates all these
features. The figure on the left corresponds to price decreases and the one on the right is for price
increases.
      We first focus on long-term responses. The event study indicated that a price reduction from
30% to 0% clearly increases demand after the price change, and the impact is long lasting. In the figure
on the left, we call this effect a "long-term response ()" and parameterize it as   . In a similar vein,
the long-term effect of price increases (') in the figure on the right can be expressed as   .
Conventional demand theory predicts that   and   have the same magnitude because a
movement along the demand curve between two prices will have the same impact on quantity
demanded regardless of the direction of the price change. In contrast, prospect theory indicates that
  is smaller than   . Therefore, our first set of null and alternative hypotheses is as follows.
                   Hypothesis 1 (symmetry in long-term responses): | | = | |
                  Hypothesis 1' (greater response to price increases):   < | |
      If null hypothesis 1 is rejected in favor of hypothesis 1', we conclude that, in favor of prospect
theory, conventional demand theory does not hold, at least in our setting. In this case, the ratio of the
two estimates (  /  ) can be viewed as the loss aversion parameter. This first hypothesis is our
main interest in this study.
      Next, we turn to short-term responses. Once again, we first discuss the figure on the left for
price decreases. The event study indicated that there are short-term demand responses immediately
before the price change at T= -1 and immediately after the price change at T=0. We term the former
                                                
as the "anticipatory effect ()," represented by -1 , and the latter as the "offset effect ( )," with


                                                   9
                                           
the parameter 0 . The anticipation effect, -1 , may arise if people cut back on healthcare in
anticipation of lower future prices. Such a temporary demand reduction may also result in the offset
        
effect, 0 , if individuals can delay their purchase until the price is reduced at T=0. If both
anticipation and offset effects are present, we can see that individuals intertemporally substitute
consumption.
      The short-term demand response for price increases can be characterized in the same way, with
analogous parameters (see the figure on the right in Figure 4). In this case, the anticipation effect,

-1 , may imply that individuals stock up on health care in anticipation of higher future prices. This
                        
effect may be offset by 0 after the price increase if people cut back because they have fewer
unmet needs.
      We test whether anticipatory and offset effects exist in both price directions.

                  Hypothesis 2 (non-existence of anticipatory effect and offset effect):
                              - = , 
                                    
                                     = ,       
                                         - = ,  = .

      Finally, we can examine whether the impact of the anticipatory effect () is completely
canceled by the offset effect (). This is equivalent to examining whether "over-shooting (),"
                                                                                                 
which is the difference between the anticipation effect and the offset effect, that is (|-1 | - |0 |),
is equal to zero. If "over-shooting" exists, it implies that when prices decrease, children spend less
during the pre-price change period than they intertemporally substitute. Similarly, we can define the
                                                     
overshooting for the price increase (') by (|-1 | - |0 |). We are interested in whether such
overshooting exists in both price directions and if there is asymmetry in overshooting.

        Hypothesis 3 (non-existence of overshooting): |                      
                                                       - | - | | = , |- | - | | = 

               Hypothesis 4 (symmetry in overshooting): |                    
                                                         - | - | | = |- | - | |

      We reiterate here that our main interest is the long-term response, that is, hypothesis 1.


      5.2. Empirical model
      We estimate an empirical model that allows us to identify the key parameters discussed in the
previous section, using longitudinal claims data in a difference-in-differences framework. Specifically,
our basic estimation equation is:
                      =-1          =-1 
       =  +    +    + =-  1( = ) + =-  1 =
                               
                             +  +  +  +  +  +  ­[1]

where  is the outpatient spending of child  whose age is  (measured in months) at time  (year-

                                                    10
month) and is living in municipality .  ,  , and  are fixed effects for age, time, and municipality,
respectively. 9 In addition,  represents the individual fixed effects, which captures the child's
unobserved time-invariant characteristics and addresses the compositional changes in the unbalanced
panel data. We also control for two time-varying municipality variables,  , a dummy that equals one
if the subsidy is in kind rather than a refund and zero otherwise, and another dummy variable that
equals one if there is an income restriction on subsidy eligibility and zero otherwise.
      The variable  is the indicator for a price decrease, which equals zero before i experiences
a price reduction and equals one in all periods after a price decrease, even if the subsidy is expired. We
define  similarly. 10 For example, suppose an individual's coinsurance rate is initially 30% at
age 6, goes down to 0% at age 10, and increases to 30% at age 12. Then,  equals zero before
age 10, and one at age 10 and thereafter. The value of  is zero before age 12, and one at age 12
and thereafter. Currie et al. (2015) employ a similar strategy to examine the asymmetric effects of
opening and closing toxic plants on housing values.   and   capture the long-term effect of price
decreases and increases in spending, respectively, as they are illustrated in our stylized model. These
parameters are identified from within individual variations before and after a price change, along with
a control for the time trend to which individuals in other municipalities without a price change
contribute. Note that we estimate one coefficient each for price increases (  ) and price decreases
(  ), instead of estimating age specific values. Although this is a simplification, previous work using
the same data (Iizuka and Shigeoka, 2018) shows that the effect of a price change is quite similar across
children between ages 6 and 15, which supports our modeling approach.
      The indicator variable 1( = ) equals one in the kth month from the price decrease and zero
           
otherwise.  captures the short-run deviation in spending in month k from the long-run average
          
spending.  corresponds to the anticipation effect () and offset effect () in Figure 4.
                                  
1 =  can be defined similarly and  is interpreted accordingly.
      We first experiment with K being equal to one (i.e., allowing the short-run deviation to exist one
month before and after the price change) and then expand K to two months. We find that the
anticipation and offset effects become statistically significant only in the month of the price change (
= 0) and one month before the price change ( = ­1), as seen in Figure 3. Thus, we set K equal to one,
and the resulting estimation equation is written as:



9
  Note that we still include  at the monthly level to account for any age in month-specific effects (e.g., graduation
from junior high school).
10 Note that this method of constructing variables in our data only makes sense when the changes in an individual's

subsidy status are less than or equal to two. Thus, we remove 921 individuals (1.45%) who experience more than
two changes in subsidy status.
                                                         11

          -1 1 = -1 + 0 1 = 0 + 
                                 +  +  +  +  +  ­[2]

      We estimate this equation using ordinary least squares (OLS). 11 Standard errors are clustered at
the municipality level to account for serial correlation in the error terms within municipalities.
     The identifying assumption in our difference-in-differences strategy is that there are no
unobserved municipality-specific changes that are (1) correlated with subsidy changes in the
municipality and (2) correlated with municipality-specific changes in healthcare utilization. For
example, if municipalities in better financial condition are more likely to implement subsidy expansion
whereas income effects simply increase utilization, our estimates may be biased upward.
      To address this concern, we adopt two approaches. First, the event study in Section 4.3 already
shows there are no systematic differences in the pre-trend between the treated and control
municipalities before changes except for the anticipation effect. Second, we add time-by-
municipality fixed effects (with time measured in months) to examine the robustness of our baseline
estimates. This specification is most stringent, as these fixed effects capture the average effect of
municipality-specific policy changes or events in a particular month, if any, such as income transfers,
other subsidies, or business cycles. 12


6. Results
      6.1. Main results
     We report estimation results from equation [2] and the results of hypotheses tests in Table 2. We
first focus on the long-term demand responses (hypothesis 1). Spending increases () by USD 8.89
when prices decrease, whereas spending decreases (') by as much as USD 20.0 when prices
increase, more than double the change for a price decrease. These results indicate that children react
much more strongly to price increases than price decreases. Note that although a price increase from
0% to 30% starts from a "zero price," this does not explain the differential demand responses,
because a price decrease also includes a zero price when the price decreases from 30% to 0%. The
difference between the two estimates is USD 11.1 and is highly statistically significant at the 1%
level. These results are consistent with loss aversion but not with conventional demand theory. The
loss aversion parameter, which is the ratio of the two estimates, is 2.26. Previous studies using lab



11
   In our previous work (Iizuka and Shigeoka, 2018, 2020), we used OLS and alternative functional forms,
including one- and two-part generalized linear models, and find the estimates are almost identical.
12 Additionally, one may be concerned that sicker children may move to a municipality that offers free care. To

alleviate this concern, we estimated a conditional logit model that examines whether children migrate to a
municipality that provides free care and found little evidence to support this (see Iizuka and Shigeoka, 2018).
                                                        12
experiments typically estimate the loss aversion parameter as just over 2 (e.g., Tversky and
Kahneman, 1991), which is similar to our results. The null hypothesis that the loss aversion
parameter is equal to one (i.e., there is no loss aversion) is rejected at the 5% level (p = 0.0197). 13
     This result has substantial policy implications. If policymakers determine policy based on a
parameter estimated by a price change in the opposite direction, they may overestimate or
underestimate the demand response by more than a factor of two. Although previous studies pay
little attention to a price change's direction, the direction of a price change does matter.
     We next examine the short-term demand responses. First, there is substantial intertemporal
substitution in both price directions, as we find both the anticipation and offset effects are
statistically significant (hypothesis 2). Interestingly, the magnitude of the anticipation effect is larger
than that of the offset effect regardless of the price direction (hypothesis 3). These results may
indicate that individuals overreact to anticipated price changes and purchase more/less (when prices
increase/decrease) than they intertemporally substitute. 14 As a result, there is significant overshooting
in both price change directions. 15 We also find that asymmetry exists in overshooting (hypothesis 4):
overshooting for a price increase (USD 21.25) is much larger than that for a price decrease (USD
9.41), and the difference is statistically significant at the 1% level.
     Overall, we find that children respond differentially to price increases and decreases. In general,
they respond more strongly to price increases than price decreases, which is consistent with loss
aversion. In particular, we find large price asymmetry in long-term demand responses. We also find
asymmetry in overshooting in the short run. Appendix Table A1 reports the results from a
specification that adds time-by-municipality fixed effects to equation (2) and finds qualitatively
similar results.


      6.2. Heterogeneity
     To further understand what drives the asymmetric demand responses, we examine heterogeneity
by service type. We divide spending into six service types: medication (54.1%) 16, consultation fees
(23.6%), laboratory tests (17.4%), non-surgical procedures (5.8%), surgical procedures (3.2%), and
all else (1.2%). 17 Table 3 reports the results for the four largest categories, which equal 95.6% of


13
   The standard errors are calculated using the delta method.
14
   As reported in Table 2, for a price decrease, the anticipation effect is USD 15.19 whereas the offset effect is only
USD 5.78. This pattern is stronger for price increases; the anticipation effect is USD 28.22, whereas the offset
effect is only USD 6.97.
15 Lin and Sack (2019) also find that both anticipation and offset effects exist, and the former exceeds the latter.
16 We exclude outliers from the sample (i.e., growth hormone injections) as they are extremely expensive (on

average USD 3,334) relative to other medications and substantially increase the variance.
17 Medication includes fees for prescribing and dispensing medications, including pharmacy fees, and accounts for

more than half of total spending.
                                                          13
total spending. The corresponding figures are presented in Figure 5.
     Panel A of Table 3 presents the long-term demand response by service type. It shows that
medication contributes most to the long-term asymmetry observed at the aggregate level: whereas
outpatient spending increases by only USD 5.67 for price decreases, it decreases as much as USD
10.2 for price increases. The difference is statistically significant at the 1% level. We note that
although we find a negative sign for consultation, the magnitude is relatively small.
     Panel B of Table 3 presents the short-term demand response by service type. First, we find
anticipation effects in both directions (rows 1 and 3) for all service types. In particular, we find large
anticipation effects for price increases (row 3) in medication (USD 12.56)--implying the stockpiling
of storable goods--and in laboratory testing (USD 7.82). By contrast, the magnitude of the offset
effect (rows 2 and 4) is relatively small in all service types and in both price change directions. While
we observe little overshooting for price decreases (row 5), we find substantial overshooting for price
increases (row 6) for medication (USD 10.67) and laboratory testing (USD 6.25). As a result,
asymmetry in overshooting is observed only for medication and laboratory testing (row 7).
     The large overshooting in medication may indicate that future price increases induce consumers
to purchase additional medications (such as additional days of prescriptions or different types of
medications) that may not necessarily be intertemporally substituted. 18 Our results regarding
medications are consistent with Chandra et al. (2010), who document that the elderly stockpile
prescription drugs just before a small increase in copayment. We further contribute to the literature
by showing that overshooting exists and is especially larger for price increases than price decreases.


7. Conclusion
      This study tests whether the demand response differs when prices increase and decrease in the
context of child healthcare. Economists and policymakers pay little attention to the direction of a
price change when they report and utilize estimates. This omission is not surprising because it is
quite rare to observe exogenous price changes in opposite directions in the same market. Exploiting
the rapid expansion in subsidy for child healthcare in Japan, where we observe the same price
changes in opposite directions, we find evidence against the conventional demand theory: when price
increases from 0% to 30%, demand decreases more than twice as much as it increases when price
decreases from 30% to 0%, a result consistent with loss aversion. This result suggests the direction of
a price change does matter, and welfare analysis should incorporate price change direction. Testing
whether similar asymmetric demand responses exist in other goods is one interesting avenue for


18We abstract from whether this effect is induced by the patient or physician. See, for example, Iizuka (2007, 2012)
for studies that attempt to disentangle these two effects.

Notes: The figure illustrates the textbook case of a consumer's decision, where the consumer chooses the amounts of two goods,
healthcare service  and a composite good  , given the prices of the two goods ( and  ) under a budget constraint. The initial

from  to  , its quantity will decrease from  to  based on the income and substitution effects. Now, suppose that the change
                                                       1       0
in the price of healthcare service is reversed from      to      . Then, based on classical demand theory, the quantity of healthcare

service will return to the original quantity,    , from     . That is, the absolute value of the impact of the price change on demand
should be the same regardless of the direction of the price change. By contrast, under loss aversion, utility loss from a price increase
is greater than the utility gain from a price decrease even when the size of the price change is the same. This, in turn, leads to a
                                                                                                               0     1

Notes: The outcome is the monthly spending on outpatient care measured in USD (100JPY/USD). "Price decrease" indicates the
subsidy expansion which lowers the price of healthcare from 30% to 0%, and "Price increase" indicates subsidy expiration that raises
the price from 0% to 30%. The solid lines plot the estimates from a variant of estimation equation [2] where the subsidized dummy is
replaced by the interaction of belonging to the treatment group (i.e., experiencing the change in subsidy status) and a series of
dummies for each month, ranging from 12 months prior to the change in subsidy status to 12 months after the change (T= ­12 to
+11, where T=0 is the change in subsidy status). The dotted lines are the 95th confidence intervals where standard errors clustered at
municipality level are used to construct them. The reference month is three months before the change (T= ­3). The scales of the y-
axis are set as the same so that the two figures for opposite price change directions are visually comparable.

Notes: The figures present a stylized model of demand responses. The figure on the left corresponds to price decreases (from 30% to 0%) and the one on the right is for
price increases (from 0% to 30%). "Long-term response ( and ')" reflects the long-term demand changes as the price changes, which are parameterized as   on
the left, and   on the right. "Anticipatory effect ( and ')" reflects the short-term demand change immediately before the price change at T= -1, which are

which are parameterized as 0 on the left, and 0         on the right. Finally, "over-shooting ( and ')" is the difference between the anticipation effect and the offset

Notes: The outcome is the monthly spending on outpatient care measured in USD (100JPY/USD). "Price decrease" indicates the
subsidy expansion which lowers the price of healthcare from 30% to 0%, and "Price increase" indicates subsidy expiration that raises
the price from 0% to 30%. The solid lines plot the estimates from a variant of estimation equation [2] where the subsidized dummy is
replaced by the interaction of belonging to the treatment group (i.e., experiencing the change in subsidy status) and a series of
dummies for each month, ranging from 12 months prior to the change in subsidy status to 12 months after the change (T= ­12 to
+11, where T=0 is the change in subsidy status). The dotted lines are the 95th confidence intervals where standard errors clustered at
municipality level are used to construct them. The reference month is three months before the change (T= ­3). The scales of the y-
axis are set as the same so that the two figures for opposite price change directions are visually comparable.

Notes: The estimates from equation [2] which also includes time-by-municipality FE are reported. The outcome is the monthly
spending on outpatient care measured in USD (100JPY/USD). "Price decrease (dec)" indicates the subsidy expansion which lowers
the price of healthcare from 30% to 0%, and "Price increase (inc)" indicates subsidy expiration that raises the price from 0% to 30%.
All the regressions include age (in months) FE, time (in month) FE, and individual FE. We also control for an in-kind dummy that
takes one if the municipality offers the subsidy in the form of in-kind instead of refund, and an income restriction dummy that takes
one if the municipality imposes restriction for subsidy eligibility. Significance levels: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.10
