Introduction

     This paper identifies key issues surrounding the advisability and

practicality of adopting "target zones' for the exchange rates of major

currencies. 1

     At present there are wide differences of view on the subject of

target zones. This reflects at least three factors: first, different

assessments of the performance of the existing exchange rate system of

managed floating; second, different evaluations of whether a system of

target zones could remedy the perceived weaknesses of the existing

system; and third, different conceptions of the preferred form of

target zones.

     The purpose of this paper is not to make the case either for or

against the adoption of target zones. Indeed, we have tried to avoid

expressing our own view on this central issue. Rather, the intention

 is to raise and discuss factors that should be considered in any serious

 examination of the topic. As such, the paper not only outlines potential

 strengths and weaknesses of various versions of the target zone approach

 but also confronts operational questions thai would have to be faced if

 the target zone approach to exchange rate management were adopted.

      The paper is organized as follows. Section I addresses four funda-

 mental questions concerning the definition of and the rationale for

 target zones: first, what is generally meant by a target zone approach

 to exchange rate management and how can "hard" and "soft" versions of

 this approach be defined; second, what are the perceived deficiencies in

 the existing exchange rate system which motivate the call for the adoption
                                  —2—

of target zones; third, how might target zones remedy these deficiencies;

and fourth, what factors are behind much of the skepticism over and

opposition to target zones?

     Section II deals with a series of operational questions and issues

of a more technical and specific nature that weigh heavily on the practi-

cality of implementing a target zone approach. The issues discussed are

the following: how would the target zones be calculated; what currencies

would be included in the system of target zones; how wide should the

target zones be and how frequently should they be revised; and what

policy instruments would be employed to keep actual exchange rates within

the target zones, and with what consequences for other policy objectives?

A brief postcript appears as Section III of the paper.

     Finally, three caveats relevant to the nature and scope of this

study should be mentioned. First, there should be no presumption that

advocates of target zones see this as the only proposal for improving

exchange rate stability. Indeed, most advocates of target zones would

also rely on stronger surveillance of a broader nature to help reach

that objective. Second, since the paper does not attempt to compare

the target—zone proposal to other proposals for improving exchange rate

stability, there should likewise be no presumption that the strengths

and weaknesses outlined here are more or less significant than those

associated with other proposals. 2 Third, since many of the precise

operational features of a system of target zones remain largely

conjectural (e.g., which currencies would be included, how target zones
                                      —3—

would be calculated, etc.), the views expressed on these operational

features should be seen more as aids to discusssion and debate than as

definite conclusions.


1.   The Meaning and Rationale for Target Zones

1.1: What   are   target zones?

     Target zones mean different things to different people. Perhaps

the easiest way to think of them is as a hybrid exchange rate system that

combines some of the attributes and characteristics of both pegged and

flexible exchange rate systems. 3

     A. Row does a system of target zones differ from other exchange
         regimes?

     Target zones differ from a pure system of clean floating in that the

authorities are permitted (and indeed are likely) to intervene in the

exchange market, and, more generally, are encouraged "to take a view" on

 the desirable level of the exchange rate. Target zones differ from the

 present system of managed floating in at least two principal respects: 4

 (i) the authorities establish a target zone for the exchange rate

 for some future period; and (ii) the authorities are expected to keep

 more of an "eye" on the exchange rate in the conduct of monetary policy

 so as to keep    the   actual exchange rate within the target zone. 5

 Compared to the adjustable peg system, target zones need not entail a

 formal commitment to intervene in all circumstances in the exchange

 market to keep actual rates within the zone.       Indeed, the only concrete

 intervention guideline that is typically mentioned is that the author-

 ities refrain from "destabilizing intervention," that is, buying their
                                          4—

 own   currency   when it is above the top of the zone and selling it below

 the bottom of the zone. This specific guideline was also included in

 the Fund's 1974 "Guidelines for the Management of Floating Kxchange

 Rates." 6 Finally, target zones differ from a pure system of rigidly

 fixed exchange rates in that, in addition to the lack of a formal inter-

 vention obligation, the zones themselves are to be occasionally reviewed

 and changed if deemed necessary.

       B. Flow can "hard" and "soft" versions of target zones be defined?

       In general, various versions of target zones can be distinguished

 by reference to the following four characteristics:

       (1) width of the target zone (outside of which the exchange rate

 is viewed as "out of line"),

       (ii) the frequency of changes in the target zones,

       (iii)   the   degree of publicity given to the zones; in this context,

one nay distinguish between public announcement of the target zones and

confidential disclosure in official circles (for purposes of exchange rate

surveillance, intervention, multilateral policy coordination, and consultation),

that is, "loud zones" versus "quiet zones," and

       (iv) the degree of commitment to keeping exchange rates within

the zone.

       Obviously, these characteristics define a spectrum of possible

approaches to target zones. At one end, a "hard" version of target

zones night entail a monetary policy that is heavily geared to

maintaining the exchange rate within the narrow, infrequently
                                                                   revised,

and publicly announced zone. At the other end of the spectrum, lies
                                 —5—.


a "soft" version of target zones that might be characterized by a

monetary policy paying only limited attention to the level of the

exchange rate; and by zones that are wide, frequently revised, and

kept confidential. The hard and soft poles, in turn, may serve as

useful benchmarks for the analysis and evaluation of intermediate

versions of target zones.

     The hard version of target zones shares some of the attributes of

the existing European Monetary System (EMS).   In particular, hard target

zones can be considered a close relative of the EMS's fixed but adjustable

rates with narrow margins and a "divergence indicator.' However, unlike

the EMS, hard target zones do not entail a formal commitment for exchange

rate intervention; nor need there he an analogue to the credit facilities

of the EMS. The soft version of target zones differs from existing

Fund surveillance procedures (e.g., the requirement for reporting real

exchange rate changes in excess of 10 percent to the Executive Board)

 in that the former introduces a more explicit and formal framework for

 defining the appropriate pattern of exchange rates and for establishing

 the links between exchange rates and macroeconomic policies. 7

 1.2: What considerations underlie the call for the adoption of target
      zones?

      Proponents of target zones proceed from two basic perceptions:

 first, that the present system of managed floating has exhibited serious

 deficiencies; and second, that the adoption of a system of target zones

 could remedy at least some of these deficiencies. Mtong the alleged

 deficiencies, the most attention has been paid to the following

 considerations:
                                   —6—

      A. Exchange rates have been highly volatile and unpredictable

          Whether measured in real or nominal terms, bilateral or effective

 terms, the short—run variability of exchange-rates over the period of

 managed floating has been high——indeed, significantly higher than during

 the previous Bretton Woods system. In addition, most exchange rate changes

 have been unpredictable (as suggesEed by market indicators like forward

 exchange rates). While high short—term volatility and unpredictability

 of exchange rates is usually deemed to be less serious than longer—term

 "misalignnents; this volatility is still regarded as costly because it

 generates uncertainty, and hence leads to lower levels of investment and

 trade. Further, developing countries are alleged to be especially

 hurt by this volatility because they do not have well—developed financial

markets (particularly forward cover arrangements).

     B. Exchange rates of major currencies have been subject to large
         and persistent misalignments

         A second complaint against the present system is that exchange

rates of major currencies have been subject to large and persistent

"misalignments" over the past dozen years. Such misalignments are

commonly measured by cumulative departures from purchasing power parity,

or by the sheer magnitude of changes in real exchange rates
                                                              themselves,
or by departures from more comprehensive concepts of the   equilibrium"
real exchange rate (e.g., the exchange rate that yields a cyclically

adjusted current account balance equal to normal net private capital

flows). Not surprisingly, charges of misalignment were particularly

pronounced over the period 1981—85. A representative estimate of mis-

alignment is provided by Williamson (1985). lIe estimated that by the
                                   —7—


end of 1984 the extent of misalignment in the real effective exchange

rate was 39 percent (overvaluation) for the U.S. dollar and 19 percent

 (undervaluation) for the Japanese yen. Such misalignments are, in turn,

deemed costly because they have an adverse impact on resource allocation,

induce adjustment costs (including unemployment), distort optimal levels

of capital formation, and encourage protectionism.

     C. Under the existing exchange rate system, macroeconomic policies
         in major industrial countries have been undisciplined and
         ordinated

         Perhaps the chief criticism by the proponents of target zones

is that the existing system of floating exchange rates lacks an effective

mechanism for ensuring policy discipline and coordination. 8   As support-

ing evidence, the critics cite, inter alia, the doubling of industrial—

country average inflation rates as between 1963—72 and 1973—85, and the

tripling of the ratio of industrial countries' government fiscal deficits

to GNP over the same period. On lack of coordination, they point to the

frequent conflicts among the major industrial countries on both the stance

and mix of macroeconomic policies, as well as on the need for structural

reform. Also, despite the efforts made at coordination, critics emphasize

the absence of binding agreements during the floating—rate period on

either rates of monetary expansion or exchange rate norms. Undisciplined

and uncoordinated policies, in turn, are said to be costly because such

behavior is incompatible with financial stability and sustainable growth,

and also because such policies are the main driving force behind both

short—term volatility and longer—term misalignment of exchange rates.
                                 —8—

    D. TMF surveillance under the existing exchange rate system has been
        largely ineffective in respect of major industrial countries,
        resulting in asymmetry in the international adjustment mechanism

         Yet a fourth alleged weakness of the existing system is that Fund

surveillance has not been sufficiently effective in respect of the very

tndustrial countries whose policies have the most significant "spillover

effects' on the world economy, thereby producing, among other things, an

asymmetric distribution in the burden of adjustment. As evidence for this

position, the critics cite the magnitude and persistence of current account

imbalances in the United States and Japan, especially over the past three

years. The seeming inability of surveillance to bring about a correction

of the structural U.S. budget deficit is regarded as another striking

example of this lack of symmetry. Further, it is argued that an Inap-

propriate mix of macroeconomic policies in the major industrial countries

during the early l9SOs resulted in high real interest rates and in sluggish

economic activity. A consequence of this was that developing countries

faced (during 1981—83) a sharp increase in debt service requirements,

a significant decline in export earnings, a compression of their imports,

and unusually slow growth. Thus, so it is argued, adverse spillover

effects from poor policies in industrial countries were substantial,

and the burden of adjustment fell disproportionately on the developing

 countries.

 1.3: How would the introduction of target zones for the major currencies
      remedy these four perceived deficiencies of the existing exchange
      rate system?

      A central argument advanced by proponents of target zones (see, for

 example, Roosa (1984)) is that their introduction would restore some of
                                 —9—

the useful characteristics of the Bretton Woods system without being

subject to the flaws that led to the collapse of that system.

     A. Restoring an anchor for medium—term exchange rate expectations

         Tt is often argued that one reason why exchange rates have been

o volatile under the present exchange rate system is that market partici-

pants lack an 'anchor' for medium—term expectations about exchange rates.

In such an environment, new information, rumors, or announcements can lead

to large revisions of expectations about the future which in turn induce

"large" changes in current exchange rates. Furthennore, under some

circumstances, such events may set the stage for the emergence of band-

wagon" effects and speculative "bubbles" that can dominate the evolution

of the exchange rate and divorce it increasingly from "fundamentals".

     It is claimed that target zones will reduce exchange rate volatility

and misalignment on two counts. First, the obligation (albeit an informal

one) or the intention to keep the exchange rate within the zone provides

market participants with useful information about the likely conduct of

future macroeconomic policies, especially monetary policy. The easier it

is to nake an informed judgment about the future course of policies, the

less one can expect the erroneous extrapolation of short—tern events and

the more forgiving will be the market of short—term deviations of policy.

Second, the publication of target zones provides market participants

with Information on the authorities' collective estimate of future equi-

librium exchange rates. Therefore, it is said to reduce the risk that

market participants use the "wrong model" in translating (even perfectly

foreseen) future policy changes into forecasts of future exchange rates.
                                  — 10 —




     B.   Restoring discipline and coordination to the conduct of
          economic policies

          Target zones are said to restore discipline to macroeconomic

policymaking for two reasons. First, if exchange rates are maintained

within the target zones, then macroeconomic policies, again particularly

monetary policy, are disciplined by the exchange rate constraint. Second,

even if the authorities opt to alter the target zone rather than their

policies, they would still be obliged both to negotiate a new zone and

to explain why a new zone is appropriate. These obligations themselves

are said to introduce stronger peer pressure into policy formation.

     Turning to the coordination of policies, the following points are

noteworthy. First, the very fact that a system of target zones has to be

negotiated and must display mutual consistency of cross exchange rates is

said to enhance the degree of international policy coordination. Under a

system of target zones, so it is argued, the exchange rate implications

of alternative stances and mixes of policies would be directly confronted,

thereby ending the undesirable current practice whereby exchange rates

emerge as a "residual of other policy actions of individual countries.

Also, the requirement that target zones be negotiated and mutually agreed

is said to reduce the risk of competitive devaluations.

     And to the extent that target zones do restore discipline and

coordination to the conduct of macroeconomic policy, they will reduce

misalignment and volatility of exchange rates.
                                 — 11 —




    C.   Increasing the effectiveness of IMF surveillance and reducing
         the asymmetry in the adjustment process

         Proponents of target zones argue that the need to negotiate,

to ensure consistency, and to revise the zones could provide a natural

focal point for multilateral Fund surveillance. Just as important, such

surveillance procedures when applied to target zones will be aimed at

the policies of the najor industrial countries that, in turn, are likely

to constitute the membership of the target zone system. It is alleged

therefore that target zones will remove the Achilles heel of the present

surveillance procedures, namely, the inability to effect a meaningful

change in policies of large industrial countries. Since the asymmetry

of adjustment is said to depend critically on policy behavior in industrial

countries, more effective surveillance of them would also produce more

symmetrical adjustment.

     the remedial properties of a target zone approach would obviously

depend on the particular version adopted. The "harder" versions, by

virtue of being closer images of the Bretton Woods regime, clearly offer

a stronger dose of external pressure on domestic policy. But, as is

discussed in subsequent sections, the alleged benefits associated with

 the harder versions may also entail higher costs.

      Proponents of the "softer" versions of the target zone approach

 argue that their adoption would enhance the surveillance process for at

 least three reasons. First, even if the zones were wide and were frequently

 revised, they would exert some disciplinary force on the most flagrant and

 persistent cases of inappropriate policies. Thus, while soft target zones
                                  — 12 —



may not do much to catch niisalignments on the order of 10 percent or less,

 they will, so their supporters argue, catch the 20—40 percent real exchange

rate misaligmBents that do most damage to the system. Second, even if the

 zones were not announced to the public, they still are likely to provoke

helpful discussion and analysis of policy interdependence among officials

of participating members. Also, such "quiet' zones provide another channel

for peer pressure against inappropriate policies. Third, since the Fund1s

current practices in any case involve evaluating the appropriateness

of members' exchange rates, supporters argue that even unpublished zones

may prove useful in generating a more concrete framework for evaluating

exchange rate implications of alternative macroeconomic policies.

     D. Escaping the same fate as the Bretton Woods system

         Supporters of target zones acknowledge that many of the factors

associated with the collapse of Bretton Woods have not gone away (e.g.,

high international mobility of capital, larger financial resources for

private speculators than for central banks, existence of large and

suddenly changing interest rate differentials across countries, etc.).

Nevertheless, they contend that a system of target zones can survive

pressure from "hot money" flows. They argue that so long as policy

adjustments are made when necessary or so long as the target zones are

revised frequently to reflect inflation differentials and needs for real

exchange rate adjustment, expectations of large and discontinuous exchange

rate adjustments that provide the motive for speculative attacks will

seldom arise. Tn their view, the viability of the EMS provides testimony
                                   — 13 —




that   it is possible to operate an adjustable peg system in the 1980s

provided that there is sufficient political commitment, active exchange

market intervention policies, and a presumptive indicator for adjustment.

Since a target zone system shares many of these characteristics, it too

is viable. 9

1.4: What factors are behind much of the skepticism about and opposition
     to target zones?

       Opposition to the adoption of target zones stems from a more sanguine

appraisal of the performance of the existing system, doubts about the

capacity of target zones to remedy alleged deficiencies, and concerns

that target zones would introduce new problems. Each of these elements

is discussed in turn.

        A. Has the existing system failed?

            Exchange rate volatility. While the short—run volatility of

 both nominal and real exchange rates has indeed been high during the

 period of managed floating, this begs the question of whether that

 volatility was •excessive." In this connection, opponents of target

 zones raise two   points.
        First, the period since 1973 has witnessed great turbulence in the

 world economy and great uncertainty about the future course of economic

 and political events. In this environment, all asset prices, not only

 exchange rates, have shown high volatility. In fact, exchange rate

 changes have been smaller than changes in prices of other assets (e.g.,

 national stock market prices, changes in short-tertfl interest rates,

 changes in commodity prices). As such, conclusions about the excessive

 nature of exchange rate fluctuations depend upon the specific yardstick

  selected.
                                        — 14 —



      Second, they note that there is an intrinsic difference between

 asset prices on the one hand and wages and goods prices on the other

 hand. The former are auction prices that
                                                 depend heavily on expectations
 about the future whereas the latter are more sticky in the short run,

 reflecting in large part contractual arrangements made in the past.

 Thus, wages and prices of national output may not serve as a proper

 yardstick for assessing exchange rate volatility. Indeed, some would

 say that it is precisely because wages and prices are so slow to adjust

 to current and expected economic conditions that it is desirable to allow

 for "excessive" adjustment in exchange rates.

     As regards the unpredictable nature of exchange rate changes under

the present system, opponents of target zones note that the foreign

exchange market is one in which risk can be covered
                                                          relatively easily
(via access to forward markets, options markets, etc.). For this reason,

it is argued that    it   may be preferable to concentrate the disturbances in

this market rather than transfer them to other markets, such as labor

markets, where dealing with them would be more difficult.

     Turning to the cost of short—run volatility of exchange
                                                                   rates,
opponents point to the sporadic nature of the evidence linking
                                                                     exchange
rate volatility to the volume of international trade and investment. 10

They also argue that it is doubtful that the system of pegged rates

could have survived in the turbulent environment of the
                                                             past 15 years
without severe limits on trade and capital movements
                                                          being imposed by
many countries. 11    Such restrictions on trade and capital flows, in
                                      — 15 —



 turn,   could well have been more costly for the world economy than the

 short—run volatility of exchange rates experienced under the present

 system.

             Exchange rate misalignment. Almost all observers, even many

 staunch opponents of target zones, agree that there have been serious

 misalignnertts of major currency exchange rates during the past few years,

 particularly as regards the sharp real appreciation of the U.S. dollar.

 Opponents of target zones suggest however that in evaluating both the

 extent and the cost of such misalignments several factors ought to be

 recognized.

           Changes in real economic conditions requiring adjustments in the

 relative prices of different national outputs occur all the time

 (continuing intercountry differences in growth of labor produc-

 tivity, permanent changes in the terms of trade, intercountry shifts

in both the marginal productivity of capital and the propensity to

save, etc.). Under a system of pegged rates, relative price adjust-

ments are achieved through the slow changes of national price levels and

through occasional changes of parity. Under floating rates, adjustments

in the relative price of different national
                                               outputs occur rapidly and in
anticipation of changes in economic conditions rather than after the

need for adjustment has become apparent. In the absence of an explicit

specification of relative costs, there is no general presumption that

slow adjustment of relative prices is preferable
                                                    to rapid adjustment,
or that price adjustments should not occur in anticipation of events

requiring such adjustments. Hence, what nay seem to be misalignments

may in part represent equilibrating changes.
                                  — 16 —




      Critics   of target zones argue that one should not overlook the

fact that significant misalignment of major currency exchange rates

also occurred during the Bretton Woods period, especially in its later

years. In this connection, they caution that misalignment of real

exchange rates can derive from too little nominal exchange rate flexi-

bility as well as from too much. The frequency of misaligned real

exchange rates in countries with "pegged" exchange arrangements, where

there is often a reluctance to alter nominal rates in the face of

large inflation differentials, should stand as a warning to the dangers

involved.

       The size of estimated misalignments in major currency exchange

rates is, according to defenders of the present system, highly uncertain.

To take but one example, calculations of misalignment done by Williamson

(1985) and others are strongly affected by the assumption that 'normal'

net capital flows are zero for the United States. This assumption is

important because the equilibrium exchange rate is defined in such calcu-

lations as the exchange rate that would produce a current account balance

equal to the assumed normal net private capital flow. But a country

 that is a "normal" net capital exporter under one set of macroeconomic

 policies, tax considerations, and political events abroad may become a

 natural importer under others. In this connection, a judgment that

 normal net private capital flows for the United States were, say, a

 $30 billion annual inflow (to reflect high expected profitability,

 relatively low domestic savings, and safe—haven considerations) rather
                                                                    12
 than zero would reduce the estimated misalignment considerably;

                                                                   that
         Defenders of the present system argue that explanations

attribute long—term misalignment to a speculative bubble are highly

questionable. They point out that the (narrow) theoretical models that

are frequently used to generate a speculative bubble in the exchange

rate (i.e., a fully expected continuous price change not justified by

fundamentals) also imply that such a bubble could prevail for only a

short period of time——certainly not for five years or so.

           Discipline and coordination. Defenders of the current exchange

 rate system question the allegation that it exerts less discipline than

 regimes with greater fixity of exchange rates.     As a theoretical matter,

                                                           highly visible and
 it is pointed out that changes in exchanges rates are

 are transmitted promptly into domestic prices.     As a result, the conse-

 quences of undisciplined macroeconomic policies are readily apparent. In
                                            fixed exchange rates show up only in
 contrast, undisciplined policies under

 reserve changes, and then usually become public only after a significant

 delay. Therefore, it is argued, the supposed superior disciplining force

 of a fixed rate regime is not obvious. Furthermore, as an empirical

 matter, the 1979—86 policy experience in industrial countries can be

 viewed as evidence that anti—inflationary discipline can be restored

  without fixed exchange rates. Indeed, the deceleration in growth rates

  of narrow and broad money that took place in the face of high unemployment

  in most of the major industrial countries in 1979—82 coincided with

  relatively high variability of both nominal and real exchange rates.

      As for coordination, defenders of the
                                            present system note that
 there have been some successful
                                    coordination efforts during the past

 decade. In this context, they mention the U.S. dollar support package

 of November 1, 1978, agreements on short—tenn exchange rate
                                                             management
 policies (e.g., intermittent joint countering of disorderly market

 conditions) ,   the agreements of the Bonn economic summit of 1978, and

 the Group of Five agreement (of
                                    September 22, 1985) in New York on
 foreign exchange intervention and other policies. 13

      In addition, it can be argued that the optimal degree of coordi-

 nation is less than complete. For
                                      example, the perception of independent

 monetary policy may be necessary in some countries for
                                                          sustaining confidence
 that monetary policy will not be inflationary in the long run (particularly

if not all potential partners in a target zone system have a track record

of consistently sound monetary policy). 14

     In sum, the very point of departure for the projionents of target

zones, namely, the overall appraisal that the
                                                 existing system has failed,
is itself not universally
                             accepted. Opponents of target zones acknowledge
that the present system has weaknesses but do not see these weaknesses

as more serious than those demonstrated by earlier
                                                      systems.   In addition,
opponents emphasize that the present system has demonstrated some "valuable

strengths.' Specifically, exchange rate changes are viewed as having made

a positive contribution to securing effective
                                                 external payments adjust-
ment over the medium to long run. The present system is also credited

with having maintained a mechanism of conflict
                                                 resolution (namely, the
foreign exchange market) that has not involved either suspension of
                                        —19—


 currency convertibility or large—scale restrictions on trade and capital

 flows; indeed, supporters of the present system claim that floating

 rates allowed the removal of certain
                                          restrictions. Furthermore, it is
 argued that independent monetary
                                     policy, facilitated by the existing

 exchange rate system, permitted the application of successful disinfla-

 tionary policies. Finally, it is argued that no exchange rate regime

 would have emerged unscathed from the combination of shocks, portfolio

 shifts, and structural and institutional
                                               changes that occurred during
 the years of nanaged floating.

         B. Would the introduction of
                                        target zones improve matters?
         (1) Would target zones provide an anchor? As noted earlier, one of

 the central arguments for the introduction of target zones is that such

 zones would provide an anchor for medium—term exchange rate expectations.

But would it, and at what costs?     Skeptics make the following points.

              If the absence of an anchor stems from lack of information

about future government policies, then it is not clear that publication

of target zones, rather than announcement of the future course of policies

themselves, is the preferred way to provide that information. Obviously,

if the zones are not published
                                  (i.e., quiet zones), then their adoption
will not alleviate the policy uncertainty problem at all. 15

          If the source of uncertainty is that market participants do

not possess information on the model linking government policies with

the consequent levels of exchange rates, then target zones (loud zones)

do indeed provide the missing information.
                                                This presupposes, however,
either   that the government has superior information about the "true
                                  —20—


                                                           to convince
model" or that the government carries enough credibility

market participants that it will adjust its policies to consistently

maintain exchange rates within the announced zone (i.e., it will adjust

its policies to make the exchange rate forecast come true). Opponents

of target zones see no evidence that governments have such superior

information or knowledge about such a model. Further, they point out

that experience with preannounced exchange rate targets in Latin America

suggests that countries would probably find it difficult to adhere to

such targets. 16

       Even if the target zones were credible for some period of

 time, critics argue that the occasional need for revision of the target

 zones will invite the same type of one—way bet for speculators that

 ultimately felled the Bretton Woods system. Of course, since govern-

 ments are not formally committed to defend the target zones, they may

 choose to allow exchange rates to depart from the zone (while subsequently

 announcing a revised zone). But in that case, the zones themselves would

 soon lose their credibility.

        Even if the zones are announced, critics contend that "soft"

 versions of target zones characterized by wide and frequently revised

 zones are not likely to provide a strong and reliable anchor because
                                                  about the future rate.
 they will not sufficiently narrow expectations

 Yet such wide and frequently revised zones are said to be necessary (by

 critics) to account for our measure of ignorance about the equilibrium

 exchange rate and for changing real conditions.
                                   — 21   —



      Even if the anchor is   credible    and   durable,   its   introduction
may be costly. The argument here is that the volatility or misalignment

of exchange rates is not the likely source of difficulties but rather a

manifestation of the prevailing package of macroeconomic policies.

Without introducing a significant change into the conduct of policies, a

manipulation of exchange rates to satisfy the zones may not improve

matters at all. In fact, the absence of the exchange rare as a market

gauge for assessing policies will then only confuse matters and reduce

the information essential for policymaking.

            (2) Would target zones provide discipline? It is widely agreed

that misalignment of real exchange rates arises to a large extent from

undisciplined and uncoordinated macroeconomic policies. Hence, the

ability of target zones to reduce misalignment rests in good measure on

their ability to enhance discipline. Skeptics put forward the following

arguments.

             Experience suggests to them that national governments are

unlikely to adjust appreciably the conduct of domestic policies so as to

satisfy the constraints imposed by the exchange rate regime. Rather, it

is argued, it is more likely that the exchange rate regime adjusts to

whatever discipline national governments choose to have. As an illustra-

 tion, it is pointed out that other external pressures aimed at restoring

discipline to policy in major industrial countries (e.g., individual

Article IV consultations, Fund Executive Board discussions of the world

 economic outlook, Group of Five surveillance meetings, OECD country

 reports) have met with only limited success. Why then should target

 zones succeed where other similar measures have produced such limited

 results?
                                  — 22 —



       Evidence from earlier periods during which exchange rates were

more rigid does not suggest that greater fixity of exchange rates

induced either lower average external imbalances, or more rapid adjust-

ment of such imbalances, or greater symmetry of adjustment as between

either surplus and deficit countries, or between reserve and nonreserve

currency countries. 17 Why then should target zones provide the impetus

to discipline when exchange regimes with greater formal commitment have

not consistently done so?

     • In a related vein, it is argued that by focusing attention on

exchange rates rather than on the root cause of misalignment, namely,

the stance and mix of macroeconomic policies, one may lessen the pressures

for corrective action on the ultimate sources of the problem.

       Critics argue that if the nominal target zones reflect rigid

targets for real exchange rates, they can destabilize the price level. 18

Thke, for example, the case of a country that experiences an unexpected

wage push that raises its price level relative to that abroad. Its real

exchange rate will then have appreciated relative to its initial level.

If the authorities attempt to restore the original real exchange rate by

announcing a more depreciated nominal target zone, then the implied

expansion in monetary policy (needed to keep the actual exchange rate

within the new target zone) will increase the price level. In short,

critics warn that while a rigid real exchange rate may he helpful for

preventing trade balance deteriorations due to eroding competitiveness,

it can also present new dangers for controlling inflation. More
                                                                  broadly,

monetary policy is not the appropriate policy response to all types of

disturbances.
                                   — 23 —



       Critics   point out that while target zones can supply inform-

ation on intercountry divergences in policy, they do not provide guidance

on the right stance of policy within a country. For example, if two

countries each have inflation rates of 10 percent, the exchange rate

may be stable but few would argue that monetary policy in either country

was appropriate. Again, so the critics argue, target zones do not ensure

discipline.

     (3) Would target zones enhance coordination and strengthen

surveillance? In appraising the effects of the adoption of target zones

on policy coordination and on Fund surveillance, skeptics make the follow-

ing observations.

       Whatever the exchange rate regime, there are strong barriers

to coordination for at least two reasons: (1) exchange rates are by their

very nature •competitive" in the sense that one country's gain is frequent-

ly another country's loss; (ii) various compromises on growth, inflation,

and income distribution at the national level often leave little room for

further compromise on policies at the international level. 19 Target

zones, so say their critics, cannot overcome these barriers.

       The process of negotiating target zones could produce

dangerous frictions among the negotiating parties and could lead ultimately

to a reduced level of coordination in this and other areas.

       ate cannot rule out the possibility that the cumbersome nego-

tiation of target zones would land the system back in the management
                                   — 24 —



delays   of the latter days of the Bretton Woods system, with adverse

effects on the desired flexibility of real exchange rates. With

target zones, one loses the "safety valve" provided by the marketplace

for foreign exchange as a mode of conflict resolution.

         To the extent that the adoption of target zones results in

a significant loss in independence in the conduct of domestic monetary

policy, the authorities may be tempted to adopt discriminatory trade

practices and other measures of protection in order to compensate for

the loss of a powerful policy instrument.

         The use of target zones as a possible focal point for Fund

surveillance raises three related potential problems. First, the use of

the exchange rate as a primary indicator of disequilibria in macroeconomic

policies could send misleading signals. Critics note that the more

general Fund practice as applied to adjustment programs and financial

programing is to employ a whole set of macroeconomic indicators for

diagnostic purposes. Would exchange rate movements vis—'—vis the target

zone constitute a "sufficient statistic" for monitoring macroeconomic

policies? If one believes that the answer to that question is negative,

then orienting Fund surveillance around that single indicator, in addition

to possibly diverting attention from the root causes of disequilibria,

may jeopardize the quality of surveillance,

     The second problem raised by skeptics is that the target zone

approach is agnostic about which policy instruments should be used to

respond to departures of exchange rates from the zone. The usual pre-

sumption is that it will be monetary policy. 20 However, if the root

cause of the disequilibrium is an inappropriate monetary—fiscal policy
                                   — 25   —



nix,   then an excessive emphasis on monetary policy could produce compliance

with the target zones and yet leave the fundamental problem unsolved.

In short, critics argue that the calculation of the target zones

would have to be based on an appropriate and broad set of indicators

to avoid sending false signals about both the need for adjustraent and

the appropriate corrective measures.

       Third, critics contend that target zones do not resolve the problem

of how to allocate and enforce the burden of adjustment among member

countries. When more than one member's (effective) exchange rare leaves

the zone, it will be necessary to specify who does what if an effective

and coordinated policy response is to take place. But target zones, so

the critics argue, offer no solution to this "14—1 problem."

           (4) Could target zones escape the fate of the Bretton Woods
               system?

               Opponents of the target zone approach to exchange rate manage-

ment remain unconvinced that target zones could escape the fate of Bretton

Woods. They make essentially three arguments. First, technological ad-

vances in transferring funds across national boundaries, in combination

with absence of parallel growth in official reserves, mean that the

capital mobility problem (hot money flows) is now even more formidable

than in the early 1970s. Second, difficulties associated with negotiat-

ing mutually—consistent target zones would as before produce large discon-

tinuous changes in exchange rates, thus motivating strong speculation.

 In addition, if the timing of exchange rate changes were done unpredic-

 tably to prevent such speculation, this would destroy the raison d'tre
                                   — 26 —



of   the target zone scheme itself. Third, the viability of the EMS owes

much to the unusual political commitment behind it, to capital controls

imposed by some members, and to the structural characteristics of its

members. 21 None of these factors would, according to the critics, neces-

sarily transfer to an exchange rate arrangement among a larger and more

heterogeneous group of countries. As such, to them, the viability of

the EMS does not imply much about the viability or desirability of a

target zone system.


II. Operational Questions Associated with the Possible Implementation
     of Target Zones

11.1: How would the target zones be calculated?

       An important implicit assumption in the target zone approach to

exchange rate management is that the authorities can approximate the

equilibrium (real) exchange rate to a useful degree. But by what methods

or techniques? Three methods deserve explicit consideration.

      The first is the purchasing—power—parity (PPP) approach. If the

authorities can identify a base period when the country was in

external balance, then the equilibrium value for the nominal exchange

rate in the current period is the value of the exchange rate in the base

period adjusted for the intercountry difference in inflation rates

between the current and base periods. This is equivalent to restoring

the value of the real exchange rate in the base period. Since the real

exchange rate, in turn, is often viewed as a measure of the country's
•



                                       —27—


    competitive position, the PPP approach can be regarded as an analysis

    of competitiveness as well.

        The    exchange rate used for such calculations would typically be
    an index   of effective exchange rates using bilateral trade weights or

nore sophisticated combinations of trade weights and trade price

    elasticities (e.g., MEI*{ weights). Inflation differentials could be

    measured by consumer price indices, or more likely, by indices of

    either unit labor cost's or prices in manufacturing.

         The PPP approach carries the advantage of simplicity and ease of

    computation. Arrayed against this, however, are several rather serious

    disadvantages   for use in a target zone context.
         First, PPP will be a suitable indicator of the equilibrium exchange
    rate when all disturbances between the base and current periods are
    monetary in origin. In this case, general price levels will be
    altered but relative prices (of imports and exports, or of tradables
    and nontradables, or of individual tradables like food or fuel) will
    not. In contrast, when disturbances are real and do alter relative
    prices, then it will be desirable to have a departure from PPP (i.e.,

    a change in the real exchange rate). This point is relevant because
    there have been numerous real disturbances over the past 13 years of
    managed floating (e.g., large changes in oil prices, changes in savings
    and Investment propensities), and there   is little reason to   believe
    that such real disturbances will not occur in the future. This means
    that if a PPP formula were used to compute the equilibrium rate in a
    target zone, there would probably have to be a manual "override option"
                                  —28—


to permit departures from PPP whenever there were real disturbances to

the system. But this override option robs PH' of its simplicity and

computational facility.

     A second disadvantage of the PPP approach is that actual exchange

rates of major currencies during the l970s and early 1980s have not

followed the paths implied by PPP——and for both the short and

long run. 22 To most observers, the empirical failure of PPP in the

short run is attributable to an intrinsic difference between exchange

rates and prices of national outputs. The former are jumpy, forward—

looking, auction prices that move in anticipation of future events

whereas the latter are sticky, backward—looking, administered prices that

may largely reflect previous events. In the long run, structural changes

and permanent supply shocks nay cause PH' to miss the mark.     In any

case, the poor empirical track record of PPP suggests that exchange rate

forecasts based on PPP might not be credible to market participants.

     A third difficulty with PPP is that the results themselves appear to

be quite sensitive to the choice among alternative price indices and base

periods to the income levels and income growth rates of the countries

involved in the comparison (i.e., the so—called productivity—bias in PPP)

23 and to the level of aggregation in the data (manufacturing versus the

entire economy). 24 Such sensitivity, in turn, makes it difficult to

speak with confidence about all but very large misalignments.

    A second method of calculating equilibrium exchange rates for

target zones is to employ an estimated structural model of exchange

rate determination that relates the (nominal) exchange rate to
                                        — 29 —



 "fundamentals."   Two   popular   such models are the monetary model and

 the portfolio balance model. In the
                                          monetary model, the change in the

 exchange rate is usually explained by changes in the ratio of hone to

 foreign money supplies and by changes in the ratio of the demand for

 money at home to that abroad (where the demand for money is a function

 of, inter alia, real income, nominal interest rates). The portfolio

 balance model relates the (nominal) exchange rate to the stocks of

 assets denominated in the hone and foreign currencies (where these asset

stocks include money supplies as well as interest—bearing securities).

 Since the stocks of financial assets can be related to cumulative budget

deficits, cumulative current account imbalances, open market operations,

and exchange market intervention, the portfolio balance model provides a

direct role for such policies in influencing exchange rates.          In the

monetary model, such policies affect exchange rates only to the extent

that they affect the supply or demand for money.

     Given estimates for such a structural model of exchange rates, the

equilibrium exchange rate could be defined as the rate corresponding

to the desired path of the explanatory fundamentals in the equation

(i.e., money supplies, real income, interest rates, budget positions).

This estimate of the equilibrium nominal
                                                 exchange rate, combined with

some assumed consistent path for prices at home and abroad, could then

be translated into an estimate of the equilibrium
                                                         real exchange rate.
     This structural approach has three advantages: (i) it is forward—

looking and thus compatible with the intrinsic nature of the price

behavior of such assets as securities denominated in
                                                            different currencies;
                                     30 —



                                                                variables and
(ii)   it provides a direct link between macroeconomic policy

exchange rates; and (iii) it recognizes that in today's world of high

international mobility of capital, the proximate determinants of exchange

rates, at least in the short run, probably lie in asset markets rather

than goods markets. At the same time, the structural exchange rate

equation approach is subject to at least two serious deficiencies.

       The most serious shortcoming is that all known structural models

of exchange rate determination have been shown to have very limited

forecasting ability.    In fact, extensive empirical testing over the

past few years has demonstrated that the out—of—sample performance of

structural exchange rate models is frequently no better than that

yielded by naive" models (e.g., a random—walk model). 25 with the

benefit of hindsight, it seems that an important reason for the poor

 performance of the various models is the nature of exchange rates as

 asset prices. As indicated above, exchange rates are very sensitive to

 expectations concerning future events and policies.   Periods that are

 dominated by rumors, announcements, and "news" which alter expectations

 are likely to induce a relatively large degree of exchange rate vola-

 tility. Since by definition "news" cannot be predicted on the basis of

 past information, it follows that by and large the resulting fluctuations

 of exchange rates are unpredictable. In a way, this asset market per-

 spective suggests that one should not expect to be able to forecast accu-

 rately exchange rate changes with the aid of simple structural models.

 The role of the simple structural models is to account for the systematic

 component of the evolution of exchange rates. In cases where the systematic,
                                 —31—


predictable component is relatively small, one may expect to account for

only a small fraction of the variability of exchange rates. The main

message of all this is that target zones based on exchange rate forecasts

from such models night not carry sufficient credibility to act as an

anchor.

     Another problem with the structural exchange rate models is that

the explanatory variables can be difficult to measure and interpret on

a timely basis. For example, the portfolio balance model requires

measurement of asset stocks by currency, by country of issuance, and

by residence of the holder. But such data only becoute available much

after the fact and estimates based on extrapolation of benchmark figures

may introduce substantial error into the calculations. Similarly, in

the monetary model one faces the problems of which monetary aggregate

to use (in view of financial market innovations) • how to forecast that

aggregate over the relevant tine horizon, and how to distinguish short—

 term movements in velocity from trends. For these reasons, the prospects

of obtaining timely forecasts (target zones) from these models are not

 encouraging.

      The third method for calculating equilibrium exchange rates is the

 underlying balance approach. In this approach, the (real) equilibrium
                                                            '
 exchange rate is defined as the rate that would make the       underlying"
 current account (i.e., the actual current account adjusted for temporary

 factors) equal to "normal" net capital flows during the next two      or   three

 years, given (i) anticipated macroeconomic policies in the subject
                                    — 32 —



 countries,   (ii) the delayed effects of past exchange rate changes, and

 (iii) a number of other expected developments.   Furthermore, the equality

between underlying current accounts and normal capital flows must not be

achieved either by wholesale unemployment, or by artificial incentives

to incoming or outgoing capital, or by undue restrictions on trade. 26

 If after accounting for these factors, "underlying" current accounts are

calculated to be quite different from "normal" capital flows, the impli-

cation is that either planned macroeconomic policies or present exchange

rates need to change to prevent such undesirable balance of payments

scenarios from taking place.

     This underlying balance approach to exchange rate assessment was

developed by the Fund staff in the early l970s (see IMP (1984b));

it similarly serves as the framework for calculation of •misaligninents"

in Williamson (1935). The inputs for the calculations come from various

sources. Estimates of "anticipated macroeconomic policies," and their

associated real growth and inflation paths, can be obtained from national

projections or from the Fund's world economic outlook projection's.

Estimates of "normal" net capital flows typically come from an analysis

of past trends adjusted for expected future structural developments

(e.g., capital liberalization measures). Finally, estimates of the

effect of exchange rate changes on current accounts can he derived, for

example, from either of the Fund's two operating trade models, namely

the Multilateral Exchange Rate Model (MERN) or the World Trade Model

(WTM). 27
                                      — 33 —




     For application in a system of target zones, the underlying balance
approach carries three advantages. First, it recognizes that judgments

about the appropriateness of current exchange rates cannot be divorced

from either future anticipated macroecononic policies, or from delayed

effects of past exchange rates that are not yet visible but are likely

to emerge in the future, or from particular factors (e.g., dock strikes)

that are temporary in nature. In this sense, it not only focuses attention

on the root cause of   misalignment   (i.e., inappropriate policies) but also

addresses   the "time dimension" in the misalignment problem.
     Second,   the underlying balance approach appreciates that a desirable

or sustainable payments position need not imply a zero current account

balance. Specifically, it recognizes that a country with a relatively

low domestic savings rate but with relatively attractive domestic

investment opportunities can run a persistent current account deficit

by drawing on foreign savings if (i) it invests those foreign savings

wisely; and (ii) the return on domestic investments is not artificially

 high (because of special incentives for or restrictions on international

 capital flows, or because of unsustainably high government borrowing).

      A third advantage of the underlying balance approach is that, at

 least in principle, it ensures that the computed equilibrium exchange

 rates are consistent across countries. 28 This is so because the trade

 models that underlie such exchange rate calculations are specifically

 designed to be used in a multilateral setting. Since target zones must

 be mutually consistent, this is not a trivial consideration.
                                     — 34 —




      Moving to the negative side of the ledger, the underlying balance

approach is subject to a number of problems.

     First and foremost, the concept of "normal" net private capital

flows is a particularly ambiguous one; yet estimates of these capital

flows play a key role in the estimate of the equilibrium real exchange

rate. The reasons why the concept is so slippery include the following:

(1) While private saving rates are reasonably stable over time and

across countries, the geographic loci of perceived investment opportu-

nities are not; the latter depend on a wide set of expected policies in

both the origin and host countries——many of which can change precipi-

tately. (ii) Various controls on capital flows make it difficult to

determine what is "normal," especially when these controls change over

tine. (iii) Acquisition of foreign assets subjects the holder to risks

(e.g., expropriation risk) that are fundanentally different from those

associated with domestic assets, and therefore consideration of such

risks may limit exposure even when average real rates of return on foreign

assets are high. (iv) Large changes in government fiscal positions, and

drastic shifts in private portoflio composition, can lead to large swings

in observed capital flows, the duration of which is highly uncertain.

The end result of all this is that estimates of "normal net capital

flows for the likely participants in a target zone system are subject

to a considerable margin of error.

    A second problem with the underlying balance approach is that it is

not well suited to the analysis and diagnosis of the mix of macroeconomic

policies. In general, macroeconomic policies influence the equilibrium
                                  —35—


exchange rate in this approach via their effect on anticipated real

output and inflation paths over the next two to three years. Thus, the

model will produce different estimates of the equilibrium exchange rate

for different real output and inflation paths. But it cannot distinguish

among policy mixes that yield the same output and inflation paths.    This

must be regarded as a shortcoming since the cause of misalignment may

lie more with an inappropriate mix of policies (e.g., overly loose fiscal

policy cum overly tight monetary policy) than with an inappropriate stance

of policies (e.g., excessively expansionary monetary and fiscal policy).

     The third difficulty with the underlying balance approach is that

it is operationally complex. Ihta requirements are substantial, computa-

tions depend on large—scale trade models, the rationale behind some of

the calculations is not transparent, and estimates of some key parameters

(e.g., short—run and long—run tradeelasticities) are uncertain. 29

All of this, in turn, might be burdensome for agreement on, and continuous

revision of, target zones.

     Fourth, the large—scale trade models that are likely to be used in

this approach do not pay sufficient attention to either financial var—

lables or to the important distinction between expected and unexpected

values of key economic variables. These omissions render this approach

 somewhat remote from the mechanisms usually associated with the deter-

mination of market exchange rates. Therefore, target zones based on

 forecasts from the underlying balance approach may again be questioned

by market participants.
                                  — 36 —



     To summarize, each of the three methods of calculating equilibrium

exchange rates has strengths and weaknesses. It might, however, not be

necessary to follow just one method. Instead, one could construct a

 consensus" forecast on the basis of estimates from several methods.

Such an exercise would also provide information on the comparative

performance of each method which, in turn, could aid in the ultimate

selection of the proper calculation method. Finally, in appraising the

methods of calculating equilibrium exchange rates, it is important to

recognize that such methods are already being applied to some degree

whenever the Fund "takes a view" on the appropriateness of major currency

exchange rates. In this sense, the problems raised are not new ones.

The differences are that in a system of target zones (especially the

"harder" versions) the method of calculating equilibrium exchange

rates would be more explicit and subject to greater scrutiny, and that

the results of such calculations would be shared with the market.

11.2: What currencies should be included in the system of target zones?

     Mother central issue for a system of target zones is the number

and choice of currencies to be included. Several considerations seem

paramount.

       For administrative efficiency, it is desirable that member-

ship should be kept fairly small. This is because the complexity of

negotiations, and the danger of conflicts that might bring about a

collapse of the system, can be said to increase rapidly as the number

of partners rises.   This position is consistent with the view that

centralized management of exchange rates is feasible only when the
                                   — 37 —




n.nber of decisions to be made is reasonably small. 30 In this connection,
it is useful to recall that although a large number of currencies were

managed under the Bretton Woods system, countries took the initiative

for   par value changes, the Fund could only concur with or object to par
value   changes proposed by a member, and par values were changed rather

infrequently. 31 similarly, the present system of managed floating is a

decentralized system that permits "market—based" decisions to act as a

safety valve when more centralized decisions about adjustment responsi-

bilities and exchange rate alignments do not prove possible. In short,

since international decision—making on exchange rates is likely to be

difficult, one should not unduly burden the system with too many players.

         For a target zone system to have an appreciable impact on

conditions in foreign exchange markets, it is desirable that the member-

ship include major currency countries. Although the vast majority of

countries currently maintain some form of "pegged" exchange arrangements,

the largest trading countries maintain either "limited flexibility"

 (e.g., the EMS) or "more flexible" exchange arrangements, including

 '•independent floating" by four of the largest industrialS countries

 (Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). 32

 Reflecting this, it has been estimated that about two thirds to four

 fifths of world trade is conducted at floating rates. 33 The key to

 progressing toward more fixity in exchange rates therefore lies not in

 inducing many countries to adopt constraints on exchange rate flexi—

 bility——thisis already a fact of life——but rather in inducing the largest
                                    — 38 —




 trading   countries to accept such constraints. This consideration has no

 doubt influenced the leading proposals
                                          (e.g., Roosa (1984)) that the key
 members of a target zone be either the three largest industrial countries

 or the Group of Five (or perhaps Group of Seven) countries.

       A further consideration is the characteristics of the potential

member countries. These characteristics, emphasized in the literature

on so—called optimal currency areas, are relevant not for choosing the

right number of countries for a target zone but rather for assessing

the likely membership.

     The more important country characteristics ate the following:

     (1) The openness of the economy. This criterion suggests that

relatively open economies should prefer greater fixity of exchange

rates because exchange rate fluctuations induce larger domestic price

changes in more open economies, thereby complicating the task of

domestic stabilization policies.

     (ii) The size of the economy. Small economies are said to be

more inclined to join currency unions because, in the absence of such

monetary integration, their effective economic size would be suboptimal.

This of course begs the question of to whom to peg.

     (iii) The degree of commodity diversification.   Highly diversified
economies are deemed more likely candidates for greater fixity of exchange

rates because their diversification provides some natural insulation

against a variety of shocks; hence, there is less need for the insulation

properties of a flexible exchange rate.
                                  — 39 —




     (iv)   The degree of factor mobility. Countries between which there

is a high degree of factor mobility are viewed as better candidates for

currency unions because factor mobility provides a substitute for exchange

rate flexibility in promoting external adjustment. Since factor mobility

ta in turn likely to diminish with geographic distance, this criterion

is often used to justify currency unions between small neighboring states.

     Cv) Similarity of inflation rates. The argument here is that

countries with similar tastes for inflation——and more important, similar

histories of inflation——will tend to prefer greater fixity of exchange

rates. There is however a chicken—and—egg problem: do member countries

of a currency union have similar inflation rates because they belong

to the union, or have they joined the union because of their similar

capacities to combat inflation?

     Obviously, these country characteristics do not all point in the

same direction. For example, the criteria of openness, size, and factor

mobility suggest that the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany,

and Japan would have relatively weak incentives to join a target zone,

relative say, to the smaller European countries that are members of

the EMS. th the other hand, the criteria of commodity diversification

and similarity of inflation rates lean perhaps the other way.

       A final consideration is the relationship to existing currency

blocs. In thinking about the potential membership of a target zone

system, it is important to recognize that most countries are already

part of a currency bloc, be it via pegging to a single currency or cur-

rency basket, or via participation in an arrangement with limited exchange
                                    — 40 —



rate   flexibility (e.g., the EMS). This raises three points: (1) where

members of the target zone system are also members of other (regional)

currency blocs, provision would have to be made for ensuring consistency

of cross exchange rates and for coordinating intervention practices

between the "core" target zone and "satellite" currency blocs;

(ii) countries that already have non—exchange—rate linking arrangements

(e.g. a customs union) nay be reluctant to undertake additional linkages

(i.e. target zones) for fear of restricting too tightly their room for

independent action; and (iii) if the most natural and profitable oppor-

tunities for currency union are exploited first, then it is likely

that a target zone system among major currency countries nay have to

operate with more flexibility (e.g., wider margins and more frequent

revision of central rates) than satellite currency blocs.

11.3: Row wide should the target zones be and how frequently should they
      be revised?

       The equilibrium exchange rate——also sometimes referred to as the

central rate——represents only one of several parameters that characterize

target zones. Two others are the width of the zones surrounding the

central rates and the frequency by which the zones are revised,

What considerations bear on the determination of these latter two

parameters?

       Concerning the width of the zones, four factors are relevant.

First, the zones must be wide enough to accommodate transitory distur-

bances that do not alter long—run equilibrium real exchange rates.

In this sense, the zone may be viewed as providing a buffer. The

buffer not only guards against costly shifts in resources due to
                                   — 41 —




excessively   frequent changes in central rates but also provides the

authorities with breathing space to sort out permanent from transitory

shocks. Second, the zone should be wide enough to reflect uncertainties

about the equilibrium central rate itself. As noted earlier, there

are various approaches to calculating the real equilibrium exchange

rate and there are uncertainties about the parameter values in each

model. To many observers, little is gained by acting as if equilibrium

exchange rates could be assessed with great precision.    Recognizing

                                                  initial zones on the
this, some proposals for target zones recommend

order of 10 percentage points on each side of the central rate (see,

for example, Williamson (1985)). The third factor to be considered

is speculation. A well—known weakness of fixed exchange rates is
                                                  bets" about the
that frequently they offer speculators "one—way

direction of changes in parities. Target zones must therefore be

 sufficiently wide to allow for occasional changes in central rates

 within the zone without provoking one—way speculation.    Fourth, if

 central   rates were specified in terms of a numeraire currency, then
 the width of the target zone linking nonnumeraire currencies will
 in   general be different to that between each currency and the

 numeraire.

        Also, there is no reason why the width of the zones should be

 constant over time. For example, if uncertainty about the equilibrium

 real exchange rate and about the nature of disturbances diminished

 with experience, then narrower zones could be adopted. On the other
                                   — 42 —



 hand, if turbulence increased over time, wider zones could be adopted.

 Finally, as a corollary of the above arguments, there is no logical

 presumption that the width of the zone should be the sane for all

 members. In this connection, it is relevant to note the experience

 of the EMS in which the currency of Italy, a country that has had

 relatively high inflation in the past, is subject to wider margins

 than other currencies. Similarly, it has been suggested that if the

United Kingdom were to join the EMS, special provision should be

made in the form of wider margins for the pound sterling to reflect

the influence of oil price developments on the exchange rate.

     Turning to the frequency of adjustment, a number of points need

to be considered. To begin with, the frequency with which the central

rates (and zones around then) are adjusted should reflect the frequency

of changes in real economic conditions, as well as, of course, the size

of inflation differentials across member countries.    Examples of changes
in real economic conditions would include permanent changes in the

terms of trade, continuing intercountry differences in labor productivity,

and intercountry shifts in saving and investment propensities. Because

such changes in real economic conditions generally do not occur at close

intervals, they are unlikely to induce frequent changes in the
                                                                 target
zones. The size of inflation differentials depends
                                                      primarily on how

successful target zones are in inducing harmonization of members' macro-

economic and structural policies, particularly
                                                 monetary policy. The
second factor governing the desired frequency of adjustment is the flexi-

bility of macroeconomic policy instruments. Specifically, since a change
                                     — 43 —



in   real economic conditions can be reconciled either by a change in

macroeconomic policies with an unchanged zone or by a change in the zone

with unchanged policies, it follows that inflexible policies call for

higher frequency of zone adjustment, and vice—versa. Third, there is

the credibility issue. Frequent revisions in the zones reduce credibility

of the zones and thereby reduce their value as an anchor for expectations.

On the other hand, frequent changes in macroeconomic policies designed

to sustain the zones may also reduce credibility——but this time of the

policies.       Therefore,   the optimal frequency of adjustment from a credi-

bility viewpoint involves balancing between these two considerations.

Fourth, some have argued that if target zones are adjusted frequently

for inflation differentialsand the need for balance of payments adjust-

ment, speculative attacks will be discouraged, since they are motivated

by large discrete changes in exchange rates. Fifth, the frequency of

adjustment must obviously be constrained by the availability of the data

necessary for computations.

11.4: How would exchange rates be kept within the zones and with what
       consequences for other policy objectives?

       For a system of target zones to operate successfully, it is neces-

sary that exchange rates be kept within the agreed zones, at least most

of the time. But how would participating countries assure this result?

Three policy instruments should be considered.

         The most obvious instrument is domestic monetary policy.

Indeed, as indicated in Section I, a differentiating characteristic

of target zones is that the authorities pay more attention to the

exchange rate in the conduct of domestic monetary policy than they do
                                    — 44 —



 under the present system of managed floating. What this means is

 that participating members will have to seek greater coordination of

monetary policies, with a consequent reduction in the ability to inde-

 pendently control the money supply. For example, a member of the system

 that sees its nominal exchange rate fall to the bottom of the zone would

be expected to slow its money growth rate and to increase its domestic

 interest rate vis—'a—vis those of other members; 35 in this way, it

would induce an appreciation in its nominal exchange rate, thereby

keeping its exchange rate within the target zone.   Assuming that the

pass—through of nominal exchange rate changes into domestic prices is

less than complete, the same monetary policy action would allow the

member to satisfy its target for the real exchange rate as well. 36

     There is little doubt about the ability of major industrial coun-

tries to influence nominal and real exchange rates in the medium term

using domestic monetary policy. 37 The key question concerns the willingness

to do so given the implied reduction in their ability to then use domestic

monetary policy for internal objectives. To Dany observers, it is simply

naive to believe that the United States, Japan, and the Federal Republic

of Germany would be willing to override internal objectives for exchange

rate targets in the formulation of domestic monetary policy. Under this

view, "soft" target zones are the strongest commitment one can
                                                                 reasonably
envisage for the three largest potential members. Others argue, however,

that the independence of monetary policy is far from complete under the

present system, even for those countries classified by the Fund as
                                   — 45 —




"independently   floating." To take but one recent example, the U.K. author-

ities reacted to the large decline in the dollar/pound rate in early

1985 by encouraging large increases in domestic interest rates——and this

even though there was strong domestic pressure for lower interest rates

to help reduce unemployment. For this reason, supporters of target zones

argue that all countries already have implicit target zones beyond which

they are willing to sacrifice internal objectives for the exchange rate.

It is argued therefore that the loss of monetary independence at the

margin would be minimal.

       A second possible policy instrument for keeping exchange rates

within target zones is sterilized exchange market intervention (i.e.,

exchange market intervention that leaves the monetary base unchanged).

Its main attraction is that, if effective, it would   permit   the author-

ities to influence exchange rates while simultaneously maintaining

control of the domestic money supply.

     Unfortunately, the prognosis for using sterilized exchange market

intervention as the primary instrument for controlling exchange rates

is not favorable. The Jurgensen Report (1983), for example, supports

the view that sterilized intervention by itself is unlikely to be an

effective tool for influencing the level of the exchange rate over the

medium or long—term. 38 Similarly, recent empirical work on exchange

rate determination indicates that while domestic and foreign currency

assets may well be imperfect substitutes——a necessary condition for

 sterilized exchange market intervention to be effective——risk premiums

 in exchange markets are not well explained by relative asset supplies
                                     — 46 —



 (the   very variables affected by exchange marker intervention). 39 In

 short, the effects of sterilized intervention on market exchange rates

 are likely to be small and uncertain in size.
                                                  Nevertheless, sterilized
 intervention   may have a useful role to play in dampening short—term
 volatility   of exchange rates, in countering disorderly market
                                                                 conditions,
 in complementing and supporting other policies, and in expressing an

 attitude toward exchange markets.

         Capital controls represent a third instrument for keeping exchange

rates within target zones. This is however generally not regarded as an

attractive option for two reasons. First, even aggressive capital control

programs, such as those of the early 1970s, were not able to stem private

capital flows, and the subsequent development of offshore banking markets

suggests even lower effectiveness today. Second, capital control programs

are most effective in altering exchange rates when they cover all types

of capital transactions. But in that case, there is no presunption that

the resource allocation costs of impeding the international flow of

capital would be less serious than departures of exchange rates from

the zones themselves.

     The preceding discussion suggests that the primary instrument

for keeping exchange rates within target zones is likely to be monetary

policy. If this is so, then a second relevant question emerges: with

monetary policy geared more to external objectives, what policy instru-

ments will be assigned to internal balance (i.e., price stability and

high employment)?
                                 — 47 —



     One logical answer is fiscal policy. 40 Here, the key question

is not so much whether fiscal policy can affect aggregate demand in najor

industrial countries. Experience suggests that it can. Rather, the

issue is whether fiscal policy is a sufficiently flexible policy instrument

to be used for stabilization policy in a world in which some countries

have medium—term targets for reducing the share of government expenditure

in overall economic activity, some are contemplating large structural

changes in their tax system, some are commited to given levels of

social programs and defense spending, some are wedded to preannounced

public sector borrowing requirements, and some are facing legislatures

that can take years (not months) to enact significant cuts in budget

deficits.

     A second policy option (favored for example by Meade (1984)) is

to use labor—market policy for internal balance. In brief, the idea

is to lower the money wage rate in any sector which has excess supply

of labor and to raise it where there is excess demand. The problem,

recognized by supporters, is that the implementation of such a policy

would involve the substantial reform of labor market institutions.

In short, although sound in its internal logic, it begs the central

question of how to bring such a labor market policy into being in

advanced industrial economies. The slow progress in reducing structural

rigidities in European labor markets bears testimony to the difficulties

involved.

     In sum, because of the limitations of other policy instruments,

monetary policy is often called on to serve both external and internal
                                  — 48 —




objectives.   If a move to target zones were made, it would require shift-

ing more of the emphasis toward external objectives. This might not

create a major problem if all members of the target zone geared monetary

policy toward price stability; or if coordinated, sterilized exchange

market intervention could ease the external obligations of monetary

policy; or if fiscal policy could be made flexible enough to deal

effectively with internal balance. itwever, since none of these

three outcomes is likely to be fully realized, members of a target zone

system would probably still be faced with serious conflicts between

external and internal balance. At the same time, the constraints on

macroeconomic policies induced by a target zone system might make a

contribution to the realization of these three outcomes.

III. Postcript

     This paper, along with others that examined issues raised in the

reports on the international monetary system presented by the 1puties

of the Group of Ten and Group of Twenty—Four, was discussed by the

Fund's cecutive Board in early 1986. Since then, efforts to improve

the functioning of the exchange rate system have centered on enhancing

economic policy coordination among the largest economies and on

strengthening the multilateral setting for Fund surveillance, includ-

ing the formulation of a set of "objective indicators."

     At its meeting on April 9—10, 1986, the Interim Committee agreed

that "if better exchange rate performance were to be achieved on a

durable basis, it would be of the essence that economic policies be

conducted in a sound and mutually consistent way and that exchange rate
                                    — 49 —



considerations   should play their part in those policies" (International

Monetary Fund (1986), p. 115). The Committee also reconfirmed the key

role that Fund surveillance needs to play in the functioning of the

international monetary system. "To improve the multilateral setting

for surveillance, the Committee asked the Executive Board to consider

ways in which its regular reviews of the world economic situation could

be further adapted to improve the scope for discussing external imbal—

ances, exchange rate developments, and policy interactions among members.

An approach worth exploring further was      the   formulation of a set of

objective indicators related to policy actions and economic performance,

having regard to a medium—term framework. Such indicators might help

to identify a need for discussion of econonic policies" (p. 115).

     The leaders of the seven major industrial countries, meeting on

May 4—6, 1986 in Tokyo at the twelfth annual economic summit, reinforced

this commitment to closer coordination of economic policies. They asked

that their finance ministers meet at least once a year to review their

individual economic objectives and forecasts collectively, and that

they use a set of quantitative indicators of economic policies and

performance with a particular view to examining their mutual compati-

bility" (International Monetary Fund, 1986, p. 145). They welcomed the

recent examples of improved coordination among the Group of Five

countries——including the Plaza Agreement of September 22, 1985——but

felt that additional measures were needed "to ensure that procedures

for effective coordination of international economic policy are

strengthened further" (ibid, p. 157). Toward this goal, the leaders,
                                   — 50 —




together   with the representatives of the European Community parti-

cipating in the meeting, reaffirmed their intention "to cooperate

with the IMP in strengthening multilateral surveillance, particularly

among the countries (the Group of Five) whose currencies constitute

the SDR" (ibid, p. 157). Further, they asked that in conducting such

surveillance and in conjunction with the Managing Director of the IMF,

account be taken of "such indicators as growth rates of gross national

product (GNP), interest rates, inflation rates, unemployment rates,

ratios of fiscal deficits to GNP, current account and trade balances,

money growth rates, international reserve holdings, and exchange rates"

(ibid, p. 157).

     In July 1986, the Fund's Executive Board discussed a staff paper

on "Indicators Relating to Policy Actions and Economic Peforniance." 41

This was followed in September by the Executive Board's discussion of the

staff's world economic outlook exercise, the published version of which

appeard in October,     In the context of analyzing the medium—term prospects

of industrial countries, that exercise contains a section which reviews

certain potential sources of tension in the interaction of economic

 developments and considers their implications for the stance of policies.

     SThen the Interim Committee next met on September 28, 1986 in

 Washington, it once again focused, inter alia, on the use of indicators

 in surveillance. The committee agreed that "a key focus of indicators

 should be on points of interaction among national economies, in parti-

 cular developments affecting the sustainability of balance of payments

positions,   and on the policies underlying them" (International Monetary

Fund, 1986, p. 309). The Committee also asked the Funds Executive

Board to develop further the application of indicators in the context

both of the period consultations with individual member countries and

of the World Economic Outlook so as to facilitate the nultilateraj.

appraisal and coordination of economic policies" (ibid).

                                 FOOTNOTES




  lAt its meeting in Seoul, Korea on October 6—7, 1985, the Interim

Committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary

Fund requested the Executive Board of the Fund '. . . to study the issues

raised in these reports (the reports on the international monetary

system presented by the Deputies of the Group of Ten and the Deputies

of the Group of Twenty—Four) with a view to facilitating a substantial

consideration by the Committee at its next meeting." This paper is

one of the series of papers prepared in late 1985 in response to

that request.

  2Some other proposals for improving exchange rate stability are

analyzed in Crockett and Goldstein (1987).

  31n the Group of Ten report, target zones are described as follows:

    the authorities concerned would define wide margins around an

adjustable set of exchange rates devised to be consistent with a sus-

tainable pattern of balances of payments" (par. 31). (See International

Monetary Fund (...).).

  4Another way of summarizing the difference between a system of target
zones and the present system of managed floating would be as follows.

Under target zones, authorities must come to a mutually agreed view on

the appropriate zones for major currency exchange rates. In contrast,

under the present system, authorities have not generally expressed

their own view on appropriate zones for exchange rates, let alone come

to a common view with other authorities.
                                  — 53 —




  5Target zones are intended to reflect estimates of real equilibrium
exchange rates because it is the real exchange rate that is most

relevant for resource allocation decisions and for balance of payments

adjustment; however, it is usually assumed that for operational purposes

these real rate calculations would be translated into nominal exchange

rate zones. The assumption is that the authorities can alter real rates

by operating on nominal rates. Also, whereas a breach of the target

zone is expected to initiate a review of the whole range of a country's

macroeconomic and structural policies, most target zone proposals assume

that monetary policy will carry the primary responsibility for managing

the exchange rate.

  6lnternational Monetary Fund (1974b).

  7Existing procedures do not rely on the assessment of appropriate zones

but rather use as a starting point the last occasion on which exchange

rate developments were brought to the attention of the Executive Board.

  8Coordination may be thought of as encompassing all international

influences on domestic policymaking; see Polak (1981). It might be

regarded as the chief criticism because short—term volatility and

longer—term misalignment of exchange rates are generally regarded as

manifestations of the lack of discipline and coordination.

  9See Lingerer, Evans and Nyberg (1983) for a review of the EMS   experi-
ence during the 1979—82 period.

  l°International Monetary Fund (1984a).

  "See, for example, Bryant (1983) and Obstfeld (1985).

  l2This   assumes that such an order of magnitude is compatible over

the long run with a reasonable buildup of debt and with an acceptable

maturity profile.

  l3Critics of the present system might reply that the Group of Five

New York agreement was a reaction to the absence of coordination and the

large misaliguments fostered by the present system.

  '4See solomon (1982) on this point.

  '5Some observers also doubt whether in practice quiet zones could he

quiet for long. They argue that it is not possible for the Fund and

national authorities to know what target zones are without this inform—

ation leaking out.

  '6See    Calvo   (1983).

  '7See International Monetary Fund (1984c), Tables 2 and 3.

  '8See Adams and Gros (1986) for an analysis of the dangers for

inflation of real exchange rate targets.

  l9See    Polak   (1981).

  20Most proposals for target zones (e.g., Williamson (1985)) assume

that fiscal policy is not well suited to be an instrument of exchange

rate policy because it is too inflexible and because its (alleged)

comparative advantage (vis—'a—vis monetary policy) is in influencing

domestic demand rather than the balance of paents.

  21See Ijngerer (1984) for a discussion of the implications of the

EMS for the likely success of a return to a system of fixed hut adjust-

able exchange rates.

  22See Frenkel (l981a). Of course, to the extent that actual exchange

rates have been subject to misalignnents, one would not want the actual

rates   to closely follow a PPP path. However, divergencies from PPP have
been so marked and so persistent as to raise doubts about the credibility
of exchange rate forecasts based on PPP.
  23See Balassa (1964).

  24See    International Monetary Fund (1984b).
  25Meese and Rogoff (1982) and Isard (1986).
  26This description of the real equilibrium exchange rate is a close
relative of those outlined in Nurkse (1945), InternatIonal Monetary
Fund (1970), and the Group of twenty—Four Report, para. 69.

  27See Artus and Mccuirk (1981) and Deppler and Ripley (1978).

  2SThis advantage must be qualified in view              of the birge global dis-
crepancy in       current account positions. This discrepancy makes it harder

to reach agreement on what consltutes an equilibrium pattern of current

account positions.

  29See, for example, Goldstein and Khan (1984).

  300f course, exchange rates established in a target zone would have

clear implications for nonparticipants to which they would have to

adjust and/or react.

  31The Bretton Woods system also had the U.S. dollar as the numeraire.

With the dollar as anchor, exchange rate decisions could take place one—

at—a—time. When this was no longer the case (e.g., August—December 1971),

negotiations over exchange rates were much more difficult. It is not

clear what currency or currency—basket would serve as numeraire in a

target    zone.

  321t is worth recalling that the currencies of EMS members float
against currencies of many nonmembers.

  338ee International Monetary Fund (1984c) and the Group of Ten

Report, para. 9.

  34A counterargument is that changes in macroeconomic policies in

response to real changes in the economy could act at times to enhance

the credibility of policy if they were perceived as responsive to these

changes.

  351t is not clear what form monetary intervention would take.

Members could intervene in domestic financial markets (exchanging

money for debt of the same currency of denomination) or in interna-

tional financial markets (exchanging monies of different currency

denomination). If the latter were envisaged, questions could arise

about the adequacy of intervention assets and about sterilization

operations.

  36Obstfeld (1985) reports that month—month correlations between

nominal and real exchange rates for the 1976—85 period were above

0.95 for the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, and the deutsche mark.

  371n the long run (say, three to five years) ,   the ability to
use monetary policy to affect the real exchange rate will be more

modest. Also, even in the medium term, this ability will be lower

for the smaller, more open, more highly indexed industrial countries

than for the larger, less open, less indexed ones. See Goldstein and

Khan (1984) for a survey of estimates of these "pass—through" effects.

and supporting other policies." JurgenAen Report (1983), p.

  39See, for example, Dooley and Isard (1983).

  40Fiscal. policy also has a role to play in achieving a given real

exchange rate on a sustainable basis.

paper.
