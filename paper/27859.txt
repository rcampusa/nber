                                         ABSTRACT

We show that superior performance relative to peers during stressful times identifies higher
quality firms as measured by conventional historical financial statement based measures as well
as default probability measures. Quality measured this way is persistent, but different from price
momentum. Further, a managed portfolio that takes a long position in top quintile (Stable) firms
and a short position in bottom quintile (Vulnerable) firms earns superior risk adjusted returns in
excess of the risk-free rate. The portfolio has an annualized Fama and French three-factor alpha
of 5.2% (t=5.04) and a five-factor alpha of 3.3% (t=3.38)

1        Introduction

Firm quality plays an important role in asset pricing and asset management. Several successful

long term investors like Graham1 and Buffett have emphasized the importance of investing in high

quality companies at reasonable prices.2 While there is no agreed upon definition of quality, one

would expect high quality firms in better businesses, ceteris paribus, to be well governed, having

higher profitability, and requiring fewer resources.

        Identifying higher quality firms based on the above mentioned characteristics requires infor-

mation available in firms financial statements for constructing firms' profitability and resource-use

measures. Novy-Marx (2013) advocates using the ratio of gross profits to assets employed as the

measure of profitability. Fama and French (2015) augment their widely used three factor model

with two additional quality related factors: a profitability factor referred to as robust-minus-weak,

RWM; and an investment factor referred to as conservative-minus-aggressive, CMA. The RWM

factor is based on the ratio of operating profitability to total assets (OP); and the CMA factor is

based on asset growth (INV), which can be interpreted as a measure of resources used by firms for

exploiting future profitable opportunities. Chen and Zhang (2010) construct two quality related

factors: one based on profitability, and the other based on asset growth rate. In contrast to Fama

and French (2015), profitability is measured by return-on-equity, ROE; and asset growth rate by

the ratio of investments to total assets, I/A. Piotroski (2000) constructs a quality measure referred

    According to Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkeshire Hathaway, a company which according to Frazzini
et al. (2013) ranks #1 among all stocks and mutual funds with 30 or more years of history, and 4th among 1,994
mutual funds and 62 among 9035 firms with at least a 10 year history, during 1976-2011, the bulk of the billions in
Berkshire Hathaway has come from the better businesses. See `Poor Charlie's Almanac', 2005, p204.

to as the Piotroski score from information in financial statements to identify higher quality firms

among firms trading at low share prices relative to book value. Asness et al. (2019) construct an

aggregated quality score based on firms' profitability, growth, and safety rankings.

       We propose a measure of firm quality that does not require information from firms financial

statements. Following the folk wisdom that quality shines during difficult times, we measure a firms

quality based on its stock price performance relative to peers during stressful times. In particular,

we use the Fama-French 12 industry classifications (FF12) to identify firms' peer groups, and use

the month with the lowest return during a year as proxy for the stressful time. For each industry

group, we first identify the worst month in a given year. To avoid size bias, we group stocks into big

and small. Stocks are sorted by worst month returns within each size group separately. We term

stocks with worst month returns in the top 20% percentile as Stressful time Stable (SS) firms and

those with returns in the bottom 20% percentile as Stressful time Vulnerable (SV) firms.

       We find that SS firms are of higher quality, when quality is measured using information in finan-

cial statements and market prices as in the literature, even though we did not use any information

from financial statements for classifying firms as SS or SV. We find that SS firms are more profitable

­ higher gross profits to assets ratios, higher operating profitability, and higher return on equity

when compared to SV firms. SS firms also have lower asset growth rate than SV firms, i.e., SS are

more conservative ceteris paribus requiring less resources. Further, SS firms are safer with lower

average default probabilities as given by Ohlson O-score in Ohlson (1980), and of higher quality as

measured by Piotroski F-score.3 .

       We also compare SS and SV firms based on their exposure to systematic and idiosyncratic risks.

SS firms are safer.4 Furthermore, SS firms have less co-skewness and less co-kurtosis, i.e., they

are less sensitive to extreme market downturns. Finally, SS firms continue to be of higher quality
   3
    See Piotroski (2000).
   4
    We measure systematic risk by market beta and idiosyncratic risk by the volatility of the residual in the Fama-
French 3 factor model in Fama and French (1993). See Appendix 8.2 for details.


                                                        3
according to financial statements based quality measures, and safer according to market based risk

measures for several years following the year in which we identified them as being Stressful time

Stable (SS).

      We find that the portfolio of stocks of firms in the SS category significantly outperforms the

portfolio of stocks in the SV category during the worst month in the following year. The relative

performance spread between the SS and SV portfolios of stocks is relatively stable over time across

all industry groups. The average worst month return difference between SS and SV portfolios is

about 4% per month. The persistent superior performance of SS firms relative to SV firms during

the worst months in a year is consistent with the findings in Lemp´
                                                                  eri`
                                                                     ere et al. (2017) and Asness

et al. (2019) that stocks of higher quality firms have lower tail risk.

      The natural questions that arise are whether the higher quality SS firms we identify are the

same as past winners with positive momentum, or low historical beta firms with low systematic risk

exposures. To answer these questions we first consider two sorting methods for identifying stocks

with positive momentum: past-year cumulative returns and partial cumulative returns excluding

the worst month. We find that past winners do have a higher return on average than past losers

during the worst month in the following year. However, the difference becomes insignificant when

the worst month was excluded when measuring past year cumulative returns for identifying past

winners and losers. This suggests that it is the worst month performance that helps in identifying

firm quality. We then consider firms identified as safe based on sorting on their traditional market

betas as well as their downside betas. Firms with high past low market betas as well as low downside

betas perform better during the worst month in the following year. However, both high and low

beta firms have similar financial statement based quality measures, i.e., they are of similar quality.

The same is true for high and low downside beta firms5 .
  5
      A similar observation can also be found in Novy-Marx and Velikov (2018).




                                                         4
   Asness et al. (2019) document that high quality firms had higher risk adjusted returns on average.

Therefore, if SS firms are of high quality, then SS firms should also have higher historical average risk

adjusted returns, when quality related risk factors are not used for computing risk adjusted returns.

We find that over the 52-year from 1967:01 to 2018:12, the Fama and French (1993) three factor

(FF3) alpha for SS is 0.15% per month (t-statistics 3.24) while that for SV is -0.29% per month

(t-statistics -4.21). When we augment the FF3 model with the momentum factor to construct a

four factor model (FF4) for risk adjustment, the alpha of the SS portfolio alpha comes down to

0.10%, but remains significant (t-statistics 2.16). However, the alpha of SV becomes insignificant.

The SS portfolio returns load positively on the quality related factors in Fama and French (2015),

Chen and Zhang (2010), and Asness et al. (2019). We interpret this as the SS portfolio earning a

quality premium. The alphas are not significant when we use quality related factors in addition to

the market for controlling for exposure to systematic risk.

   Given our finding that stressful time relative performance is highly persistent, we should expect

the long SS and short SV (SMV) portfolio to perform better than other commonly used factor

portfolios during the collection of worst month in a year. Our findings are consistent with this

expectation. During the 52 market worst months the SMV portfolio gained 2.67% per month on

average during the 52 worst months. In comparison, the average worst months returns for the

two quality related factors of Fama and French, RMW and ROE, are 0.93% and 1.10% per month

respectively. The `quality-minus-junk' factor QMJ has a comparable worst month return of 2.41%

per month, with a slightly higher standard deviation (2.97 versus 2.53). During the continuing

COVID-19 Pandemic, the stock market suffered the worst loss in March 2020 with the S&P500

index losing more than 16%. The SMV portfolio gained about 10 percent during that month.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data and the methods

we use to identify stressful time stable (SS) and vulnerable (SV) firms. In Section 3 we examine

firm-level characteristics of the SS and SV firms. In Section 4 we compare the characteristics of

the returns on portfolios constructed based on worst month return performance, and portfolios

constructed based on traditional price momentum and historical betas. In Section 5 we provide a

comprehensive analysis of the return dynamics of managed portfolios of SS and SV firms' stocks.

We discuss the performance of the SMV portfolio during the COVID-19 crisis in Section 6 and

conclude in Section 7.



2     Data and Methodology

2.1    Data

We focus on the US stock market. Our universe consists of all individual stocks traded on the

NYSE, NYSE MKT, NASDAQ, and Arca. Our data sample period is from 1967:01 to 2018:12,

when both individual stock market data, firm level financial data, and market-wide pervasive risk

factors data are all available.6 We collect individual stock and firm level data and the market level

risk factor data from several sources.


Individual Stock Market Data We obtain monthly and daily stock returns (RET), number

of shares outstanding (SHROUT), and exchange codes (EXCHCD) for all available publicly traded

common stocks (with share codes 10 and 11) from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP)

for the period 1967:01 to 2018:12. We require that a stock has a valid share prices number of shares

outstanding with at least 3-year price history. For delisted stocks, we use delisting return (DLRET)

as the last month return and we adjust the missing delisting returns following the procedure in

Shumway (1997) and Bali et al. (2016). We collect the monthly value-weighted (VWRETD) and
    6
      The CRSP/Compustat Merged Fundamentals Annual data is available from 1950:01. Fama-French 5-factor data
is available from 1964:01. As suggested by Banz and Breen (1986), it is common practice in the literature to omit the
first few years of accounting data from COMPUSTAT, since they are likely to be backfilled. The Q-factor data for
HXZQ-model is available from 1967:01.

equal-weighted (EWRETD) aggregate market portfolio return from CRSP. We use PERMNO as

the unique identifier for individual stocks.


Firm Level Financial Statements Data               The annual firm level financial data are from the

CRSP-COMPUSTAT merged database from 1967 to 2018. The firm level financial data are matched

with stock data by using the PERMNO-PERMCO link table. We use the SIC codes in CRSP as

industry identifiers, and for firms with missing SIC codes in CRSP we use the ones from COMPU-

STAT. We assign firms to one of the Fama-French 12 industries based on SIC codes. We refer the

reader to the French Data Library available on Professor French's website for the map between SIC

codes and industries.


Market Wide Factors Data            Monthly returns data for the Fama-French 12 Industry portfolios

(FF12) and benchmark market wide factors, i.e. one-month treasury-bill rate (RF), Fama-French

3-factosr (MktRF, SMB and HML), Cachart momentum factor (UMD), and the two additional

factors in the Fama-French 5-factor model (RMW and CMA) are downloaded from the French

Data Library available on the website.7 Monthly returns data on the Quality-minus-Junk (QMJ)

factor andthe Betting Against Beta (BAB) factor for the US market are collected from the AQR

website.8 We thank Lu Zhang for providing us the up-to-date monthly data for the Q-factor model

in Hou et al. (2019).


2.2      Methodology

Industry Classification        In order to compare firms' performance in stressful time with their peers

in the same industry, we need to first specify the industries. Among various available industry

classifications, we use the widely accepted Fama-French industry classifications based on firms'

                                                    7
Standard Industry Classification codes (SIC). In the Fama-French online data library, firms are

grouped into from 5 to 49 industries. Since our purpose is to compare firms' performance in

stressful time with their peers in the same industry, we need the industry classification to be

sufficiently granular for defining peer groups of firms with sufficient precision, and at the same time

sufficiently coarse so that there are enough number of firms within each industries. Given this

tradeoff, we decided on the Fama-French-12 industry categories (FF12) as our benchmark industry

groups. The Fama-French-12 industry groups are: Consumer NonDurables (NoDur), Consumer

Durables (Durbl), Manufacturing (Manuf), Oil, Gas, and Coal Extraction and Products (Enrgy),

Chemicals and Allied Products (Chems), Business Equipment (BusEq), Telephone and Television

Transmission (Telcm), Utilities (Utils), Wholesale, Retail, and Some Services (Shops), Healthcare,

Medical Equipment (Hlth), Finance (Money), and Others (Other). The Fama-French 12 industry

categories are based on SIC codes which are available from both COMPUSTAT fundamental file

and CRSP security file on WRDS. It is well-known that in some firms their SIC codes in CRSP and

COMPUSTAT may be different.9

      Table 1 lists the number of firms in each of the Fama and French 12 industries based on SIC

codes from COMPUSTAT and SIC codes from CRSP for 2018, along with the number of firms that

have the same classification in both COMPUSTAT and CRSP. Among all 3604 firms, 72.56% have

consistent industry classification based on SIC codes from COMPUSTAT and CRSP. In fact, except

for the residual group `Other', the industry classification based on CRSP SIC codes is generally

consistent with that based on COMPUSTAT SIC codes across all industry groups. One of the

reasons for the inconsistency in `Other' group is the COMPUSTAT and CRSP allocate different SIC

code to conglomerates. For example, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is classified as `Financial'

industry according to SIC code from CRSP (6371) while the SIC code from COMPUSTAT is 9997

(conglomerate), which falls into `Other' industry, though Berkshire Hathaway is widely considered

as a financial company. In order to avoid this inconsistency, we rely on SIC codes from CRSP for the

industry classification and our empirical results are robust to use SIC codes from COMPUSTAT.

Stressful Times We define stressful time for an industry as that time interval among successive

time intervals within a given time period during which the industry stock index portfolio has the

worst return. For operational convenience we define a time period as a calendar year and the

time interval as a month. Therefore, there is one stressful month within each calendar year. More

generally, stressful times occur regularly once within each successive time period. Note that the

stressful times are different from `crashes', like the ones that occurred during the Dotcom period,

the financial crisis, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike stressful times, crashes are rare

and happen infrequently.

       While there is one worst (stressful) month in each calendar year, the length of time between

two successive worst months are random. The top panel in 1 plots the monthly return of the

equal-weighted market portfolio of all stocks in the CRSP database (EWRET on CRSP10 ) from

1967:01 to 2018:12, where the red circles represent the worst month in each year and the grey shades
  10
    We use the equal-weighted portfolio rather than the value-weighted portfolio to avoid the performance of the
portfolio being being driven by a few big firms.

highlight the NBER recessionary time periods. The middle panel in Figure 1 plots the number of

days between the worst (stressful) months in two successive calendar years for the equal-weighted

market portfolio of all stocks in the CRSP database during 1967:01 to 2018:12. The lower panel in

Figure 1 gives the average number of days between two consecutive worst months for the 12 industry

stock industry portfolios. As can be seen, successive worst months are reasonably well separated in

time, with an average gap of around 200 days, although the gap tends to shrink during recessions.


Stressful Time Relative Performance         We proceed to introduce our method for ranking firms

according to their relative performance over stressful times. For each industry group, at the end

of each calendar year, we identify the month with the worst return on the corresponding industry

stock index portfolio. We then sort stocks within each industry into two groups ­ Big and Small

­ based on their market capitalization (mcap) in the worst month for that industry. We use the



                                                10
median market capitalization for stocks listed in the NYSE as the break point. To avoid using newly

listed or short-lived stocks, we require stocks to have at least 3-year price history at the time of

classification. Within each size group, we sort stocks by their worst month return. Stocks in the top

quintile (20%) are labeled Stressful time Stable (SS) and stocks in the bottom quintile are labeled

Stressful time Vulnerable (SV). We repeat the procedure each year and filter out stocks that moved

from the top (bottom) quintile in the previous year to the bottom (top) quintile in the current year.

   Our method is different from the momentum strategy in many aspects. Unlike relative price

momentum strategies that rank stocks based on their returns over a given period of time in the

past, we rank stocks based on their returns during the worst month, i.e., our focus is on tail risk.

Further stable and vulnerable firms are identified within each industry separately. That said, we

can readily modify our approach and broaden the peer group of a firm to all stocks, and define the

worst month based on the return on the equal-weighted portfolio of all stocks. Since market-wide

worst performance in a year is often driven by a few industries, the market-wide Stressful time

Stable and Vulnerable portfolios will be less diversified across industries.

   Figure 2 compares the market shares for each industry for the stressful time stable and stressful

time vulnerable groups together with that for the market on average, formed with and without

industry control in 2008. We note that during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, with industry control

the percentage of financial firms in the stressful time vulnerable portfolio is slightly higher than

that for the market average. However, without industry control, the majority of the worst month

losers in 2008 consists of financial firms.

   In addition, we control for size within each industry in the ranking procedure to minimize size

bias since big firms are normally more resistant to market downturns than small firms. Figure 3

compares the relative market capitalization of firms in stressful time stable and vulnerable portfolios

from 1967 to 2018. We calculate the relative market capitalization for each portfolio as a percentage

of the total market capitalization in a given year. As can be seen, there are more big firms in the

stressful time stable portfolio, with an average market capitalization of around 20% of the total

market. The average market capitalization of stressful time vulnerable firms is around 10% of the

total market capitalization. Nevertheless, the relative market capitalization for stressful stable and

vulnerable portfolios are comparable in the sense that neither of them are dominated by small firms.

3         A Return Based Measure of Firm Quality

In this section, we demonstrate that firms that perform better relative to their peers during stressful

time continue to do so in the future. They have stronger and better financial statements based

quality measures. Further they are less risky based on conventional measures of risk.


3.1         Persistence of Stressful Time Relative Performance

As documented in the literature, firm quality is persistent.11 If stressful time relative performance

is sufficient to separate high and low quality firms, stressful time stable firms should continue to

outperform their stressful time vulnerable firms in the future as well. To examine the persistence

of the stressful time relative performance, we therefore compare the performance of the past-year

SS and SV firms in worst month of the following year.

                   Notes : Table reports the average monthly returns for past-year stressful time stable (SS,
                   RSS ) and vulnerable (SV, RSV ) portfolios in next year's worst month, respectively. RInd
                   and RMkt are the corresponding equal-weighted industry and market portfolio monthly
                   returns. RSMV = RSS - RSV represents the monthly return spread of the RSS and RSV .
                   The last column reports the t-statistics for H0 : E[RSMV ] = 0. The sample period is
                   1967 to 2018.

year. As a benchmark, we also report the average worst month returns for the equal-weighted

industry portfolio along with that from the equal-weighted aggregated market index. In the last

two columns, we calculate the equal-weighted average return spread between the past-year SS and

SV and the t-statistics (E[RSM V ] is different from zero). Across all industries, the past-year SS loses

less in the next-year worst month compare to the industry average while the SV performs worse

than the industry average as well as the aggregated market portfolio. The average return spread

between the past-year SS and SV is around 3.5% and is significantly different from zero across

time. The positively significant SS-SV return spread suggests that the past-year SS maintains the

outperformance over SV in the next-year worst month.

   We further examine the persistence of the worst month return spread between SS and SV for

longer horizon. In particularly, we calculate the worst month return spread between SS and SV over

a 10-year lead-lag period, i.e. 5-year before and 5-year after the identification year. The hard-lines

in Figure 4 plot the return spread (upper panel) and the corresponding t-statistics (lower panel).

Not surprisingly, the return spread is largest at the identification year, with the highest t-statistic.

                                                   14
The return-spread drops significantly immediate after the identification year. Since we rely on the

past-two year Stressful Time Stable and loser identifications to filter out any conflict assignments,

the return-spreads are slightly higher. Other than that, the lead-lag worst month return spread

between the winner and loser is around 3.5% (with a t-statistics around 5) and significantly positive

before and after the identification year in a 10-year horizon .

   Finally, Table 3 reports the empirical transition probability matrix for the stressful time relative

ranking from 1967 to 2018 across all industry group. Firms are grouped into five categories at the

end of each year based on their relative performance in the worst month within each industry, where

vulnerable and stable represent the bottom and top quintile (20%), respectively. As it shows, the

stressful time relative performance states are relatively stable, where the transition probability for

vulnerable state is around 50% and that for the stable state is around 48%.


3.2     Characteristics of Stressful Time Stable and Vulnerable Firms

In this subsection, we compare various firm level quality related characteristics for firms in SS and

SV categories. Given that there is no universally agreed upon definition of quality, we focus on

some of balance sheet, profitability, and risk measures of quality that have been widely used in the

literature.

   Following Novy-Marx (2013), Fama and French (2015), and Hou et al. (2015), we consider gross

profitability (GPOA), operating profitability (OP), and return-on-equity (ROE) as profitability

                                                          15
indicators and total asset growth (IV) as the investment measure. In terms of safety, we rely on

the Ohlson O-score as a measure of default risk. Furthermore, we use the Piotroski F-score as our

aggregated quality score measure. Finally, we consider several market return based risk measures,

including including systematic risk (proxied by market beta), idiosyncratic volatility (based on the

residuals from Fama-French 3-factor model), and higher order co-moments (e.g. co-skewness and

co-kurtosis).12

       At the end of each year, we calculate the financial statements based characteristics for each firm

in SS and SV with one-year lagged annual financial data from COMPUSTAT. The market based

risk measures are estimated from daily returns over the past one year. In the following analysis, for

each measure, we report the cross-sectional average estimates for all firms in SS and SV categories,

together with the average from the market13 .


Profitability and Investment               Figure 5 plots the time-series of the average profitability and

investment ratios for SS firms (blue hard-line) and SV firms (red hard-line), together with the

market-wide average (black dashed-line). Firms in SS have higher gross profits, operating prof-

itability and return-to-equity ratios than the market average while the firms in SV underperform

the market average. The spreads between the profitability ratios of SS and SV are non-trivial and

persistent over the whole sample period, indicating firms in SS are consistently more profitable

than those in SV. However, the patterns for investment is less significant. Indeed, for most of the

time, firms in SS have a lower total asset growth rate than those in SV, however, the spread is

relatively small and the firms in SS occasionally have a higher investment ratio than those in SV.

One explanation is that growth rate of total asset is a very noisy measure of investment, as the

change of total asset can be affected by several activities, such as mergers and acquisitions, which

      The details of definitions and formulas for the fundamental based quality related characteristics and market based
risk measures are provided in Appendix 8.1 and 8.2.
   13
      We report the cross-sectional average for each ratio rather than the value-weighted aggregated ratio as our purpose
here is to compare the firm level characteristics rather than portfolio level.

Safety       Altman Z-score and Ohlson O-score are among the commonly used indicators of default

(credit) risk in empirical accounting literature. The Altman Z-score was first proposed to measure

the financial health for manufacturing firms based on 66 companies. We use the Ohlson O-score

which is considered more suitable for firms in different industries and over the periods of time in

our study.14 As can be seen from Figure 6, except at the beginning of the sample, firms in SS group

display a consistent lower default risk than the market average and those in SV. Overtime, the

average default probability for the market is around 33%, while that for SS and SV is around 25%

and 45% separately. The spread between SS and SV is remarkable wider during the crisis periods,
  14
     Begley et al. (1996) find the Ohlson's O-score displays overall stronger and more consistent performance and is
a preferred model as an indicator of financial distress comparing with Altman Z-score. Grice and Ingram (2001) find
Altman's original model is not as useful for predicting bankruptcy in recent periods as it was for periods when it was
developed and the model is bias for predicting bankruptcy of non-manufacturing firms.

e.g. late 1980s, early 2000s, and 2008-09. In particular, during the most recent volatile periods (at

the end of 2018), the average default probability for firms in SV is more than 80% while that for

firms in SS is only 20%.

Aggregate Quality Score                 We use the intuitive and widely used Piotroski F-score proposed by

Piotroski (2000). The F-score is an aggregate measure of a firm's quality obtained by summing nine

binary scores, including profitability, efficiency, safety, and growth. The aggregate Piotroski F-score

ranges from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the lowest quality ranking and 9 is the highest. In Figure 7,

we plot the time-series of the percentage of firms with a Piotroski F-score lower than 3 (low quality)

and higher than 6 (high quality) in SS and SV separately.15 As a benchmark, we also reports

the percentage of `low quality' and `high quality' firms in the whole market (black dashed-line).

Throughout the whole sample period, SS category has a higher percentage of high quality firms

(around 45% on average) than the SV category (around 25% on average) and the market (around

35% on average). Similarly, the SV category has a much higher percentage of firms with a Piotroski

F-score less than 3 (around 30% on average) than the SS category (around 15% on average) and

the market benchmark (around 20%).
  15
    Due to low data availability in earlier time periods in our sample, the time-series for the Piotroski F-score is from
1985 to 2018.

Return based Risk Measures                  Figure 8 presents the time-series of various return based risk

measures for firms in SS and SV separately. The average market beta for firms in SS is almost

always below one through the entire sample, while that of firms in SV is mostly higher than 1,

indicating firms in SS have lower systematic risk exposures than those in SV.16 Moreover, firms in

SV also have higher idiosyncratic volatility (based on the Fama-French 3-factor model) than those in

SS and the spread is non-trivial and consistent across time. Turning to the higher-order co-moment

risk measures, the average co-skewness of SV firms is more negative than SS firms, suggesting that

firms in SV are more sensitive to market downside risk. Similarly, SV firms also exhibit higher

co-kurtosis.
  16
     While SS firms have lower betas than SV firms on average, SS firms have higher quality scores on average as well.
In contrast, as we show later, high beta and low beta firms have about the same financial statements based quality
scores.

Persistence     So far, we have demonstrated that at the time of identification, firms in SS are of

high quality while those in SV are of low quality. As observed by Novy-Marx (2018), quality is

highly persistent, in other words, higher quality firms will continue to be of higher quality in the

future. Figure 9 plots the quality measures for SS and SV one year after they have been classified

as SS or SV. It can be seen that firms in SS continue to show higher profitability, lower default

risk, and high aggregated quality score, while those in SV continue to have worse measures than the

market average. These persistent patterns confirm that relative performance during stressful times

is a valid measure of firm quality. By sorting stocks based on their returns in the worst month, we

are able to separate stocks of higher quality without directly observing any of the various quality

related characteristics.

   To summarize, we find that sorting on stressful time relative performance identifies firms' quality

along various dimensions. Stressful time stable firms have higher aggregate quality scores, are more

profitability and more conservative in their investments, and have lower default risk. Moreover,

stressful time stable firms have lower exposure to systematic and idiosyncratic risks and are affected

less by extreme market movements.



4    Stressful Time Performance, Momentum, and Beta

The natural questions that arise are whether the higher quality SS firms we identify are the same

as past winners with positive momentum, or low historical beta firms with low systematic risk

exposures. To answer this question, in this section we consider two alternative sorting strategies:

(1) momentum based sorting: identify winners/losers based on past returns; (2) market beta based

sorting: identify high/low risk firms based on historical betas. We then focus on comparing the

stressful time performance and fundamental based quality measures between the alternative sorting



                                                                       21
portfolios and the ones identified based on stressful time relative performance.


4.1   Momentum and Beta Sorted Portfolios

At the end of each year, we calculate the following four characteristics for each firm:


 A.1 Past-year holding return: the cumulative monthly return over past 12 months;


 A.2 Past-year cumulative return excluding the worst month return;


 A.3 Market beta from past 3-year monthly data;


 A.4 Market downside beta from past 3-year monthly data;


The market beta  and downside beta  - are calculated following Bawa and Lindenberg (1977)

and Ang et al. (2006),

            cov(ri , rm )         -     cov(ri , rm |rm < µm )
      i =                 ,   and i =                          ,
             var(rm )                    var(rm |rm < µm )

where ri (rm ) represents the stock i's (the market's) excess return and µm is the average market

excess return.

   To be consistent with the stressful time relative performance ranking procedure in Section 2.2, we

control for both industry and size in forming the alternative momentum and beta sorted portfolios.

We require firms have at least three-year stock price history. At the end of each year, calculate the

four characteristics A.1 - A.4 for each firm. For each industry group, we first sort stocks into big

and small by their market capitalization and use the median market capitalization of NYSE stocks

as break-point. Within each size group, we then sort stocks into five quintiles (from low to high)

based on one of the characteristics A.1 - A.4. Table 4 summarizes how the four characteristic sorted

portfolios are formed.

   These four alternative return-based sorting characteristics are based on their wide use in the

empirical asset pricing literature. Procedure A.1 replicates the momentum portfolio construction

method in Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) with industry and size control. By excluding the worst

month return in calculating the past-year cumulative return, Procedure A.2 allows us to explicitly

investigate the role of the worst month return in momentum sorted portfolios. Procedure A.3 is

based on the "betting-against-beta" investing strategy in Frazzini and Pedersen (2014) and Asness

et al. (2014). Finally, Procedure A.4 follows Ang et al. (2006).


4.2     Stressful Time Performance Comparison

We first compare the stressful time performance of the four alternative return-based portfolios with

the stressful time portfolios with a lead-lag analysis as in 3.1. Figure 10 plots the average worst

month return spreads (upper) and the corresponding Newey-West t-statistics (lower) between Q5

and Q1 from the stressful time and A.1 to A.4 ranking in a 10-year lead-lag window. First, it

can be seen clearly that the average worst month return spread for the stressful time stable-minus-

vulnerable (SMV) is the most significant and consistent. The average worst month return spreads

for both momentum-based sorting strategies are barely significant over the 10-year lead-lag period.

This further confirms that stressful time relative performance contains different information than

past performance. Turning to the beta-based sorting strategies, the average worst month return

spreads for both market beta and market downside beta are significantly positive and comparable

to SMV at both leads and lags. This suggests that stressful time relative performance captures the

tail risk relevant information in firms' betas and downside betas.

4.3   Quality Measures Comparison

In this subsection we compare the various financial statements based quality measures of the top and

bottom quintile firms in the four alternative ranking procedures with those of SS and SV firms. For

each quality characteristics, we plot the time-series of sample average of the top (Q5) and bottom

(Q1) groups, along with the average of the whole market. The summary statistics for the spread

between the top and bottom quintiles (Q5 - Q1) for each of the characteristics are reported. In

order to test whether the separation between Q5 and Q1 from stressful time relative performance

ranking is stronger than the alternative sorting procedures, we report the difference between Q5

- Q1 from stressful time relative performance ranking procedures and the alternative ones in row

`SMV - X', along with the associated t-statistics.


Profitability         Figure 11 and Table 5 compare the measures of profitability of the four alternative

ranking strategies with those based on stressful time relative performance. In general, all of the



                                                                24
four alternative ranking strategies are able to separate profitable and unprofitable firms, though

with occasionally crossing. Across all three profitability measures, the momentum-based portfolios

show better separations between profitable and unprofitable firms than the beta-based strategies.

Beta-based portfolios provide weaker separation of high and low profitability firms when compared

to sorts based on stressful time performance. Surprisingly, the difference between Q5 - Q1 spreads

from portfolios sorted by past-year holding returns (momentum) are not significantly different from

the ones from stressful time relative performance. However, after taking out the `worst month',

stressful time relative performance does show stronger separations, which suggests it is the worst

month that help to separate more profitable firms from less profitable ones.

Investment            Figure 12 and Table 6 compares the total asset growth ratio between Q5 and Q1

from different ranking procedures. Since high quality firms tend to have lower investment ratio,

the Q5 - Q1 spread should be negative. In contrast to profitability measures, momentum and

market (downside) beta based ranking procedures result stronger separations of investment than

the stressful time relative performance strategies.

rate higher quality firms from lower quality firms better than sorting based on past returns, market

beta, and market downside beta.



5    Portfolios Based on Stressful Time Performance

Folk wisdom is that investing in higher quality stocks leads to long run higher returns and lower

risk. Asness et al. (2019) finds that higher quality portfolios higher risk adjusted returns. Therefore,

if stressful time performance does indeed separate high quality and low quality firms, then it would

be reasonable to expect managed portfolios SS firms firms to load positively on market wide quality

related factors used in the literature, and have similar risk adjusted returns. On the other hand,

SV firms should earn lower risk adjusted returns and load negatively on quality related factors.

    At the beginning of each year, we form value-weighted portfolio of SS (SV) firms where firms

were assigned to SS (SV) category in the previous year as described in in Section 2.2. The portfolios



                                                                       29
are rebalanced slightly each month so that they remain value weighted. For each industry, we have

four value-weighted portfolios: big stressful time stable (BSS), small stressful time stable (SSS),

big stressful time vulnerable (BSV), and small stressful time vulnerable (SSV). We calculate the

monthly return for each group by averaging across all industry, i.e., our SS and SV portfolios are

obtained by equally weighting the corresponding small and large industry portfolios.

      We first examine the monthly returns in excess of the risk free rate            17   for SS and SV portfolios.

Table 9 provides the summary statistics for the monthly excess returns for SS and SV portfolios

against the aggregate stock market (MktRF from Fama-French data library). As expected, the SS

portfolio consistently earns higher excess return than the market while the SV portfolio underper-

form the market portfolio. As shown in Table 9, SS earns a much higher average excess returns

than the market portfolio (0.73% versus 0.52% per month) with the same risk exposure (almost the

same standard deviation of 4.48). In contrast, portfolio based on SV has the same average excess

return as the market portfolio but with a much higher standard deviation (6.31 versus 4.48). The

annualized Sharpe ratio for the market portfolio is 0.42, while that of the SS and SV portfolios are

0.55 and 0.31 respectively.

5.1      Risk-adjusted Returns

Next we examine the risk-adjusted returns of the SS and SV portfolios. We start with the traditional

CAPM with market factor (Mkt), Fama-French 3-factor (FF3) model with size (SMB) and value
 17
      We use the Rf from Fama and French Data Library for the risk free rate.

(HML) factors, and the Fama-French-Carhart 4-factor (FFC4) with momentum factor (MOM). We

then consider the more recent factor models that have quality related factors ­ the Fama-French

5-factor model by Fama and French (2015), the HXZQ-factor model by citehou2015digesting, and

the FF3Q model in Asness et al. (2019).

       Notes : Table reports the time-series regression results for the monthly return of the stressful time
       stable portfolio (SS) over the sample period from 1967 to 2018. The associate t-statistics are in
       parenthesis.



   We report the alphas for each of the factor models based on time-series regression of the monthly

excess returns on the SS and SV portfolios on the risk factors in Table 10. The SS portfolio has

a significant monthly CAPM alpha of 0.24% per month with the market beta of 0.94. The alpha

drops to 0.15% per month when the FF3 model is used for risk adjustment, but remains significant.

Since there are more small firms in general, SS loads positively on SMB. By construction, SS also

loads positively on the momentum factor MOM. However, the MOM coefficient is only 0.05 and

the FFC4 alpha of 0.10% per month is significant. As expected, SS loads positively on quality

factors. In particular, SS loads heavily on the investment factor (CMA) with a coefficient 0.17 and

the profitability factor (RMW) with a coefficient 0.25 per month. The FF5 alpha is almost zero

(0.02% per month) and insignificant (t-statistics = 0.56). Similarly, SS loads significantly on the

is insignificant.18 In FF3Q, we augment the FF3 model with the aggregate quality factor, QMJ,

in Asness et al. (2019). SS portfolio has a coefficient of 0.24 for QMJ which is highly significant

with an associated t-statistic of 9.72. The loadings for Mkt, SMB and HML are almost the same

as the corresponding loadings in the FF3 model. Not surprisingly, the FF3Q alpha is not much

different from zero. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that the SS portfolio will

have a positive alpha unless quality related factors are included in the factor models.

       Table 11 presents the results for the monthly excess returns on the SV portfolio. The SV portfolio

has a monthly negative CAPM alpha, that is not significantly different from zero, and a FF3 model

alpha that is significantly negative, -0.29% per month. As the portion of small firms in SV is even

higher than that in SS, the SMB coefficients are positively significant and much larger than those

for the SS portfolio. Not surprisingly, SV loads heavily on momentum factor with a significantly

    Notice that the loadings on investment factor in HXZQ is higher than that in FF5 as HXZQ drops the value factor
(HML), which may be redundant. This is in consistent with the findings in Fama and French (2015), that with the
addition of the two quality related factors, profitability and investment, the value factor (HML) becomes redundant.

negative coefficient of -0.23. The FFC4 alpha, though negative is not significant. Note that SV has

significantly positive loadings on investment and significantly negative loadings on profitability in

HXZQ-model, and a significantly negative loading on the quality factor (QMJ). All these findings

are consistent with what we would expect, given our view that SV is a portfolio of low quality

stocks. Next we proceed to examine the risk-adjusted abnormal returns on the long-short SMV

portfolio. In addition to the risk factor models in Tables 10 and 11, we also consider the FF3 model

augmented with the betting-against-beta factor (BAB), i.e., the FF3B model.

       t-statistics are in parenthesis.



   Table 12 reports the time-series regression results. The SMV portfolio earns significantly positive

abnormal returns with the traditional risk-adjusted factor models, e.g. CAPM, FF3, and FFC4. As

expected, SMV has significantly negative coefficients on the market, size, and value factors. Further,

SMV loads positively on the quality factors, RMW and CMA in FF5 and IA and ROE in HXZQ and

QMJ in FF3Q. While the FF5 alpha is significant, the HXZQ and FF3Q alphas are insignifantly

differentfrom zero, indicating that the quality premium in SMV is due to exposure to the quality

factors IA, ROE, and QMJ. Also note that the loading on HML becomes insignificant, suggesting

HML becomes redundant after controlling for QMJ. Finally, while the SMV loads positively on the

betting-against-beta factor (BAB), the FF3B factor model alpha is positive and significant.

   To summarize, we find that the portfolio of firms that perform better in stressful times relative

to peers (SS) earns positive risk adjusted abnormal returns on average when risk adjustment is

done using traditional factor models. The portfolio of stressful times poor performing firms (SV)

has a negative alpha when conventional factor models are used for risk adjustment. However, there

is no abnormal risk adjusted returns when traditional factor models are augmented with quality

related factors identified in the literature. This is what one should expect if stressful time relative

performance is a measure of firm quality.

5.2      Tail Risk Exposure

In this subsection we compare the tail risk in the SMV portfolio return, which can be viewed as a

'quality factor' with the tail risk in the various market wide risk factors and quality related factors

in the literature.

   For that purpose, we use the worst month in a given year for the value-weighted market portfolio

(MktRF) and compare the returns on the factor portfolios in the various factor models we examined

Section 5.1, and the return on the SMV portfolio. Table 14 reports the correlation of worst month

returns of SMV with other risk factors. Note that SMV is signficantly positively correlated with the

quality factors ­ 0.68 with QMJ, 0.60 with ROE, and 0.59 with RMW ­ as we expected. However,

the correlations with size (SMB), momentum (MOM) and betting-against-beta (BAB) factors are

lower.

  Notes : Table reports the correlations of the monthly returns between the stressful time stable minus vulnerable
  portfolio (SMV) and the other risk factors over the sample period from 1967 to 2018.



   The summary statistics for SMV and various risk factors are reported in Table 15. On average,

SS loses less than the market portfolio during the worst months while SV has a much fatter left tail,

with the 2.5% quantile be -26.86%. Turning to the risk factor mimicking portfolios, SMB, MOM,

and BAB are among the ones with the lowest worst month returns and fatter left tails. The average

worst month return for SMB is even -1.62% per month, indicating small firms perform poorly over

stressful time. The quality factors are more robust over the worst months, among which QMJ has

the highest average return of 2.41% with the standard deviation being 2.97. However, SMV beats

QMJ with a higher average return of 2.67% and a smaller standard deviation of 2.53. The SMV

portfolio performs better than QMJ in all inter-quantiles.

       Notes : Table reports the summary statistics for the monthly returns of the stressful time stable
       (SS), vulnerable (SV), stable minus vulnerable portfolios, and other risk factors in the annual worst
       month of the market. The sample period is from 1967 to 2018.



    Figure 15 plots the distribution densities of the worst month returns for each risk factor mim-

icking portfolio (black hard line) against that of the long-short worst month portfolio SMV (black

dashed line). Across all pairs, SMV has a more concentrated distribution with a thinner left tail,

suggesting the SMV has lower exposure to tail risk relative to the profitability and quality factors.

Consistent with the evidence in the summary statistics table, SMB, MOM, and BAB exhibit fatter

left tails. The quality based factors are less left skewed in general, indicating quality stocks are

more robust to downside risk.

  together with the industry average. The stocks in SS and SV are identified based on the worst month return in
  2019.

   Table 16 compares the value and equal weighted monthly returns for the stressful time vulnerable

(SV), stable firms (SS), and the long Stable and short Vulnerable (SMV) portfolio, for each of the

industry groups during March 2020. The corresponding monthly returns for the Fama-French 12

Industry Portfolios are used as a benchmark (column Industry). As can be seen, on the one hand, for

both value- and equal-weighted portfolios, the stressful time vulnerable firms suffer larger losses than

the corresponding industry benchmarks. In contrast, stressful time stable firms maintain perform

better than the corresponding vulnerable firms in their industry, as well as the industry benchmarks.

As a results, the long-short SMV portfolio earned a positive return across most industry groups

during March 2020. There are three exceptions in the case of value-weighted portfolios: Business

Equipment, Utility, and Health, where the vulnerable firms slightly outperform the stable firms.

For the equal-weighted portfolios, the only exception is the Utility industry. Overall, on average,

the value weighted and the equally weighted industry SMV portfolios earned large positive monthly

returns of 9.86% and 10.11%, respectively.

     Notes : Table reports the monthly returns for the market , the value and equal weighted stressful time

   We proceed to compare the performance of SMV with the other long-short hedged risk factor

mimicking portfolios in 2020 March in Table 17. As can be seen, the traditional Size and Value

factors (SMB and HML) had large losses, which suggests small firms and value firms were more

vulnerable than large and growth firms during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Momentum (UMD) and

                                                      38
Quality-minus-junk (QMJ) generate significant positive returns, comparable to SMV. Interestingly,

betting-against-beta (BAB) portfolio lost heavily during the pandemic, confirming our earlier ob-

servation that while both SMV and BAB have lower market betas, they behave differently during

stressful times. Finally, the Fama-French profitability (RMW) and investment (CMA) factors re-

turns during the pandemic were not much different from zero.



7    Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a return-based method to identify high quality stocks. Our method is

based on the street wisdom that quality shines under stress, i.e., higher quality firms perform better

than other firm during stressful times. At the end of each calendar year, we identify stressful time

stable (SS) and vulnerable (SV) firms by sorting firms in each industry group based on the month

with the worst return for their industry. Even though we did not use any other information than

returns, we find that SS firms are of higher quality as indicated by their higher profitability, more

conservative investment policy, higher Piotroski F-Score, lower credit risk, lower market beta, and

lower idiosyncratic volatility, than SV firms.

    We construct managed portfolios of stressful time stable firms (SS) and vulnerable firms (SV)

and examine their correlations with quality related market wide risk factors studied in the literature,

their risk adjusted returns, and their tail risk. The SS loads positively while SV loads negatively

on the quality factors and the long SS and short SV portfolio has properties similar to the `quality-

minus-junk' factor (QMJ). The long SS and short SV portfolio (SMV) has a significantly positive

risk adjusted return(alpha) when risk adjustment is made using the standard CAPM, Fama and

French three factor model (FF3), and the FF3 augmented by the momentum factor. When alpha

becomes insignificant when FF3 is augmented with quality related QMJ factor. The alpha is also

insignificant with the Chen and Zhang (2010) model that has two quality related factors. These


                                                  39
findings are consistent with the those in the literature documenting a quality premium in stock

returns.

   Finally, we update the analysis with data of the first 5 months in 2020, when the global market

were hit by the COVID-19 Pandemic. We compare the performance of 2019 stressful time vulnerable

(SV) and stable (SS) stocks in each industry during March 2020, the worst of the first 5 months

in 2020. Similar to the quality-minus-junk and the momentum factor portfolios, the stressful time

hedged portfolio (SMV) earned a significant positive return. In contrast the Size, Value, and

betting-against-beta portfolios suffered large losses. We conclude that the stressful time vulnerable

and stable firms identified by the methodology we propose in this paper is robust, and provides a

return based alternative measure of firm quality.

8.1    Fundamental Based Quality Measures

At the end of each year, we calculate the fundamental based quality measures for each firm with

one-year lagged financial data from annual fundamental file on COMPUSTAT.


Profitability and Investment Measures             We calculate the profitability and investment mea-

sures in Novy-Marx (2013), Fama and French (2015), and Hou et al. (2015) by:


    1. Gross profits (revenue less cost of goos sold) over total assets:


                       (REVT - COGS)
             GPOA =                                                                              (1)
                            AT


    2. Operating Profitability to Equity:

             OP =                              .                                                 (2)
                                BE


       where the book equity (BE) is calculated by:


             BE = SEQ + TXDB + ITCB - BVPS, BVPS = {PSTKRV, PSTKL, PSTK}.


    3. Return on book equity:

             ROE =       .                                                                       (3)
                      BE


       where IB is income before income before extraordinary items.

Ohlson O-score At the end of each year, we calculate the Ohlson O-score using CPI data with

2009 as base year:


                                        ATadj             (DLC + DLTT)        (ACT - LCT)

where ATadj = AT + 0.1(ME - BE) is the adjusted total assets. The probability of default in 2-year

period is given by the exponential transformation of the Ohlson O-score:

                     exp(O)
      Pdefault =              .                                                                     (6)
                   1 + exp(O)


Piotroski F-score        Piotroski F-score is an aggregated signal measure of firm's quality by summing

nine binary scores:



                     F-score =1ROA>0 + 1CFOA>0 + 1ROA>0 + 1ACC<0 + 1LEV<0                           (7)

As in Piotroski (2000), the 9 binary variables can be grouped into two categories and are defined

as follows:


   1. Profitability Measures:

                            AT

      (c) Leverage (total long-term debt over total assets):

                        DLTT
                LEV =                                                                         (13)

                        LCT

      (e) New issuance (changes in common shares outstanding):


                EQO = CSHO - CSHO-1                                                           (15)


8.2   Market Based Risk Measures

At the end of each year, we calculate the following market-based risk measures for each stock using

daily return data over the past one year:


  1. Market  from CAPM:
