                                            ABSTRACT

Exploiting variation in welfare reform across states and over time and using relevant comparison groups,
this study estimates the effects of welfare reform on an important source of human capital acquisition
among women at risk for relying on welfare: vocational education and training. The results indicate
that welfare reform reduced enrollment in full-time vocational education and had no significant effects
on part-time vocational education or participation in other types of work-related courses, though there
is considerable heterogeneity across states with respect to the strictness of educational policy and the
strength of work incentives under welfare reform. In addition, we find heterogeneous effects by prior
educational attainment. We find no evidence that the previously-observed negative effects of welfare
reform on formal education (including college enrollment), which we replicated in this study, have
been offset by increases in vocational education and training.

Introduction

       A major goal of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act

(PRWORA) of 1996 was to move recipients off of cash assistance and into the labor force. The

legislation imposes time limits on welfare receipt, expands work requirements for recipients, and

allows states to impose stricter sanctions for non-compliance with work requirements and other

rules. PRWORA’s “work first” approach de-emphasizes education and training, representing a

departure from previous approaches that encouraged human capital formation as a strategy for

achieving self-sufficiency. Although minor mothers are required to attend high school or training

in order to receive welfare and are not subject to time limits or work requirements if they are

full-time students, PRWORA sharply restricts the extent to which adult recipients can count

education and training as required work activities.

       Few studies have investigated the effects of welfare reform on educational acquisition of

adult women even though the vast majority of mothers on welfare are adults, education and

training activities are common among adults beyond traditional ages for schooling, and

PRWORA de-emphasized education for this group. Previous research using a quasi-experimental

design has found that welfare reform decreased the probability of both high school and college

enrollment among adult women. No previous research has investigated the effects of welfare

reform on vocational education and training, defined broadly as educational training that

provides practical experience in a particular occupational field, despite the importance of this

type of education for women likely to be on welfare. In 1995, 23% of unmarried mothers in the

U.S. age 25-54 with less than a college education participated in non-college work-related

courses (authors’ own calculations from the dataset used for this study).

       Using the National Household Education Survey Adult Education Supplement from



                                                                                                   2
multiple years before and after welfare reform, we exploit variation in welfare policy across

states and over time and use relevant comparison groups to estimate effects of welfare reform on

vocational education and training of adult women who are at risk for relying on welfare—those

who are unmarried, have low education, and have dependent children. Limitations in counting

education and training as authorized work activities may increase the cost of engaging in those

activities for adult mothers on welfare and thereby decrease their participation in any educational

activities, including vocational education and training. However, if work and education are

complementary (e.g., if welfare reform increases access to vocational education or training

through employers), welfare reform could increase this type of education. Finally, findings from

previous research that welfare reform decreased the probability of college enrollment among

adult women leave open the possibility that women affected by welfare reform substituted

vocational education and training for formal higher education. Thus, the effects of welfare

reform on this important type of human capital acquisition for women at risk for relying on

welfare are an important gap in the welfare reform and education literature.

Background

        The PRWORA legislation of 1996 ended entitlement to welfare benefits under Aid to

Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for

Needy Families (TANF) block grants to states. Among the features of TANF and many pre-

PRWORA state waiver programs,1 which together constitute “welfare reform,” were time limits

on the receipt of welfare benefits, work requirements as a condition of receiving welfare, and



1
  Although welfare reform is often dated to the landmark 1996 PRWORA legislation, reforms actually started taking
place in the early 1990s when the Clinton Administration greatly expanded the use and scope of “welfare waivers”
to allow states to carry out experimental or pilot changes to their AFDC programs, with random assignment required
for evaluation. Waivers were approved in 43 states, ranging from modest demonstration projects to broad-based
statewide changes, and constituted the first phase of welfare reform. Many policies and features of state waivers
were later incorporated into PRWORA.

                                                                                                                3
sanctions for non-compliance with program rules. PRWORA also strengthened child support

enforcement and made it easier for married and cohabiting couples to qualify for welfare

benefits. These sweeping changes ushered in a new “work first” era that de-emphasized

education for adult women. The PRWORA legislation granted considerable discretion to states

in establishing welfare eligibility and program rules. As a result, there is substantial state policy

variation within the broad national regime of time-limited cash assistance for which work is

required.

       In terms of reducing caseloads, welfare reform (including the pre-PRWORA waivers) has

been successful; welfare rolls have declined by over 50% since their peak in 1994 and at least

one-third of the caseload decline can be explained by welfare reform (see Grogger & Karoly

2005). At the same time, employment rates of low-skilled mothers rose dramatically (Ziliak

2006), and at least some of that increase was a result of welfare reform (Schoeni & Blank 2000).

The effects on family structure are less dramatic. A large literature on the effects of welfare

reform on marriage and a smaller one on cohabitation reveal mixed findings, and the literature on

non-marital childbearing and female headship indicates slightly negative but inconsistent effects

of welfare reform (Blank 2002, 2007; Moffitt 1992, 1995, 1998; Grogger & Karoly 2005;

Gennetian & Knox 2003; Peters, Plotnick & Jeong 2003; Ratcliffe et al. 2002).

Welfare reform and education

       Traditionally, mothers on AFDC were not required to work and were allowed to attend

school if they so chose. The situation changed for some mothers under the Job Opportunities and

Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program, which was created under the Family Support Act of 1988

and required states, to the extent resources allowed, to engage mothers with no children below

age 3 in education, work, or training activities. However, many women were exempt from



                                                                                                        4
participation in JOBS, and between 1992 (just prior to the first statewide AFDC waiver program)

and 1996 (enactment of PRWORA) only 10% of all welfare recipients in the U.S. participated in

JOBS programs.2

        Major statewide AFDC waiver programs, first implemented in late 1992, substantially

altered the nature of welfare by imposing time limits, significantly reducing participation

exemptions, imposing sanctions, increasing earnings disregards, imposing family caps, and/or

implementing work requirements. Compared to JOBS programs, statewide waivers were broad-

based in that they applied to large proportions of welfare recipients. While states were required

to provide many specifics of their programs in their waiver plans, they were not required to

report policies vis-à-vis educational activities. Complicating the picture, states could change their

policies without having to amend their waiver plans (U.S. Department of Health and Human

Services 1997). The situation changed notably under TANF, which required states to file detailed

program specifics (including educational policies) at the outset as well as any intended changes

to those policies. That is, under TANF, the extent to which educational activities could count

toward work requirements was more explicit. Because of the reporting issues under the waivers,

it is difficult to compare educational policies under AFDC waivers and TANF, even in a given

state. However, it is clear that under both AFDC waivers and TANF, work and other

requirements gave women less flexibility in deciding how to spend their time and many welfare

recipients could attend school or vocational training only after fulfilling work requirements.

        The PRWORA legislation treats education and training programs very differently

depending on whether the potential recipient is a teen or an adult. The “work first” approach is

targeted to adult mothers, for whom the legislation sharply restricts the extent to which education

and training can count as required work activities. In particular, PRWORA limits the extent to

which education or training can count toward federal work participation requirements, generally

restricting the length of full-time education and training to 12 months and for no more

than 30 percent of TANF participants (Martinson & Strawn 2003). In contrast, minor mothers are

subject to the “human capital” approach, as they are required to attend high school or training

(and to live with their parents or in another approved setting) in order to receive welfare and are

not subject to time limits or work requirements if they are full-time students. Several studies

using quasi-experimental designs have examined the effects of welfare reform on teen drop-out

rates (Hao & Cherlin 2004; Kaestner, Korenman & O’Neill 2003; Offner 2005; Dave, Reichman

and Corman 2008; Koball 2007). Overall, the available evidence suggests that welfare reform

has had favorable effects on high school completion of teenage girls.

       For adult women, the situation vis-à-vis welfare reform and education is very different

than that for teens. By requiring work and imposing restrictions on education and training,

welfare reform increased the costs of engaging in such activities for this group. However, it also

potentially increased the benefits of education and training, since the five-year lifetime limit

created greater incentives for women to become more engaged in the labor market. Thus, it is not

clear a priori whether welfare reform would have been expected to decrease or increase adult

women’s investments in education and training.

       As far as we know, only two previous studies used nationally representative data and

quasi-experimental designs to investigate the effects of welfare reform on adult women’s

educational enrollment and those focused on formal education. The more comprehensive study,

by Dave, Reichman and Corman (2008), used annual data from the October Education



                                                                                                      6
Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1992 to 2001 to estimate the effects of

welfare reform on high school and college enrollment of adult women using a difference-in-

differences methodology. The primary focus was on college enrollment, because the number of

women in the relevant sample attending high school was quite small. The target group for the

analyses of college enrollment was women aged 24-49 who were unmarried, had less than a

college degree, and had minor children in the household, while the comparison group was

women in the same age range and with the same educational levels but who had no children.

They found that welfare reform reduced college enrollment by about 20% The authors also

examined the extent to which college enrollment varied by state TANF education and work

incentive policies and found that the negative effects of welfare reform on college enrollment

were stronger in strict states (those that did not allow post-secondary education to be considered

a valid work-related activity and those with stricter work requirements) than in more lenient

states. Finally, they found that women who worked 20 or more hours per week were far less

likely than those who worked fewer hours to attend college.

       In an earlier study, Jacobs and Winslow (2003) compared the probability of post-

secondary education enrollment at 2 points in time: 1995 and 2000 (using March CPS data) and

1995 and 1999 (using the National Household Education Survey—NHES). The CPS analysis

included information on state policies but restricted the analysis to women age 16 to 24 (thereby

missing many adults who may be affected by welfare reform) and confounding the differential

educational incentives for teens versus adults. The NHES analysis included women of all ages,

but did not include state policy data. In the CPS analysis, they found that single mothers are less

likely to go to college post-welfare reform, holding welfare receipt constant, and that adult

women in states that allow education to count toward work requirements are more likely than



                                                                                                      7
those in stricter states to attend college. In the NHES analysis, they found that single mothers are

more likely to attend college after welfare reform but that welfare receipt negatively affects

enrollment. A shortcoming of this study is that it takes snapshots at 2 points in time and

attributes all changes to PRWORA. Also, using 1995 as the pre-reform comparison would

provide biased estimates because welfare reform was well under way by then (19 states had

already implemented major AFDC waivers).

       Overall, both previous studies found that welfare reform decreased acquisition of post-

secondary education among women at risk for relying on welfare, and that the stricter the

policies, the more negative the effects. Both studies, in their conclusions, discuss the possibility

that other types of human capital acquisition may be more desirable or cost/effective than college

education for women at risk for relying on welfare and that this group may have substituted

vocational education or training for formal education as a response to welfare reform. To date,

no studies have examined this question. Given that the existing literature indicates that welfare

reform has led to decreases in formal education among adult women, the next obvious question

is whether less formal, vocationally-oriented education has also decreased or whether welfare

reform led to a substitution of vocational education for formal education.

Vocational education and training

       Vocational education and training activities are not uncommon among adult women. For

example, 80% of females taking vocational courses in the U.S. in 2006 were age 25 years or

older (U.S. Census Bureau 2008). Figures on vocational education for population subgroups,

such as low-educated unmarried women (i.e., women at risk for relying on welfare) are not

readily available, and presenting some relevant statistics in that regard is one of the contributions

of this study. According to Leigh & Gill (1997), the returns to community college education



                                                                                                       8
(both degree-granting and vocational programs) are about the same for returning adult students

as for traditional-age students. Welfare recipients are more likely to attend two-year rather than

four-year colleges, and those who do so are less likely than non-recipients to graduate (London

2006). However, each year of credit at a community college yields, on average, a 5 to 8%

increase in annual earnings—a return similar to that from one year of a four-year college

(review, Kane & Rouse 1999). Thus, it appears that there are positive returns to vocational

education in a formal school setting. Several studies have also examined returns to less formal

vocational training activities as a form of human capital acquisition and found that such training,

even firm-specific training, imparts a positive effect on wages (Veum 1999; Loewenstein &

Spletzer 1999; Marcotte 2005). Frazis, Gittleman, and Joyce (2000) found a strong positive

association between formal educational attainment and employer-provided or employer-financed

training, and Marcotte (2005) suggests that complementarities between the two types of

education have been growing over time. To the extent that complementarities exist between

vocational training and formal education for women at risk for relying on welfare, we would

expect that welfare reform had a negative impact on vocational education and training. To the

extent that complementarities exist between work and access to work-related training, we would

expect that higher employment rates among at-risk women due to welfare reform would have a

positive impact on vocational education and training.

Data

       We use data from the National Household Education Survey (NHES), which collects

information about the educational activities of the U.S. population. Specifically, we use the

Adult Education Supplements administered in 1991, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005, which

span the period enveloping welfare reform, to estimate the effects of the welfare reform on



                                                                                                     9
vocational education. We define any vocational education as having participated in a full-time

vocational education program, part-time vocational education program, or other work-related

courses. Full-time vocational education includes full-time activity toward a diploma or certificate

from a vocational or technical school after high school or a formal vocational training program.

It excludes those enrolled in any degree-granting program. It includes full-time community

college enrollment if the individual is in the process of obtaining a certificate or diploma but not

a degree. Our measure of part-time vocational education corresponds to the measure of full-time

vocational education but pertains to part-time enrollment. Our measure of other work-related

courses pertains to courses that are vocationally oriented but not part of a degree or vocational

program. These are usually part-time and short-term, and include activities such as courses taken

at one’s job, courses taken anywhere else that relate to one’s job or new career, or courses taken

for a license or certification for one’s job.

        In our main analyses, we estimate models for participation in full time vocational

education, part time vocational education, and other work-related courses, as defined above; a

composite of those three, which we call “any vocational education;” and employer-paid

education (that for which an employer paid for some or all of educational expenses or for the

employee’s time during which those activities occurred). The last outcome includes college in

addition to the three types of vocational education. In other analyses, we examine enrollment in

full-time and part-time degree programs (college or university) and in any type of education or

training (college or any type of vocational education).

        We attach measures of state implementation of welfare reform to the NHES data. Welfare

reform was implemented in two phases. The first consists of federal waivers granted to states to

experiment with AFDC rules prior to PRWORA. Since 1962, the Secretary of Health and Human



                                                                                                    10
Services has had the authority to waive federal welfare rules if a state proposed experimental or

pilot programs that furthered the goals of AFDC. Some waivers increased the amount of earnings

that recipients were allowed to keep while maintaining welfare eligibility; others expanded work

requirements to larger groups, established term limits for cash assistance, permitted states to

issue sanctions to recipients who failed to meet work requirements, or allowed states to eliminate

increases in benefits to families who had additional children while on welfare. We construct an

indicator to reflect whether a given state in a given month and year had a statewide waiver in

place that substantially altered the nature of AFDC with regard to time limits, work exemptions,

sanctions, earnings disregards, family caps, and/or work requirements.3 The second phase of

welfare reform was the implementation of TANF programs post-PRWORA. Because all states

implemented TANF programs between the 1995 survey and the 1999 survey, all states are coded

with a zero for TANF implementation for 1991 and 1995, and a one for subsequent years.4 These

two measures follow the convention in the literature (reviewed in Blank 2002). For simplicity of

exposition and because we find that the waiver/TANF distinction does little to enhance our

analyses and has no bearing on our inferences, our primary measure of welfare reform combines

the two into a dichotomous indicator of whether the state had either an AFDC waiver or TANF

in place during the time period measured. However, we conduct corresponding analyses that

include the separate indicators for AFDC waivers and TANF (several specifications are

presented in Appendix Table 2 and the others are available upon request). Finally, in certain



3
  The educational variables in the NHES reference the prior year. Based on the respondent’s month of interview, we
therefore match welfare reform policies that were in place in the respondent’s state of residence during the midpoint
of the past 12 months. Eleven states enacted major waivers to their AFDC programs across various months, between
1992 and 1994. Estimates are robust to alternative measures of the fraction of the past year (since the month of
interview) that the welfare policy was in effect.

models we estimate differential effects by state educational policies, sanctions, and benefit

generosity under TANF, as described later.

           Since welfare reform is measured at the state level, we incorporate additional state-

specific socioeconomic measures in the analyses to capture time-varying trends within areas.

State unemployment rate and per capita personal income are derived from figures provided by

the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Welfare caseloads, defined as the total number of welfare

recipients in a state, are obtained from the Department of Health and Human Service’s

Administration for Children and Families Office of Family Assistance.5 All models further

include indicators for whether a given state in a given year had a strict high school exit exam

(testing material at or above the 9th grade level) or a less strict exam (below the 9th grade level),

with the reference category being no high school exit exam. For women who completed high

school, we use the existence of the exam during their eighteenth year. For those who did not

complete high school, we use the contemporaneous existence of the exam in their state. These

data are derived from the Appendix provided by Dee & Jacob (2007).

Methods

           The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of welfare reform on adult

women’s vocational education and training. We employ a difference-in-difference-in-differences

(DDD) framework – akin to a pre- and post-comparison with treatment and control groups – in

conjunction with multivariate regression methods, which is standard in the economics literature

on evaluating the effects of welfare reform and other state policies (e.g., Kaestner & Tarlov

2006; Bitler, Gelbach & Hoynes 2005; Blank 2002). Under certain conditions, described below,

this quasi-experimental research design will yield causal estimates of the effects of welfare

reform on our outcomes of interest. We conduct various specification and robustness checks to

assess the validity of the identification assumptions underlying this methodology.

         Consider the following DDD model which relates changes in educational outcomes to

implementation of welfare reform for the target group relative to a comparison group:

(1)   Eist   '  ( 1   1* )Targeti  ( 1   1* )(WRst * Targeti )   1* (WRst ) 
 X ist  '  Z st  '  States '  Yeart  '  ( States * t ) '   ist


Equation 1 posits that the educational outcome (E), for the ith woman residing in state s during

year t, is a function of welfare reform implementation (WR), measured here by an indicator

reflecting whether a given state has enacted either a statewide AFDC waiver or TANF (based on

the respondent’s interview month and year). In addition, educational acquisition depends on a

vector of individual characteristics (X) such as age, race, ethnicity, highest grade completed, and

urban residence, a vector of time-varying state characteristics (Z) such as economic conditions

and educational policies, state fixed effects (States), and year fixed effects (Yeart). The

parameter μ represents an individual error term.6

         There are several benefits to estimating Equation 1. It bypasses having to estimate the

structural model relating welfare reform to welfare caseloads, which has been problematic in the

literature (Kaestner & Tarlov 2006; Blank 2002).7 Equation 1 is also more policy relevant as it

represents the reduced-form model directly linking welfare policy measures to key outcomes,




6
  We estimate equation (1) via OLS, though results are not affected when probit or logit methods are employed. All
models control for the sampling weights as a covariate to increase efficiency, as recommended in Korn and
Graubard (1995) and because the NHES over-sampled those who participated in educational activities. Reported
standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation across observations within each state.
7
  Changes in welfare caseloads are not due solely to welfare policy. Research suggests that much of the drop in
caseloads, especially prior to TANF implementation in 1996, was not policy-related. While the welfare caseload fell
dramatically in the 1990s, only part of the decline (≤ 35 %) was due to welfare reform legislation (Blank 2002).
Changes in economic conditions and other factors also played an important role.

                                                                                                                13
and therefore accounts for any and all mechanisms through which welfare policy may be

affecting educational acquisition.

       The direct focus on welfare reform, either an AFDC waiver or TANF, also underscores

the point that the population of interest, that which is affected by welfare reform legislation, is all

women at risk of being on public assistance, and not just current or former program participants

(Kaestner & Tarlov 2006). Welfare reform can affect exit rates as well as entry rates.

Considering all women at risk addresses some of the limitations from leavers’ studies, which

focus solely on individuals who have left welfare. These studies find it difficult to differentiate

individuals who leave public assistance voluntarily from those who left because of welfare

reform policies. They also do not consider the experiences of individuals who have been diverted

from public assistance as a result of policy shifts. Potential welfare recipients are shown to

behave strategically in their use of welfare benefits when faced with time limits and other

regulatory constraints (DeLeire et al. 2006; Grogger 2004). Thus, in order to identify the

population effect of welfare reform on key outcomes, the appropriate sample is all women at risk

of being on public assistance.

       Traditionally, the welfare caseload has consisted primarily of low-educated, unmarried

mothers. This at-risk population group is the target group, for whom welfare policy would be

expected to have the largest behavioral effects. In addition to the state-varying trends we

consider when estimating equation (1), the possibility of omitted variables remains. This

problem is addressed in the DDD framework by considering a comparison group – individuals

who are similar in many ways to the target group but are unlikely to participate in public

assistance programs and therefore not likely to be affected by welfare policies. In the above

equation, Target represents a dichotomous indicator equal to one if the individual is in the target



                                                                                                      14
group (population at risk of being on welfare) and zero if the individual is in the comparison

group (population not at risk of being on welfare). The DDD estimates of the effects of welfare

reform are the coefficients of the interaction terms between the policy measures (WR or, in

supplemental analyses, separate indicators for AFDC Waiver and TANF) and the Target group

indicator.8 The impact of welfare reform is identified using variation in the timing and incidence

of welfare reform across different states over time.

         The assumption necessary for the DDD effect to represent an unbiased estimate is that in

the absence of welfare reform, unobserved state-varying factors would affect the target and

comparison groups similarly. Consequently, the choice of target and comparison groups is

integral to a valid implementation of the DDD methodology. Following the literature, we employ

target and comparison groups that are conventionally defined (Dave et al. 2008; Kaushal and

Kaestner 2001; Kaestner and Kaushal 2003). Identifying the target group for our analyses—

individuals who are at risk of relying on public assistance—is relatively straightforward. As

indicated earlier, welfare reform is likely to have its strongest behavioral impacts on unmarried

mothers with low levels of education and their children. As such, we compare unmarried women

ages 25-54 who have less than a college education and live with children (target group) to

unmarried women in the same age and education groups who do not live with any children

(comparison group).

         We confirm that baseline means between the target and comparison groups were similar

in 1991, the period that predated any welfare reform. For instance, unadjusted weighted

differences in full-time college enrollment (-0.0054), part-time college enrollment (-0.0193), and

8
  For parsimony, Equation 1 imposes the restriction that, within states, the effects of the non-welfare reform
measures (vectors X, Z, Year and State*t) are similar for the target and comparison groups. In supplemental
analyses, we estimated all models allowing the effects of X and Z to differ across target and comparison groups, by
including interactions between the target indicator and X and Z. Coefficient magnitudes are not materially affected,
though standard errors are inflated somewhat due to reduced degrees of freedom.

                                                                                                                  15
any vocational education (-0.0051) between the target and comparison groups were insignificant.

Individuals in the comparison group were significantly more likely (by about 10 percentage

points) to participate in work-related courses in 1991 relative to the target group; this is to be

expected since labor force participation and employment were much higher among individuals in

the comparison group relative to individuals at-risk of welfare assistance (target group) who

were not required to work in order to receive welfare benefits. Trends between 1991 and 1995

(excluding states that had implemented major AFDC waivers) were also generally similar

between the groups for these measures; for work-related courses, the increasing trend was

qualitatively similar for both groups but somewhat steeper for the target group. Some of this

confounding is likely due to differential effects of the economic expansion on employment

between the target and comparison groups as work-related courses are expected to be highly

complementary to employment. We are therefore careful to control for measures of economic

activity in all models, and in fact when we do so, the baseline difference in work-related courses

between the target and comparison groups is attenuated by 60 percent and the difference in trend

becomes statistically insignificant.

         One concern is that states may have implemented major waivers to their AFDC programs

in response to economic conditions or the behavior of welfare caseloads on the state. Therefore,

all models control for one- and two-year lags of the state unemployment rate, real personal

income per capita, and welfare caseloads. 9 We conduct several specification checks to assess

the robustness of our estimates. First, in alternate models, we include state-specific trends to



9
  Results (available upon request) are virtually unchanged if these lagged covariates are excluded from the models.
In alternate models, we also control for a larger vector of state-specific factors including state child support
expenditures, minimum wage, and poverty rates. Results (available upon request) are highly robust with respect to
both magnitudes and significance. This robustness to additional controls for state-varying factors is validating since
in a well-specified DD model, the comparison group accounts for time-shifting unobservable factors; thus, results
should not be sensitive to parametric controls for state-specific factors.

                                                                                                                   16
account for systematically-varying unobservable factors within each state. Second, we assess

whether our estimates are sensitive to the choice of the comparison group by utilizing an

alternate comparison group (low-educated married women with children) that has also been used

in the welfare reform literature. Third, we estimate alternate specifications only for individuals

in the target group, separately controlling for state-specific prevalence of vocational and work-

related educational engagement among unmarried women with no children and married women

with children (individuals who are not likely to be impacted by welfare policies) to capture

general trends in these educational activities. Our estimates remain generally robust across all of

these specifications, adding to the weight of the evidence bearing on our conclusions.

Results

       The results are organized as follows. Table 1 replicates previous work that estimated the

effects of welfare reform on college attendance. Tables 2 and 3 present our main results--effects

of welfare reform on vocational education and training and on employer-subsidized education.

Table 4 presents results from models that stratify by state TANF policies vis-a-vis education,

sanctions, and benefit generosity in order to explore effect heterogeneity along those dimensions.

These analyses also assess the plausibility of our estimates by checking for a “dose-response”

relation based on whether the effects are expectedly larger for stricter states. In Table 5, we allow

for heterogeneous effects of welfare reform on vocational education by prior formal educational

attainment, allowing us to explore complementarity between formal and vocational education. In

Table 6, we present estimates from models of welfare reform on any schooling (formal or

vocational education) to assess overall effects on potential human capital acquisition. In all

tables, the estimated effects of welfare reform are indicated by the (bolded) coefficients on the

interaction terms between the welfare reform and target group indicators. All sample sizes have



                                                                                                    17
been rounded to the nearest 10, and we perform weighted analyses per National Center for

Education Statistics guidelines.

        In Table 1, we replicate previously discussed findings, based on the October supplement

of the CPS, of Dave, Reichman and Corman (2008) that welfare reform reduced college

enrollment of adult women at risk of relying on welfare. The estimates for any enrollment and

full-time enrollment confirm these previous findings, although that for any enrollment is

imprecisely estimated. For instance, welfare reform is associated with a 3.7 to 3.9 percentage

points decline in college enrollment among low-educated single mothers ages 25-54, relative to

similar aged and educated women without children. 10 Estimate magnitudes and standard errors

are robust to the inclusion of state-specific trends. Sample sizes vary across outcomes because

individuals engaging in types of education other than that being modeled are excluded from the

sample (for example, the 2,910 observations in Column 3 consist of women who either engaged

in no education or full-time degree education, and excludes women who engaged in any other

type of education or training). Thus, the reference group in all models consists of individuals

who did not participate in any schooling or training, making the marginal effects directly

comparable across all specifications.

        Table 2 presents our main results. As indicated earlier, nationally representative statistics

are not readily available for vocational education participation among women at risk for relying

on welfare—before or after welfare reform. As shown in the bottom row, in 1990-1991 (our

“baseline” pre-welfare reform period), about 4.5% of women at-risk for welfare (aged 25 to 54

years, less than college-educated, unmarried, and with dependent children) were enrolled in a

10
  For any degree enrollment, we find a higher-magnitude effect than the corresponding estimate by Dave, Reichman
& Corman (3-4 percentage points versus 1-2 percentage points). This is partly due to a somewhat higher prevalence
of any degree enrollment for the target group in the NHES relative to the October CPS (11.6 percent vs. 8.9
percent), suggesting that the educational focus of the NHES may be picking up greater participation in degree-
granting activities that is perhaps missed in the CPS.

                                                                                                              18
full-time vocational education program at some point during the year. Another 1.8% had been

enrolled in a part-time vocational program, and another 13.6% had engaged in any other work-

related courses during the year. Thus, about 20% of women at-risk for welfare participation

engaged in some type of vocational education and over one-quarter were engaged in either

vocational training or formal college education. For vocational education, the most common type

was short-term, part-time training that does not lead to a degree or diploma (“any other work

related courses”). We also find that almost 14% of women at risk for welfare reform in 1990-

1991 received employer-subsidized education (including college or any type of vocational

education).

       The estimates in Columns 2-4 of Table 2 indicate that welfare reform reduced full-time

vocational enrollment by about 4 percentage points but increased part-time vocational education

by one percentage point. This latter represents a large effect relative to the baseline mean, though

this effect is imprecisely estimated. There is no significant or substantial effect of welfare reform

on participation on any other work-related training. When the three types of vocational education

are combined (Column 1), we find no evidence that welfare reform had a significant impact on

vocational education among women at risk for relying on welfare. In addition, we find no

significant effects of welfare reform on employer-subsidized education. Table 3 presents

estimates from models that control for state-specific trends; effect magnitudes and standard

errors are not materially affected.

       We would expect the negative effects of welfare reform on vocational education to be

particularly strong in states that do not permit or that limit education as an authorized work

activity for adults. To explore this, Table 4 (panel A) presents estimates from models with a three




                                                                                                  19
way interaction between TANF, target, and state TANF education policy.11 Specifically, we

created a dichotomous variable equal to one if the state never allows post-secondary or other

education to substitute for work requirements, or imposes substantial time limits on the duration

of the educational activities. We then interacted this variable with our TANF*Target variable.12

None of these states allow schooling, as a stand-alone activity, to satisfy work requirements.

Since these state educational policies specifically refer to TANF, we focus on the TANF effect in

these models and exclude states that had already implemented welfare reform through major

waivers to AFDC prior to TANF implementation.

         Although measured with some imprecision due to reduced effective cell size, we find that

the negative effect of TANF on full-time vocational education becomes stronger in strict states

and approaches zero in states that have more lenient policies with respect to educational

enrollment. We also find some evidence of heterogeneity with respect to part-time vocational

enrollment. That is, in lenient states, at-risk women are more likely to attend part-time vocational

programs (by about 8 percentage points), and in strict states, at-risk women are less likely to

attend such programs (by about 7 percentage points) relative to the lenient states. Combining the

effects over all states thus yielded a net one percentage point increase in part-time vocational

education. There is also some suggestive evidence of differential effects for other work-related

courses (1.7 percentage points decline among the stricter states relative to the lenient states, and

a 2.4 percentage points increase among the lenient states), though the difference here is not as



11
   We investigate only TANF because there is no known source of information on educational policies under AFDC
waivers.
12
   Specifically, we examined these policies at two points in time (1999 and 2002), and designated states as "strict" if
they did not allow education as a stand-alone activity and they did not allow schooling to be combined with other
work activities for more than one year. Twenty-two states (AZ, CO, CT, FL, ID, IN, KS, LA, MA, MD, MI, MS,
ND, NM, NY, OH, OK, OR, SD, TX, WA, WI) and D.C. fall into this category. The data, available on the State
Policy Documentation Project website, can be found at: http://www.spdp.org/tanf/postsecondary.PDF and
http://clasp.org/publications/postsec_table_i_061902.pdf.

                                                                                                                    20
large as for vocational training. This is not surprising, since these courses do not represent major

financial commitments compared to the other two categories.

       We would also expect the effects of welfare reform on vocational education to be

stronger in states with strict work incentives, such as sanctions for non-compliance with work

requirements and low benefits generosity. As above for TANF education policy, we interacted a

measure of strict state sanctions in Panel B and a measure of low or medium (relative to high)

benefits generosity in Panel C (as characterized by Blank & Schmidt 2001). Again, we find

significant differential effects on vocational education depending on strict versus less strict

states. That is, women in states with stricter work incentives were less likely than women in

more lenient states to engage in full-time and part-time vocational education.

       As discussed earlier, more highly educated individuals are more likely than those with

lower educational levels to engage in work-related courses. Thus, it is possible that our overall

results may mask important differences in propensity to engage in vocational education within

the at-risk population. Table 5 presents results that allow for differential effects of welfare

reform depending on whether the woman had a high school diploma (about 70% of the target

group). Because of small cell sizes, we present results only for the two largest categories of

vocational education (any vocational education and work-related courses) and for employer-

subsidized schooling (which includes college as well as vocational education). Similar to the

above analyses of heterogeneous effects based on state variation in TANF policies, we interact

our main DD effect (Welfare Reform*Target) with an indicator for whether the woman had a

high school diploma. The coefficient of this triple interaction term (Welfare Reform* Target*

High School Graduate) represents the effects of welfare reform for those at-risk women who

have a high school degree, relative to those who do not.



                                                                                                    21
       Although imprecisely estimated, we find that for women with less than a high school

diploma, welfare reform reduced any vocational education by about 3 percentage points and any

other work-related courses by about 6 percentage points. Relative to these women with less than

a high school education, welfare reform is associated with a 2.6 and 6.8 percentage points

increase any vocational education and work-related courses, respectively. Overall, for these

high-school graduates, there is no appreciable negative effects of welfare reform (sum of the

coefficients of Welfare Reform*Target and Welfare Reform*Target*High School Graduate).

These findings suggest that limitations in counting education and training as authorized work

activities increase the cost of engaging in those activities overall, but that complementarities

between work and education (such as access to employer-subsidized education) may largely

offset those effects for high school graduates. The results for employer-subsidized education are

consistent with this scenario. Although welfare reform had small and statistically insignificant

effects on employer-subsidized education (Table 2), we see here that the effects were negative

for the least educated women while small but positive for those with at least a high school

diploma relative to those with less than a high school education.

       Table 6 considers the overall effects of welfare reform on any type of education (formal

college, vocational programs, or work-related courses). These estimates address the question of

whether the decrease in formal schooling found by Dave et al. (2008) and corroborated in this

study were tempered by increases in informal schooling in the form of vocational training and

work-related courses. Models 1 and 2 (excluding and including state-specific trends,

respectively) estimate average effects of welfare reform across the sample, while models 3 and 4

consider differential effects of welfare reform by the woman’s prior education. From the first

two columns, we can see that welfare reform had a negative (but statistically insignificant) effect



                                                                                                   22
on overall educational participation, which is consistent with the separate findings for college

and vocational enrollment (in Tables 1 and 2, respectively). From the last two columns, we can

see that for women with at least a high school diploma, this effect is substantially attenuated.

Together, these estimates suggest that while welfare reform led to overall declines in educational

acquisition among women at risk for relying on welfare, the effects were confined for the most

part to very low-educated women. The effects for women with a least a high school diploma

appear to have been offset by increases in employer-subsidized education (from Table 5). In

other words, the “work first” strategy under welfare reform appears to have had uneven impacts

in terms of its effects on educational acquisition, with the most disadvantaged (in terms of

completed education) falling even farther behind and the others experiencing neutral effects.

       In additional specifications (not shown) we used an alternative comparison group—

married women (with children in the household) in the same age range and with the same

education levels as the target group—and found that results were consistent in terms of both

effect magnitudes and significance relative to those presented in Tables 2 and 3. The only

substantive difference is that we find a significant decrease in other work-related courses,

confirming that welfare reform seemed to have an overall negative effect on the target women's

human capital acquisition through formal education and training.

       When the target and comparison groups are defined according to characteristics, such as

education, parental status, and marital status, which may themselves be affected by welfare

reform, potential bias due to compositional selection is a concern. We confirm that key

characteristics used to define the target and comparison groups have not changed significantly

over the sample period. For instance, 6.85 percent of all women are classified into the target

group prior to TANF (being low-educated, unmarried, and with children) compared to 6.71



                                                                                                   23
percent in 2005. Similarly, the prevalence of marriage among low-educated women and the

number of children among low-educated unmarried and married women have remained

relatively stable over the sample period. Thus, selection bias with respect to parental and marital

status or family structure is unlikely, and this is consistent with prior research which has also

found weak to no effects of welfare reform on those as outcomes.

       As an alternative check for compositional selection, we also assessed whether welfare

reform can predict who is in our analysis sample and who is in the target versus comparison

samples (controlling for observed covariates). In both cases, welfare reform is not significantly

or substantially associated with the probability of inclusion in the analysis sample (target or

comparison group relative to all others) or inclusion in the target group relative to the

comparison group (marginal effect of -0.008). When the welfare reform indicator is separated

into AFDC waivers and TANF, we find that neither is significantly associated with the

probability of inclusion in the analysis sample. However, TANF appears to reduce the

probability that an adult woman is observed in the target group by about 6 percentage points

(about 10% relative to the baseline prevalence of the target indicator). Since the only difference

between the target and comparison groups is the presence of minor children in the household,

this result could reflect changes in household structure post-TANF, such as formation of multi-

family or intergenerational households (outcomes that have not been explored in the welfare

reform literature). Thus, women who may otherwise have been in the target group are classified

in the comparison group potentially because their living arrangements were affected by welfare

reform. Since about 10 percent of the target group potentially shifted into the comparison sample

as result of welfare reform, it should be noted that this would attenuate observed DDD effects by

about 10 percent (Dave and Kaestner, 2008). Thus, if anything, the reported estimates are



                                                                                                    24
conservative and compositional selection has a negligible effect on the results. It is also

validating that results are robust to alternate definitions of the comparison group as noted above.

       Appendix Table 1 presents the separate effects of state AFDC waivers and TANF

implementation on all reported educational outcomes. The patterns and magnitudes of the

estimates are consistent with those discussed above with respect to the overall welfare reform

indicator. In addition, both AFDC waivers and TANF similarly impacted educational outcomes;

we are unable to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in effects between the two indicators.

This is consistent with the results reported in Table 4, which suggest that work incentives were a

key mechanism through which welfare reform impacted educational outcomes, and both AFDC

waivers and TANF imposed strict work requirements as a condition for receiving benefits.

Conclusion

       We found robust and convincing evidence that welfare reform significantly decreased the

probability of full time vocational training and had no significant effects on part-time vocational

education acquisition or participation in any other type of work-related education among adult

women on average. We also found considerable heterogeneity across states, suggesting that

states with stricter educational policies and stronger work incentives experienced larger declines

in full- and part-time vocational training participation. Indeed, participation in part-time

vocational education appears to have significantly increased (relative to no education or training)

in lenient states. The negative effects of welfare reform on vocational education appear to be

confined to women with less than a high school education. We found no evidence that the

previously-reported negative effects of welfare reform on enrollment in formal education

(particularly college), which we replicated in this study, have been offset by increases in

vocational education and training on average. In other words, welfare reform appeared to



                                                                                                 25
decrease adult women’s education and training overall, and again, the effects appear to be

confined to those with very low levels of completed education.

       The results from this study fill an important gap in the welfare reform literature and

confirm that the gains from welfare reform in terms of increasing employment and reducing

caseloads have come at a cost—lower education and training among women at risk for relying

on welfare. Our finding that the effects appear to be concentrated among women with very low

education has negative implications for this group’s ability to attain self-sufficiency and

experience upward mobility. These negative effects of welfare reform on adult women’s

education may have become even larger under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2006, which raised

states’ work participation targets and narrowed the range of welfare-to-work activities that can

be counted toward those targets, and during the recent economic downturn. Finally, the findings

from this study contribute generally to the sparse economics literature on adult vocational

education by identifying welfare policy as a determinant of vocational education and training,

Notes: Coefficient estimates are from linear probability models. The reference group in all models corresponds to no schooling. Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation
within each state and reported in parentheses. All models include age and age squared, indicators for race and Hispanic ethnicity, indicators for high school graduate and less than
high school, number of children less than 16 years of age in the household, number of residents in the household, urban residence, state fixed effects, year fixed effects, and the
appropriate sampling probability weights. State covariates include state-level unemployment rate, real state personal income per capita, and indicators for state high school exit exam
requirements. Lagged state covariates include one- and two-year lags of the welfare caseload, unemployment rate, and real personal income per capita. Significance is denoted as
follows: *** p≤0.01, ** 0.01<p≤0.05, * 0.05<p≤0.10. All sample sizes are rounded to the nearest 10 per National Center for Education Statistics guidelines. Baseline mean
represents the weighted outcome mean for the analysis sample, for the target group, from 1991 and 1995 (excluding states in 1995 that had enacted statewide AFDC waivers).

      Notes: Any vocational education or training (1) includes full time (2), part-time (3), and other (4). Any employer-
      paid schooling (5) includes (1) or any college. Coefficient estimates are from linear probability models. The
      reference group in all models corresponds to no schooling. Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation
      within each state and reported in parentheses. All models include age and age squared, indicators for race and
      Hispanic ethnicity, indicators for high school graduate and less than high school, number of children less than 16
      years of age in the household, number of residents in the household, urban residence, state fixed effects, year fixed
      effects, and the appropriate sampling probability weights. State covariates include state-level unemployment rate,
      real state personal income per capita, and indicators for state high school exit exam requirements. Lagged state
      covariates include one- and two-year lags of the welfare caseload, unemployment rate, and real personal income per
      capita. Significance is denoted as follows: *** p≤0.01, ** 0.01<p≤0.05, * 0.05<p≤0.10. All sample sizes are
      rounded to the nearest 10 per National Center for Education Statistics guidelines. Baseline mean represents the
      weighted outcome mean for the analysis sample, for the target group, from 1991 and 1995 (excluding states in 1995
      that had enacted statewide AFDC waivers).

Notes: See Tables 1 & 2. States which had implemented major waivers to their AFDC programs prior to 1995 are
excluded from the sample. Models also control for interactions between the policy indicator and the target group
indicator, and between the policy indicator and TANF. TANF represents the conditional difference between 1999,
the first post-TANF NHES wave, and the pre-TANF wave 1995 which is the reference year indicator.

         Notes: Outcome definitions correspond to those in Table 2. Coefficient estimates are from linear probability models.
         The reference group in all models corresponds to no schooling. Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation
         within each state and reported in parentheses. All models include age and age squared, indicators for race and
         Hispanic ethnicity, indicators for high school graduate and less than high school, number of children less than 16
         years of age in the household, number of residents in the household, urban residence, state fixed effects, year fixed
         effects, and the appropriate sampling probability weights. Models also control for interactions between welfare
         reform and high school graduate indicators, and between the target group and high school graduate indicators. State
         covariates include state-level unemployment rate, real state personal income per capita, and indicators for state high
         school exit exam requirements. Lagged state covariates include one- and two-year lags of the welfare caseload,
         unemployment rate, and real personal income per capita. Significance is denoted as follows: *** p≤0.01, **
         0.01<p≤0.05, * 0.05<p≤0.10. All sample sizes are rounded to the nearest 10 per National Center for Education
         Statistics guidelines. Baseline mean represents the weighted outcome mean for the analysis sample, for the target
         group, from 1991 and 1995 (excluding states in 1995 that had enacted statewide AFDC waivers).
