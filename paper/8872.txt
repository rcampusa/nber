Do Cigarette Taxes Make Smokers Happier?

NBER Working Paper No. 8872

JEL No. H2, I1, D9



                                              ABSTRACT

        To measure how policy changes affect social welfare, economists typically look at how policies
affect behavior, and use a formal model to infer welfare consequences from the behavioral responses. But
when different models can map the same behavior to very different welfare impacts, it becomes hard to
draw firm conclusions about many policies. An excellent example of this conundrum is the taxation of
addictive substances such as cigarettes. Existing empirical evidence on smoking is equally consistent with
two models that have radically different welfare implications. Under the rational addiction model,
cigarette taxes make time consistent smokers worse off. But, under alternative time inconsistent models,
smokers are made better off by taxes, as they provide a valuable self-control device.
        We therefore propose an alternative approach to assessing the welfare implications of policy
interventions: examining directly the impact on subjective well-being. We do so by matching information
on cigarette excise taxation to separate surveys from the U.S. and Canada that contain data on self-
reported happiness. And we model the differential impact of excise taxes on those predicted to be likely
to be smokers, relative to others, in order to control for omitted correlations between happiness and excise
taxation. We find consistent evidence in both countries that excise taxes make predicted smokers happier.
This evidence suggests that the time inconsistent model of smoking is more appropriate, and that as a
result welfare is improved by higher cigarette taxes.

       To measure how policy changes affect social welfare, economists typically look at how

policies affect behavior. They then use a formal model to infer welfare consequences from the

behavioral responses. The advantage of this approach is that many behaviors can be readily

measured in easily available micro-data sets. The disadvantage is that the model used to make

this inference is often empirically unverified. Since different models can map the same behavior

to very different welfare impacts, it becomes hard to draw firm conclusions about many policies.

       An excellent example of this conundrum is the taxation of addictive substances such as

cigarettes. There is wide agreement that consumption of cigarette is fairly price sensitive

(Chaloupka and Warner, 2001). But this fact is equally consistent with two very different models

of why people smoke. Under the rational addiction model pioneered by Becker and Murphy

(1988), agents decide to smoke in the same way they decide on other things: they trade off the

long-term costs of smoking against the immediate pleasures all the while taking into account the

addictive properties of nicotine. In such a model, taxes will reduce smoking but will also make

smokers worse off: the price of a good that they enjoy is more expensive.

       An alternative class of models suggests that smoking decisions are not made optimally.

For example, in the model of Gruber and Koszegi (2001,2002), time inconsistent smokers have

self-control problems: they would like to quit smoking but cannot. In this model, a rise in taxes

also reduces smoking. But now the reduction in smoking makes smokers better off: the higher

taxes provide a commitment device that helps them deal with their self-control problem.

       These models have very different policy implications. Under the rational addiction

model, the only reason to tax cigarettes is the presence of interpersonal externalities. Under the

more behavioral model, optimal taxes can be quite high, even absent interpersonal externalities,

due to the self-control benefits of taxation. Critically, since consumption can be price sensitive
                                                        2

under both models, existing evidence based solely on smoking behavior does not allow one to
                                                                       1
distinguish the correct model for welfare and policy analysis.

        In this paper, we go beyond the existing literature to propose a new approach. We do so

by drawing on a source of data that is sometimes used in other disciplines but rarely by
                                                   2
economists: data on self-reported happiness. In principle, happiness is a direct welfare measure

that can overcome the limitations of other approaches to welfare analysis of policies such as

excise taxation. This measure has been repeatedly validated as a good correlate of well-being,

using alternative psychological, physiological, and economic measures of well-being. Since the

two models above make very different predictions of how taxes ought to affect happiness, this

data allows us to distinguish between them in a way that traditional behavioral data cannot.

        We use two independent data sets to examine the effect of cigarette taxes on happiness.

These are the General Social Survey’s (GSS) that are carried out in the United States (since

1973) and in Canada (since 1985). Both surveys repeatedly ask a random sample of respondents

to report on their well-being. In addition, the survey also contains information on a host of other

demographic variables and, in many years, on smoking behavior.

        To assess the effect of taxes, we match these data to cigarette exercise tax data in each

country. In both the US and Canada, states and provinces have independently changed their

taxes over time, giving us significant variation to estimate the effect of cigarette tax changes on

self-reported happiness. However, looking at how these tax changes affect happiness in the state

consumption, but this test is unlikely to be feasible given existing data.

  Easterlin (1974) provides an important early exception. Recent examples of work by economists using happiness
data include Blanchflower and Oswald (1996), Clark and Oswald (1994), and DiTella, MacCulloch and Oswald
(2001) and Easterlin (1995).
                                                  3

or province as a whole would cause problems if other factors are changing along with these

taxes. We, therefore, examine how tax changes differentially affect the happiness of those in a

state who are predicted to be smokers. This strategy in essence uses those who are predicted to be

non-smokers as a way of controlling for other shocks contemporaneous with cigarette tax

changes.

       Our results are striking: those who are predicted to be smokers are significantly happier

when excise taxes rise. The fact that this conclusion emerges so clearly in two independent data

sets, with different distributions of underlying happiness indicators, is quite striking. In both

countries, the estimated effects appear surprisingly large. This evidence is very robust to a

battery of specification checks across both countries. And our findings are inconsistent with two

alternative explanations for our results, interpersonal externalities within the family, and long run

impacts of taxes in a time consistent setting. Overall, our findings are consistent with time

inconsistent models of smoking and provide early evidence that cigarette taxes may serve to

actually increase the welfare of smokers themselves.

       Our paper proceeds as follows. In Part I, we discuss the alternative predictions for the

impact of cigarette taxes on happiness, the models that underlie those predictions, and the

importance of assessing the impact of cigarette taxation on welfare, in terms of optimal

government policy. In Part II, we discuss the use of subjective well being indicators as a

measure of welfare. In Part III, we discuss our data source and our empirical strategy. Part IV

presents basic results and our battery of specification checks. Part V then explores two

alternative explanations for our findings: intra-family externalities and long run averaging. Part

VI concludes.

                              Part I: Smoking Behavior and Policy

       The key question that we propose to assess in this paper is whether cigarette taxation

raises or lowers the happiness of potential smokers. In this section, we expand on why cigarette

taxation might have either positive or negative effects on happiness. We then discuss the strong

differences in government policy implied by these different models.

       Cigarette taxes will decrease happiness among smokers under the rational addiction

model of Becker and Murphy (1988). Becker and Murphy model the act of smoking as the

building of an addiction stock. The more cigarettes smoked today, the greater the addiction

capital tomorrow. High addiction capital lowers average utility but raises the marginal utility of

smoking. In this way, smoking lowers future utility but also increases the craving for another

cigarette. The key feature of any addiction model is on how people deal with this intertemporal

problem. In the original Becker-Murphy formulation individuals discounted the future

exponentially, meaning that they discount k-periods forward by δk, where δ is the per-period time

discount factor. Since an exponential individual makes a time-consistent choice to smoke, a rise

in taxes can only lower discounted utility today. If it were to raise it, then the rational addict

could raise utility by simply reducing smoking by the amount that the tax does, i.e. by emulating

the tax. So cigarette taxes should reduce the happiness of time consistent rational addicts.

       Gruber and Koszegi (2001,2002) develop an alternative to the Becker and Murphy model

where smokers can actually be made better off by cigarette taxation. Their alternative embeds

within the Becker-Murphy stock addiction framework preferences that are time inconsistent,

following Laibson (1997) and O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999). In this quasi-hyperbolic

formulation, next period is discounted by βδ, the following period by βδ2, and k periods in the
                                                      5

future by βδk, where β<1 is an extra discount factor that changes the discounting of this period

relative to the entire future. The key feature of such a hyperbolic model is that individuals will

have self-control problems. Specifically, a sophisticated hyperbolic individual (one who knows

that he discounts hyperbolically) would like to smoke less in the future than he actually can. The

problem arises because he is patient about the future (the relative discount rate between future

periods is δ), but impatient about the present (the relative discount rate between today and

tomorrow is βδ<δ). This means that when the future arrives he will end up making more

impatient choices (i.e. smoke more) than he would like to from today's vantage point.

         As Gruber and Koszegi show, the discounted utility of a sophisticated hyperbolic

consumer can rise if a tax is imposed. The reason is that the tax serves as a self-commitment
         3
device. By forcing a reduction in the smoking in the future, the tax allows the sophisticated

hyperbolic agent to do something they would not be otherwise be able to do.4 This is the essence

of the empirical test carried out below: a positive impact of cigarette taxation on the present

discounted value of happiness is the direct implication of a sophisticated time inconsistent

model.

         Existing empirical evidence on smoking, reviewed in Chaloupka and Warner (2001) and

Gruber (2001), does not distinguish between these models. There is a strong consensus that

smoking is moderately price elastic, but agents are price elastic under either of these models.

Gruber and Koszegi (2001) find that smokers respond not only to the current price, but also to

next period’s price in their smoking decisions. They show, however, that this tests only the non-


3
 As Gruber and Koszegi (forthcoming) discuss, this government-provided commitment device is valued by
consumers because the private sector cannot plausibly provide true commitment.
                                                             6

myopia condition that is present in both the rational addiction and their alternative model; this

test has no implications for the time consistency aspect which strongly differentiates the models.

           There is a large body of evidence to support the notion that agents are time inconsistent,

in particular with regards to their smoking decisions. Laboratory experiments document

overwhelmingly that consumers are time inconsistent (Ainslee, 1992). In experimental settings,

consumers consistently reveal a lower discount rate when making decisions over time intervals

further away than for ones closer to the present, raising the specter of inter-personal conflict over

decisions that have implications for the future.

           In the context of smoking, there is indirect evidence for time inconsistency that is

reviewed in Gruber and Koszegi (2001,2002). A hallmark of sophisticated time inconsistency is

the use of self-control devices. And there is substantial evidence that self-control devices are

frequently employed to quit smoking; people regularly set up socially managed incentives to

refrain from smoking by betting with others, telling others about the decision, and otherwise

making it embarrassing to smoke (Prochaska et al., 1982). Various punishment and self-control

strategies are recommended by both academic publications (Grabowski and Hall, 1985) and self-

help books (CDC, various years). Such self-control devices are not needed by a time consistent

agent; while such an agent would obviously like to make quitting as costless as possible,

lowering the utility of an undesired alternative is irrelevant for decisionmaking.

           An alternative formulation of time inconsistency is the naive case, where individuals do

not recognize their own self-control problems (O’Donoghue and Rabin, 1999). One feature that

distinguishes naive time-consistent agents from time-inconsistent agents is an inability to realize


4
    Of course, a sophisticated time inconsistent consumer’s first choice would be a tax that started next period, but
                                                         7

desired future levels of smoking. In fact, unrealized intentions to quit at some future date are a

common feature of stated smoker preferences. Eight of ten smokers in America express a desire

to quit their habit (Burns, 1992). Among high school seniors who smoke, 56 percent say that they

won't be smoking five years later, but only 31 percent of them have in fact quit five years hence.

Moreover, among those who smoke more than one pack/day, the smoking rate five years later

among those who stated that they would not be smoking (74 percent) is actually higher than the

smoking rate among those who stated that they would be smoking (72 percent) (U.S. Department

of Health and Human Services, 1994).

        This set of evidence paints a compelling case that many decisions, and in particular

smoking, are not time consistent. This is particularly true when one acknowledges that there is

absolutely no evidence, experimental or otherwise, for time consistent preferences as a better

explanation for laboratory or real world phenomenon than are time inconsistent preferences.

But none of this evidence meets the gold standard for economics testing, which is to test the

hypothesis through revealed behavior in response to a real change in the underlying economic

environment. Unfortunately, that may be a standard that is almost unreachable given the

similarities between the models. Thus, whether higher cigarette taxes will make smokers better

or worse off remains an open question.

        Understanding the impacts of cigarette taxes on well-being is not simply a matter of

intellectual curiosity; these different models also have radically different implications for


Gruber and Koszegi show that even a tax that starts this period would make time inconsistent smokers better off.

government policy. Under the rational addiction model, there is no rationale for government

regulation of addictive bads other than interpersonal externalities. Just as the government has no

cause, absent market failures, for interfering with revealed preference in the realm of non-

addictive goods, there is no reason to take addictiveness per se as a call to government action, if

individuals are pursuing these activities rationally. It is this framework that implicitly underlies

the well-known efforts of Manning et al. (1989) and others to measure the external costs of

cigarette and alcohol consumption. These estimates, which are frequently cited and influential in

debates over excise taxation, suggest that the optimal tax rate for cigarettes in particular is fairly

low, since the net external costs of smoking are small. In particular, most estimates of the

externalities from smoking are well below the existing average level of excise taxation (Gruber

and Koszegi, 2002).

         Gruber and Koszegi (2002) explore in detail the implications for government policy of a

introducing time inconsistent, quasi-hyperbolically discounted preferences into the Becker-

Murphy framework. In the Gruber and Koszegi model, the optimal excise tax is greater than zero

even absent externalities, due to the self-control benefits to time inconsistent agents. Calibrations

show that this point is not a theoretical curiosity, since the “internalities” (damage to the smoker

himself) of smoking are so large, at over $35 per pack when accounting for mortality effects

alone (calculated using the impacts of smoking on length of life and standard estimates of the

value of a life from Viscusi, 1992). They find that the optimal tax in their model, even with very

modest time inconsistency, is well over $1 per pack, above and beyond externalities. 5


5
 Gruber and Koszegi (2001) also extend this analysis to show that a time inconsistent formulation has radical
implications for the incidence of cigarette excise taxation. Since lower income groups, either on a current or
permanent income basis, are more likely to smoke, traditional analyses have viewed cigarette taxes as regressive.
                                                           9

         It is important to note that not all alternatives to the rational addiction model deliver the

prediction that smokers will be made better off by higher cigarette taxes. For example, in the

temptation models of Bernheim and Rangel (2001), agents do not behave in a rational time

consistent fashion; they have different preferences over “tempted” and “untempted” states. But

there is by definition no price elasticity in the “tempted” state, so that higher prices serve no self-

control purpose; thus, higher prices only make them worse off. Similarly, in the model of Gul

and Pesendorfer (2000), there is a direct disutility from being tempted; but, so long as the agent

can afford the product which is tempting them, there is no reduction in this disutility from higher

prices. Even in the model of Gruber and Koszegi (2001,2002), time inconsistent but naïve

consumers, who have a self-control problem but don’t recognize its existence, would not be

made better off in their own eyes by higher taxation; such consumers view themselves as time

consistent, so that by the same logic as above they would feel worse off from a tax-induced price

rise. Social welfare, discounted exponentially, may rise when taxes increase on naïve hyperbolic

smokers, but their own perceived welfare will not increase.



                                 Part II: What does Happiness Measure?

         Our methodology relies on using subjectively reported happiness measures in empirical

work. But how much can such measures be trusted? Economists worry about the validity of

such questions and to some extent the scientific evidence supports these worries (Bertrand and

Mullainathan 2000). A large array of evidence has shown that subjective survey questions are



But when such taxes play a corrective role, as in the time inconsistent formulation, the incidence is reversed for a
wide class of parameter values. This is because both the higher smoking rates of lower income groups and their
greater price elasticities imply a greater corrective benefit to them from higher taxation.
                                                        10

prone to significant reporting error. For example, studies have found that the placement of well-

being questions affects how they are answered. If they are preceded by a question, for example,

that asks about dating behavior, people are more likely to report unhappiness. Beyond order

choice, instantaneous mood at the time of survey is also found to have a large effect on how

people answer such questions. Schwarz and Strack (1999) provide a nice survey of these effects.

        Yet such results only tell us that there is measurement error in these questions. There is

also measurement error in the numerous other variables that economists study. What is more

relevant for our purposes is that the evidence is clear that these questions also contain significant

true signal about well-being. Evidence of this kind comes in several varieties but they all follow a

similar methodology: find a more objective measure of well-being and see how well this measure

correlates with the self-report. And strong positive correlations have been found for a large set of

such variables. For example, outsider’s assessments of a person’s happiness or independent

counts of smiles correlate positively with self-reported happiness. Moving to much more

physiological measures, everything from heart rate, blood pressure, skin resistance measures of

responses to stress, to even level of activity in the left versus right prefrontal lobe all are found to

correlate with subjective reports of well being (Kahneman 1999; Gardner and Oswald, 2001).

These studies all suggest that despite the measurement error inherent in this attitudinal question,
                                                              6
it nevertheless correlates effectively with well being.


6
  A more subtle concern raised in Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) is that the measurement error may be correlated
with other variables. This makes it hard to assess whether something is affecting happiness or simply the
measurement error in happiness. But in our framework, for this to drive our results, the measurement error in
happiness would have to change in specific states coincident with cigarette taxes and in such a way that it only
affects those with high predicted smoking. It is hard to see how his could be driven by the considerations cited in
Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) as generating correlated measurement error, considerations such as cognitive
dissonance and social reference effects.
                                                          11

         Moreover, the small happiness literature in economics also has uncovered interesting

patterns further bolstering the idea that these variables in fact measure well-being. In cross-

sections, happiness generally rises with factors that economists would associate with improved

well being, such as higher incomes. The income effect appears to be causal, as it is present for

lottery winners and those receiving inheritances (Gardner and Oswald, 2001). Self-reported

well-being is also lower for the unemployed, and for those who are divorced (Blanchflower and

Oswald, 2000); interestingly, however, the reduction in happiness due to unemployment is

mitigated when there is a larger “reference group” of unemployed (Clark, 2000). Despite the

increased use of this measure, there has been no attempt to date of which we are aware that uses

these subjective well-being measures to attempt to either distinguish models of behavior, or to

draw welfare conclusions about particular tax or spending interventions. As a whole, therefore,

the available evidence suggests that while subjective well-being measures do contain noise, they
                                                                                                7
also contain significant signal and are a fruitful area for empirical exploration.



                                     Part III: Data and Empirical Strategy

Data

         We use two data sets to measure happiness, the General Social Surveys (GSS) from the

U.S. and from Canada. The U.S. GSS is a nationally representative survey in the United States

that has been administered to 1500 to 2500 households in most years since 1972; we use data



7 It is also important to note that subjective questions may be eliciting two different notions of “well being”. In
economic terms, they might be eliciting the Present Discounted Value of all future utility or simply the flow utility of
today. For our purposes, it is not important which is being elicited. The sign of the effect is informative for us in
either case. The distinction could be important, however, in studies that are much more reliant on specific
magnitudes rather than signs.
                                                       12

from 1973 (the first year where state identifiers are available) through 1998. The Canadian GSS

is a nationally representative survey of Canadians that has been administered sporadically since

1985; we use all available surveys that include a happiness question (1985, 1986, 1989, 1990,
                           8
1991, 1996, and 1998). Both surveys ask a variety of standard economics questions, but their

use has mostly been in other disciplines, since the survey’s main focus is on questions not

traditionally used by economists: attitudes towards current events or political parties; religious

devotion; and psychological measures such as happiness. It is the last measure that forms our

key dependent variable.

        In particular, in each year the U.S. GSS asks respondents “Taken all together, how would

you say things are these days -- would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too

happy”? The Canadian GSS question asks “Would you describe yourself as very happy,

somewhat happy, somewhat unhappy, or very unhappy”, and there is also an option for “no

opinion”. Since only a very small share of the sample responds that they are very unhappy or no

opinion, we combine those responses with somewhat unhappy to form our unhappiness
            9
category.

        Another advantage of both surveys for our purposes is that both surveys have been carried

out for many years. Over the time periods covered there have been enormous changes in the real

excise tax rates charged by the states and the Canadian provinces, absolutely and relative to each


8 The U.S. GSS survey is a random sample and requires no weighting, but the Canadian GSS is not nationally
representative unless weighted, so that all of our regression estimates use survey weights.

9 The wording of the Canadian question changes somewhat over time. In 1986, the question adds “Presently, would
you describe yourself as…”, and the 1991 and 1996 surveys add “usually, would you describe yourself as…”. These
wording changes appear to affect the distribution of responses across the very and somewhat happy categories, but
do not impact the share of the sample saying that they are unhappy, which is the category upon which we focus. Any
overall impacts from wording changes will be captured in the year dummies included in the regression.
                                                 13

other. It is these changes that provide the identifying variation for our model. Data on state

cigarette excise taxes come from the publication The Tax Burden on Tobacco. We use state

excise tax values as of February of each year, as the GSS data were collected over the February-

April period. Data on Canadian tobacco taxes were collected by Gruber, Sen and Stabile (2002),

and incorporate both federal and provincial excise and sales taxes on cigarettes. We use the tax

rate as of the month of the survey, since the Canadian GSS was collected in various months of

the year over time.

        Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations of the variables in both data sets. The

first three columns show the GSS data from the US, and the second three columns show the data

for Canada; in each set of columns, we first show the means for all respondents, and then

separately by smokers and nonsmokers. We use three dummy variables as our dependent

variables for measuring happiness, corresponding to the three possible answers to the happiness

question above. Over our entire sample, in the United States 32% of respondents report

themselves to be very happy, 55% are pretty happy, and 12% are not very happy. In Canada,

however, we see a different distribution: only 5% of the people report being unhappy, 34% report

being “somewhat happy” and 59% report being “very happy” (with 2% missing). These

differences are consistent with the literature reviewed earlier, which discusses the sensitivity of

the happiness responses across countries or types of wording. But the consistent impacts of

cigarette taxation we will see in both countries below confirm that these differences do not

interfere with our tests.

        Both data sets collected data directly on smoking behavior, but only periodically. In the

U.S. GSS, these smoking data were collected from 1977 to 1993; in the Canadian GSS, they
                                                 14

were collected in 1986, 1991, and 1996. In those years, 35% of the U.S. sample reports

themselves as smokers, which is consistent with prevalence rates over this time period; in the

Canadian data 30% report smoking. Table 1 also summarizes the data sets based on whether the

person reports being a smoker, a non-smoker and whether the data is missing. Smokers are

somewhat less happy than average in both data sets. While this consistent with the notion that

they would like to quit but cannot, it is equally consistent with heterogeneity in smoking behavior

by underlying happiness.

       The average real (in 1999 dollars) excise tax rate on cigarettes in the US is 31.6 cents,

with a standard deviation of 15.8 cents, while in Canada it is 1.17 Canadian dollars, with a

standard deviation of 39 cents. There is wide variation in excise taxes across states, over time,

and within states over time; 25% of the variation in excise taxes in the United States, and 32% in

Canada, is within states/provinces over time. This allows us to control for fixed state/province

differences in cigarette taxes and happiness in our analysis below, as well as time trends in both.

       Table 1 also shows the means for the key control variables used in our analysis. Some

interesting features are worth noting. Smokers are less educated. For example in the United

States, they have a high school dropout rate of 33% compared to 25% for non-smokers. They are

also more likely to be unemployed and less likely to be out of the labor force, although this likely

largely reflects the fact that the smoking rate is much higher among males. We have endeavored

to use as much as possible a common set of control variables in the two data sets, but the

available variables are not identical (e.g. there are no consistent labor supply measures in the

Canadian GSS).

       Finally, income is available only categorically in the U.S. GSS, in fine gradations until
                                                  15

the top of the income distribution, then in larger intervals and finally a top code. In order to

create a smooth income measure, we have used data from each year’s Current Population Survey

to impute values to each of these larger ranges and the top-coded range. Income is measured

continuously in some years of the Canadian GSS, and in categories in other years; in the latter set

of years, we use the midpoint of the income ranges (or 1.25 times the top value for the upper

range). In the regressions in each country we control for quartiles of the real income distribution.

In Canada, but not in the U.S., data are available on both personal and household income, so we

include measures for both types of income.



Empirical Strategy

       Let Hijt be the happiness of individual i who lives in state j at time t, and Tjt be the real

level of cigarette taxes in state j at time t. A simple regression that relates happiness to cigarette

taxes in the state would be:

(1)    Hijt = α + βj + ηt + δTjt

where βj are state fixed effects and ηt are year fixed effects, respectively. These fixed effects

completely control for any fixed differences between states and between years, which means that

only within-state variation in cigarette taxes is used in the estimation. Though it deals with many

of the obvious endogeneity problems inherent in using state policy, this approach may still have

problems. For example, if states are changing cigarette taxes at different points in their state

business cycle, the estimated ``effect'' may instead reflect the effect of these economic conditions.

Another potential omitted factor from this model is the state spending (or reduced other taxes)

that is financed by cigarette taxation. If we find that higher cigarette taxes lead to a general rise
                                                 16

in happiness that could simply reflect the fact that these revenues are used in a welfare-enhancing

way. Finally, we have the fact that only about a third of our sample smokes on average, so an

impact for smokers could be masked in the full sample.

       To address this problem, we exploit the fact that cigarette taxes should only affect the

happiness of those who are smokers (and former smokers). We can therefore compare the effect

of taxes on this group to taxes on those who do not smoke. We cannot do so by using direct data

on smoking behavior, for three reasons: smoking decisions are endogenous to tax rates; the

happiness effect in our model should operate through both current and former smokers; and

smoking data are only available for a subset of years in both surveys. We therefore compare the

impact of excise taxation on predicted smokers.

       Specifically, we first estimate a regression that relates smoking behavior to the observable

predictors of smoking we see in the GSS data. Most of the variables are available in both

countries, but some are available only in one or the other; we used the broadest set of covariates

possible to generate the best possible prediction of smoking behavior. Our predictors are: age

category and gender interactions; household income quartile dummies; personal income quartile

dummies (Canada only); education categories (high school dropout, high school graduate, some

college, and college graduate); education of the respondents mother and father (by the same

categories; U.S. only); race (white, black, and other; U.S. only); marital status (married,

divorced/separated, widowed, never married); dummies for number of children (U.S.) or

household size (Canada); dummies for full time work, part time work, unemployed, out of labor

force, and whether ever worked (U.S. only); religious attendance (8 categorical values in U.S.

that rise monotonically with attendance; three dummies for weekly, monthly, or annual
                                                         17

attendance in Canada); born in Canada; live in house or apartment (Canada only); own your

house (Canada only); language spoken at home (Canada only); and the state/year or

province/year unemployment rate. We estimate such an equation for each year that has smoking
                                                                                                        10
information, and use that to form a predicted probability of smoking (PREDSMOKijt).

         We then estimate equations of the form:

(2)      Hijt = α + βj + ηt + δTjt + θPREDSMOKijt + γTjt*PREDSMOKijt + ζXijt

where the coefficient of interest is now γ. So we are now asking whether deviations in cigarette

taxes from their state-specific mean cause a relative change in the happiness of predicted

smokers relative to those unlikely to smoke. We also include the set of covariates, X, that were

used to predict smoking, and which may have independent effects on happiness, as well as a full

set of state and year dummies (and, for Canada, month dummies, since some of the Canadian

GSS surveys are carried out throughout the year and we want to capture any seasonality in survey

responses).

         We create dummy variables for the various happiness responses described above, and use

those as our dependent variables. We estimate linear probability models for ease of

interpretation; probit estimates are similar. In estimating all our equations, we adjust the

standard error to allow for both auto-correlation and the grouped data, as suggested by Bertrand,

Duflo and Mullainathan (2001). We do this by performing a White correction that allows for an

arbitrary variance-covariance matrix within states.




10 In years before the first smoking information is available (1973-76 in U.S.; 1985 in Canada), we use the first
available year of information to form the prediction. In years after the last smoking information is available (1994-
98 in U.S.; 1998 in Canada), we use the last available year. In years between, we interpolate from years that have the

                                          Part IV: Results

Basic Results

        Table 2 shows our basic findings. The first three columns focus on American Data, while

the second three focus on Canadian data. Each regression is an OLS estimate of (2), including

covariates, where the dependent variable is a dummy indicating which level of happiness people

chose. Where the covariates used are the same in both countries, we use one row for both

regressions; where they differ, we use separate rows for the U.S. and Canadian cases.

        In the U.S. data, cigarette taxes have a positive but insignificant effects on the probability

of predicted smokers answering “very happy” or “pretty happy”. It has a negative and very

significant effect on the probability of answering “Not happy”. Specifically, the interaction term

between the predicted smoking variable and the tax rate in column (3) is significantly negative.

This suggests that cigarette taxes especially reduce unhappiness amongst those predicted to be

smokers. Our estimated effect here is that each penny of excise taxation reduces unhappiness by

0.156 percentage points among predicted smokers. Given that the effect is focused on reduction

in unhappiness, we focus on this variable for the remainder of our U.S. analysis.

        In the next three columns, we examine the effect of Canadian tax changes on happiness in

the Canadian data. Strikingly, we once again find that higher cigarette taxes make predicted

smokers happier. Taxes raise the probability of predicted smokers answering “very happy”,

while reducing the probability of them answering “somewhat happy” or “unhappy”. Once again,

the statistically most significant effects are found here for unhappiness, where we find that each

cent of excise taxation lowers the odds of being unhappy by 0.048 percentage points. To parallel


smoking information.
                                                19

the U.S. analysis, we focus on this unhappiness measure for the rest of the paper.

       There are two ways to gauge these magnitudes. The first is to contrast the impact of

excise taxation to other predictors of happiness. For example, the results in columns (3) and (6)

suggest that being a predicted smoker with no excise tax raises unhappiness by 7.5 percentage

points in the U.S. and by 9.6 percentage points in Canada. Thus, our findings suggest that a 50-

cent real excise tax on cigarettes would leave predicted smokers as happy as those not predicted

to be a smoker in the U.S., and that a $2.00 real excise tax would have that effect in Canada.

       Alternatively, we find that, conditional on all other Xs, being in the top income quartile

reduces unhappiness by about 7.5 percentage points (relative to the bottom income quartile) in

the U.S., and by about 6 percentage points in Canada (incorporating the impact of being in the

top quartile of both family and personal income). So a 50-cent (in the U.S.) or $1.33 (in Canada)

excise tax would have the same effect. In other words, such an excise tax level would be

equivalent to moving a predicted smoker from the bottom to the top income quartile.

       Both of these exercises imply very large impacts of excise taxes on happiness. But one

difficulty with these types of comparisons is that the effect of the X variables themselves on

happiness may not be well identified. While the impact of cigarette taxes on the happiness of

predicted smokers is, we argue, a well identified relationship, the same cannot necessarily be said

of the impact of factors such as income on happiness; those who are richer may be fundamentally

less happy for other reasons, for example, understating the impact of income on happiness. A

better comparison may be to consider what these results imply for the implications for happiness

of reducing smoking. Estimates of the impact of excise taxes on tobacco expenditures are

generally in the range of -0.5, although Gruber and Koszegi (2002) obtain a higher elasticity of
                                                 20

roughly -0.6 using more recent data. Gruber, Sen and Stabile estimate an elasticity for Canada

of –0.45.

       These estimates suggest that each 10 cent increase in price leads to a 6% decline in

smoking in the U.S. (given the base average real price of 97 cents over our sample period) and a

3% decline in smoking in Canada (given the base average real price of $1.67). Our happiness

regressions suggest that this tax rise is also associated with an decrease in 1.5 percentage points

of happiness amongst all those who are predicted smokers in the U.S., or roughly 10% of

baseline unhappiness among smokers, and 0.46 percentage points among those who are predicted

smokers in Canada, or roughly 7.6% of baseline unhappiness among smokers. Extrapolating,

then, these findings suggest that reducing smoking by 60% would fully remove unhappiness

among smokers in the U.S., and that reducing smoking by 40% would fully remove unhappiness

among smokers in Canada.

       These implied effects are once again quite large. At the same time, the data reviewed

earlier suggests that smoking is a very negative influence in the lives of many smokers so it is

plausible that there could be large effects on happiness from smoking reduction. Nevertheless,

given these large magnitudes, we turn next to specification checks to demonstrate that the

estimates are robust.

       Comparing the results across the countries suggests that a similar level change in taxes

has a much smaller effect in Canada than in the US. One possible interpretation of this could

come from the higher level of base prices in Canada, relative to the U.S. Given these high taxes

already in place in Canada, the remaining pool of smokers may be those with the largest self-

control problems. These smokers may need much larger tax changes to dissuade them from
                                                 21

smoking. This contention is consistent with the fact that the elasticities of smoking with respect

to price are similar across the two countries, despite the fact that base prices are much higher in

Canada.



Specification Checks

       In Table 3, we further explore the sensitivity of our findings to concerns about omitted

state variables that might be correlated with cigarette excise tax policy, focusing on the

“unhappy” variables in both countries. In the first column, we show our basic results from Table

2 for comparison. In the second column, we interact the state/year unemployment rate with

PREDSMOK, to capture any differential impacts of the cycle on the happiness of predicted

smokers and nonsmokers; this has no impact on our estimates. In the third column, we include

state-specific linear time trends to capture any slow-moving trends in tax policy and happiness

that might confound our results; including these trends raises the estimates in both samples. In

the fourth column, we interact a time trend with the predicted smoking measure, to allow for

separate trends in well-being for predicted smokers and nonsmokers; once again, there is little

impact. In the fifth column, we interact each state dummy with PREDSMOK to allow for the

effect of predicted smoking to vary by state; this reduces the estimate somewhat in the U.S., but

raises it in Canada. Overall, our findings are reasonably robust to these controls for slow-moving

trends in the data or heterogeneity in populations across states.

       In Table 4, we address a different worry: that our happiness result arises through the

spending financed by cigarette excise tax increases. Suppose, for example, that government

spending is more redistributive than excise taxation, or at least valued more by the types of
                                                           22

individuals who are predicted to smoke. Then our finding could reflect the happiness effects of

spending, not excise taxation.

         To address this point, we have gathered data on three other state or province taxes: the
                                                                                        11
excise taxes on gas and alcohol, and the state or province sales tax rate.                   We have also gathered

data on state or province real revenues per capita. If this is a spending effect, so long as cigarette

excise revenues are spent in a similar fashion to other tax revenues, then we should see a similar

happiness effect from these other taxes. We therefore add to our regression specification these

tax variables, as well as their own interactions with predicted smoking.

         In column (1), we see the effect of the beer tax, in column 2, the effect of the gas tax, in

column 3 the effect of the sales tax and in column 4, the effect of total state revenues. In all four

cases and in both countries, we see that the inclusion of these variables does not much affect the

initial estimate of the cigarette tax. Moreover, the new interaction terms with other taxes

themselves are never negative and significant, although, for the U.S., there is a marginally

significant negative effect of revenues per capita. For Canada, the interactions with gas and sales

taxes are actually positive and significant, suggesting that higher tax rates on those items raise

unhappiness among predicted smokers. This may reflect the fact that these regressive taxes are

targeted to those low income persons most likely to smoke. But, if anything, they suggest a bias

against our finding for cigarette taxation. Thus there is little evidence that it is spending of tax

money (rather than the tax itself) that is affecting smoker happiness.

         Yet another possibility is that cigarette taxes are somehow spent differently than other


11 The sales tax rate in both countries is an ad valorem rate; the gasoline tax is cents per gallon in the U.S. and cents
per litre in Canada; the alcohol tax is dollars per case of beer in the U.S. and ad valorem rate in Canada. All dollar
tax rates are expressed in real terms.
                                                23

kinds of taxes, so that there remains a happiness effect through the revenue side. We have

investigated this possibility by gathering data on the composition of public spending over the

1977-1999 period, decomposing total spending into spending on: educational services, social

services, transportation, public safety, environment and housing, government administration,

utility expenditures and other spending. We then regressed each of these spending categories on

the different taxes to determine whether the marginal effect of cigarette taxes was different than

the other taxes we have studied. No significant pattern was found. This suggests that differential

spending of cigarette tax revenues does not drive our results.



                              Part V: Alternative Interpretations

       These results so far are consistent with a time inconsistent model. But could they also be

consistent with the time-consistent model? On the surface they are not, but with some

reinterpretations they can be. One possibility is to argue that it is not smokers who are made

happier but instead the spouses and relatives of smokers. Since our identification strategy

compares predicted smokers to predicted non-smokers, our estimates would also include this

externality effect if spouses and relatives have similar background characteristics. They would

then also appear to be predicted smokers.

       Of course, if higher taxes made family members better off, then this would indicate

another potential failure of the standard model: imperfect family utility maximization. That is,

by the same logic that shows that time consistent smokers cannot be made better off by a higher

tax, families of smokers cannot be made better off by a higher tax if the smoker was maximizing

family utility. If family utility was being maximized, and family members were better off with
                                                  24

less smoking, then smoking would have already fallen. But this is a very different type of failure

than that discussed earlier, so it is important to distinguish whether this is driving our results.

         We investigate this possibility in two ways in Table 5. First in columns (1) through (6),

we separately examine the effect by marital status and gender. If our effects are due to individual

internalities, there is no a priori reason to believe the self-control problem ought to be greater for

any particular group (holding constant the predicted level of smoking). If, on the other hand, our

effects were due to intra-family externalities, one would expect differences. Specifically, one

would expect married people to show bigger effects since they are more likely to experience the

externalities of smoking. Moreover, since men smoke more, wives should experience a bigger

externality than husbands.

         In Table 5, we therefore separately estimate our baseline model for married versus single

people and then for four different groups: married men, married women, single men and single

women. In the US data, there is some evidence that married people show a bigger effect, and

that the effect is indeed largest for married women. In the Canadian data, however, the largest

effect is for single men and the effects for singles are much larger than the effects for marrieds.

Thus, the variation across groups seems essentially random and unrelated to the externalities

story.

         In columns (7) through (8), we examine this possibility in a different way. In the U.S.

data, which has information on spousal education and labor supply, we estimate spousal

predicted smoking as a function of the same set of covariates as above, but using the spouse’s

education and labor supply in place of the respondent. This allows us to separately include the

predicted smoking of the spouse and it’s interaction with the tax; unfortunately, this exercise
                                                 25

cannot be carried out in Canada due to the paucity of information on spousal characteristics. In

fact, we do find some weak evidence for a role for spousal smoking in determining own

happiness. The interaction of spousal predicted smoking and the tax is negative and marginally

significant for all married persons; that is, married couples where the spouse is more likely to

smoke are also made marginally better off by the tax. But the inclusion of this term has no effect

on our key estimated interaction of respondent predicted smoking with the tax. Thus, within-

family externalities appear unable to explain our results.

       There is a further complication with interpreting these results as evidence for a time

inconsistent model, however, which is much more fundamental. The key differential prediction

between the time consistent and inconsistent models is over the immediate impact of taxation on

the present discounted value sum of utility. But, in fact, we do not measure the present

discounted value of utility, only happiness at a point in time. This makes interpretation of the

results somewhat more complicated. For a time consistent consumer, the effect of taxes on

today’s utility is clearly negative, but the effect on future happiness can be positive. This is

because reducing smoking today can raise future utility. Put another way, the tax inducing him

to reduce smoking is analogous to an investment in which he bears a cost today (immediate pain

of withdrawal) and reaps a benefit in the future (higher utility tomorrow). Even though the net

effect of this investment on utility is negative, when appropriately discounted, the long-run effect

will be positive. On the other hand, the sophisticated hyperbolic consumer is made immediately

better off by a tax, since they are pleased to have this commitment device made available.

       The problem is that our existing test does not measure the immediate impacts of the tax,

but rather the average impacts over time. Since we are regressing current happiness on current
                                                 26

taxes, our estimated coefficients include the immediate effect of taxes on happiness. But if taxes

are correlated over time, they will also include the lagged effect. Specifically, the more

auto-correlated are cigarette taxes, the more the estimated effect in equation (2) includes the

effect of lagged taxes. Thus, our test cannot rule out that time consistent smokers are being made

better off in the long run, which through serially correlated tobacco taxes appears as an effect of

the current tax on happiness.

       This discussion suggests a stricter test to distinguish these models: examine the

immediate, rather than long run, impact of taxes on happiness. But doing so increases our data

requirements dramatically. To measure the average effect over time, all we require is that,

summed over all periods before and after a tax changes in a state, we have sufficient observations

to identify an impact of a tax change. But, to examine an immediate impact requires having data

in one period on enough observations to distinguish the impact of taxation. This is impossible in

the U.S. GSS. That data has the advantage of many years of data, but the typical sample size in

any year is fewer than 2000 observations, which is then divided over 50 states. When years are

pooled, our state specific sample sizes are sufficient to identify average tax effects. But

identifying immediate effects is impossible.

       The Canadian GSS, however, does permit this comparison. Our Canadian GSS data have

between 9300 and 27,600 observations per year. Moreover, these are divided over only 10

provinces, so that the average province/year cell size is over 2000 observations. Thus, we can

aggregate these data to the province/year level and estimate changes regressions that allow us to

examine immediate impacts of tax changes.

       To do so, we divide our Canadian GSS sample into those likely and unlikely to smoke;
                                                27

the former group is composed of those above the 75th percentile of the predicted smoker

distribution (a 41% chance of smoking or greater), while the latter is composed of those below

the 25th percentile (a 19% chance of smoking or smaller). We then compute the mean level of

unhappiness and excise taxes for each predicted smoker group in each province in each survey

year, and regress the change in mean happiness on the change in mean excise taxes separately for

each group, including a full set of year dummies to capture time trends. For predicted smokers,

this changes regression yields a coefficient of –0.044 (0.016). This result confirms that, for

predicted smokers, there is a short-run negative effect of higher taxes on unhappiness; when

taxes rise, happiness falls. For predicted non-smokers, on the other hand, we obtain an

insignificant estimate of –0.009 (0.008), confirming the causal interpretation of our finding for

predicted smokers.

       Thus, it appears that the impact of taxes on unhappiness does occur in the short run,

which is consistently only with the sophisticated time inconsistent model. Of course, even this

evidence is not dispositive, as our differences are taken over one or more years. If the costs of

quitting are high enough and/or discount rates are high enough, even within one year a time

consistent smoker could be made better off from reducing smoking. But the overall pattern of

findings remains much more consistent with the time consistent alternative than with the rational

addiction model.



                                      Part VI: Conclusions

       The results in this paper have potentially important implications for how policy makers

should view smoking in general and cigarette taxes in particular. In particular, they suggest that
                                                 28

smokers themselves may be made better off by cigarette taxes. This result is inconsistent with

several rational views of smoking that would view such a tax as a pure hindrance on smokers,

and more consistent with behavioral time-inconsistent models in which these taxes may serve as

self-control devices.

       The methodology used in this paper should also have broader interest. Economists are

often concerned with welfare, with how policies affect the happiness of people. Yet there are

few tools for empirically assessing welfare. In the case of smoking, as with many other

behaviors, behavioral reactions to changes in the environment can only provide limited insight

into the welfare implications of policy interventions. Theories that have very different policy

implications can accommodate a variety of behaviors and, as a consequence, empirical work on

behavioral responses can leave us in the dark about welfare.

       Subjective well-being measures provide a possible way to directly address welfare

questions. As our analysis shows, this direct approach is empirically feasible. Happiness

measures may be noisy, but in our case at least, they contain sufficient signal to discern effects of

moderate size policies. This is heartening because happiness data is abundant. In the US, the

GSS is available in moderately large samples for many years. Looking beyond the US, the

Canada data we use is not the exception but rather the rule: many countries, notably in Europe,

collect cross-sections and panel data on happiness. In short, the results in this paper suggest that

by using happiness data, economists may be able to directly assess the impacts of public policy

on well-being.

Notes: Standard errors are in parenthesis and are corrected to allow for correlation within states. "Predicted
Smoking*Unemployment Rate" means that the effect of predicted smoking was allowed to depend on the
unemployment rate in the state. "State Dummies*Trend" means each state was allowed to have its own linear
time trend. “Predicted Smoking*Trend” means that the regression includes an interaction of predicted smoking
with a linear time trend. "State Dummies*PredSmoking" means that predicted smoking was allowed to have a
different effect in each state.
