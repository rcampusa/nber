  Taxes and Cbrporate Investnent in Japapnese Manufacturing



                         ABSTRACP




This paper examines the impact of taxes on the
incentive to invest for the Japanese manufacturing
sector in the postwar period. The idyosyricratic
feature of the Japanese corporation tax system as
compared to the U.S. is the prevelence of tax-free
reserves and the tax deductibility of a part of
taxes paid by corporations in the previous year.
Our formula for the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of
capital incorporates this. The main conclusions are
as follows. While the postulated negative relation
with the cost of capital cannot be found, investment
in Japanese manufacturing shows until 1974 a strong
association with the tax-adjusted Q.       Since the
change in stock prices, not taxes, is the primary
source of changes in Q, the profitability of capital
is the major determinant of investment.

1. Introduction
    The rapid output growth in postwar Japan is characterized by
the high level of investment which has for almost all years been

above 30% of the Gross National Product. Economic theory tells
us that investment is governed by the cost and the benefit of
incremental capital stock.        Financial rate of return and taxes

determine the cost of capital, while the benefit is the profit-
ability of capital that depends on market opportunities and
technology.     The contribution of the neoclassical theory of Hall

and Jorgenson (1971)       is that it showed exactly how taxes
influence the cost of capital. whereas the essential feature of
the Q theory of investment is that the determinants of investment

can be summarized by a single index called the tax-adjusted Q
that combines the cost and the benefit of capital. In order to
understand the high level of investment in Japan, it is necessary
to analyze the relative importance of the cost and the profit-
ability of capital and how taxes affect them. The purpose of
this paper is to do precisely that by examining the relation
between investment, the cost of capital, and Q.

        The Japanese corporation tax system can potentially exercise
profound impact on the incentive to invest. The Corporation Tax
Law specifies the procedure for calculating taxable income and
the applicable tax rates.          The enterprise tax on corporations

paid in the previous accounting year is tax deductible. The
calculation of taxable income also includes accounting deprecia-

tion,     inventory valuation, and a I !owances for   accrued costs that
can be credited to tax-free      reserves. The Corporation   Law   lists
a   few tax-free reserves        and   specifies the maximum amount
creditable to those reserves.     Equally important in examining tax
incentives     is the Special T axation Measures Law, which provides
additional depreciation and a number of other tax-free reserves.
If the Japanese corporation tax system played a major role in the

high-speed      output growth,   it must be that investment was
responsive to the cost of capital.

        The plan of the paper is as follows.. Section 2 incorporates

the various aspects of Japanese tax law into a firm's optimiza-
tion.     Section 3 derives the formula for the cost of capital and
the tax-adjusted Q, and identifies the channels through which
taxes influence investment.       In section 4 we calculate the cost
of capital and the tax-adjusted Q for the Japanese manufacturing
sector as a whole and examine their relationship to investment.
Section 5 is a brief conclusion.
2. Taxes and the Valuation bf a Firm
    Our task in this section is to incorporate various aspects
of the Japanese corporation tax system into a standard model of a
firms value maximization problem. The next section will derive
a one-to-one relationship between the investment-capital ratio
and "Q" adjusted for various tax parameters. For the most part,
we will ignore personal taxes and the financial side of the firm.

Modifications of the investment-Q relationship that are necessary
if those factors are considered will be discussed at the end of

the next section.              Thus for the time being we will focus on a
100% equity financed firm whose investment finance comes from

retained profits.             Because we have to deal with many tax
parameters, the notation will be rather complicated. A glossary
of symbols is provided in Table 1.
        Consider a firm in period 0 whose objective is to maximize
its market value which is the present value of its net cash flow:



(2.1)       V0 =
                    t=0
                           C(0.t)(lIt
                                        —
                                            Tt
                                                 —
                                                     aI)
                                                                   is the
where      C(0,t)         =
                              (1+r0)1(1+r1)'.(1+rt_i)'        r

discounting rate that applies to future net cash flow.              lit is

pretax profits,                is corporate taxes, a is the price of
investment goods, and I. is the quantity of investment.              Under
Japanese tax law the following are the major items                that   are

deductible from corporate income.'
                                                                  4




(I) Depreciation      Allowances.   According   to   the financial
   statements compiled by corporations with the Ministry of
   Finance, virtually all corporations employ either the straight
   line method or the declining balance method.
(ii)   Special      Depreciation.   In addition to the ordinary
   depreciation, the Special Taxation Measures Law lists asset
   types for which additional depreciation for the first year
   (and for some assets, several succeeding years) is permitted.
   Since the cumulative amount of depreciation is unchanged,
   special depreciation amounts to deferred tax payments.

(iii) Investment Tax Credits. Currently, corporations can choose
   for certain types of equipments between a special first-year
   depreciation of 30% and a tax credit of 7% of the acquisition
   cost.     Since the amount of the investment tax credits is
   negligible relative to total investment expenditure, we will
   ignore it.

(iv) Enterprise Tax.       The amount of enterprise tax paid in the
  previous accounting year can be deducted from this year's
   income.      As seen below, the deductibility of the enterprise
  tax reduces the "effective" corporate rate significantly.
(v) Tax-Free Reserves.      The Corporation Tax Law and the Special
  Taxation Measures Law list a host of tax-free reserves that
  can be deducted from income. For most reserves the amount
  deducted must be added back to the next year's income.     In the

  formulation below we assume this is the case for all tax-free
  reserves.2       Thus   tax-free reserves, another veicle for
                                                                         5




  corporations to defer tax payments, is essentially a one-year

  interest-free loan granted by the government. The variable
  that determines the maximum amount to be deducted from
  corporate income and credited to the reserve depends on the
  reserve.      For     example, for the Reserve for Retirement
  Allowance it is the wage bill, and for the Bad Debt Reserve it

  is the amount of receivables. We will divide various tax-free

  reserves into two groups.           The first is employment-related

  reserves.3     The second group consists of reserves whose
  maximum allowable deduction is a function of various other
  variables pertaining to the firm that, we assume, are a
  function of the "size" of the firm, which we take to be the
  reproduction cost of the firm.

     The expression for the tax payment T that incorporates
these features of Japanese tax law is:



(2.2a)                   +                 Income).
                             v)x(Taxable

(2.2b)    Taxable Income =         - DEP   -
                                               S_1
                                                     -     - Rti)

(2.2c)         St =   vx(Taxab1e   Income),



Here, St s the corporate enterprise tax and v is its tax rate.
    is the total amount of corporation taxes including the
national and local corporate tax and the enterprise tax. The
overall tax rate is thus u +v .                In    the expression for the
                                                                                         b




taxable income. R is the maximum amount to he deducted from
income and credited to the tax-free reserves in period t.4 DEPt
is the sum of ordinary depreciation and sped at depreciation.
This can be written as



(2.3)                DEPt =
                                      x= U
                                             D(x.t-x)aI
where        the depreciation formula as of                       t—x, D(x,t—x) includes
special depreciation.

        It    is shown in                    the Appendix that the expression for the
value of the firm under (2.1)—(2.3) can be written as



(2.4) V0 =                                          —
                 C(0.t)((l_Tt)1Tt
                t=0                                     (l—z)aJ   + [Tt_Tt+t/(1+rt)]R)


                 +            —               +
                                  r0R1

where



(2.5)                 =
                          n= 1

                                                  Ytvt,

(2.7)                     =
                              x= 0
                                      C(tt+x)rtD(xt).
                                                                                 7




(2.8)                = E (C(0t)rt[           D(x—x)a...xI_x]}
                       t0              x=1


Some of these rather formidable expressions are standard.
represents        the present value of tax savings arising from
depreciation allowances on a yen of new investment, while Ad                    is

the present value on all assets purchased in the past
         Other notations are novel. The "effective" tax rate t                  is

not      simply the sum of u and v.     A one-yen increase in the current

enterprise tax        means    a tax    saving     of u+v       yen in the next
accounting year.         But   part    of the tax saving, v, which is the
amount of reduction in the next year 's enterprise tax, gives rise
to a tax increase of v(u÷v) in the year after next. This, in
turn, brings about a tax saving of v2(usv) in the following year,

and      so forth. The term y in the expression for t             is   the present
value      of tax changes on a yen of the current enterprise tax.
Th i s     term is rather important: if u = 40%, v = 10% and r = 5%,
its value Is about 43%. That is, for every yen of the enterprise

tax      paid, the firm recovers in the present value sense 0.43 yen.
The last term in the expression (2.4) for the value of the firm
has •a similar        interpretation; it is the present value of tax
changes arising        from the enterprise tax already paid in the
previous year.        The third term in the braces in (2.4) represents
a subsidy in         the form of an implicit interest on a loan of iR

yen.5       Lastly, the term t0R1 is the additional current tax when
the last year's reserves are added back to current income.
                                                                       8




3. The Tax-Adjusted Q and the Cost of Capital

        We now derive a one-to-one relationship between investment
and "Q" adjusted for various tax parameters for the value-
maximizing firm. Assuming that the firm is a price-taker, pretax
profits can be written as


                                       —
(3.1)        lIt =   PtF(KtLt.It)          wtLt.

where p is the output price, F is the production function, K is
the capital stock, L is labor input, and w is the wage rate.
Adjustment costs are incorporated here because output is assumed
to be inversely related to investment, i.e., 3F/31 < 0. "Bolting
down1' new machines is a resource-using activity; as the quantity
of investment increases, a larger fraction of capital and labor
has to be directed to the investment activity, which results in
lower output.

        As we indicated in the previous section, the tax-free
reserves are divided into employment-related reserves (RL) and
other reserves (RK).             The former depends on the wage bill (wL)
while the latter is a function of the reproduction cost of the
firm (aK):


                =
(3.2)
                     RLt(wtLt)    +
                                      RK(aK)
                                                                        9




As   it will turn out, it does not matter in the final expressions

for the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of capital how R is divided
into the two components.

        The firm is assumed to maximize its value in (2.4) subject.
to the capital accumulation constraint


(3.3)        Mt =              +
                    (1—o)Kti

Since     the last three terms in the expression (2.4) for the value

of the firm is predetermined at time 0, the value maximization is

equivalent to maximizing the first term subject to (3.3). That
is, the firm is assumed to maximize



(3.4)          EC(O,t){(l—T )11         —   (l—z')a   I




                        ÷ [Tt_T+1/t1÷rt][RLt(wLt)+RKt(atKt)])


subject to (3.3).        Letting C(0.tLXt be the Lagrange multiplier
for (3.3), we obtain the following first-order conditions:



(3.5a)        (1-rt)PtBFt/BKt +


                                   —
                                            + (l—O)A+1/(1+r)   =   0,


                                                 =
(3.5b)        (1_o)Pt3Ft/91t —         (l—z)a
                                                                                 1 (1




(3.5c)         (!_T)(PaF/aL_w) +                                        =   a.
                                             [Tt—t+1/u+r]aRL/aL1

The last condition yields


(3.6)                         =




where
                                       R 1+r÷ )]
(3.7)          wt =   w
                          t
                                              '
                                                     RL t /3Lt
                                    i—tic


The second term is the reduction in wage rate induced by the
employment-related tax-free reserves. Solving (3.6) for Lt and
substituting it into (3.1), we see that pretax profits are a
function of the real wage w*/p adjusted for tax-free reserves.
If pretax profits in real terms is denoted by                       =            we

obtain by the envelope theorem that


(3.8)          amt(wt/Pt/awt/Pt =


(3.9)         aAt(L4/Pt)/aKt =


        If   there were no adjustment costs, then 3F/31 = 0, so we
have from (3.5b) At =             (1-zpat.        Thus from (3.5a) and (3.9) we
obtain the following expression for the cost p1 capiti:


(3.10)        ant(wyw)/a}ct =       ct.
                                                                                       11




where
                                      —
(311)        Ct —
                     —       (1—z)a        (l—a)(1—z÷1)a+1/(l+rt)
                                          (1 —
                                              Tt)Pt

                         —     [rt_rt+i/u+rt1]aRK/aK
                                          (1 —
                                                  Tt)Pt

The second term represents the reduction in the cost of capital
arising     from             the capital-related tax-free reserves.                 This

expression, however, does not capture the effect of the reduced
wage rate on the marginal profit 3A/3K brought about by the
employment—related              tax-free          reserves.         A    more meaningful
expression would add to c the effect of the employment-related
reserves.     Such an expression can be obtained as follows. Using
(3.8), we obtain the following Taylor expansion:


(3.12)
            aAt(wt/Pt)/aKt            aAt(wt/Pt)/aKt -          (aLt/aKt)(wt-wt)/Pt.

Combining (3.7), (3.10) and (3.12) we get



                                          c.
                                                     -

This expression for the cost of capital is convenient for
evaluating the overall impact of both types of tax-free reserves
on the incentive to invest.

        We now re-introduce adjustment costs.         Noting that the
optimal labor input is a function of w/p and solving (3.5b) for
investment, we obtain the investment-Q relation:


(3.15)        It =   Tt(QtiKtWYPt)

where
                        -    (1—z')a
(3.16)           =
                            - tt)Pt

This 9 is referred to as the tax-adjusted Q.            It is the real

value of the gap between the shadow price of capital (A) and the

effective price of investment goods [(1-z')a], grossed up by the
corporate tax rate. We note from (3.15) that optimal investment
depends also on the adjusted real wage t?/p.          It is clear from

the derivation of this optimal investment rule that if the
production function F in (3.1) has the separable form F(K,L,!) =
G(K.L)    -   C(I,L),   optimal investment rule does not involve the
real wage rate.

     There is a simple connection between the tax-adjusted 9 and
the cost of capital.            By definition, the cost of capital c
satisfies
                                                                                     13

Subtracting    (3.17) from (3.5a) we get


                                             —
(3.18)        (l.r)P(aF/aK — ct)                 [A—(1—z)a]

This can be solved for A-(1-z)a as



(3.19)      A-(1-z)a =         £C(t,s) (1_o)5t(1_15)p5(aF5/3K5_c;).

That is, the tax-adjusted Q is essentially the present value of
the gap between the marginal product of capital and the cost of

capital.      Thus, in the model with adjustment costs, the cost of
capital continues to be an important channel through which taxes
influence investment.

     As shown in l-Iayashi (1982), the shadow price of capital A in

the expression (3.16) for the tax-adjusted Q can be made
observable If we assume that (i) the firm is a price-taker and
(2) the environment represented by the production function is
ii nearly   hornoqeneous .     Tb! s   I at ct   honioqene   it y assumpt ion    i n the
presents    tuat ion has to include the asstiniption             that   RL and RK in

(3.2), the maximum tax-free accumulation of reserves, are also
linearly homogeneous in their respective variables, namely,


(3.20)               =                   and aRKt/aKt =
                         RLt/Lt                           RKt/Kt.

Under this set of assumptions it seems obvious that the iüaximized
value of (3.4) is proportional to the initial capital stock (1-

o)K1.    So the marginal value of capital A0 is equal to the
average value of capital:


                  V - A'    +   t (RL_     +RK   ) -   (l+r   )y S_
            0 —
                                    (l—o)I<i

Thus the tax-adjusted Q as defined in (3.16) is connected to the
value of the firm. Furthermore, under the homogeneity assumption
the investment-Q relation becomes


(3.22)     It/Nt =


This much is standard. A new result here is that the connection
involves the tax-free reserves and the enterprise tax in the
previous year.    The same homogeneity assumption also permits a
simplification of the expression (3.14) for the cost of capital.
Noting that under the homogeneity assumption aL/aK = L/F( and
using (3.20), we get, for       =   0.

For our purpose of empirical implementation, this expression is
convenient because it does not involve the unobservable BL/BK.

     So far we have assumed that there is only one kind of
capital.        The theoretical model can allow for other kinds of
capital provided that there are no adjustment costs associated
with investment in these other assets.                          It is fairly straightfor-
ward to show that the marginal value of the first asset (with
adjustment costs) is given by (3.21) if the market value of other
assets (which equals their reproduction cost because there are no
adjustment costs for those assets) is already subtracted from V0.

In our empirical implementation in the next section, the first
asset      is    depreciable                 assets       (buildings,     structures and
equipments),           while        the other assets consist of land and
inventories.

        We close this section by discussing briefly the issue of
investment finance.                 So far we have assumed an equity-financed
firm that finances investment by retained profits.                                 So the

discount rate r              is the expected equity return and the value of

the firm is the total equity value. How should we modify fl'e
expressions for the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of capita!? The
following results on the investment-Q relation have been obtained
                                                                  16




in Hayashi       (1985) for a model of a firm with adjustment costs
under uncertainty and personal        taxes: (i) the investment-Q
relation can be derived when at least part of incremental
investment is financed either by retained profits or by new
equity;   (ii)    if new equity are used for investment finance, the
value of the firm in the model is simply the sum of equity and
debt outstanding; (iii) if retained profits are used, the equity
value receives a higher weight than debt, provided that the
capital gains tax rate is lower than the dividend tax rate; and
(iv) when incremental investment is financed entirely by debt,
the investment-Q relation cannot be derived. However, the model
is incapable of explaining why corporations in the real world
simultaneously issue new shares and pay dividends. There does
not seem to be any work that derives the cost of capital as the
determinant of investment for a firm without adjustment costs
under uncertainty and personal taxes.         More specifically, it
remains unclear how the discount rate r t         is related to the
corporate bond rate and the expected equity return.6 With no
completely satisfactory theory about how investment finance
influence the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of capital, we will
continue to use the expressions derived in this section, with V0
(the value of the firm) being the value of equity and debt minus
land and inventories.

4. Empirical Results
        The impact of taxes on the incentive to invest can be
evaluated by examining how taxes enter the expressions for the
tax-adjusted Q and the cost of capital. Since they involve the
present value of various forms of tax savings, we have to make
assumptions about how future tax rates and discount rates are
anticipated.        For empirical implementation we assume static
expectations about the tax rates (u, v -r) and the discount rate.
Thus a', A' and r can now be written as


                                                 U,

is    the real discount rate adjusted for changes in the investment
goods price.

        The measurement of the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of
capital for the Japanese manufacturing sector as a whole requires
data on: V (market value of equity plus debt minus land arid
inventories). u (corporate tax rate), v (enterprise tax rate), r
(discount rate), A (present value of depreciation allowances on
past investment), R (tax-free reserves), S (enterprise tax), a
(investment goods price), 6 (physical depreciation rate), K
(capital stock), al (nominal investment), a (present value of
depreciation allowances on new investment), p (output price) and
P    (real rate of return).                            Two prinàipal data sources are the
Ministry of Finance (various fiscal years) and the Tax Bureau
(various fiscal years).                            The former has data on the financial
statements aggregated over all corporations by industries. The
aggregation is done by blowing up the sample aggregates by the
sampling ratio. These data will be referred to as the £11 nçJl
                                                                     19




Statements     data.      The latter has data on taxes paid by
corporations and tax-free reserves allowed by the Tax Bureau.
These data will be referred to as the lix        data.   Since the time

interval for those two primary data is a fiscal year (from April
to the next March), all the calculations below are for fiscal
years.

     The data on V,         A,   a, a! and 1< are taken from a study by

Homma, Hayashi, Atoda and Hata (1984), which calculated the tax-
adjusted Q for various Japanese industries but which did not take
tax-free reserves and the tax deductibility of the enterprise tax

into account.7         Their data are for the period of 1955 to 1981,
and this determined our sample period. The following is a brief
summary of how the data on V, A, a, a! and K are constructed in
their study.       (i) The data on nominal investment are taken from

the Economic Planning Agencys Gross Capital Stock of Private
Firms.    Although the data includes the noncorporate sector, the
numbers      are   very close to the nominal investment series
calculated from the Financial Statements data except that the
latter shows erratic movements for the first few years of the
sample period.         The data on the capital stock is from the
National Wealth Survey. As this survey is done every five years,
the Gross Capital Stock data are used for interpolation. Using
the nominal investment series from the Financial Statements data
and the investment goods price index (to be explained later), I
generated a capital stock series by a perpetual inventory method
with the rate of depreciation of about 9%.          It turned out that
                                                                 20




this capital stock series is very close to the above capital
stock series.                     -


        (ii)   The market value of equity is calculated under the
assumption that the ratio of the market value to the book value
for all corporations in manufacturing Is the same as that for all
corporations in manufacturing traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
In calculating the market value of equity, the average of daily
stock prices over the fiscal year is used. The market value of
long-term debt is obtained by dividing the interest payments by a
long-term interest rate. The market value of short-term debt is
assumed to be the same as the book value. The value of the firm
is the sum of the market value of equity and debt. However, the
stock market valuation of a firm includes the value of land and
inventories, which must be subtracted from the value of equity
plus debt to arrive at the financial valuation of the capital
stock.     A perpetual inventory method is used to calculate the
value of land. The price index for land is the Residential Land
Price Index constructed by the Japan Research Institute of Real
Estates (Nihon Fudosan Kenkyu-Jo). The change in the book value
of land is assumed to be the market value of the change in land.
The market value of land in the base year (1955) is assumed to be
equal     to   the   assesment given by the Ministry of Local
Administration for the purpose of levying property taxes. The
value of inventories       is assumed to be equal to the book value
because the majority of corporations employ the average method
for inventory valuation.
                                                                                21




        (iii) To       calculate A      and z, the data on the depreciation

formula D(x,t) are necessary.           The asset life for tax purposes is

assumed to be 34 years for buildings, 28 years for structures and

10 years for           equipments in 1970.      These numbers are taken from

the National Wealth Survey.                The calculati on incorporates the

major reductions in asset hf etimes for                     tax purposes that
occurred in 1951, 1961. 1964 and 1969. The Special Depreciation
permitted by the Special Taxat ion Measures Law is incorporated
into the depreciation formula                 as follows.     The fraction of
special depreciation in fiscal year t, SP(t                   is defined as the

ratio of the amount of special                 depreci at! on in the Financial

Statements     data to nominal mves              tment.     If d(x,t)   is the
depreciation formula implied by                a given asset lifetime for a
given      depreciation method, the            depreciat ion formula D(x,t)

adjusted for special depreciation is: D(x,t) =                [1—SP(t)]d(x,t)    +


SP(t) for t        =     0    and D(x,t) =    [ 1—SP(t)]d(x ,t) for t > 0. The
implicit     assumption          here    is     that the ratio of special
depreciation, SE, is the same for all asset types                 The yield on

the Japan Telegraph and Telephone Company's bond is used for the
discount rate.         Other information necessary for c alculating A and

z are:      (1) the share of respective deprec 1 at ion methods and (2)

the breakdown          of nom inal investment into the t hree asset types
(buildings, structures and equipments). The data on (1) is taken
from the financial statements of corporations traded on the Tokyo

Stock Exchange.              Since virtually all corporations employ either

the straight line method (about 20%) or the declining balance
                                                                    0




method    (80%), only the two depreciation methods are considered.
This share is assumed to be the same for all asset types. The
data on (2) are not available on yearly basis. The breakdown for
 1975 (calendar year)    is obtained from the capital formation
matrix in the 1975 Input-Output Table. The breakdown is assumed
to be the same as that in 1975 for all years.

     Our construction of the investment goods price index (a) is
as follows. From the capital formation matrix in the 1975 Input-
Output Table, we can obtain the breakdown of nominal investment
by industry source.      We use this breakdown as weights to
calculate the price index as a weighted average of the relevant
components of the Wholesale Price Index. The same weight is used
to calculate the overall depreciation rate (o). The depreciation
rate for individual assets      is taken from Hulten and Wykoff
(198!).    Our estimate of 6 turns out to be 8.99%. We use the
overall Wholesale Price Index for the output price index (p).

     Our estimate of u, v, S and R comes from the Tax data. The
corporate tax rate u is the ratio of the national and local
corporation taxes to the taxable income. The enterprise tax rate
v is the ratio of the enterprise tax to the taxable income. The
figure for S is directly available from the Tax data. The
measurement of R (tax-free reserves)      is more problematical.
There are as of 1981 twenty-eight tax-free reserves listed in the
Corporation Tax Law and the Special Taxation Measures Law. Since

corporations may accumulate the reserves above the maximum amount
specified by the tax law without any further tax heneftts, the
                                                                23




data on reserves available from the Financial Statements data
cannot be used.       Furthermore, the Financial Statements data do

not report tax-free reserves separately; some of the tax-free
reserves are merged with the amount of special depreciation and
other reserves that are not tax-free. On the other hand, the
data on only six major tax-free reserves from 1963 are available

from the Tax data.        They are: Reserve for Bad Debts, Bonus
Reserve, Reserve for Retirement Allowances, Reserve for Price
Fluctuations, Overseas Market Development Reserve for Small- and
Medium-Sized Enterprises, and Reserve f or Overseas Investment

Losses.      The amount credited to these reserves (except for the
last two, which are minor relative to the rest) must be added
back in full in the following accounting year, as assumed in our
theoretical model. For lack of alternative data sources, we use
the total of these six tax-free reserves for R.
        The data thus obtained that are necessary for calculating
the tax—adjusted Q and the cost of capital are gathered in Tables

1   and 2.      The data for 1955 (fiscal year) are not available
because the calculation of Q requires data for the preceding
year.     Table 3 contains the tax-adjusted Q and the cost of
capital along with a couple of variables that summarize the
impact of taxes on the cost of capital. Since no data are
available for R (tax-free reserves) before 1962, our calculation
assumes that the ratio of R to ak (the reproduction cost of
capital) prior to 1963 is the same as that for 1963.      As we can

see by comparing the Q series in Table 3 with the data on the
                                                                            24




Hi ark e   t    value of equity in Table 1, stock prices are the main
source          of variations In Q.        An expected rate of return of 4% is

used           for P in calculating the cost of capital by the formula
(4.5).              We see from this formula that the direct impact of taxes
on th e cost of capital is captured by two terms, (1-rz)/(1-i-)
and            (R/aK)i-r/[(1-rz)(1+r)]. We call the former the tax factor,
which          influences the cost of capital multiplicatively. The
latter          measures the equivalent reduction in the rate of return
caused          by the tax-free reserves. These two terms are shown in
the las t two columns of Table 3. The rate of return equivalence
of the              impact of tax-free reserves is tiny (at most 0.6%). Our
calculati on should, however, be taken as providing a lower bound,

since our data on P includes only six reserves.

           A basic assumption behind the formulas (4.4) and (4.5) is
that           IL     th e amount deducti ble from corporate income,       is

proportional              to the capital    stock.   In order to check the
validity             of     this assumption    we looked at the financial
statements of individual firms in manufacturing publicly traded.
The source of the data is the NEEDS Company Data compiled by the
Nhon Keizai
______                    Shimbun.   From data on accounting depreciation and
the book value of depreciable assets, the market value of the
reproduction              cost of capital CaR) is constructed by a perpetual
inventory method for about 620 firms for the fiscal years 1965 to

1981.           Although thi s data set consists mainly of individual
financial statements,                there is an item that reports since 1976
the maximum amount to be credited to the Reserve for Retirement
                                                                       25



Allowances.      This amount is regressed on the capital stock for
each year. Table 4 reports the regression results. Although the
intercept term is significant, the capital stock coefficient is
very close to that in the regression without the intercept.
      The data in Table 3 are graphed in Figures 1-6. The
investment-capital ratio, the tax-adjusted 9, the cost of capital

and the tax factor are plotted against time in Figures 1 to 4.
The declining trend in the cost of capital is mainly due to the
decline in the price of investment goods relative to the output
price. The tax rate r is the major reason for changes in the tax
factor. The investment-capital ratio is plotted against the tax-
adjusted 9 in Figure 5.           Until 1974 there is a fairly strong
positive relationship between I/K and 9, but since then the
correlation turns into negative. BY historical standards, 9 in
recent Years is too high in relation to investment.                  Two

explanations come into mind for the puzzling behavior of 9 after
1974, both of which rely on the sharp rise in energy prices. The
first is to note that the relationship between I/K and 9 as given
in (3.22) involves real factor prices whose component includes
energy prices. Energy inputs are needed to install new machines
within the firm.         As energy prices go up, the installation
activity gets depressed.         This explanation seems a little far-
fetched.      The second explanation relies on the heterogeneity of
capital .   There   is no ex—post subst tutabi] I ty   between energy and

capital.      Our calculation of the capital stock gives equal
weights to gas guzzlers and gas misers. while in the financial
                                                                  U




markets  gas guzzlers are heavily discounted when energy gets
expensive. However, if this explanation is correct, Q should be
undervalued, which it is not. The behavior of Q in recent years
remains    a puzzle.

        However, Q looks good if compared with the cost of capital.
The plot of 1/1< against the cost of capital in Figure 6 shows a
positive correlation.




5. Conclusion

        While the postulated negative relationship with the cost of
capital does not exist, investment in Japan shows, at least until
1974,     a strong positive association with the tax-adjusted Q.
However, most of the action in Q comes not from taxes but from
stock prices.          As stock prices are a good summary of future
profitability, we may conclude that market opportunities and
technological change have been the major driving force behind the
high invstment level in postwar Japan.
Appendix: Derivation of the Valuation Formula
             In this appendix we derive the formula (2.4) in the text.

             Comb i n i ng   (2.1), (2.2a) and (2.2b). the value of the firm is

written as



(A.1) V0 =              £C(0.t)[(1—ut—vt)1r

Substituting           (A.5) into (A.1) we obtain

The summation in the second line can be rewritten as:

            trO ira         [csotut+vtvtivut2)Y.]

        =

             a,
        =

where

(A.9)
                  yt         C(tt+n)(ut+ntvt÷n)V(t+1t+n_1).
                                                                                         29



Using        this            the summation in the third line can be rewritten
as




              C(0,t)[(u+v t)vti V(0,t—2)}S
                               t




        =                   ,n-1 ) (Un

        =
             —(1+r1)y1S1.

Thus (A.8) becomes

                                                                 aI]   + (1+r1)y1S1


        = C(O.t)[(I_ttflt                  -            +
                                                             (1+r1)y1S1,


        +          C(0.t)TtDEPt +              C(0,tYr (R —Rti).
             t=o                         t=o


where

(A.Il)                     It = Ut   + v


        Now. it is shown in Flayasiui (1982) that the second summation
in      A.   10) the present. value of ItDEP* where DEPt                    is defined   in

                                                                      .-) U




(A.!2)           C(Ot)(1—a)aIt +
                t=Q


where z         and A are defined in the text [see (2.7) and (2.8)].

Furthermore,      it is easy to show that the third summation in
(A.1D) becomes



(A.13)         C(Ot)rt(Rt—Rt_i)         C(Ot)[T_i-t+l/(1+rt)lRt T9R
         t=o                      t=o


Substituting (A.12) and (A.13) into (A.1O) we obtain the formula

(2.4) in the text.
                                                                 :3 I




Footnotes

1. For a good description of the Japanese corporation tax system,
see An Outline of Japanese Taxes published by the Printing Bureau
under authorization of the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance.

2. For a few tax-free reserves, the law permits corporations to
spread the amount to be added back to income over several years.
The tax-free reserves for which the data are available to us are
the types described in the text.

3. The Reserve for Retirement Allowances and the Bonus Reserve
are examples.    In the theoretical model we will assume for such
reserves that the amount creditable to the reserve is a fraction
of the current wage bill and that the amount credited must be
added back in full to the next year's income. However, the
Reserve for Retirement Allowances does not exactly satisfy this
assumption.   According to the law, the amount creditable to this
reserve during the current year is either (i) the difference over
the year in a hypothetical total severance pay that the firm must
pay if all the employees retire now, or (ii) a fraction of the
current total wage bill. Furthermore the amount to be added back
to income is the actual severance pay during the current year.
So if the firm hires a worker, it can deduct from income either
the hypothetical severance pay accruing to the worker or the
fraction of the worker's current salary, and the corresponding
increase in income occurs when the worker actually retires, which
may be several decades from now. Let R be the amount accumulated
in the reserve.      If the firm    chooses U) above, R is the
hypothetical total severance pay. If the firm chooses (ii), the
change in R is the fraction of the current wage bill. Provided
that the present value of the future corresponding increase in
income is negligible, the tax benefit arising from this reserve
comes only from the decrease in current income, which equals the
change in R.     This is equivalent to the assumption in the text
that the firm can deduct from current income the entire amount R
but that the previous year's R must be added back in full to
current income.

4. For the Reserve for Retirement Allowances, R is the amount
that has been accumulated. See footnote 3.

5. That the tax-free reserves influence the cost of capital
through this term was noted in Ikemoto, Tajika and Yui (1984).

6. Auerbach (1979) shows that the discount rate is a weighted
average of the corporate bond rate and the expected equity rate
of return for a case where there are no uncertainties but where
the corporate bond rate is an exogenously given function of the
debt-equity ratio.
