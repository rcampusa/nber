                                               ABSTRACT

We describe the Medicaid eligibility rules for the elderly. Medicaid is administered jointly by the
Federal and state governments, and each state has significant flexibility on the details of the implementation.
We document the features common to all states, but we also highlight the most salient state-level differences.

There are two main pathways to Medicaid eligibility for people over age 65: either having low assets
and income, or being impoverished due to large medical expenses. The first group of recipients (the
categorically needy) mostly includes life-long poor individuals, while the second group (the medically
needy) includes people who might have earned substantial amounts of money during their lifetime
but have become impoverished by large medical expenses. The categorically needy program thus only
affects the savings decision of people who have been poor throughout most of their lives. In contrast,
the medically needy program provides some insurance even to people who have higher income and
assets. Thus, this second pathway is to some extent going to affect the savings of the relatively higher
income and assets people.

Introduction
      Expenditures on medical care by Medicaid and Medicare, America’s two main public
health insurance programs, are large and growing rapidly. Although Medicare is the main
provider of medical care for the elderly and disabled, it does not cover all medical costs. In
particular, it covers only a limited amount of long-term care expenses (e.g., nursing home
expenses). The principal public provider of long-term care is Medicaid, a means tested program
for the impoverished. Medicaid now assists 70 percent of nursing home residents,2 and helps the
elderly poor pay for other medical services as well. In 2009, Medicaid spent over $75 billion on
5.3 million elderly beneficiaries.3
      An important feature of Medicaid is that it provides insurance against catastrophic medical
expenses by providing a minimum floor of consumption for households. Although Medicaid is
available only to “poor” households, middle income households with high medical expenses
usually qualify for assistance also. Given the ongoing growth in medical expenditures Medicaid
coverage in old age is thus becoming as much of a program for the middle-class as for the poor
(Brown and Finkelstein (2008)).
      Another important feature of Medicaid is that it is asset and income tested; in contrast,
almost all seniors qualify for Medicare. This implies that Medicaid affects a household’s saving
decisions not only by reducing the level and risk of its medical expenses, but also by
encouraging them to consume their wealth and income more quickly in order to qualify for aid
(Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes, 1995). Although Medicaid covers poor people of all ages, this
paper focuses on Medicaid’s rules on the elderly.
      Many recent proposals for reforming Medicaid could have significant effects on the
financial burdens of the elderly, on the medical expense risk that they face, and on their saving
decisions. Moreover, Medicaid is a large and growing component of the Federal budget. The
share of total federal, state and local government expenditures absorbed by Medicaid has risen
from less than 2 percent in 1970 to almost 7 percent in 2009,4 and is expected to increase even

more in the future. Medicaid costs control is an important component in correcting the Federal
government’s long-term fiscal imbalance.
     In this paper, we describe the Medicaid rules for the elderly and discuss their economic
implications. We focus on the rules for single (i.e., never married, divorced or widowed)
individuals, to avoid the additional complications involved in considering couples. The main
difference between singles and couples is that the income and asset limits for eligibility are
higher for couples.
     Medicaid is administered jointly by the Federal and state governments, but each state has
significant flexibility on the details of the implementation, hence, there is large variation across
states in income and asset eligibility and in coverage. This variation may well provide elderly
people in different states with different saving incentives, and it might even encourage them to
move from one state to another. We focus on finding the features common to all states, and
identifying the most salient state-level differences.




Overview of the Medicaid program
     Medicaid and Medicare were created by Social Security Amendments of 1965. Although
the program was initially intended to cover for the population on welfare (recipients of AFDC,
SSI etc.), over time new legislation has expanded coverage to non-welfare recipients
overwhelmed by their medical costs. Table 1 provides a chronology of important Medicaid-
related legislation for the elderly. Two key themes emerge from table 1. First, Medicaid has
increased the number of services provided over time. Second, Medicaid has attempted to limit
the abuse of the system by using increasingly stringent and comprehensive asset tests.

     For our purposes, it is useful to divide elderly Medicaid recipients into three groups: (1) the
categorically needy, whose low income and assets qualifies them for Medicaid. This includes
those who qualify for Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI) as well as “dual eligibles”, whose
Medicare deductibles and co-pays are covered by Medicaid; (2) the institutionalized medically
needy, who qualify for Medicaid because their financial resources do not cover their nursing
home expenses; and (3) the non-institutionalized medically needy, who qualify for Medicaid
because their financial resources cannot cover catastrophic non-institutional medical expenses.
Each group faces different sets of asset and income tests.

      Figure 1 presents data on Medicaid enrollment and expenditures. In 2008 Medicaid spent
roughly $75 billion5 on 5.3 million beneficiaries ages 65 and older (data from the Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services). These data provide information on the number of people and
expenditures in the different groups. Of those ages 65 and older, SSI recipients accounted for
40% of all beneficiaries and 27% of all Medicaid expenditures. “Dual eligibles” represent 29%
of all beneficiaries and 9% of all Medicaid expenditures, represent the second largest group of
Medicaid beneficiaries. “Medically Needy” individuals represent 10% of all beneficiaries and
23% of all expenditure. “Others”, largely coincides with those with catastrophic medical
expenses, but not technically “Medically Needy”, and represent 29% of all beneficiaries and
41% of all expenses. Although the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services technically refers
to “Others” as categorically needy, a large share of this group are what we will refer to as
medically needy because their circumstances (catastrophic medical expenses) are more like those
of the strictly medically needy than those of the other categorically needy groups.

  Data from MSIS cited in figure 1 show $68.3 billion, but these data do not include certain payments such as
Medicare premia paid for dual eligibles. For this reason the MSIS data likely understates dual eligibles’ share of
total expenditures. Also, the MSIS catagories are slightly different than those in figure 1. However, virtually all
“cash recipients” over 65 are those receiving SSI and virtually all “poverty related” individuals over 65 are dual
eligibles.

The categorically needy: SSI beneficiaries
        In most states, SSI recipients qualify for Medicaid as categorically needy recipients. Under
the Social Security Amendments establishing SSI in 1972, states were mandated to provide
elderly SSI recipients with Medicaid benefits. The law exempted states that in 1972 were using
Medicaid eligibility criteria stricter than the newly enacted SSI criteria (Gruber, 2000.) The 11
states that had the more restrictive rules for Medicaid are referred to as 209(b) states (Gardner
and Gilleskie, 2009).6
        SSI pays monthly benefits to people with limited incomes and wealth who are disabled,
blind, or are 65 years and older. There is a (maximum) monthly SSI benefit that is paid for by
the Federal Government. States can supplement this benefit. Figure 2 plots the federally-
provided monthly SSI benefit from 1975 to present. Table 2 shows the state-level supplements
for all states that have offered a supplement over the sample period. In contrast to the federal
benefit, which in real terms has been constant, the state supplements have varied greatly over
time as well as across states.
        To qualify for SSI, individuals must pass both an income test and an asset test. In non-
209(b) states, the income test is based on the combined Federal and state maximum monthly
benefit. Individuals with no income receive this maximum monthly benefit if they pass the asset
test.    Otherwise, each individual’s “countable income” is deducted from the maximum to
produce a net benefit. In most states individuals receiving any benefit, no matter how small, are
categorically eligible for Medicaid. This implies that the implicit marginal tax rate for the
threshold dollar of countable income – the incremental dollar that pushes the individual over the
income threshold – is extremely high, because that last dollar of income eliminates the
individual’s Medicaid coverage.

    Data converted to 2010 dollars using the CPI.


          The conversion of actual income into countable income depends on whether the income is
earned or unearned. Earned income consists of financial or in-kind income from wages, self-
employment (net), and sheltered workshops.7 Each dollar of earned income in excess of $65
counts as 50 cents of countable income. Unearned income includes Social Security benefits,
worker or veteran compensation, annuities, rent, and interest from assets. Each dollar of
unearned income counts as one dollar of countable income. In addition, the first $20 of income,
earned or unearned, is disregarded; the amount varies slightly across states. By way of example,
in 2010 the maximum Federal benefit for single, aged SSI recipients is $674. To qualify for SSI,
an individual must have less than $6742 + $65 + $20 = $1,433 of earned income, or $674 + $20

 Sheltered workshops are organizations that provide employment to people with disabilities (Sheltered Workshops.
Inc, 2011).

= $694 in unearned income. Finally, several types of income, most notably Food Stamps, are
excluded from the income test.8
          The income standards used by the 209(b) states do not have to follow this formula, although
some do. The law only requires that the states impose criteria no stricter than those in effect in
1972 (Green Book, 2004).
          The asset test is more straightforward. Individuals with assets at or below the state-specific
threshold qualify. Individuals with assets above the threshold do not qualify. This implies that
the implicit marginal tax rate for the threshold dollar of assets is extremely high, as that last
dollar of assets eliminates the individual’s SSI and Medicaid benefits. Such a penalty provides a
strong disincentive to saving, and encourages people to spend down their assets until they fall
below the threshold. The asset threshold varies across states, with a modal value of $2,000. It is
also the case, however, that many important categories of wealth are exempt, including one’s
principal residence. Table 3 lists assets that are excluded for elderly individuals:

                               Assets Excluded from the SSI Asset Test
    1.    The home you live in and the land it is on, regardless of value
    2.    Property that you use in trade (gas station, beauty parlor, etc.)
    3.    Personal property used for work (tools, equipment, etc.)
    4.    Household goods and personal effects
    5.    Wedding and engagement rings
    6.    Burial funds (up to $1,500)
    7.    Term life insurance policies (regardless of face value) and whole life insurance policies (with face
          value up to $1,500)
    8.    One vehicle (regardless of value)
    9.    Retroactive SSI or Social Security Benefits for up to nine months after you receive them (includes
          payments received in installments)
    10.   Grants, scholarships, fellowships, or gifts set aside to pay educational expenses for up to
          9 months after you receive them.
    11.   Some property may be partially excluded, such as the property used to produce goods or services
          needed for daily life, and non‐business property that produces income such as rented land, real
          estate, or equipment.

  In addition to Food Stamps, the exempt categories include income that is set aside towards an approved plan for
achieving self support (used by the blind and disabled to pay off educational or vocational goals), and certain types
of assistance for home energy needs.

      Table 4 shows the current income and asset thresholds for each state. The 209(b) states
appear at the bottom of the table.        The only common factor across 209(b) states is that
individuals have to apply for Medicaid separately from their SSI Benefit application. Although
some of the 209(b) states impose tighter income or asset restrictions for Medicaid, SSI eligibility
implies Medicaid eligibility in most of these states.

The categorically needy: dual eligibles


      “Dual eligibles” are individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid and have Medicaid pay
Medicare premia. Medicare covers basic health services, including physicians and hospital care,
for the elderly. Medicare Part B, which covers outpatient services such as doctor visits, costs
$96.40 per month. As a dual eligible, an aged individual can get Medicaid to cover Medicare
premiums and services that Medicare does not cover. Depending on their income, dual eligibles
can qualify as Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB’s), Specified Low Income Beneficiaries
(SLMB’s) or Qualified Individuals (QI’s). QMB’s are assisted with Medicare Part B premiums
and co-payments. In most states the QMB income limit is 100% of the Federal Poverty Level
($903 for single elderly people), and the asset limit is $6,600. However, 9 states (including New
York) do not impose any asset limits, and a subset of these states also provide more generous
income limit and disregard amounts. SLMB’s are elderly individuals with income between
100% and 120% of the Federal Poverty Level. SLMB’s are assisted with premiums only. QI’s
are individuals with income between 120% and 135% of the poverty level who, depending on
funding availability, may receive assistance with Medicare Part B premiums.         (The Kaiser
Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2010a and 2010b.) Table 5 shows the asset and
income limits for QMB’s, SLMB’s and QI’s.

The medically needy


       Individuals with income or assets above the categorically needy limits may nonetheless not
have enough resources to cover their medical expenses. Under the medically needy provisions,
Medicaid pays part of these expenses, thus preventing destitution. The implementation of
medically needy coverage, however, varies greatly across states and types of medical care. The
types of care covered under these arrangements include institutional (long–term) care, home and
community based service (HCBS) care.

                                                         14
     As pointed out above, the term “medically needy” has both a loose and a strict definition.
The loose definition we use refers to all programs for receiving Medicaid due to catastrophic
medical expenses. However, in formal Medicaid language, the term “Medically Needy” refers to
just one of several mechanisms for coping with unaffordable medical expenses. As a rule we
will use the lower-case term “medically needy” to refer to the loose definition, and the upper
case term “Medically Needy” to refer to the formal program.


Figure 3 presents a diagram of how individuals may qualify for medically needy coverage under
the various provisions.    In addition to having different mechanics, the provisions impose
different asset and income thresholds. For example, Medicaid imposes more generous asset
limits for non-institutional care. We discuss these provisions below.

The institutionalized medically needy


      We begin by looking at provisions for institutional (i.e., nursing home) care.9                         If an
institutionalized elderly individual’s monthly income is within 300% of the SSI limit, then she
qualifies for Medicaid (Gruber, 2000) in 39 states plus the District of Columbia through the
expanded nursing home provision. Virtually all of the person’s income will still be applied
towards the cost of care, and the individual will get an allowance. If an institutionalized person’s
income is greater than 300% of the SSI limit, but still insufficient to cover her medical expenses,
she may qualify for Medicaid through one of two mechanisms. The first is use the formal
Medically Needy provision, which can be used for any sort of medical expense, to cover
institutional care. The individual will have a “spend down” period that lasts until her net income
– income less medical expenses – falls below the Medically Needy threshold. After qualifying
as medically needy, the person still has to direct most of her income to pay for her care. She can
keep only a small amount as a personal allowance, while Medicaid uses the rest to keep the
individual at the institution (Gruber, 2000).
      The second mechanism for receiving institutional care is to use a Qualified Income or
Miller Trust. Income deposited in these trusts is excluded from the Medicaid tests.                            The
individual deposits enough income in a trust to fall below the 300% limit and qualify for
expanded nursing home coverage. Once the individual passes away, the state receives any
money remaining in the trust, up to the amount that Medicaid has paid on the individual’s
behalf.10 (Weschler, 2005.)
      Of the 39 states offering enhanced nursing home coverage, 25 also offer Medically Needy
coverage. The remaining 15 states are required by Federal law to allow applicants to use Miller
Trusts. Four of the states that provide medically needy coverage permit Miller Trusts as well
(Stone, 2002.)
      Of the 11 states not offering expanded nursing home coverage, 9 offer Medically Needy
coverage. The difference between these states and the states offering expanded nursing home

Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured (2010).

   Prior to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act in 1993, it was acceptable to place extra income in
a self-created discretionary fund to acquire Medicaid coverage. Since 1993, apart from limited trusts such as the
Miller or Qualified Income Trusts, most discretionary trust funds are treated as countable income or assets and may
restrict people from obtaining Medicaid. (See Goldfarb, 2005.)

                                                        17
nursing home is that individuals in these states are not automatically eligible for Medicaid
nursing home care if their income is below 300% of the SSI level. However, given that most
individuals in nursing homes incur medical expenses far greater than 300% of the SSI level,
there is little practical difference in Medicaid eligibility across the different states.                          All
individuals with incomes below 300% of the SSI level in either type of state will deplete all their
resources and will be eligible for Medicaid nursing home care through the Medically Needy
program. The remaining two states, Indiana and Missouri, lack both provisions. However,
Indiana and Missouri are both 209(b) states. To reduce the hardships that SSI beneficiaries may
face in 209(b) states, Federal rules require these states to allow individuals to spend down to the
states’ income and asset limits for Medicaid.11 The rules thus mandate that 209(b) states offer
the equivalent of a Medically Needy program, even if the states do not formally offer the
Medically Needy option (Smith et al., 2000). Four 209(b) states – Indiana, Missouri, Ohio and
Oklahoma – offer a spend-down provision in accordance with this mandate. With this provision
in place, institutionalized individuals in every state have at least one way to qualify for Medicaid
if they are destitute and institutionalized.
      Table 6 shows the provisions offered in each state, and the associated income and asset
limits. In most states, the Medically Needy income limits (income less medical expenses) are
stricter than the income limits for the categorically needy.12




11
    The mandate is in the 2000 House Bill 1111, Section 11.445, which specifies that an individual eligible for or
receiving nursing home care must be given the opportunity to have those Medicaid dollars follow them to the
community and to choose the personal care option in the community that best meets their needs (Neisz, 2002).
12
   This raises the possibility of a discontinuity in coverage. An individual whose income is $1 above the categorically
needy limit may need to spend a considerable amount to qualify under the Medically Needy provision. However, in
practice the discontinuity in coverage is unimportant in most cases because institutionalized Medicaid recipients
must spend almost all of their income on their care. The median cost of nursing home care, $5,550 per month in
2010 Whether an individual’s income is slightly more or less than 300% of the SSI limit ($6743 = $2,022),
Medicaid will still provide a nursing home, but all of their income must be put towards the cost of the nursing home.

        Medicaid’s ability to recover assets from the estate


        The asset limits presented in Table 6 are similar to the asset limits for the categorically needy
        presented in Table 4. There are two key distinctions between the two sets of asset tests, both
        relating to their treatment of housing. First, the Medicaid asset test for the categorically needy
        excludes the individual’s principal residence, whereas the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005
        stipulates that the Medicaid asset test for the medically needy places limits on the amount of
        home equity that is excluded. Although there are limits on the amount of home equity that can
        be excluded, the second to last column of Table 6 shows the limits are quite generous.13 Second,
        and more importantly, houses owned by institutionalized individuals who do not plan to return to



        13
             If a spouse or dependent resides in the house, the equity limits do not apply. (ElderLaw, 2011.)

                                                                    21
that house no longer serve as principal residences.14                   Therefore, the home equity of that
individual is not longer excluded from the asset test. More precisely, the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (2005b, page 2) states that an individual’s house is included in the
asset test when he “has no living spouse or dependents and: moves into a nursing home or other
medical institution on a permanent basis without the intent to return; transfers the home for less
than fair market value, or; dies.”          An essential part of the definition is “the intent to return”
provision, designed to exempt individuals whose stay at the institution is temporary. In most
states, the intent to return is based on the beliefs of the institutionalized individual, with no
reference to the individual’s underlying medical condition. Only the 209(b) states are allowed to
use more objective criteria, such as a professional medical diagnosis or the duration of stay, to
assess the likelihood that the individual might return to his home. A mechanism that is available
to non-209(b) states is to restrict the institutionalized individual’s income allowance so much
that the individual can no longer cover property taxes and maintenance costs, forcing her to sell
her home.       However, individuals may be able to resist such “squeezes” by using reverse
mortgages to fund taxes and maintenance. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
2005b.)
      Once an individual dies his home ceases to be protected. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act
of 1993 requires states to seek from beneficiary estates reimbursement for long-term care, both
in-house and institutional, and services provided concurrently with long-term care. However,
states cannot pursue homes occupied by the beneficiary’s spouse or dependents (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2005a). Furthermore, because the state may be one
of many claimants to the estate, and given the general complexity of estate law – which in a few
states explicitly protects estates from Medicaid claims – Medicaid collects relatively little money
from estates.15 In 2004, estate recoveries equaled 0.8% of Medicaid spending on nursing homes,
with the most successful state, Oregon, recovering 5.8% of its nursing home expenditures. (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2005d.) Table 7 provides information on asset
recovery practices and outcomes.
14
   The inclusion of housing in the asset tests for institutionalized individuals applies to the categorically needy as
well as the medically needy. Most categorically needy individuals, however, do not hold significant housing equity.
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2005b).
15
   States do not have to pursue an estate if they judge pursuit to not be cost-effective. The definition of “cost-
effective”, not surprisingly, varies across states. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2005a).

        One device states use to enhance their recovery prospects is to place liens on their
beneficiaries’ assets. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TERFA) of 1982 allows
states to place liens on the homes of permanently institutionalized Medicaid beneficiaries. After



                                                        24
the beneficiary dies, states may also place “post-death” liens on her estate. (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, 2005c.)
     TERFA liens can help states protect themselves from abuses of the “intent to return”
provision. While the “intent to return” is generally based on the subjective opinion of the
beneficiary himself, TERFA liens may be established on the basis of objective criteria. (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2005c.) Table 8 summarizes the criteria states use.
     TERFA liens also protect states if a beneficiary attempts to transfer the house to a third
party (e.g., a child) prior to applying for Medicaid. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 extended
Medicaid’s “look-back” period from the three years preceding application to five years.
Transfers made during the look-back period are subject to Medicaid review. If the applicant is
found to have made a net transfer, i.e., sold some of his assets at prices below their fair market
value, his eligibility will be delayed. (ElderLaw, 2011.)
     The degree to which elderly individuals transfer their assets in order to become eligible for
Medicaid has been the subject of several studies. These studies find that the elderly transfer little
if any of their money to their heirs for the purpose of making themselves eligible for Medicaid.
Thus extending the “look back” period past five years or more aggressive pursuit of transferred
assets is unlikely to defray much of Medicaid’s expenses. Norton (1995) argues that elderly
individuals are more likely to receive transfers in an attempt to avoid Medicaid. In contrast,
Bassett (2007) finds that “the self-assessed probability of entering a nursing home is a significant
determinant of making an asset transfer.” Bassett estimates that in 1993 there were about
$1 billion “Medicaid-induced” asset transfers, equaling about 3 percent of total Medicaid
expenditures. Many of the people making the transfers, however, did not receive Medicaid long-
term care benefits, implying a smaller final cost to Medicaid. Waidmann and Liu (2006) study
asset transfers over the period 1995-2004. They conclude that “even the most aggressive pursuit
of transferred assets would recover only about 1% of total Medicaid spending for long-term
care.” Reviewing the literature, O’Brien (2005) concludes that the evidence “do[es] not support
the claim that asset transfers are widespread or costly to Medicaid.” In summary, the evidence is
mixed whether the elderly give or receive transfers to affect the Medicaid eligibility. However,
there is a clear consensus that these transfers are small relative to the size of Medicaid transfers.

The non-institutionalized medically needy
           The structure of Medicaid coverage for non-institutionalized medically needy individuals
is similar to that for those in institutions. Individuals with specific needs such as home health
care can qualify under provisions tailored to those needs. Individuals not qualifying under these
limited provisions can qualify under the general medically needy provision, if their state offers it.


                                                     26
     Individuals needing long-term care can often substitute home-based care for care at a
nursing home or another institution. To promote the use of home-based care, states can utilize
1915(c) Home and Community Based Service Care (HCBS) waivers, which give them additional
flexibility in how they provide these services (Smith et al., 2000). Services that can be offered
under an HCBS waiver range from traditional medical services such as dental care and skilled
nursing services to non-medical services such as case management and environment
modification.
     In most states, the income test used for 1915(c) waivers is the same as the one used for
expanded nursing home coverage, namely 300% of the SSI limit. Other states (e.g., California)
impose more stringent tests. 23 states (including Arizona) allow the use of Miller Trusts. As
with the expanded nursing home program, beneficiaries are expected to direct their income
toward the cost of their expenses. The income allowances, however, can be and vary greatly
across states. (Walker and Accius, 2010.)
     The asset limits for 1915(c) applicants are the ones for the categorically needy. (Stone,
2002.) Housing is excluded from the asset test, but the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993
requires states to pursue estates for the cost of long-term care. On the other hand, states do not
have to pursue costs when they judge declares it not to be cost-effective. (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, 2005a.) Given the limited success of estate recovery in general, it
is unlikely to play a large role in the case at hand.
     Some states limit access by requiring 1915(c) beneficiaries to exhibit difficulties in
performing at least three Activities of Daily Living; functional eligibility for nursing homes
requires only two. Most states impose limits on how much they spend per year for Home and
Community Based Service Care. Furthermore, states are free to choose how many applications
to approve. They are also free to limit the number of waivers.16 Many states have more
individuals in need of waivers than open “slots”, and thus operate waiting lists. (The Kaiser
Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2009). Table 9 summarizes the 1915(c) HCBS
waiver programs offered by each state.


     16
          For example, New Hampshire and Michigan limit 1915(c) waivers for the aged to those who are also
disabled. Only two states, Arizona and Vermont do not offer HCBS waivers, and Arizona offers a similar program.
(Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2011).


                                                      27
       In addition to utilizing 1915(c) waivers, states can provide HBCS services under two other
provisions: the federally-mandated home health benefit provided by all states; and the optional
personal care benefit, which in 2006 was provided by 31 states. In 2006, the two programs
incurred 34% of total HCBS expenditures and assisted 61% of the HCBS beneficiaries. Most
states screened applicants to these programs with the income and asset tests for categorically
needy recipients. There is variation in the financial eligibility limits states require to get this
benefit. Some states keep it at the 300% level, but others restrict further. Many states also
provide a medically needy spend-down option. (The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the
Uninsured, 2009.)

The non-institutionalized medically needy:other pathways


        For individuals unable to qualify under any of the preceding pathways, the Medically
Needy provision provides an important “last chance” opportunity to qualify for Medicaid
(Crowley, 2003). The income and asset levels for the non-institutionalized Medically Needy
applicants are the same as ones for institutionalized individuals presented in Table 6. Similarly,
non-institutionalized individuals with high incomes end up paying most if not all of their medical
expenses before they receive aid.
        Because the income limits for the Medically Needy provision are usually stricter than the
limits for the “income needy” (e.g., the Categorically Needy, Dual Eligibles, and certain HCBS
beneficiaries) non-institutionalized individuals also face a possible discontinuity in coverage. In
consequence, the penalty to being Medically Needy rather than income-needy may be
significant.




                                                        30
     By way of example, consider two individuals in Pennsylvania. Both individuals require
health care costing $500 per month. The first individual has a monthly income of $900 month,
which in Pennsylvania allows him to qualify as categorically needy (Table 4). This person pays
nothing for medical care. The second individual has a monthly income of $1,100, who does not
qualify as categorically needy. Deducting medical expenses leaves her with a net income of
$600, which is above Pennsylvania’s Medically Needy net income limit (Table 6). In short,
receiving an additional $200 of income costs the second person $500 of Medicaid benefits. The
quantitative importance of these discontinuities is of course an empirical matter, depending both
on the formal provisions and their practical application by Medicaid administrators.


Discussion
     In a number of recent studies, the joint effect of Medicaid and public assistance programs
such as SSI is modeled as a consumption floor: if an individual is not able to cover her medical
expenses and purchase a minimal amount of consumption, the government will cover the
difference (Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes, 1995; Palumbo, 1999; De Nardi, French and Jones,
2010; French and Jones, 2011). Is this a reasonable approximation of the Medicaid system?
     Our review suggests that the effective consumption floor provided by Medicaid varies
greatly by income and asset levels, and medical conditions. Individuals in nursing homes are
given much smaller allowances, and are more likely to forfeit the value of their house, than non-
institutionalized individuals. This distinction has been recognized by Brown and Finklestein
(2008), among others. The extent to which institutionalized individuals must surrender their
homes depends on a number of factors, including the interpretation of the “intent to return”, the
willingness of the state to impose liens, and the effectiveness of estate recovery, all of which
vary across states.
     We also find the potential for discontinuities in coverage. Medicaid recipients can be
placed in two groups. The first is the “income needy,” who receive benefits because they have
low income.      Income needy individuals include those receiving expanded nursing home
coverage, many recipients of HCBS services, and Dual Eligibles, as well as the categorically
needy. The second group is the “expenditure needy” who receive benefits because their medical
expenses are large relative to their income. This group includes individuals utilizing Miller
Trusts, as well as the Medically Needy. In some cases, the net income (income less medical

                                               31
expenses) limits for the medically needy are stricter than the income limits for the income needy.
This raises the possibility that the income needy receive more generous coverage. We believe
that the scope for such unequal treatment is greatest for non-institutionalized individuals.
