The relationships between social networks and economic behavior have been well-documented. However,
it is often difficult to distinguish between the role of information sharing and other features of a neighborhood,
such as factors that are common to people of the same ethnicities or socio-economic opportunities,
or uniquely local methods of program implementation. We seek to gain new insight into the potential
role of information flows in networks by investigating what happens when information is disrupted.
We exploit rich microdata from Florida vital records and program participation files to explore the
effects of neighborhood social networks on the degree to which immigrant WIC participation during
pregnancy declined in the "information shock" period surrounding welfare reform. We compare changes
in WIC participation amongst Hispanic immigrants living in neighborhoods with a larger concentration
of immigrants from their country of origin to those with a smaller concentration of immigrants from
their country of origin, holding constant the size of the immigrant population and the share of immigrants
in the neighborhood who are Hispanic. We find strong evidence to support the notion that social networks
mediated the information shock faced by immigrant women in the wake of welfare reform.

I. Introduction


         The relationships between social networks1 and economic behavior have been well-

documented. Country-of-origin networks have been found to facilitate immigrant assimilation

(Borjas, 2000), job seeking (Edin, Fredriksson, and Aslund, 2003; Munshi, 2003), and business

relationships (Jackson and Schneider, 2010).             Social networks also apparently contribute to the

participation in social programs; Bertrand, Luttmer and Mullainathan (2000) find that eligible

individuals who live amongst others who speak their same language are more likely to

participate in welfare programs.

         A major pathway through which these social networks are hypothesized to operate

involves information channels. People who have fewer barriers to communicate with others

about potential opportunities are likely more able to act on these opportunities. However, it is

often difficult to distinguish between the role of information sharing and other features of a

neighborhood, such as factors that are common to people of the same ethnicities or socio-

economic opportunities, or uniquely local methods of program implementation. Aizer and

Currie (2004) challenge the information-sharing hypothesis by showing that participation in a

publicly-funded prenatal care program in California does not follow the patterns one would

expect if information-sharing is a driving force. They find that measured network effects are not

larger for people who are likely independently less informed -- women in their first pregnancies

as compared to later pregnancies, and immigrant women as compared to native-born women.

Their results indicate that if information-sharing was an important explanation for the

involve information-sharing and favors (see, e.g., Jackson, 2010)-- rather than the more recent references to social
networking sites such as Facebook.
relationship between social networks and economic behavior, these social networks may not

matter as much in steady state.

        It may be that the information role of social networks is not particularly important when

conditions are stable and information is widespread, but perhaps social networks matter more

when there is new information to be disseminated. We seek to gain new insight into the potential

role of information flows in networks by investigating what happens when information is

disrupted.2 Specifically, we consider the case of the information shock caused by the enactment

of welfare reform in 1995 and 1996, beginning with waivers approved by the U.S. Department of

Health and Human Services that allowed states to change the rules of welfare program

implementation and culminating in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity

Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), signed into law in August 1996.3 Welfare reform led to

widespread temporary confusion about individuals' eligibility for a variety of social programs

such as Medicaid and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and

Children (WIC), even though eligibility for these programs was often not directly affected, and

this confusion was particularly widespread amongst immigrants. (While Medicaid eligibility for

immigrants changed with welfare reform, eligibility for WIC did not change at all during this

  Duflo and Saez (2003) present experimental evidence suggesting that new information regarding retirement plans
transmits via social networks. We seek to determine how social networks interact with an information shock
regarding social programs.
3
  Florida, where we conduct this analysis, began its experimentation with welfare reform in February 1994, when it
introduced the Family Transition Program (FTP) in two counties -- Alachua (Gainesville) and Escambia (Pensacola)
-- as a randomized demonstration experiment. The FTP demonstration was expanded to eight counties in September
1995, including larger counties such as Duval (Jacksonville), Orange (Orlando) and Pinellas (St. Petersburg). A
search of Google news archives from 1995 indicates that this expansion was receiving considerable attention in
newspapers in areas not immediately affected, such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Sarasota. The state was actively
gearing up to enact statewide welfare reform during this period, as evidenced by the fact that the FTP program was
officially implemented statewide only two months after the passage of PRWORA.
time period.) Mazzolari (2004) and Kandula et al. (2004) document reductions in immigrant

program participation associated with the "chilling" effects of the policy climate, and Watson

(2010) shows the importance of regional differences in immigration law enforcement in

explaining differences in the chilling effects of welfare reform.4 In an environment of increased

uncertainty regarding program eligibility, as well as general unease about financial stability,

social networks may prove particularly useful in disseminating information.

         This paper uses rich microdata from Florida to explore the effects of neighborhood social

networks on the degree to which immigrant WIC participation during pregnancy declined in the

"information shock" period surrounding welfare reform. We attempt to identify a role of social

networks that is not likely to be due to local implementation of public programs by accessing a

database of detailed natality and program participation records for all Florida births in a 6-year

period surrounding welfare reform. We concentrate our attention exclusively on the set of

Hispanic immigrants who were eligible to receive WIC during pregnancy, as evidenced by the

fact that their birth was funded by Medicaid.5 We compare changes in WIC participation

amongst Hispanic immigrants living in neighborhoods with a larger concentration of immigrants

from their country of origin to those with a smaller concentration of immigrants from their

country of origin, holding constant the size of the immigrant population and the share of

immigrants in the neighborhood who are Hispanic. Florida is an outstanding place to study

these effects, because there are very large populations of young women who were born in Cuba,

Mexico and Puerto Rico, and individuals from these countries often live in the same

 Welfare reform also had effects on program participation in other dimensions, such as health care utilization. See,
e.g., Bitler, Gelbach and Hoynes (2005).

neighborhoods.6 By controlling directly for the interaction between time and the size of the

Hispanic population in the neighborhood, we can avoid confounding the effect of own-origin

concentration with the role of language or of treatments of Hispanic immigrants in local policy

implementation surrounding welfare reform. While it is still possible that local policy

implementation could differ in ways that would affect, say, Mexican women in predominantly

Cuban neighborhoods differently than they affect Mexican women in predominantly Mexican

neighborhoods, it seems more plausible to believe that country-of-origin information flows are at

work. As such, our identification strategy provides us with the opportunity to separate the

effects of the density of an individual's social network from the effects of the ethnicity of that

network.

         It is clear that something significant happened to the WIC participation of Hispanic

immigrants in the period surrounding welfare reform. As can be seen in Figure 1, we observe

that participation in the WIC program during pregnancy in Florida fell precipitously -- by over

50 percent from pre-reform highs -- in the time surrounding welfare reform and then rebounded

after about a year to levels consistent with pre-welfare-reform trends.7 (The horizontal axis

 There are large numbers of young Hispanic women born in other countries as well, but these other Spanish
speaking countries, primarily in South and Central America, are combined in the birth vital records.
7
  The magnitude of this decline may come as a surprise to readers familiar with the annual data on overall WIC
caseloads (see, e.g., the figures reported by the Food Research and Action Center, 2005), which continue to rise,
albeit modestly, in Florida in the period surrounding welfare reform. These statistics miss the dip in WIC take-up
rates for Hispanic immigrants for several reasons. First, the decline in WIC participation does not overlap perfectly
with fiscal year definitions; when we construct caseloads at the fiscal year level using the microdata, we observe a
decline of only 22 percent, so this reporting distinction alone can account for more than half of the discrepancy. In
addition, the statistics in the public domain conflate WIC caseloads during pregnancy with postpartum WIC
caseloads, for which we would have little expectation regarding an information problem since women were more
likely to have been counseled about their WIC eligibility in the hospital once they were informed about their
Medicaid eligibility. We do not have data on postpartum caseloads, so cannot observe the degree to which our
explanation accounts for the remaining discrepancy. On the other hand, the dip in observed WIC take-up among
Hispanic immigrants is not appreciably different from the overall dip in WIC take-up, so our use of Hispanic
reflects month of birth, so WIC participation could have conceivably begun as early as nine

months prior to this time) Medicaid use did not change during this time, but this is likely

because uninsured women who arrived at hospitals to give birth were automatically checked to

see whether they qualified for Medicaid; the lack of a change in Medicaid participation at birth is

a good "gut check" to demonstrate that the change in WIC participation in the period surrounding

welfare reform is not artifactual. Because Florida had a gradual process of implementing welfare

reform, we do not think of welfare reform as an "event" as we do not know exactly when welfare

reform "happened" in the consciousness of Hispanic immigrants in Florida; indeed, in some of

our model specifications we will control for neighborhood-by-time fixed effects so that we are

explicitly not identifying participation effects off of timing alone. Rather, we identify the

information shock period as the period empirically observed to have the large dip in WIC

participation, and we seek to explain whether neighborhood social networks may have played a

role in determining the magnitude of this dip for some groups of people relative to others.

         We find strong evidence to support the notion that social networks mediated the

information shock faced by immigrant women in the wake of welfare reform.                        The dip in

participation was particularly pronounced for Hispanic immigrants living in neighborhoods

populated with larger numbers of other immigrants -- even when those other immigrants are

themselves Hispanic. But for those who lived near other Hispanic immigrants from the same

country, this dip was considerably smaller. These results indicate that the uncertainty

surrounding welfare reform's effects on other social program eligibility was much lower when



immigrants is not an explanation of the difference between our figures and overall fiscal year caseload level
statistics. Additional evidence for the accuracy of the dip in our microdata is provided by the observation of a
concomitant decrease in WIC spell lengths during the same period.
social networks were likely stronger. These results have important potential implications for the

role of social networks in information diffusion in other settings as well.



II. Hispanic immigrant births and program participation in Florida

         As we seek to distinguish the effects of social networks during information shocks from

factors such as local implementation of policies that vary temporally, program implementation

that affects speakers of one language differently from speakers of another language, or language

barriers that may not have anything to do with social networks, we make use of the large-scale

administrative dataset from Florida to study a very tightly-defined population -- Hispanic

immigrants who were born in Cuba, Mexico or Puerto Rico, the three Spanish-speaking places

outside of the United States that are identified on the birth certificate.8 We therefore begin by

describing the patterns of births to these Hispanic immigrants in Florida in the years surrounding

welfare reform. We make use of data on all live births in Florida between 1994 and 1999

provided to us by the Florida Department of Health, matched with indicators of WIC and

Medicaid participation during pregnancy. As seen in Figure 2, during this time period the

number of births in Florida was increasing, with about 16,000 births per month in 1994 and

about 16,500 births per month in 1999. Figure 3 zeroes in on the share of immigrants as a

percentage of total births in Florida: The number of births to immigrant women increased by an

even larger degree during this period, from 22 percent of all births in 1994 to 26 percent of all

births in 1999, and the percentage of births to Hispanic immigrant women increased from under

13 percent in 1994 to over 15 percent in 1999. The percentage of all births to mothers born in

 Some Filipino women self-identify as Hispanic as well, and we can identify Filipino origin on the birth certificate.
However, there are very few Filipino women in the Florida data, only a few hundred. In practice, our results are
unchanged depending on whether we include or exclude Filipino women from our analysis.
Cuba, Mexico and Puerto Rico -- the places of birth of the mothers in our study population --

increased from 6 percent in 1994 to 8 percent in 1999. And as can be seen in Figure 3, these

percentages have been approximately monotonically increasing over the entire study period;

there is no evidence that immigrant births changed at all during the information shock period

surrounding welfare reform. Because we further restrict our study to women who were eligible

for WIC during pregnancy -- as evidenced by the fact that the birth was paid for by Medicaid --

our study population is the set of 45,528 births to women from Cuba, Mexico or Puerto Rico

who were eligible for WIC during pregnancy and resided in a zip code with at least ten births

(regardless of immigrant status) in each of the six calendar years of the study.9

         While the number of births to Cuban, Mexican and Puerto Rican immigrants may not

have changed during the information shock period, the composition of these births may have

changed. Figure 4 presents month-by-month averages of maternal age, maternal education and

whether the mother received adequate prenatal care, according to the Kotelchuck index (prenatal

care begun in the first trimester, and at least six prenatal visits.) As can be seen, there is no

evidence that the characteristics of the Hispanic women giving birth changed at all during the

information shock period surrounding welfare reform. Therefore, the evidence indicates that

while participation in WIC amongst those eligible to participate fell considerably and then

rebounded during the welfare reform period, this is not due to differences in the attributes of the

women who gave birth during this period. More broadly, the dip in WIC participation occurs in


9
 We make this last restriction because we calculate the immigrant percentages based on the observed attributes of
mothers living in zip codes, and wish to ensure that we have a reasonably-sized denominator for these calculations.
In practice, this sample restriction has tiny effects on our overall sample size; only 3.4 percent of all mothers in
Florida (and 2.8 percent of Hispanic immigrant mothers) lived in zip codes that do not meet this restriction, and the
median mother lived in a zip code with 307 or more births in each year of the study (393 for Hispanic immigrants.)
The tenth percentile mother lived in a zip code with 64 or more births in each year (100 for Hispanic immigrants.)
both immigrant and non-immigrant populations and appears to transcend race and education

(figures available upon request), thus resisting simple models of program participation based on

individual demographic characteristics. This puzzle leaves us to consider deeper measures of

influence related to neighborhood and social structure.



III. Social networks as information channels

       Our objective is to identify whether social networks played a role in the degree to which

WIC participation during pregnancy fell in the "information shock" period surrounding welfare

reform. While it is impossible to measure social networks directly in the administrative datasets

available to us, we believe that immigrant women are more likely to be acquainted with and

share information with other women of their same nationality than they are with other immigrant

women from different nationalities. We therefore hypothesize that immigrant women who live

near other immigrant women from the same country will have better information about program

rules than might immigrant women who live in communities with fewer immigrants from the

same country. But as Aizer and Currie (2004) point out, correlations between concentration of

an ethnicity in a neighborhood and members of that ethnicity's propensity to participate in a

program could reflect many factors, including local program implementation. Our strategy is to

distinguish between immigrant neighbors from one's own country and immigrant neighbors who

simply share the same language; thus we can more distinctly identify the potential for

information networks amongst immigrant women.

       In order to compare immigrant women in communities with few neighbors from the same

country to those in communities with many neighbors from their country of origin, we must have

immigrant women living in a variety of communities that differ both by (1) the concentration of
Hispanic immigrants in the neighborhood and (2) the concentration of Hispanic immigrants of

their same national origin. As can be seen in Figure 5, Hispanic immigrant women live in a wide

variety of neighborhoods, as defined by the share of all births to Hispanic immigrants. While

some live in neighborhoods with almost no other Hispanic immigrant mothers, others live in

neighborhoods where more than four-fifths of all mothers are Hispanic immigrants. More to the

point of the paper, Figure 6 presents information about the degree to which Hispanic immigrants

live in neighborhoods that vary considerably in the concentration of immigrants from their own

countries, conditional on the overall share of Hispanic immigrants in the neighborhood. The

figure shows five density plots, where neighborhoods are divided into quintiles based on the

percentage of all babies born to Hispanic immigrant mothers. Hispanic immigrant women live in

a wide variety of neighborhoods, as characterized by the degree of Hispanic immigrant density,

and within each of these groups, one observes considerable variation in the share of all Hispanic

immigrants coming from the mother's country of origin. In each of the five quintiles, there are

cases where there are virtually no other mothers from the woman's country of origin, other cases

where virtually all of the Hispanic immigrant mothers come from the same country of origin, and

every combination in between.



IV. Estimates of the effects of social networks on participation during information shocks

        Our estimating equation of interest is

Wizt = αt + βMiz·tt + γHiz·tt + δOiz·tt + σXizt + εizt ,                                  (1)

where W represents the WIC participation during pregnancy of mother i living in neighborhood z

during time t, M represents the percentage of births to immigrant women in the mother's

neighborhood, H represents the percentage of births to Hispanic immigrants in the mother's
neighborhood, O represents the percentage of births to immigrants from the mother's home

country in the mother's neighborhood, and X represents a set of mother-specific covariates

(maternal age, education level and country of origin.) The coefficients α, β, γ and δ are all

vectors, with different coefficients estimated for each quarter10 (or month) between January 1994

and December 1999. Our coefficients of interest are the δs, the estimated relationships between

the fraction of own-origin women in the neighborhood and a mother's WIC participation during

pregnancy, holding constant the immigrant concentration and Hispanic immigrant concentration

in the neighborhood, at different points in time. We cluster all the standard errors at the

neighborhood level, and we measure the neighborhood as the zip code of residence at the time of

the birth. Again, we limit our analysis to pregnancies in which the births were funded by

Medicaid, so that we know that all women in the study were eligible to participate in WIC during

their pregnancies.

         While our primary specifications rely on the notion that neighborhoods with different

attributes may respond differently during the information shock period around welfare reform, it

is important to note that neighborhoods are likely settled by different types of individuals who

might react differently to the information shock. There is little evidence that high school

dropouts and high school graduates live in different types of neighborhoods in terms of

immigrant densities -- the typical neighborhood occupied by a high school dropout in our

population is 17.8 percent own-origin immigrant, as compared with 17.0 percent own-origin

immigrant in the typical neighborhood occupied by a high school graduate (p=0.647). However,

there is a strong age gradient in the likelihood of living near other immigrants from one's own

10
  Here and throughout the paper, when we refer to a quarter, we are referring to the quarter-year combination, so
that all of our models interacting quarter with various variables have 24 interactions to reflect the 6 years. Our
monthly interaction models have 72 interactions.
country of origin: While neighborhoods occupied by immigrants 20 and under averaged 15.4

percent own-origin immigrant, this figure rises monotonically with age, from 16.8 percent for

those aged 21-25 to 18.3 percent for those aged 26-30 to 19.5 percent for those aged 31 and older

(p=0.000). Note that this is likely due to differential location patterns at the time of immigration

rather than any general patterns leading immigrants to move to relatively homogeneous

neighborhoods as they age: When we compare the neighborhood attributes of the 4,679 mothers

in our study who moved zip codes between births, we find that 33.6 percent moved to

neighborhoods with percent own origin more than 3 percentage points above their previous

neighborhood, 33.4 percent moved to neighborhoods with percent own origin more than 3

percentage points below their previous neighborhood, and 33.0 percent moved to neighborhoods

with percent own origin within 3 percentage points of their previous neighborhood. Nonetheless,

as a further check to ensure that we are not ascribing social network effects to other changes

occurring in specific neighborhoods housing particular types of immigrants, in some

specifications, we go further still and estimate models with time-specific neighborhood-specific

fixed effects:

Wizt = αzt + βMiz·tt + γHiz·tt + δOiz·tt + σXizt + εizt .                                    (2)

In these highly parameterized specifications, we explicitly compare Cubans to Puerto Ricans to

Mexicans within the same neighborhood at the same time.

        Even in this specification, if certain immigrant groups (e.g., those from Mexico versus

those from Cuba, or those who are high school dropouts versus those who are high school

graduates) respond differently to the information shock surrounding welfare reform, and they are

somehow clustered together in neighborhoods, there remains the possibility that we might

interpret, say, a Mexican immigrant-specific response to the information shock as a social
network-related response to the information shock. Therefore, as a final step, we estimate a

model specification in which we also control for time-specific origin-specific fixed effects, time-

specific fixed effects for different education level, and time-specific age interactions:

Wizt = αzt + βMiz·tt + γHiz·tt + δOiz·tt + λCiz·tt + ψEiz·tt + τAiz·tt + σXizt + εizt ,      (3)

where A represents the mother's age, C is a vector of country of origin, and E is a vector of

education levels. In this most heavily-parameterized model, we are comparing the responses of

Cubans to Mexicans, say, within the same zip code at the same time, holding constant any

temporal changes happening to Cubans and Mexicans statewide, and so on. While this model is

more heavily parameterized than we believe to be ideal, it does provide an important check to

ensure that our results are not being driven by some omitted variable.

        We measure time t at the quarterly level; measuring time at the monthly level does not

change the results but makes evaluation of the coefficients of interest more cumbersome. To see

this distinction, compare Figures 7 and 8, which present the time dummies α at the quarterly

versus monthly level, respectively. It is clear that the quarterly-measured time dummies smooth

out some of the small-scale oscillations from month to month in the overall likelihood of WIC

participation, but do not change the overall temporal pattern of WIC participation. Therefore, for

clarity we will present all results with time measured at the quarterly level.

        We begin by estimating two variants of equation (1), our model in which we estimate

quarter-specific relationships between percent immigrant (or percent own-origin) in the

neighborhood and prenatal WIC participation among Hispanic immigrants to Florida. The

coefficients on time dummies and time-specific interactions with neighborhood characteristics

are reported in Table 1. Each row in Table 1 represents a different quarter (where 94:1 is the

comparison quarter) between 94:2 and 99:4, and the first three columns are all coefficient
estimates from a single estimation of equation (1) in which we do not include percent Hispanic

immigrant interactions. The second four columns are all coefficient estimates from the

estimation of equation (1) in which we also include percent Hispanic interactions with time. Our

primary coefficients of interest, those on the interactions between percent own-origin in the

neighborhood and time, are bolded in each of the two specifications. As can be seen from the

table, during the period of time in which welfare reform was commencing in Florida -- births

during 1996 and the first part of 1997 -- Hispanic women eligible for WIC who lived in

neighborhoods with relatively more immigrants from their own country of origin were

significantly more likely to participate in WIC during pregnancy than were similar women with

fewer immigrants from their country of origin. These differences are meaningful in magnitude

as well: A coefficient of 0.339, for instance, implies that if a woman lived in a neighborhood that

was 100 percent own-origin immigrants, she would be 34 percentage points more likely to

participate in WIC than if she lived in a neighborhood with no own-origin immigrants, holding

constant the percentage of immigrants in the neighborhood (and in the case of Model 2, the

percentage of Hispanic immigrants in the neighborhood as well.) Given that the standard

deviation of percentage own-origin immigrant in a neighborhood is 0.172, a coefficient of 0.339

suggests that increasing the percentage own-origin by one standard deviation increased the

likelihood of prenatal WIC participation by 5.8 percentage points during that quarter. Since the

difference between the pre-dip peak and the bottom of the "information shock" dip is 32

percentage points (note the participation rates provided in the first column of the table, below the

quarter labels), this is a meaningful proportion of the dip that could have been mitigated by our

proxy for information networks. The results suggest that the generally negative effect of being
around other immigrants, and even other Hispanic immigrants, is mitigated and often

overwhelmed by being around other own-origin immigrants.

       The necessarily large number of coefficient estimates makes the information in Table 1

cumbersome to read. In Table 2 we summarize the point estimates from Table 1 (Model 2,

which includes controls for percentage Hispanic immigrant in neighborhood) in a manner that

makes cross-specification comparisons more transparent. Because we do not know exactly when

the information shock began for the immigrant groups, we present a variety of comparisons. The

first row of Table 2 simply summarizes the information from Model 2 of Table 1. Here, we

compare the empirically defined "dip period", 96:2 through 97:2, to 94:1, in the first column. In

the second through fourth columns, we divide the period from 95:4 though 97:1 into three six

month periods. We chose these periods purposefully: The interquartile range in days of WIC

participation during pregnancy in Florida is 77 to 186 days, and very few women participate in

WIC for more than seven months during pregnancy. Births during the first two quarters, 95:4 to

96:1, roughly correspond to the period of time when the vast majority of women would have

entered the WIC program following the September 6, 1995 enactment of the welfare waiver in

Florida, and births during the last two quarters, 96:4 to 97:1, roughly correspond to the similar

period of time following the enactment of PRWORA on August 22, 1996. The two intermediate

quarters, 96:2 to 96:3, represent the period of time after Florida welfare reform was enacted in a

set of counties and as statewide (and national) welfare reform was gearing up. We are agnostic

about exactly when welfare reform became salient to these women, so present a variety of

comparisons. As can be seen from the table, there was no apparent differential WIC take-up rate

by women living amongst others from the same country of origin immediately following the

welfare waiver, but in the intermediate period and even more following the passage of
PRWORA a substantial gap opened up, suggesting that living near others from the same country

of origin provided some useful information channels that helped to overcome the widespread

confusion surrounding welfare reform.11

         We hypothesize that immigrant women might be particularly reliant on information

channels when the pregnancy is their first, so we next restrict the analysis to first pregnancies.

This is a particularly important check of the information channels story, since Aizer and Currie

(2003) suggest the first birth comparison can be an important way to identify the women likely to

be most sensitive to information about social programs. As can be seen from the table, the

estimated effects of having a larger fraction of women in the neighborhood who were themselves

immigrants from the same country are substantially larger when restricting the study population

to first births.

         Because people with different likelihoods of participating in the program at different

times might have settled in different neighborhoods, as an extra check we repeat the same

analysis but include zip code by time fixed effects (equation (2) above.) In this specification, we

are now directly comparing different own-origin groups in the same neighborhood at the same

time, and identifying solely off of the relative sizes of the different Hispanic national groups in


11
   Because we have no way of knowing exactly how much information had spread throughout the state, and when
exactly the information spread, we are cautious about trying to differentiate our results between the eight counties in
which welfare waivers had the most direct effect and the 59 counties in which welfare reform did not immediately
begin occurring. In addition, the sample size of women in waiver counties is too small to obtain precise estimates,
as waiver counties comprise 15.9 percent of our study population (15.6 percent if Alachua and Escambia counties
are omitted.) That said, we do observe earlier and larger-magnitude results in the waiver counties than in the non-
waiver counties: The estimated own-origin coefficients in waiver counties are 1.474 (se=1.194), 1.369 (se=1.152),
and 1.361 (se=1.050), respectively, in 1995:4-1996:1, 1996:2-1996:3, and 1996:4-1997:1. None of these
coefficients are statistically distinct from those in the non-waiver counties, which are close in magnitude and
statistical significance to the overall results. While the larger estimated results are consistent with an information
shock and social network story, we are too uncertain to want to make that claim, and report the disaggregated results
purely for the sake of completeness.
the neighborhood. The results, reported in row 3 of Table 2, are less statistically significant than

those in the previous specifications, but the pattern of findings -- that the larger the own-origin

group in the neighborhood, the more likely a Hispanic immigrant was to participate in WIC

during pregnancy during the "information shock" period -- persists. And, of course, since this is

now directly comparing, say, Cubans to Mexicans simultaneously in the same neighborhood, it

might highlight any systematic differences affecting all Cubans versus all Mexicans that are

time-specific. Therefore, in row 4 of Table 2 we estimate equation (3), in which, in addition to

zip code by quarter fixed effects, we also control for origin by quarter fixed effects, as well as

education by quarter fixed effects and age by quarter interactions. In this very highly

parameterized specification, we are comparing Cubans in a neighborhood to Mexicans in the

same neighborhood at the same time, holding constant any time-specific differences between

Cubans and Mexicans overall. While this model is more highly parameterized than our

preference, it is our best attempt to control for all possible omitted variables. In this model, we

continue to find that the percentage own-origin in the neighborhood is positively related to WIC

participation during pregnancy. The estimated effects are larger in magnitude than in the

specifications only controlling for zip code by time fixed effects, and are again statistically

significant, suggesting that there may have been differential temporal patterns for Cubans,

Mexicans and Puerto Ricans in the time surrounding welfare reform. This is not wholly

unexpected, especially since Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens while Cuban-born or Mexican-born

immigrants may not be. Nonetheless, these results continue to provide evidence supporting the

notion that social networks were salient in helping to determine immigrants' responses to the

information shock surrounding welfare reform.
           We further consider whether the estimated responses are stronger for some groups of

immigrant women than they are for others. Table 3 presents our estimates of the models

reported in rows 1 and 2 of Table 2, stratified along two dimensions: education and age. We

compare high school dropouts to high school graduates, and women aged 25 or younger to those

aged 26 or older.12 As can be seen in Table 3, our estimated social network effects are

consistently larger for less educated and younger mothers. These patterns are true whether we

consider all mothers or restrict the study population to first births. All in all, they suggest that

having a higher percentage own-origin in one's neighborhood is particularly important for people

who might be less experienced or more sensitive to information shocks.



V. Program office proximity as a substitute for social networks

           Our results are consistent with a story that social networks play a role in mitigating

information shocks. This finding begs the question of whether government agencies might be

able to place offices strategically to help to mitigate information shocks as well. In order to

gauge the degree to which program office proximity might serve as a substitute for social

networks, we repeat the above analyses, but augment the model with a series of WIC office

proximity by time variables. Specifically, we attempt two different specifications of WIC office

proximity, one where we observe whether a WIC program office was within two miles of the

centroid of the zip code (42.3 percent of the population) and another where we observe whether a

WIC program office was within five miles of the centroid of the zip code (75.0 percent of the

population.) This measure of WIC office proximity is not perfect; most importantly, the earliest

information we have about specific locations of WIC offices in Florida is in 1998, so we may be
12
     The median age of a mother in our population is 25.
measuring WIC office locations during the information shock period with error. That said, we

have reason to believe that this measurement error is not very large: For instance, in 1998, zip

codes with WIC offices within two miles had a 2.8 percent higher take-up rate than those where

the nearest WIC office was over two miles away, and in 1994, the first year of our data, the

difference was a statistically indistinguishable 1.7 percent. Measuring access at the five mile

radius level yields even more similar comparisons: In 1998, zip codes with WIC offices within

five miles had a 2.6 percent higher take-up rate than those where the nearest WIC office was

over two miles away, as compared with 2.8 percent in 1994. If there was a major change in WIC

office locations during our study period, it is not being reflected in substantial changes in WIC

take-up patterns.

       Table 4 presents our head-to-head comparisons of the estimated effects of percent own-

origin in the neighborhood at different time periods to the estimated effects of having a

proximate WIC office during the same time period. As can be seen in the table, we never

observe statistically significant estimated effects of WIC office proximity during the critical time

period, and to the extent to which the WIC office proximity interactions are substantial in

magnitude, they have a negative sign, indicating that if anything, having a WIC office nearby

might have reduced, rather than enhanced, WIC take-up amongst our population during the

information shock time period. On the other hand, our estimated social network effects remain

robust to the inclusion of the WIC office time interactions. While these results are not

conclusive, they provide additional evidence that program office proximity is not a substitute for

social networks during information shocks.

       While WIC office proximity appears to not be a substitute for social networks, this

proximity might still affect the degree to which social networks influence program participation
in a time of information shocks. We therefore stratify the zip codes by whether there is a WIC

office within two miles. The last two rows of Table 4 present the results of this analysis. We

observe that the estimated effects of social networks are stronger in communities with a WIC

office more immediately accessible. Therefore, these results indicate that while program office

proximity may not be a substitute for social networks during times of information shocks, it may

help to increase the likelihood that social networks will translate into program participation. We

intend to explore this relationship further in future research.



VI. Conclusion

       We present new evidence suggesting that social networks provide information that might

help to reduce confusion during information shocks. We employ a unique dataset and empirical

methodology that allow us to rule out local program implementation factors, ethnic background

itself, or shared language as explanations for why program participation is higher in communities

where social networks are likely to be stronger. Since we are controlling for ethnic background,

we are able to disentangle the effect of the density of the social network from the ethnicity of the

network in our analysis. While we do not provide long-run equilibrium explanations of

correlations amongst similar individuals in their economic activity or program participation, this

research does indicate that social networks may play an important role in the short run.

       The fact that we find that program office proximity is associated with the degree to which

social networks influence program participation, but that program office proximity per se does

not affect participation, has potential policy implications for the role of program office location

in spreading information. Our results suggest that strategically-located program offices may be

successful in spurring program participation, but perhaps only if key individuals in the
surrounding community are made aware of the eligibility rules for services the program office

provides. We cannot speak to the mechanisms through which these enhanced information flows

might operate, and this is certainly a topic for future experimentation and study. Nonetheless,

our evidence on the potential role of social networks suggests that using social networks to

spread information about eligibility rules and benefits may be successful in reducing the

likelihood of major reductions in program participation in periods of information shocks.
