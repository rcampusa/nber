Chasing Noise

                                            ABSTRACT

We present a simple model in which rational but uninformed traders occasionally chase noise as if
it were information, thereby amplifying sentiment shocks and moving prices away from fundamental
values. We fill a theoretical gap in the literature by showing conditions under which noise traders can
have an impact on market equilibrium disproportionate to their size in the market. The model offers
a partial explanation for the surprisingly low market price of financial risk in the Spring of 2007.

    In the spring of 2007, financial markets, and in particular markets for
fixed income securities, were extraordinarily calm. Corporate bond spreads
were remarkably low, as were the prices of Credit Default Swaps on financial
firms (See Figure 1 below). This tranquility ended in the summer of 2007,
as the problems with subprime mortgages precipitated a sequence of events
leading to a major financial crisis. The price of risk rose to the highest levels
in decades.
    It is obvious from the tranquility in the spring of 2007 that financial
markets, and in particular derivative markets, did not anticipate the crisis.
What makes this fact particularly interesting is that most of the participants
in these markets are sophisticated investors. Unlike, say, in the internet
bubble, this pricing was unlikely to be driven by the mass of demand by
unsophisticated investors. Could the observed tranquility of markets in the
spring of 2007 have resulted from the trading behavior of sophisticated in-
vestors that masked the potential bad news? In this paper, we suggest that
the answer is yes. We propose a very simple model, extending Grossman-
Stiglitz (1980, [6]), which helps think about this question. The model focuses
on the interaction of different types of investors in a market, the vast majority
of whom are rational, and shows how this interaction can sustain incorrect
prices.
    The basic idea is to consider three types of investors: a small number of
investors, called insiders, who possess valuable information and trade com-
pletely rationally, a small number of noise traders who are vulnerable to sen-
timent shocks and trade on those, and the vast majority of outside investors,
who possess no information but learn from prices and trade rationally. All
the insiders have the same information, and all the noise traders face the
same sentiment shock. The focus of the paper is the trading by the silent
majority of outside investors, and its effect on prices.
    The problem facing an outsider is difficult. On the one hand, he wants to
follow the insiders who know something, and since he only observes prices,
would like to chase price increases caused by insiders trading on valuable
information. On the other hand, he wants to bet against the noise traders
who are influenced by sentiment, but again since he only observes prices,
would like to sell into a rising market and be a contrarian. Which one of these
motives dominates? In particular, is it possible for this rational outsider to
get confused and to chase noise as if it were information? We show that,
under some plausible circumstances, the answer is yes, and outsiders end
up chasing sentiment, thereby suppressing the possible impact of informed

                                       1

trading on prices. They do so because, in those circumstances, they believe
that price movements reflect information even though they reflect noise.
    The composition of a market can be depicted graphically on a triangle, as
in Figure 2. The x-axis represents the proportion of market participants who
are insiders, denoted by I, and the y-axis represents the proportion who are
noise traders, denoted by N . The remaining proportion is outsiders, denoted
by O , so that the three shares sum to 1. In the markets of interest, we think
of most traders as being rational and sophisticated, but not well-informed.
This corresponds to points near the origin in this triangle, labeled “Region
of Interest.”
    We can think of the evidence in Figure 1 as an outcome in a market in

                                      2

our Region of Interest. Specifically, the corporate bond and CDS markets are
dominated by outsiders, with small but positive masses of noise traders and
informed traders. During the spring of 2007, the noise traders were very calm
(and hence very willing to sell insurance), and the majority of sophisticated
but uninformed investors took this downward pressure in the price of risk as
evidence that the world was indeed safe. As a consequence, they were also
willing to sell insurance. Even if there were informed investors in this market
who saw the risk of a calamity and were buying insurance, their demand was
constrained by their risk-bearing capacity (Lewis 2010, [9]). This demand
was then insufficient to raise prices significantly because the outsiders owned
most capital and believed that low prices reflected good news. Subsequently
in the summer of 2007, public news about fundamentals revealed that the low
price of risk was not justified. Because risk was not correctly priced before,
the reaction of the price to news was extremely large, as Figure 1 shows.

                                      3
    We examine the responsiveness of prices to sentiment when almost all
investors are sophisticated. If S is the sentiment shock and p is the price of
                                         ∂p
the asset, our argument requires that ∂S    be large. One might think that this
will not be true in a market with few noise traders, since a market with almost
no noise traders will behave almost like a market with no noise traders at all.
We show that this intuition can fail, and dramatically so. Under plausible
              ∂p
conditions, ∂S   can be very large in our Region of Interest. This implies that
the small mass of noise traders can have a disproportionately large impact
on market prices. Even with a modest noise trader shock, prices can diverge
sharply from fundamental values in a market dominated by sophisticated
traders.
    This counterintuitive result holds because the outsiders, in their attempt
to chase the insiders, will occasionally chase the noise traders instead. Under
conditions which we explore, each outsider’s demand curve is upward sloping.
Since there is a large mass of these traders, they exert strong pressure on
prices in the direction where they observe movement.
    We consider three metrics for stability and efficiency of the market. The
first is an ex-post measure of the responsiveness of price to the noise trader
         ∂p
shock, ∂S   . The second is an ex-ante measure of the variance of the price,
conditional on the insider’s information, V ar(p|InsideInf ormation). The
third is the informativeness of the pricing system, as defined by Grossman
and Stiglitz, corr(value, p). By this last metric, additional insiders make the
market more efficient on average. However, we are especially interested in
the first two metrics, because they speak to the question of how markets
can be inefficient even when most traders are sophisticated and noise trader
shocks are modest.
    The literature on trading in financial markets between better and less
informed investors is huge, so we can only refer to some of the more relevant
studies. Grossman and Stiglitz (1980, [6]) consider a model with only rational
investors and demonstrate that, when acquiring information is costly, there
cannot be a market equilibrium in which prices fully reflect fundamental
values. Because we are interested in a different question than Grossman and
Stiglitz, we do not consider the aggregation of information from differentially
informed rational traders. Rather, we focus on the efforts of uninformed
rational traders to piggyback on the trading of the informed ones.
    Kyle (1985, [8]) considers markets with informed investors and noise
traders, but also an uninformed but rational investor who in his case is a
market maker. Kyle is interested in market microstructure, and hence fo-

                                      4
cuses on the behavior of a monopolistic risk neutral market maker, a setting
appropriate for his objective. We in contrast are interested in the market
interactions of small competitive investors, and hence have a different model
and different results. Wang (1993, [13]) presents a dynamic trading model
with differentially informed investors, and shows that less-informed investors
can rationally behave like price chasers. His model incorporates effects sim-
ilar to ours, but does not focus on the extreme sensitivity of prices to noise
in the Region of Interest. Barlevy and Veronesi (2003, [2]) consider a model
with risk neutral outsiders trading with noise traders and insiders, optimally
extracting information from the price of an asset. In their model the out-
siders have a non-monotonic demand curve, leading the relationship between
price and fundamentals to be S-shaped. This induces a discontinuity in price
when the fundamentals fall below a certain level, which Barlevy and Veronesi
interpret as a crash. Their mechanism is different from ours, but their market
structure is similar.
    In Stein (1987, [11]), rational speculation can impose an externality on
traders trying to make inferences from prices, and consequently destabilize
prices. In Calvo (2002, [3]), rational uninformed investors optimally extract
information from prices affected by informed investors. Instead of being
confounded by the presence of noise traders, the confound he considers is
occasional liquidity shocks to the informed traders forcing them to withdraw
from the market. The uninformed traders misinterpret this as a negative
shock to fundamentals and drive down prices.
    Our paper is also related to the literature on noise trading. DeLong et al.
(1990a, [4]) model the interaction between rational speculators, who would
correspond to the outsiders in our model, and noise traders. With no insid-
ers in that model, trading by speculators unambiguously stabilizes prices. In
DeLong et al (1990b, [5]), arbitrageurs buy in anticipation of positive feed-
back trading by the noise traders, and thus destabilize prices. Allen and Gale
(1992, [1]) present a model of stock prices manipulation by a large investor,
who buys and thus stimulates demand by uninformed investors trying to infer
information from price movements. Hassan and Mertens (2010, [7]) present
a dynamic model in which the uninformed investors can mix up information
and noise, and focus on implications for investment. Rossi and Tinn (2010,
[10]) use the Kyle (1985, [8]) framework to model positive feedback trading
by rational uninformed investors trying to learn from prices. Their model
has several periods and a different setup than ours, but they are trying to get
at some related ideas on how uninformed but rational speculators balance

                                      5
their desires to follow insiders and to bet against noise traders.
    Stein (2009, [12]) considers arbitrageurs trading against a statistical reg-
ularity (under-reaction) causing a new type of market inefficiency in the
process of trading away profit opportunities on the old type. He shows that
prices can sometimes be further away from fundamental values than they are
without the arbitrageurs. In both his approach and ours, rational traders try
to push prices towards their rational expectation of fundamental value, but
in our approach the expectation of fundamental value derives from both a
private signal and observation of the price, whereas his traders observe the
price and a statistical regularity they can take advantage of.
    The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we formally present
and solve the model. Section 3 examines the slope of an outsider’s demand
curve. Section 4 analyzes the implications of this demand curve on market
equilibrium. Section 5 considers measures of market stability and efficiency
besides the sensitivity of market price to sentiment. Section 6 concludes. All
proofs and derivations are in the appendix.


1    The Model
There is a market for a risky asset in supply 1 trading at price p. There
are two periods. Trading occurs in period 1, then the asset pays off its
fundamental value V in period 2. The fundamental value is the sum of three
terms. First is the unconditional expectation µ. Second is a shock σ1 ν1
which is realized in period 1. ν1 is Normally distributed with mean zero and
variance 1. Finally, there is a shock σ2 ν2 to fundamental value which isn’t
realized until the second period. ν2 is also distributed Normally with mean
zero and variance 1. The fundamental value is then given by

                             V = µ + σ 1 ν1 + σ 2 ν2                        (1)
    In addition to this risky asset there is a riskless asset in elastic supply
with return r.
    There are three types of agents participating in this market: a mass N of
noise traders, I of insider/informed traders, and O of outsiders/uninformed
sophisticated traders. We normalize I + O + N = 1. In period 1, the insider
traders get a signal about the termination value of the asset. That is, each
insider observes the same ν1 .


                                       6
    The noise traders do not learn from prices and have a biased belief about
the fundamental value of the asset, given by a a shock to their level of “sen-
timent”, the random variable S. S is distributed normally with mean 0 and
variance σS2 . Every noise trader has the same realization S. S is independent
of all fundamentals.
    Outsiders are rational and optimally interpret the price signals they ob-
serve. All agents have CARA(γ) utility.
    We begin by deriving the period-1 demand curves directly from utility
maximization. Each agent i begins with wealth Wi and chooses demand Di
to maximize

   Ei [−e−γ(Di V +(Wi −Di p)r) ]

    Maximizing this expression is equivalent to minimizing minus this expres-
sion, which is in turn equivalent to minimizing the log of that. Assuming for
the moment that V is normally distributed conditional on agent i’s infor-
mation set, the first order condition immediately gives the demand curve:

                                             Ei [V ] − pr
                                      Di =                                 (2)
                                              γσi2 (V )
    where Ei [·] denotes the expectation with respect to agent i’s information
set and σi2 (V ) denotes the variance of V conditional on agent i’s information
set. for the insider, this becomes
                                           µ + σ1 ν1 − pr
                                    DI =                                   (3)
                                                γσ22
   For the outsider, this becomes

                                        µ + E[σ1 ν1 |p] − pr
                              DO =                2
                                                                           (4)

                                   σO = V ar(σ1 ν1 |p) + σ22               (5)
   Finally, the demand for the noise traders is given by
                                             µ + S − pr

     where σN  is the variance perceived by the noise traders. Since the noise
traders do not observe a signal or use the price to update their information

    In (11), r appears in each term because it is the riskless discount factor.
A is a factor describing the aggregate risk bearing capacity of the market,
the inverse of which corresponds to the risk-premium agents demand in equi-
librium in the first term.
    The second term is the impact of the noise trader sentiment shock on
                                           ∂p
the market price. The coefficient here is ∂S  and will be the subject of some
examination. The third is the impact of the aggregate information about
fundamental value on the price. If the market resembles the noise trader-free
benchmark, the coefficient on S should be close to zero and the coefficient
on ν1 should be close to r−1 .
    The ultimate objects of interest are how completely the fundamental in-
formation ν1 and the sentiment S are incorporated into the prices of the asset.
We can write the impact of the fundamental information ν1 and sentiment
shock S as
                                  ∂p     Iσ1
                                      =                                         (14)

                            ∂S   ABrγ(σ12 + σ22 )
    It is difficult to evaluate these expressions analytically. In thoroughly-
studied special cases there are either only insiders and outsiders or only noise
traders and outsiders. In the former case, the coefficient on ν1 does turn out
to be r−1 , while in the latter case the coefficient on S decreases towards zero
as the risk bearing capacity of the sophisticated traders increases. These are
signs of a stable market that prices assets effectively.
    From these observations, the natural intuition to build would be that
adding more sophisticated investors, and in particular adding more informed
sophisticated investors, pushes the coefficient on S towards zero and de-
creases the market volatility. Similarly, intuition might suggest that a small
N necessarily implies a small coefficient on S, so noise trader shocks do not
get factored into the price of the asset.
    As we show in Section 4, neither of these intuitions hold for markets in the
Region of Interest. The reason for this is that prices in this model are driven


                                            9
primarily by the trading behavior of the outsiders, who have most of the risk
bearing capacity and hence ability to move prices in this model. Outsiders are
trying to chase information, but may occasionally end up chasing noise. Their
efforts to chase information make them more aggressive when they think there
is more information in the market, which means that adding insiders to the
market might destabilize prices. These efforts to chase information also lead
them to chase noise in some circumstances by mistake, which might also have
a destabilizing influence. In the analysis below, we seek to develop this logic.
                                           ∂p
    To this end, we focus on evaluating ∂S    in the Region of Interest. In the
appendix, we prove the following Lemma:

Lemma 1.

   where the OutsiderDemandCurveSlope is defined as ∂D           ∂p
                                                                   O
                                                                     . Lemma 1
makes it clear that the slope of an outsider’s demand curve is crucial for
                                                  ∂p
stability of financial markets, as proxied for by ∂S . Our first step, then, is to
examine this slope.


2        The Slope of the Outsider Demand Curve
In the cases of interest outsiders compose most of the market. As suggested
by Lemma 1, their demand curve and its slope in particular are then im-
portant to understanding to see how the market behaves. The slope of an
outsider’s demand curve (after some rearrangement) is given by

        dDO   r                1                           N       I           N
            =                                                     ( 2 σ12 − 2         σ2 )   (17)
         dp   γ   σ12
                        I(1 − N ) +
                                       N 2 σS2
                                                    (σ12       2
                                                           + σ 2 ) σ2      (σ1 + σ22 ) S
                  σ22                 (σ12 +σ22 )

    We can understand the demand curve better by looking at its three multi-
plicands separately. The third term is the easiest to interpret, as it determines
the sign of the slope. Specifically

         rI 2      rN
    (       σ −
           2 1
                            σ2 )
        γσ2     γ(σ1 + σ22 ) S
                   2


                                                     10
                   Figure 3: Outsider Demand Curve Slope

    is the slope of the aggregate insider demand curve times the variance
of their signal minus the slope of the aggregate noise trader demand curve
times the variance of their “signal.” If the noise traders are “noisier” than
the insiders are “inside”, then the demand curve will be downward sloping.
    The middle term
       rN
   γ(σ12+ σ22 )

    is the slope of the aggregate noise trader demand curve. When this slope
is small, the noise trader demand is highly inelastic, so it is difficult to trade


                                       11
with them without changing the price significantly. This makes it harder
to trade against noise trader irrationality, a significant source of equilibrium
profits for the outsiders. And limited ability to make profits from the noise
traders dampens the outsider’s willingness to trade, making his demand curve
less steep.
    When this slope is large, the outsiders can gain a lot by trading against
them. When this slope is small, the noise traders make it hard to trade
against them so the outsider’s demand curve is less steep.
    The first term is harder to interpret.

                  1
    rσ12                        2

    γσ22
           I(1 − N ) +   γ(σ12 +σ22 )


    The second term in the denominator is N times the slope of the aggregate
noise trader demand curve times the variance of their shock. The first term
is the slope of the aggregate insider demand curve times the variance of their
shock, times I(1 − N ), which is a term describing the interaction between
the insiders and the outsiders trying to emulate them.
    We would like to understand this demand curve in terms of three effects:
the outsiders trying to trade against the noise traders, trying to avoid adverse
selection from better-informed insiders, and trying to trade with insiders
when they have a strong signal.
    We interpret the middle term as being solely a matter of trading against
noise traders. This makes sense, as it does not involve the insiders so cannot
have anything to do with them.
                     Iσ 2
    The expression σ21 appears in the outsider’s demand curve both additively
                       2
and multiplicatively. In the third term it describes the portion of information
due to insiders, which increases the outsider’s desire to trade with insiders,
driving up the slope. We therefore interpret this term as a following-insiders
or positive-feedback effect.
    The expression also appears in the denominator of the first term, and it
is large when insiders are aggressive traders. The effect of a big term here
is to make the slope flatter, regardless of its sign. When there is enough
                                                                             Iσ 2
information in the market for the curve to be upward sloping, a large σ21
                                                                               2
makes it less upward sloping. When there is not enough information in the
market for the outsiders to have an upward sloping demand curve, this term
makes their demand curve less downward sloping. We interpret this term

                                        12
as the adverse selection term. Whenever insiders are aggressive, it makes
outsiders less aggressive because they are afraid of trading on the opposite
side of the market from insiders.
    We can directly evaluate the outsider demand curve slope at N = 0 and
I = 0 to see how the outsiders behave in the simple cases
                                 dDO         r
                       I=0⇒          =−                                   (18)
                                  dp    γ(σ1 + σ22 )
                                           2


                                        dDO
                             N =0⇒          =0                            (19)
                                         dp
    These are reassuring. With only noise traders to trade against, the out-
siders’ demand is very elastic, since they know that trading against noise
traders is optimal because prices contain no new information. With only
insiders to trade with, the demand curve is perfectly inelastic because prices
are fully revealing and everyone behaves like an insider (no-trade theorem
intuition applies). The separating case is easy to identify:

Lemma 2. The slope of the outsider’s demand curve is positive if and only
if σI2 σ12 > (σ2N     σ 2 > 0.
                +σ 2 ) S
    2       1   2


   Lemma 2 says the outsider’s demand curve is upward sloping if the ex-
pectation of the proportion of a price move due to insiders is greater than
the proportion due to noise traders. In particular, for every market with a
nonzero number of insiders, there is a N > 0 such that the outsider’s demand
curve is positively sloping whenever 0 < N < N . Moreover, it can be shown
that for a fixed positive number of noise traders, more insiders always means
a higher slope of the demand curve.
   In the next section we consider the implications of this outsider behavior
on market equilibrium.


3       Market Equilibrium
                                                   ∂p
We are interested in whether it is possible for ∂S    to be large in the Region
of Interest. We know that it is generally very small on the axes because the
sophisticated traders effectively trade against the noise traders. The general
                ∂p
expression for ∂S  is difficult to analyze in the interior of the domain, so we
take three alternative approaches.

                                      13
    First, we analyze the special cases that we do understand well: markets
with either no noise traders or no insiders. By understanding these markets
thoroughly, we can gain insights into the behavior of markets with similar
compositions.
                                                        ∂p
    Second, we perform local experiments: we ask how ∂S    changes as we move
infinitesimally away from one of our well-understood cases. The market with
                             ∂p
no insiders has a very small ∂S , as does the market with no noise traders. We
          ∂p
ask how ∂S changes when we add the first marginal insider or noise trader.
These two experiments we analyze are depicted in figure 4.




            Figure 4: Changing the Composition of the Market
                                                 ∂p
   The final approach is numerical. We calculate ∂S for a range of parameter
                                                              ∂p
values and across the Region of Interest to establish that ∂S    can in fact


                                     14
achieve a maximum near the origin.

3.1    The cases of the missing types
To gain more insight into the market equilibrium, we evaluate the compara-
tive statics of price in the cases in which either noise traders, insider traders,
or uninformed sophisticated traders are missing. First suppose noise traders
                                            2
are absent. When N = 0, note that σO           = σ22 , so the expressions for the
impact of information and sentiment on price become
                                    ∂p    σ1
                                        =                                    (20)
                                    ∂ν1   r
                                      ∂p
                                          =0                                 (21)
                                      ∂S
    This is intuitive. If there is no noise coming from the noise traders, then
the uninformed investors can perfectly back out the signal ν1 , so they behave
as if they are informed. Now setting I = 0 to get rid of the insider traders
                                  2
and noting that this implies σO     = σ12 + σ22 , the comparative statics become
                                    ∂p
                                        =0                                   (22)
                                    ∂ν1
                                     ∂p    N
                                         =                                  (23)
                                    ∂S      r
    Again this is an intuitively appealing result. The outsiders know that any
price movement is due to noise traders so choose to trade against it, but their
ability to do so is limited by their risk bearing capacity. Their collective risk
bearing capacity depends on their mass O, which is pinned down here to be
1 − N . Thus the O + N term disappears from the denominator.
    Finally we can look at the situation with only insiders and noise traders,
so O = 0.
                         ∂p   Iσ1 I      N
                             = 2( 2 + 2          )−1                         (24)
                         ∂ν1  rσ2 σ2 (σ1 + σ22 )
                     ∂p       N       I      N
                        =    2    2
                                     ( 2+ 2     2
                                                    )−1                      (25)
                     ∂S   r(σ1 + σ2 ) σ2 (σ1 + σ2 )



                                       15
    The intuition for these results is exactly as above. These results make
clear that the model we present subsumes as a special case the previously
studied models of bilateral trade. Each of the three possible pairings has
been studied separately, and we are looking at what happens when all three
types are present.

3.2    The First Noise Trader
                                                             ∂p
When there are no noise traders in the market, we know ∂S        is zero. The
main contention of this paper is that markets with very small numbers of
noise traders need not behave qualitatively like markets with none at all.
                                                              ∂p
    To quantify this claim, we can look at the difference in ∂S   when we go
from N = 0 to N > 0. To keep the size of the market constant, we perform
this experiment holding the number of insiders constant and changing an
outsider into a noise trader. That is, dO = −dN . This is a comparison of
the equilibrium behavior of two different but similarly composed markets.
The strongest possible proof of our claim would be a discontinuous jump.
This does not occur, but the next strongest proof would be a very high
derivative at 0. In the appendix we prove that this is exactly what we see:

trarily large for small I.

   Since we generally think of the insiders as being a small population, this
proposition focuses on the most relevant part of the domain. In this re-
gion, the first marginal noise trader can have an enormous impact on market
equilibrium despite being infinitesimally small herself.
   The driving force behind this result is the positive slope of the outsider’s
demand curve. At N = 0 the outsider’s demand curve is flat. By Lemma 2,
adding a sufficiently small number of noise traders will make the outsider’s
demand curve strictly upward sloping. With an upward sloping demand
curve, the outsiders will trade with any price movement they observe. When
the noise trader does start trading, the outsiders chase her trading very
aggressively, mistaking it for an insider trade. This causes the sentiment S
to be factored into the price much more strongly than it would if only the
noise trader were trading on it.
   Subsequent noise traders do not have nearly as big an effect because the
outsider’s demand curve flattens and eventually become downward sloping as


                                            16
more and more noise traders join the market. Nevertheless, this proposition
captures the fact that it does not take many noise traders to get a noisy
market.
    This big effect only comes into play because the outsider’s demand curves
is upward sloping at N ≈ 0. This highlights the centrality of the presence of
insiders. Without them, this slope would not be positive and the effects of
noise would not be nearly so pronounced. This suggests that there may be
circumstances in which adding insiders can destabilize the market. We show
exactly that in the next section.

3.3    Destabilizing Insiders
In a market with only noise traders and outsiders, the outsiders know any
price movement to be caused by the noise traders, so they trade against any
price movements they observe. Their demand curves are strongly downward
sloping. Outsiders’ willingness to keep the noise traders from affecting market
prices is limited only by their risk-bearing capacity. What happens when we
start adding insiders? In a perfect world, two nice things would happen.
First, the insiders’ information would be factored into the price perfectly,
and the insiders, who have a lower perceived variance and thus a higher risk
bearing capacity, would effectively trade against any noise trader shocks.
                                         ∂p
    To examine this, we look at how ∂S      changes when we add dI insiders.
Holding the number of noise traders constant so that dI = −dO, the exper-
iment we’re considering is turning an outsider into an insider.
    The derivative is hard to evaluate in general analytically, but can be
                                                         ∂σ 2
signed locally near I = 0 because of the fact that ∂IO |I=0 = 0. In the
appendix we prove the following proposition

Proposition 2. For sufficiently small levels of σS2 , N, and I, increasing the
number of insiders while decreasing the number of outsiders actually increases
                         ∂2p
price instability, i.e. ∂S∂I >0

    Instead of decreasing the impact of noise traders, adding an insider in-
creases it. This effect holds in particular in the Region of Interest near
the origin, where there are many outsiders. The intuition for this result is
twofold. First, when insiders join the market, the informativeness of prices
to the outsiders goes up quickly. In particular if σ1 is large compared to σS
and the insiders are “more” inside than the noise traders are noisy, the slope


                                      17
of the outsider’s demand curve quickly shifts upward. The first marginal
insider is not enough to make the demand curve slope up, but as the curve
shifts towards flatness, the outsiders stop trading against the noise traders,
so the noise traders have a greater impact. This effect is magnified by the
fact that in the Region of Interest there are many outsiders all trading with
the same strategy.
    Second, after enough insiders have been added to the market, the out-
sider demand curve becomes upward sloping. Once this happens, they start
actively trading with any price movement they see. Since they cannot dis-
tinguish between price movements caused by insiders and outsiders, they
occasionally trade with the noise traders. Again since there are many of
them, on these occasions the market behaves like there is a large mass of
noise traders.
                                                            ∂p
    Proposition 3 shows that in a neighborhood of I = 0, ∂S    is increasing in
I, but does not tell us anything globally. We can numerically calculate these
derivatives for a range of parameter values.

                  Figure 5: Price Sensitivity to Noise:   ∂S


   The figures make clear that the effects described are strongest when the
noise traders are not very noisy. When the average quality of insider infor-
mation σ1 is high compared to the average size of the sentiment shock σS ,
the odds that any price movement is due to noise trading is low, so it is
optimal most of the time for the outsider to trade with the price movement.
In these situations large sentiment shocks do not happen often, but even
moderate shocks can become enormously magnified– even more so than in
markets with only noise traders.
   In this sense, the question is one of ex-ante or ex-post stability. Ex-ante,
the additional insiders make the price system more informative (shown below)
and more stable most of the time. Ex-post and for specific realizations of S,

the additional insiders increase ∂S and so increase the sensitivity of the price
to these shocks. This is a measure of ex-post instability.
    It is tempting to make normative judgements about the effects of insiders
based on this destabilizing effect, but to do so would be premature. Adding
insiders does increase the effect of the noise trader sentiment, increasing
market volatility at time 1, but it also leads to fundamental information
being factored into the price more effectively, leading to less volatility at
time 2. Figure 6 below shows the effect of the fundamental shock ν1 on the
period 1 price for different market configurations and parameter values. In
all cases, more insiders moves the market toward more fully pricing their
fundamental information. In this respect, they are stabilizing the market.
    Recall that the cases in which insiders are destabilizing are those in which
σS is small compared to σ1 and the composition of the market lies in the
Region of Interest. These are exactly the markets where noise traders are
generally very quiet. Most of the time, the noise traders get only a small
shock, the insider information gets factored into the price effectively, and
the market behaves well. It is only on a rare occasion (like the spring of
2007, we argue) that the noise traders get a moderate or big shock and the

                                          20
market behaves inefficiently because the rational outsiders trade along with
the noise.

3.4    Demand Covariance
We would like to think that most of the time outsiders successfully trade with
the insiders. The result of the previous section showed that when they fail to
do so, they can fail rather dramatically. Here we show that on average, they
do indeed trade together. A reasonable way to measure whether outsiders and
insiders trade together is the covariance of their demands. In the appendix
we prove the following proposition

                                     21
Proposition 3. The outsiders on average trade with the insiders. Specifi-
cally, Cov(DI , DO ) ≥ 0

    This is extremely intuitive. If the outsiders are rational, they must be
doing their best to emulate the insiders. If their demands did not positively
covary, it would be profitable for the outsiders to flip the slope of their
demand curves.
    How can proposition 3 and propositions 1/2 be true at the same time?
    Most of the time the outsiders trade with the insiders (this is Prop 3).
They do not, however, trade on the same side of the market 100% of the
time. On rare occasion (for the parameter values we are interested in), the
noise traders will get a modestly big shock. Because of the signal extraction
at the heart of the model, the outsiders believe that there was most likely
an insider shock, so trade with the noise traders. This means that the effect
of a moderate noise trader shock is big (Props 1 and 2), but only rarely is
there a big enough noise trader shock to cause the outsiders to trade against
the insiders.
                                        ∂p
    Proposition 2 is a statement about ∂S  and how that derivative changes as
we vary the number of insiders in the market. Now, we expect this derivative
to be non-negative regardless of the composition of the market, because a
slight increase in S shifts up the noise trader’s demand curve while leaving
everyone else’s unaffected.
    Fundamentally, Propositions 3 and 1/2 are about different things. Prop
3 is for each fixed set of parameter values (specifically, the makeup of the
market). Propositions 1 and 2 are answering questions about two simultane-
ous experiments: how much bigger would the price have been if S had been
higher by dS? With that question answered, how much bigger would the
answer to that question be if I were higher by dI?


4     Other Measures of Market Stability and
      Efficiency
4.1    Good Variance, Bad Variance
Another metric to measure the impact noise traders have on market efficiency
is the variance of the equilibrium asset price. That variance can be written
as


                                     22
                                  ∂p 2 2      ∂p 2
                            σp2 = (  ) σS + (     )                         (26)
                                  ∂S          ∂ν1
    This variance naturally splits into two pieces: variance caused by sen-
timent shocks, and variance caused by insider information being factored
into the price. The latter is “good variance,” as it reduces volatility between
times 1 and 2. The remaining “bad variance” can be looked at as the variance
perceived by the insider
                                             ∂p 2 2
                             var(p|ν1 ) = (     )σ                            (27)
                                             ∂S S
    From this equation, it is clear that analyzing var(p|ν1 ) is nearly equivalent
              ∂p
to analyzing ∂S  . Holding σS constant and varying other parameters, increases
   ∂p                                                                      ∂p
in ∂S map one-to-one into increases in var(p|ν1 ). As σS goes to zero, ∂S     gets
large, but that effect is offset by the decrease in σS . In the appendix we show
that the limit of var(p|ν1 ) as σS goes to zero is zero, and that the convergence
is asymptotically linear. This tempers the strength of some of our results,
but leaves unchanged the conclusions about how the market behavior varies
as we vary the market composition.
    We would like to think that in a market composed of sophisticated in-
vestors, adding insiders would be stabilizing and would decrease the variance
                                             ∂p
of the price. Proposition 1 showed that ∂S       can increase, so it comes as no
surprise that the variance of price can also be increased by the addition of
insiders. In the appendix we prove the following proposition

Proposition 4. For sufficiently small N and I, changing a marginal outsider
into an insider increases both the variance of the price and the “bad variance.”

    The set of parameters for which the variance increases is identical to the
               ∂p
set for which ∂S  increases in proposition 4.
    By this metric as well, adding insiders to a market is destabilizing. The
interaction between insiders and outsiders in the presence of noise traders
causes the noise trader shock to be integrated into the price more strongly,
increasing the “bad variance.” It also has the effect of increasing the sensitiv-
ity of the price to the insider’s information, increasing the “good variance.”
Naturally, this leads to the question of which effect effect is stronger. A nat-
ural way to compare the strength of these two effects is the Informativeness
of the Price System, which we consider next.


                                       23
                     Figure 7: Standard deviation of p

4.2    Informativeness of the Price System
Grossman and Stiglitz define the “informativeness of the price system” to be
(corr(p, ν1 ))2 . The informativeness in this case can be written as
                            ∂p 2
                          ( ∂ν 1
                                 )                 1
                                     =          σ24 σS
                                                     2                 (28)
                            σp2          N2
                                                            +1
                                         I2   (σ1 +σ22 )2
                                                2


   From this expression two important propositions immediately follow:

Proposition 5. Adding insiders always weakly increases the informativeness
of the price system.

                                         24
Proposition 6. Adding noise traders always decreases the informativeness of
the price system. This effect becomes unboundedly large as I and N approach
zero.

    Any increase in the number of insiders increases the informativeness of
the price system. This can be seen as the combination of two effects. First,
chasing behavior by the outsiders causes the “bad variance” to increase,
which would tend to dampen then informativeness of the price system. At
the same time though, this chasing behavior is applied to any information
that the insiders have. The outsiders chase the insiders, and the “good
variance” increases. Proposition 5 says that the good variance increases by
more than the bad variance.
    Proposition 6 considers an alternative experiment of adding noise traders
(while removing outsiders). It is no surprise that additional noise traders
decrease the informativeness of the price, but it is by no means obvious that
the effect can become unboundedly large as I goes to zero.
    We’ve analyzed three ways of measuring the stability and efficiency of the
market, with an eye towards seeing whether a small number of noise traders
can have an effect. The principal conclusion is that the presence of noise
traders can in fact have a large influence on the market equilibrium. Ex-
ante, small numbers of noise traders do little to diminish the informativeness
of the price system, but can hugely increase the variance of the price in period
1. The result we focus more on is the surprising one: ex-post, markets with a
small number of noise traders can have large sensitivities to the noise trader
        ∂p
shock, ∂S  . This, perhaps, can explain the evidence in Figure 1.

                ∂p
4.3    Why      ∂S   is Important
Given that there is at least one metric which cleanly identifies the efficiency
                                                                        ∂p
of the market, why bother with any other metrics, in particular ∂S         ? The
model is stylized and effectively static, but if we think of it as repeating
itself, the time series behavior will be best described by the variance and
informativeness results. It is only when trying to understand specific market
                   ∂p
realizations that ∂S   is important.
    The ex-ante metrics show us that on average, the noise traders may have
a fairly small effect in the Region of Interest. It is no surprise that the price
reacts to the noise trader shock. What is surprising is that the sensitivity
of the price to the noise trader shock is not monotonically decreasing in the

                                       25
number of insiders. In order to understand particular instances of sophisti-
                                                                  ∂p
cated markets going awry, it is important to keep in mind that ∂S     is liable
to be big exactly in the markets in which we think noise traders are quietest.


5    Conclusion
We presented a simple model in which rational but uninformed traders occa-
sionally chase noise as if it were information, thereby amplifying sentiment
shocks and moving price away from fundamental values. The model offers a
partial explanation for the surprisingly low market price of financial risk in
the Spring of 2007.
    We fill a theoretical gap in the literature by showing conditions under
which noise traders can have an impact on market equilibrium dispropor-
tionate to their size in the market. Explaining market outcomes by calling
on large numbers of noise traders or large sentiment shocks is not always
plausible, but we show that neither of these is necessary in order for noise
traders to be relevant.
    A key feature of the model is the way in which sophisticated but unin-
formed investors learn from prices. Of course, such investors may entertain
more complicated models and use other public information, such as bond
ratings, in forming their demands. This may lead to similar phenomena.
If ratings agencies usually do a good job of assessing the riskiness of bond
offerings, it may be rational for uninformed traders to use these ratings as
a rule-of-thumb to assess underlying value. On those occasions when the
ratings agencies are wrong, this will induce correlated mistakes among the
mass of uninformed traders, which will overwhelm the price impact of any
better-informed traders in the market. It is only when the direct news about
valuations reaches the uninformed investors that the market would correct
itself. In this example, uninformed traders would rationally end up chasing
noise thinking that it reflects information.


A     Derivation of Conditional Expectation and
      Variance
    We begin by deriving the demand curves directly from utility maximiza-
tion. Let p be the price of the asset. The value is as above. Agent i begins

                                      26
with wealth Wi and chooses demand Di to maximize

   Ei [−e−γ(Di V +(Wi −Di p)r) ]

    Maximizing this expression is equivalent to minimizing minus this expres-
sion, which is in turn equivalent to minimizing the log of that. Assuming for
the moment that V is normally distributed conditional on agent i’s informa-
tion set, then we are trying to minimize
                                      γ2 2 2
   −γEi [(Di V + (Wi − Di p)r)] +     2
                                        Di σi (V   )

    where Ei denotes the expectation with respect to agent i’s information
set and σi2 (V ) denotes the variance of V conditional on agent i’s information
set. The first order condition in Di is

   0 = −γEi [V ] + γpr + γ 2 Di σi2 (V )

              Ei [V ] − pr
   ⇒ Di =
               γσi2 (V )

   For the insider, this becomes
          µ+σ1 ν1 −pr
   Di =      γσ22


   For the outsider, this becomes
          µ+E[σ1 ν1 |p]−pr
   Di =       γσO 2



                          2                  2
   where E[σ1 ν1 |p] and σO are endogenous. σO is given by

    2
   σO = V ar(σ1 ν1 |p) + σ22

   Finally, the demand for the noise traders is given by
          µ+S−pr
   Di =      2
           γσN

          2
   where σN is the variance perceived by the noise traders. Since the noise

traders do not observe a signal or use the price to update their information
                                                                   2
set, their perceived variance is the same as the ex-ante variance σN = (σ12 +
σ22 ). With all this in hand, we can proceed to solve the model. Imposing

    The outsider observes the price and in equilibrium knows her own con-
ditional expectation, so knows the left hand side of this equation. Thus she
knows the right hand side, so we can find the conditional variance of σI2 σ1 ν1

First, we start with the derivative of σO :
      2

               ∂

                            1 1       2          S 2



    = −2IN 2 σ14 σS2 σ24 (σ12 + σ22 )2 (I 2 σ12 (σ12 + σ22 )2 + N 2 σS2 σ24 )−2

   Note that this are zero at I = 0. Next we look at the derivatives of A
and B.

    ∂I
          =     ( O2
              ∂I γσO
                             +    I
                                 γσ22
                                        +       N
                                            γ(σ12 +σ22 )
                                                         )

                                2

               O


    At I = 0 this becomes

    = − γ(σ21+σ2 ) +              1

    This is ugly to evaluate in general, but we can evaluate it at I = 0:

Finally, we can take a derivative of                                   ∂S
                                                                            with respect to I:

Again, hard to evaluate, but at I = 0 this becomes

When I = 0, A and B become:

We can do a similar analysis turning an outsider into a noise trader, starting
                              ∂2p
from zero noise traders. If ∂S∂N  |N =0 is large and positive, this shows that
markets with almost no noise need not behave almost like markets with no

   We are primarily interested in cases when O is big and N is small. Again,
the truth of the proposition can be read directly off of this last expression.

B.3      Demand Covariance
                        1 ν1 −pr µ+E[σ1 ν1 |p]−pr
Cov(DI , DO ) = Cov( µ+σγσ 2    ,    γσ 2
                                                  )

            1
   =            2 Cov(σ1 ν1
       γ 2 σ22 σO
                              − pr, E[σ1 ν1 |p] − pr)

   Ignoring the constant term, we can write

   Cov(σ1 ν1 − pr, E[σ1 ν1 |p] − pr) = Cov(σ1 ν1 − pr, E[σ1 ν1 − pr|p])

    The second term in this covariance is the conditional expectation of the
first term, that is, the function F (p) that satisfies

   E[σ1 ν1 − pr − F (p)] = 0

   and minimizes

   E[(σ1 ν1 − pr − F (p))2 ]

   over all functions F (p) which satisfy the first condition. We can write the
second moment criterion as

   E[(σ1 ν1 − pr)2 ] + E[F (p)2 ] − 2E[(σ1 ν1 − pr)F (p)]

   = E[(σ1 ν1 −pr)2 ]+E[F (p)2 ]−2Cov(σ1 ν1 −pr, F (p))−2E[σ1 ν1 −pr]E[F (p)]

   From the first criterion, E[F (p)] = E[σ1 ν1 − pr], so this becomes

   = E[(σ1 ν1 − pr)2 ] − 2E[σ1 ν1 − pr]2 + E[F (p)2 ] − 2Cov(σ1 ν1 − pr, F (p))

   Suppose for the moment that the covariance we care about is negative.
Then we are subtracting two of that covariance in this expression, or adding a
positive term. Replacing F (p) with E[F (p)] will then decrease the E[F (p)2 ]
term (by Jensen’s Inequality) and turn the covariance turn to zero, thus


                                              35
decreasing the second moment we’re trying to minimize. It follows that the
covariance is non-negative, as desired. We have the desired proposition.

condition becomes
