                 Measuring the Fed's Revenue from Money Creation



                                   ABSTRACT



     The national accounts include the Fed's payments to the Treasury as

a component of corporate taxes. These payments constituted 22% of reported

corporate profits taxes in 1981. This paper discusses alternative concepts

of inflationary finance. Measures for these concepts are reported for the

post—World War II period.

     Most economists know that the Federal Reserve system pays out the bulk

of its net revenues to the U.S. Treasury. However, very few economists

(actually, none whom I have asked) know where this term appears in the national

accounts. The Federal Reserve is treated as a member of the corporate sector.

The Fed's payments to the Treasury (labeled as "interest on Federal Reserve

notes") are regarded as taxes on corporate profits (at nearly a 100% rate in

this case). Therefore, the category, "corporate profits tax accruals," includes

as a substantial component the earnings of the Fed. Anyone using the aggregate

corporate tax figures to measure levies on the activities of private

businesses should know about this peculiarity in the data.

     The data from 1946-81 for amounts paid from the Fed to the U.S.

Treasury, corporate profits tax accruals (which include the first item),

and the ratio of the Fed's payments to the figures on corporate profits

taxes are shown in Table 1. (Payments from the Fed were near zero. for

most years prior to 1946.) The Fed's payments constitute 22% of measured

corporate profits taxes in 1981! The ratio was 17% in 1980, between 8%

and 12% from 1969 to 1979, between 3% and 7% from 1959 to 1968, and below

3% prior to 1959. In other words the "tax payments" by the Fed significantly

distort the reported measures of total corporate profits taxes for recent

years. Presumably, this effect will be at least this important in the near

future.

     We often measure the inflation tax as the product of an interest rate,

R, and    the   quantity of high-powered (non-interest-bearing) money, H.

Auernheimer (1974) discusses the sense in which this construct, R.H,

measures the effective flow of revenues for the government. He

 also relates this measure to the change in the stock of base      money, LJ-1.   If

 we neglected the finite maturity of the Fed's bond portfolio, and such items

 as administrative expenditures net of fees, gold, float, Treasury deposits,

 and surplus, then the payments of net revenues to the Treasury would maintain

 equality over time between the monetary base (now consisting of Federal

 Reserve notes and the reserves of depository institutions held at the Fed)

 and   the   Fed's total portfolio of securities and loans. Hence, the amount

 earned on the Fed's portfolio (all of which would be transferred to the

 Treasury) would equal R•H. In practice, there are some differences--these

include the following: 1) when interest rates rise, the yield on the Fed's

holdings (measured at book value) respond only gradually, and vice versa

when interest rates fall; 2) a small part of the Fed's revenues go into

surplus; and 3) there are changes over time in gold, treasury deposits,

float, etc.

       Table 2 reports values from 1946-81 for the Federal Reserve's

net revenues; for the product, Rfl (where ii   is   the annual average of high-

powered money); and for the change in base money, iH. The interest rate, R,

is measured as the yield on U.S. government securities with 3-year maturities

(3 to 5 years before 1953). This rate approximates the yield on the Fed's

portfolio. The Fed's revenues are always below the constructed measure,

R•H. Principally, this gap reflects an excess (currently about $20 billion)

of the monetary base over the Fed's loan portfolio (measured at book value).

Basically, a gap of roughly this size appeared with the large acquisitions

of gold during the 1930s. Otherwise, this gap has fluctuated mostly because

of changes in Treasury deposits, float, and gold holdings (measured at book

value, except for a few increases in the official price of gold).

       Recently, the Fed's revenues have lagged behind R•H because of sharp

 increases in interest rates. In 1981 the Fed's net proceeds of $14.6 billion

 were substantially below the figure of RH = $23.6 billion

      The change over the year in the monetary base, H, would correspond

 to R.IT only if the nominal interest
                                            rate equaled the growth rate of the
 monetary base. Typically, Ed-I <   R.J-1   applies, although substantial fluctua-
 tions arise from year to year. Notice that the change in high-powered

money for 1981 is only $8.0 billion, as compared with the Fed's revenue of

$14.6 billion and the value of R•H = $23.6 billion.
                                                            (A rise in the real
interest rate means more revenue
                                    to the Fed without any change in the growth
rate of prices or the monetary base.)

     Table 3 expresses the measures of inflationary finance as ratios to the

federal government's total tax and
                                       non-tax receipts, T, and as ratios to
nominal GNP. As a fraction of total federal
                                                   receipts in 1981, the inflation
tax, RH, is 3.8%, while the Fed's revenues are 2.3%. These percentages are

roughly double those applying in the early l960s.        As a fraction of GNP in

1981, the inflationtaxis 0.8%, while the Fed's revenues are 0.5%. These

fractions are more than double those for the early 1960s.1

Jo Anna Gray was a great help in locating some data for 1981. Cathy
McDevitt found some other data. Marty Feldstein motivated me to look
into this topic. He told me that the Fed's revenues appeared in a
strange place in the national accounts, but he couldn't remember where.
