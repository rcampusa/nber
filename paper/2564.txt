        Is There A Regional Bias in Federal Tax Subsidy Rates for Giving?

     This study examines req ional variation in average subsidy rates for

charitable donations. Because the tax incentive for contributions is
in an itemized deduction, the subsidy rate for an individual depends on the

taxoayers itemization status and marginal tax rate. It
this subsidy rate rises with Income. On a regional level, one  uld    expect
that subsidy rates  uld  be higher in wealthier regions. What is not clear is
the extent of such variation or whether subsidy rates vary systematically
independent of income.  In order to examine the various sources of variation,
we decompse subsidy rates. We find significant variation in subsidy rates
                                                                     bias in
independent of income, in what appears to be an unintended regional
the federal clicy   toward charitable giving.  If sst contributions remain in
the state or region of the donor, this bias will tend to affect the regional
development of the nonprofit sector.

                          GIVING?*

Introduction
       It is well known that the use of deductions in the
federal income tax to encourage certain expenditures

results in unequal subsidy rates.        In the case of most

charitable contributions, for example, the government's
effective rate of subsidy is equal to the taxpayer's

marginal tax rate if the taxpayer is an itemizer.        The

resulting "upside—downt' pattern of subsidies,      in which "the

opportunity cost of virtue falls as one moves up the income
scale" (Nusgrave and Musgrave, 1980,      p.   362), has been

criticized for its "plutocratic bias" (Vickrey, 1947, p.

131)1.    Others accept this pattern as a natural by-product

of using the deduction form in tax incentives.2 Whatever
its desirability, no one can doubt that rich taxpayers

typically face a   lower   net   cost of contributing   a dollar
than taxpayers at lower incomes.
     A question thtt is less well understood is how much

average federal subsidies differ bt state and region of the
country.    Dispersion at the     stat! or regional level may
well take on greatâr significinél for tax policy than
individual differences. It appears, for example, that         a
dollar of   contributions on 'avCrage receives more federal

subsidy in some regions than others.       Such differences   ilay,

of courss, bi due to differences In income. But, because
subsidy rates depend on whether a tflpayer it an itemizer.
and on the Amount of other deductions, there are other
factors that affect regio1 differences. If most
charitable gifts tend to stay close to a donor's home,
variations in subsidy rates may have a significant impact
on regional patterns of giving and on relative growth rates
in the nonprofit sector. Without evidence on the extent of
variation in subsidy rates by state or region, however, it
is impossible to judge whether such differences in
aggregate subsidy rates are worth worrying about.




                                     2
     Our objective in this paper is to document and analyze
differences in average tax subsidy rates among states.            We
calculate the subsidy rate for charitable contributions,
but the results would be about the same if we had chosen

mortgage interest or     a   number of other expenditure items
subsidized through personal deductions.         We focus on the

federal subsidy rate because criticisms of the disparities
in subsidy rates are strongest when applied to the federal

tax alone.      Finally, the analysis is positive,    not

normative,     although criticisms of disparities in subsidy
rates do tend to be based on normative considerations of

efficiency and equity.        We begin by considering the reasons

why subsidy rates differ among individual taxpayers.         We

then examine average subsidy rates by state.         In order to

separate the principal influences on subsidy rates, we
present   a   decomposition of subsidy rates.


Why Subsidy Rates Differ


     When the income tax allows      a   taxpayer to deduct an
item of personal expediture, such as mortgage interest or




                                     3
charitable contributions, the government in effect

subsidizes the expenditure at the taxpayeres marginal tax
rate.     The subsidy rates applying in such cases differ

among individuals for two reasons.                First, marginal tax

rates differ,       generally rising with income,         Second,
deduction-'based subsidies are available to taxpayers who

itemize their deductions.          The   majority who    take the
standard deduction receive no subsidy at all for additional

expenditures on favored items.            The standard sort of

subsidy we wish to consider here             is   an itemized deduction
allowed in the calculation of taxable income.               The rate of

subsidy    (s)    in this case is equal to the marginal tax rate

(in)   for taxpayers who itemize their deductions and zero for
those who do not.          The effect of this subsidy is to reduce
the taxpayers net cost per dollar of the expenditure to

$l(l—s).        Subsidy rates can of course be calculated for
other types of provisions, such as tax credits, deductions

subject to ceilings or floors, or percentage deductions,
but in the present paper we restrict our attention to a

simple deduction with no limitation.
        Where    I is   the probability of being an itemizer, the




                                         4
expected subsidy rate is              s=Ixn.    Because the standard

deduction offers          a    kind of threshold for itemization, the

probability of itemization is a function of deductible
expenses     (D),   which in turn are a function of income                     (Y),

the number and cost of deductible items                     (X),   and tax status

(e.g., single,          joint returns>.         A taxpayer's marginal tax
rate is a function of taxable income.                     Where    Z   represents
other characteristics such as tax status and number of

exemptions,     the subsidy rate may be written
     s   =   I(D(Y,X),Z)          ni(Y,D(Y,X),Z).                            (1)

     This formulation makes clear that subsidy rates vary
on the basis of three factors: income, deductible

expenditures, and taxpayer characteristics such as family
size and marital status.3                     The effect of income on the

subsidy rate is likely to be positive, but the effect is
not unambiguous due to the negative effect of increased

deductible expenditures on the marginal tax rate, given by
the partial derivative              m' (D).

                              +      +               +         —         +

     s'(Y)     =    m   I'(D)     D'(Y) + I     [rn'(Y)   + m'(D) D'(Y)].          (2)

 In general, however,              one expects subsidy rates to rise




                                                5
with income in      a   progressive tax system.         Thus average

subsidy rates will tend to be higher in wealthier states
and regions.

     Similarly, the opportunity to make deductible
expenditures has opposing effects on the subsidy rate.
When income    is   exogenous, the effect is
                         +

     s'(X) = m It(X) + I m'(X).                                 (3)

Where the increase in the subsidy rate due to an increase
in itemization shown by the first term on the right

outweighs the effect due to the reduction in the marginal
tax rate, the overall impact of having more or more

expensive deductible items          is   to increase subsidy rates.
This effect is illustrated by the observation that one of
the best predictors of a taxpayers subsidy rate for
charitable gifts is whether the taxpayer is a homeowner,
since home ownership         i   usually accompanied by large
deductions which make it advantageous to itemize
deductions.    Similarly, living in           a state   with expensive
housing increases a taxpayerts chance of itemizing.
     At the aggregate level, the effect of deduction levels




                                          6
on subsidy rates implies that in states and regions with

higher levels of deductible expenditures (other than
charitable contributions) subsidy rates for contributions

will tend to be higher.       States with expensive housing and

heavy tax burdens, for example, will have more itemizers
and thus higher average subsidy rates for giving.             In

particular,    the amount of state and local taxes paid by a

household is largely nondiscretionary given one's state of
residence.     Taxpayers in   a   given state have little control
over the amount of state taxes they pay, although they can
influence the amount of local taxes through their choice of
a house.     There is more individual control over the size of
the mortgage interest deduction, though that cost is

certainly a function of the cost of housing in          a   given

region.    Other deductible items would appear to have only a
limited regional component.


The Extent of Dissimilarity        in   Average Subsidy Rates
     As the above discussion implies, tax subsidy rates may

differ systematically across states and regions due to
differences in income, deductions other than contributions,




                                        7
    and taxpayer       characte4stics.         The question then becomes,
    Is this empirically iwportait?                  In order to   answer   this
    question,   we have        calculated average subsidy rates for
    charitable       contri4nations     by state for 1983 using the TAXSIM
    model, of the National!Bureau of Economic Research. The
    sample   consists of 75,960 records of taxpayers with                  incomes
    under   $200,000.         This cutoff is necessitated because the

    public-use tax files do not provide stat of residence for
    taxpayers Sn. the highest income classes. The excluded
    returns constitute             aout 0.2   percent of all returns and
    account for 4.6 •percánt of total adjusted gross income.
•
    For the purpose           of   comparison, average subsidy rates are
    calcälated. in two ways:           unweighted and weighted by adjusted

    gross income.        While the unweighted averages show the

    sasidy rates that apply to the typical taxpayer, the
    weighted values reflect the potential importance of the
    subsidy    as'   measured by dollars of expenditure.

                                                8
The states at the top have rates roughly twice the size of
those at the bottom.    When individual subsidy rates are

weighted by income, the absolute differences are greater,
although the rates are still roughly twice as high in the
top states as in the bottom states.      At the extremes, the

figures indicate that the average dollar of income receives
a   subsidy rate of .24 in Washington,   D.C. compared to rate

of only .10 in South Dakota.    The average price of giving     a

dollar of income in the District was     .76,   about 15 percent
less than the average price of .90 in South Dakota.       If the

price elasticity of contributions is -1.3, this difference
in the net cost of giving would imply differences in

contributions of roughly 20 percent.4       To the extent that

differences such as this merely reflect geographical
differences in income alone, this gap is just an aggregate
manifestation of the income-bias inherent in the deduction
form of subsidy.    In order to assess the importance of

these disparities, it is necessary to distinguish the pure

effect of income from the effect of other regionally—

specific aspects.




                                  9
Decomposing verage Tax Subsidy Rates
      Part of the difference among average subsidy rates no

doubt is due to differences in income.                  Such disparities in
rates are inevitable as long as subsidies are provided in

the form of deductions within         a    progressive income tax with
a standard deduction.       For the purpose of judging regional
effects of tax policy, however,            it is   necessary to be more
precise in identifying how largea part income differences
play in determining average subsidy rates.                    To this end, we

decompose state u1s average subsidy rate using the
following identity:


              dj    Sik


        =     dik (sik T    k)    +
                                          Sk   (d   -
                                                        dk)    +

(4)


where k is the index for income classes.5                 For unweighted

subsidy rates,      dik is the proportion of state i1s
taxpayers in income
class k and    dk is the proportion of all taxpayers in
income class k and dk      is   the proportion of all taxpayers in

income class   k.    For subsidy rates weighted by income, dik
and dk are the proportion of total income received by

taxpayers in class k in the state and nation.  The subsidy

                                          10
rates Sik and        are defined analogously to             s.   The third

term on the right-hand side of           (4) is     a baseline subsidy

rate calculated using national mean values by income class

and the national income distribution. The second term on
the right reflects the effect of the state's income
distribution. Taxpayers in income classes with low average

subsidy rates make up a more important component of the
whole in poorer states as compared to affluent states.                    The

first term captures the effect of divergencies of state

subsidy rate from average national subsidy rate at each
income level.
       It is useful to make a further decomposition in this

first term.       Two effects are at work in causing state

subsidy rates at     a    given income level        (k)     to vary from

the norm       different frequencies of itemization and
            (sk):

different federal marginal tax rates. Since Sik =       mk,        'ik
                                                                          -

these two terms, the itemization effect is likely to have

the greater.influence, for the same reason that           a

itemtzation effect will usually dominate the countervailing
marginal rate effect, as in (3).          .

        summarize, we can d0mp05e a state's average
subsidy rate into four components:                              .    -

                                       12
     Table     2 gives    the values of these components for the
50 states and Washington,           D.C. in 1983.            Because the focus
of our study        is on federal    subsidy rates, the rates in
Table   2   are calculated using federal taxes only.                    The rates

are weighted by income in order to suggest the potential

importance of the subsidy for dollars of contributions.
The average federal tax subsidy rate in 1983 was .1855,

compared to an unweighted average of .0895.                      Adding this
base rate to columns        (e),    (f)   and   (c)    for any state yields

the subsidy rate given in the first column.
     The effect of income           is shown in        column    (C).

Jurisdictions with        the highest average income, such as

Alaska,     Connecticut and Washington,              D.C.,     have positive

entries,     reflecting higher federal marginal tax rates and
thus higher average subsidy rates.                   The correlation between

per capita income and the income distribution effects shown
in column     (c)    is 0.88.   It is evident from scanning Table                2


that this component is responsible for a sizable proportion
of the total variation in average subsidy rates.                        The range

of the income distribution effect               is    the largest of the

component,     0.0997.     Its importance can also be illustrated




                                           13
by comparing the     standard deviation of average subsidy

rates with and without this component: with, it is .027,
and without, it drops to .019, a reduction of 30 percent.
       Of the remaining components, tax rates have much less

impact on total subsidy rates, with a range of only 0.0289.
By contrast, itemization is relatively important, with a

range of 0.0724.
       It is useful to illustrate this decomposition for

specific states to get an idea of the relative importance
of each component.     Table   3   focuses on Michigan and Maine,

states whose average subsidy rates differ widely, by about
.09.    Of this difference,    the disparity in income
distributions accounts for almost half and the itemization
effect for slightly more than half.           Differences in the

tendency of taxpayers to itemize their deductions therefore
is more important in explaining the difference in subsidy

rates than is the disparity in incomes between the states.

Income is important, but it is by no means the whole reason

why average subsidy rates vary.            If Maine and Michigan had

identical income distributions equal to the national

distributions, their subsidy rates would be closer, .16




                                      14
versus .21 (line   7),   but would still differ by      .05.



The Role of the State and Local Tax Deduction
     As the previous section makes clear, the itemization

effect exerts a significant effect on subsidy rate

dispersions.   The amount of itemized deductions, holding
income level constant, evidently differs markedly among
states.   One important deduction that varies by region is
the state and local tax deduction.           Taxpayers in states
with heavy tax burdens are more likely to itemize, other

things equal, than taxpayers in low—tax states.              Column   (a)

in Table 2 shows that if there had been no state and local

tax deduction in 1983 the average subsidy rate for
contributions would have been     .07 lower      in such high—tax

states as New York and Michigan but less than          .02    lower in

relatively low-tax states like Florida and Texas (the
latter relying on the non-deductible severance tax>.              For

the pair of states shown in Table       3,    the state and local
tax deduction by itself had the effect of increasing the

disparity in subsidy rates by about 0.02 (line 8).              If this

effect were removed along with the iocome effect, the




                                   15
remaining difference in subsidy rates between                   Maine and

Michigan —— due largely           to differences      in other itemized

deductions ——     would be only          .03,   a reduction from the

actual subsidy rate differential of two-thirds and                  a

reduction from the income-adjusted differential of almost
half.

        Table   4 shows   similar calculations of the effects of
income and the state and local tax deductions for the high-
and low—rate jurisdictions from Table                1.   Again, income

distributions explain only           a    portion of subsidy rate

disparities. For all states taken together, removing the
income effect reduces the standard deviation in subsidy
rates from .027 to        .019,    as noted above.         When the effect

of the state and local tax deduction is removed, the
standard deviation falls to .017.


Implications
        It comes as no surprise that subsidy rates for

charitable giving differ among individuals or that average

subsidy rates differ across states.                 Such differences are    a

direct consequence of using a deduction as                 a   tax incentive




                                            16
within a progressive tax structure.           As noted above, the

Hupside_downTv nature of the charitable tax subsidy is
understood and, to    a   large extent, accepted.      It is

surprising,    however, that a significant portion of the

variation in subsidy rates is not explained by income.          It

appears, rather,    that the likelihood of becoming an
itemizer varies independently of income, causing taxpayers

in high-itemization states to be subsidized at high rates

than other taxpayers.       In particular,     taxpayers in high-tax
states tend to receiving higher federal matching rates for
their contributions than taxpayers living in low-tax
states.    This regional pattern of subsidy rates is
difficult to justify on the basis of conventional concepts
from welfare economics.
        To what extent these disparities affect the regional

pattern of giving depends on the price-sensitivity of
charitable giving and the degree to which contributions
tend to be directed to local or regional institutions.           As

an illustration,    suppose the price elasticity of giving is
—1.3.     Eliminating the deductions for state and local taxes
alone would reduce the difference        in   subsidy rates between




                                    17
Maine and Michigan by   .02,   which would increase the

relative size of Maine's giving by       4   percent compared to
Michigan's.   By contrast,     substituting for the deduction      a

tax credit equal to the average subsidy rate of .1855 would
increase Maine's giving relative to Michigan's by 16
        6
percent.
     If most contributions end up in the donor's home

region, which seems likely, such simulations suggest that

the current deduction's system does have a built—in

regional bias.   The size of the bias seems small when

considering a marginal change such as eliminating the
apparently unrelated deductibility of state and local
taxes, but it appears quite significant when considering
the deduction itself as the form of the charitable
incentive.

2     Break and Pechman (1975, p. 27), for example, accept

this effect, but only if    a   deduction can be justified as

"an appropriate refinement of income in judging relative

tax liabilities."


     When calculating the subsidy rate for any given




                                   19
expenditure item, it           is   the usual practice in empirical

work to take all other expenditures as given but perform
calculations on the first dollar of expenditures on the

item in question so that the subsidy rate will not depend
on the amount of that item.               This is the approach followed

in the present paper.

    The income classes used in the paper break at $2000
intervals from $2000 to $20,000,then at $25,000, $30,000,

$50,000, $100,000 and $200,000.

      (C2/G2)/(Gi)/Gi)
