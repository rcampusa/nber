                                          ABSTRACT

Understanding whether labor market discrimination explains inferior labor market outcomes for
many groups has drawn the attention of labor economists for decades – at least since the
publication of Gary Becker’s The Economics of Discrimination in 1957. The decades of research
on discrimination in labor markets began with a regression-based “decomposition” approach,
asking whether raw wage or earnings differences between groups – which might constitute prima
facie evidence of discrimination – were in fact attributable to other productivity-related factors.
Subsequent research – responding in large part to limitations of the regression-based approach –
moved on to other approaches, such as using firm-level data to estimate both marginal
productivity and wage differentials. In recent years, however, there has been substantial growth
in experimental research on labor market discrimination – although the earliest experiments were
done decades ago. Some experimental research on labor market discrimination takes place in the
lab. But far more of it is done in the field, which makes this particular area of experimental
research unique relative to the explosion of experimental economic research more generally.
This paper surveys the full range of experimental literature on labor market discrimination, places
it in the context of the broader research literature on labor market discrimination, discusses the
experimental literature from many different perspectives (empirical, theoretical, and policy), and
reviews both what this literature has taught us thus far, and what remains to be done.

        Understanding whether labor market discrimination explains inferior labor market outcomes for

many groups has drawn the attention of labor economists for decades – at least since the publication of

Gary Becker’s The Economics of Discrimination in 1957. The question is of obvious importance for public

policy, as the answer can help policymakers determine whether (and perhaps how much) to emphasize

efforts to combat discrimination in trying to bring about greater equality between racial and ethnic groups

and between men and women, and in trying to improve the circumstances of other groups that suffer

economic disadvantages, such as the disabled.

        The decades of research on discrimination in labor markets began with a regression-based

“decomposition” approach, asking whether raw wage or earnings differences between groups – which

might constitute prima facie evidence of discrimination – were in fact attributable to other productivity-

related factors. Subsequent research – responding in large part to limitations of the regression-based

approach – moved on to other approaches, such as using firm-level data to estimate both marginal

productivity and wage differentials.

        In recent years, however, there has been substantial growth in experimental research on labor

market discrimination – although the earliest experiments were done decades ago. The growth in the

experimental research on discrimination likely in part reflects the growth of experimental research in

economics generally. However, it is also a specific response to continuing challenges in drawing definitive

conclusions from non-experimental research about the role of labor market discrimination. Some

experimental research on labor market discrimination takes place in the lab. But far more of it is done in

the field, which makes this particular area of experimental research unique relative to the explosion of

experimental economic research more generally.

        My goal in this survey is to cover the full range of experimental literature on labor market

discrimination, to place it in the context of the broader research literature on labor market discrimination, to

discuss the experimental literature from many different perspectives (empirical, theoretical, and policy),

and to review what this literature has taught us thus far about the existence of discrimination, which groups



                                                       1
it affects, and many other questions – as well as what remains to be done. Moreover, one point of emphasis

is summarizing and evaluating the evidence from many recent experimental studies (and some earlier ones)

that try to determine the nature of discrimination – whether taste-based, statistical, or implicit. The

distinction is important for policy, and recent research has been creative in trying to augment experimental

studies with tests for the nature of discrimination. I suggest that the tests to this point are not very

convincing, but also discuss how the studies implementing them have pointed the way to how researchers

might more convincingly conduct such tests.

         There are points of overlap with other recent research reviews. Anderson et al. (2006) provide a

brief review of laboratory experiments on discrimination covering a small set of studies on race or

ethnicity, excluding studies that ask subjects to make decisions about fictitious workers. Pager (2007)

provides an overview of a small number of field experiments of race discrimination, focusing on

differences between the clear evidence of race discrimination from these studies and the suggestion from

some analyses of secondary data that race no longer matters much in labor markets. Riach and Rich (2002)

and Rich (2014) provide summaries of many field experiments on discrimination in labor markets; the

thoroughness of these reviews enables me to avoid a detailed cataloging of results from many studies, and

instead to discuss experimental research on labor market discrimination in the context of the broader

literature and debates about discrimination, to focus to some extent on methods, and to delve into what I

view as the most important issues that these studies confront or still have to confront.1 In addition, there

has been a large number of experimental studies done in the last year or two, which figure prominently in

some parts of this review. Clearly, these other reviews can be usefully read along with this survey to get an

even fuller overview and understanding of what economists have learned and still might learn from



1
  Two reviews published in this journal are further afield, yet related. Harrison and List (2004) provide a general
review of field experiments, focused largely on defining a typology of experiments, highlighting what they can teach
us in comparison to other kinds of studies, and illustrating the kinds of questions they can answer. There is little
overlap although one section of their paper has a few references to audit or correspondence studies of discrimination.
Lang and Lehmann (2012) provide what is largely a survey of theoretical models of race discrimination, with some
emphasis on drawing empirical implications. Again, the overlap is minor, although their discussion connects with the
material I discuss on distinguishing between taste and statistical discrimination. In addition, there is a brief discussion
of audit/correspondence studies that touches on some of the points I cover in detail.

                                 2. The Facts We Are Trying to Understand

        The raw data that motivate most of the research on discrimination are generally in the direction

consistent with discrimination – e.g., lower pay for groups thought to experience discrimination in the labor

market. But untangling whether discrimination in fact generates these differences is difficult – which

explains the explosion of experimental research on labor market discrimination. Here I briefly describe

many of the stylized facts that underlie the discrimination literature, drawing on other work. I defer until

Section 4 discussion of non-experimental work testing discriminatory versus non-discriminatory

explanations of these differences, except to touch on some simple partial correlations when available.

        The experimental research focuses on hiring, and thus might be thought of as most relevant for

understanding group differences in employment and unemployment. However, the segregation evidence

for women discussed below shows that hiring discrimination may also lead to lower earnings. Moreover,

models show that discrimination in hiring can lead directly to lower earnings for groups that experience this

discrimination.

2.1 Race, Ethnicity, and Sex

        In the United States, there has been a persistent raw difference between the earnings of black and

white men – a bit over 20 percent over the past decade, and a shade larger for full-time, year-round workers

(Lang and Lehmann, 2012). Some factors explain part of this gap; in particular, Neal and Johnson (1996)

showed that controlling for age and performance on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) diminishes

the race gap for young men substantially. But other factors cut in the other direction, such as schooling

(conditional on the AFQT, blacks get more schooling). Lang and Lehmann also note that earnings

differences between black and white women have historically been lower and sometimes even reversed.

Wages of Hispanics also lag substantially behind those of whites, with about 32 percent lower median

weekly earnings for full-time workers (Kochhar, 2008). The gap is about twice as big for foreign-born as

native-born Hispanics.

        Pay differences between men and women in the United States have fallen since the beginning of



                                                      3
the 1980s, but still persist, with the gap in annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers recently

narrowing to around 22 percent, and 18 percent for weekly earnings (Blau and Kahn, 2015). Some samples

now show women getting more education, but men have tended to study more lucrative fields. Lower work

experience of women also plays a role, but this difference has declined as well.

        Employment (and unemployment) gaps between blacks and whites are pronounced in U.S. data.

Lang and Lehmann (2012) report a difference in the labor force participation rate of black versus white

men aged 25-54 of 7.8 percentage points in 2008, and an unemployment rate difference of 4.6 percentage

points. The unemployment rate differential appears unrelated to education, and there is a large earnings

differential (which, in contrast to wages, also reflects hours and employment differences that persist when

controlling for AFQT scores (Johnson and Neal, 1998)). Hispanics have participation rates that slightly

exceed those of whites, but unemployment rates are nearly a third higher (Kochhar, 2008). Women

continue to have lower employment rates than men; their labor force participation rate in 2013 was lower

by 12.5 percentage points. However, their unemployment rates are slightly lower than men’s. 2

        There is similar prima facie evidence of discrimination in other countries, for groups that are the

focus of experimental work on discrimination. For example, there are lower employment rates for

indigenous people and immigrant groups in Australia, although these become smaller and insignificant with

controls for language proficiency and schooling (Booth et al., 2012), and many studies of Europe (some in

the references) document lower earnings and employment for minorities or immigrants.

        Discrimination in hiring may affect where a person works, with important implications for earnings

if women are hired into lower-paying occupations or firms (e.g., Groshen, 1991). 3 There is also substantial

workplace segregation by race and especially by Hispanic ethnicity in the United States (Hellerstein and

Neumark, 2008); this study finds that education explains very little of workplace segregation by race, but

that language skills explain about a third of Hispanic-white segregation. The racial segregation does not

help explain lower black wages, as blacks actually work in higher-paying establishments. However,

  Occupational segregation may be more reflective of choice than discrimination; but firm-level segregation is harder
to interpret as reflecting choice.

Hispanics tend to work in slightly lower-paying establishments.

2.2 Age

         Older workers generally earn more than younger workers. However, it has long been suggested

that older workers have greater difficulty finding new jobs. Older workers do have longer unemployment

durations than middle-aged workers in U.S. data, and prior to the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment

Act (ADEA) explicit age restrictions in hiring were common. 4 More recent evidence of such overt

discrimination is documented in China and Mexico by Kuhn and Shen (2013) and Hellester et al. (2014).

During and after the Great Recession unemployment durations rose particularly sharply for older workers,

as did ADEA claims filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) (Neumark

and Button, 2014).

2.3 Evidence on Other Groups Covered in the Experimental Literature

         A number of studies document labor market differences for other groups that have been the focus

of the experimental literature on discrimination. Researchers have documented earnings penalties for gay

men relative to straight men of about 8 percent (with demographic, occupational, and other controls), 5 but

earnings premia for lesbian women relative to straight women (see Burn, 2015). Many studies have

documented earnings penalties associated with lower physical attractiveness (Hamermesh, 2011). There is

also evidence of wage penalties for obesity, even in longitudinal data with individual or family fixed effects

(Baum and Ford, 2004; Lundborg et al, 2014). Wage penalties for obesity could also reflect factors similar

to “lookism” (Caliendo and Gehrsitz, 2014). Ameri et al. (2015) document that the employment rate for

the disabled is less than half that of the non-disabled (33 percent versus 74 percent in 2012), their

unemployment rate is about double (14.7 percent versus 7.2 percent in 2013), and they are paid less.

         Finlay (2007) discusses descriptive evidence related to a criminal background, which points to

lower wages and employment for those who have been incarcerated. However, the evidence is less clear


4
  For example, in five cities in states without anti-age discrimination statutes, nearly 60 percent of employers imposed
upper age limits (usually between ages 45 and 55) on new hires (U.S. Department of Labor, 1965).
5
  Since gays are identified for couples, based on living arrangement and relationship, the comparison is to married
straight men.




                                                           5
conditional on individual fixed effects, consistent with negative selection into incarceration and less

consistent with a causal effect. Pager (2003) also notes the strong and consistent negative relationships

between incarceration and labor market outcomes, and that it is difficult to establish causal relationships,

given the role of unobserved heterogeneity.

        For at least some of these categories of workers, the differences in earnings and other outcomes can

surely be less attributable to discrimination, for one of two reasons: the defining feature of the group may

not be completely exogenous; or the defining feature of the group may in fact be associated with lower

productivity. Of course, the discrimination literature more broadly considers the argument that differentials

associated with sex, race, or ethnicity may reflect productivity differences rather than discrimination.

There may be a difference, however, for groups for which a productivity difference is in a sense inherent in

the defining group characteristic, such as an employer concerned about liability for hiring a convicted

felon, hiring a disabled worker in a job in which the disability lowers productivity, or who regards an

employee’s looks as contributing to their productivity.

                              3. Explanations Based on Models of Discrimination

        In this section, I briefly discuss theoretical models of labor market discrimination. 6 The goal is to

focus on what these models predict about possible findings from experimental studies – i.e., their

observable implications – and what the models imply for how to interpret the experimental evidence.

3.1 Taste Discrimination

        Becker (1957) considered three models that were distinct, but unified in focusing on the market

implications of discriminatory tastes of three different types of agents – employers, employees, or

customers. The model of employer discrimination is the one through which the majority of empirical work

on discrimination has been interpreted.

3.1.1 Employer Discrimination




6
  Arrow (1998) provides a relatively recent overview of the main theoretical models of labor market discrimination,
including the potential limitations of these models.




                                                          6
         In the employer discrimination model, employers dislike hiring a particular group, such as blacks. 7

When a black is hired, an employer considers the cost to be both the wage and the disutility from hiring the

worker. Thus, we think of employers as utility maximizers, with utility function

         U = U (π , B ) = π − d ⋅ B ,                                                               (3.1)

where π is profits, B is the number of black workers, and d is a constant > 0, reflecting discriminatory tastes

against blacks (a simple form of discriminatory tastes). Assume the production function is

         y = f (W + B ) ,                                                                           (3.2)

a particularly simple form in which there are no inputs except labor, and W (whites) and B are perfect

substitutes. The perfect substitutes assumption coupled with equal coefficients makes the meaning of

discrimination clear, as white and blacks are interchangeable in production. 8 We also assume that labor

supply is perfectly inelastic, so wages are determined solely by the demand side. Normalizing the price of

output to one, and letting wi denote the wage of group i (i = W, B), the first-order conditions are

         MPL = wW , MPL = wB + d                                                                    (3.3)

         Since d is positive, these imply wB < wW, and in particular

         wW = wB + d .                                                                              (3.4)

         What does this imply about employment – and in particular hiring, which is the focus of

experimental research on labor market discrimination? If d is the same for all employers, then when wW =

wB + d employers are indifferent between hiring white and black workers, so we expect most employers to

hire both. In contrast, if wW ≠ wB + d, employers will only want to hire one race or the other (e.g., only


7
  I use blacks and whites here to stand in for any two groups, the first of which might be disfavored. I change the
reference to other groups when issues specific to those groups (e.g., men versus women or young versus old) arise.
8
  This theoretical specification of discrimination is very close to one legal definition of discrimination in the United
States. In particular, the Code of Federal Regulations (29, § 1604.2) defines as illegal discrimination “The refusal to
hire an individual because of the preferences of coworkers, the employer, clients or customers …” However, note that
statistical discrimination (discussed in the next section) is also illegal. The same regulations state: “The principle of
nondiscrimination requires that individuals be considered on the basis of individual capacities and not on the basis of
any characteristics generally attributed to the group.” In an even more explicit reference to statistical discrimination
as economists understand it, the same regulations note the following as illegal (i.e., not justifying a “bona fide
occupational qualification” defense): “[t]he refusal to hire a woman because of her sex based on assumptions of the
comparative employment characteristics of women in general. For example, the assumption that the turnover rate
among women is higher than among men.”




                                                           7
whites if wW < wB + d); as a consequence, wages will adjust in equilibrium to absorb both races, until wW =

wB + d. In this case, there is no reason for employers to discriminate against blacks in hiring, as the wage

differential just offsets the disutility from hiring. But if, as seems more likely, d varies across employers (dj

for employer j), an equilibrium wage differential should be established such that if dj > wW − wB the

employer hires only whites, and if dj < wW − wB, the employer hires only blacks. In this case, in an

experimental study we would expect some employers to prefer hiring whites if there is discrimination.

         However, things are a bit more complicated. In this formulation, employers with dj < wW − wB

should prefer hiring blacks, so even if there are discriminatory employers, the implication for an

experiment attempting to estimate a preference for black or white employees is unclear. If there is an equal

wage constraint or at least a constraint on relative black and white wages (perhaps because of minimum

wages), then it is more clear that we should, on net, find evidence of discrimination against blacks in

hiring. 9 Alternatively, given that most wage equation evidence points to lower wages for blacks with

similar observables to whites, we might presume that there must be a relative abundance of discriminatory

employers, since even for the relatively small number of blacks to be absorbed by the labor market the

inframarginal employer would appear to be discriminatory. 10

         A different question is whether a finding of hiring discrimination in the kind of field experiment

discussed below is actually informative about wage discrimination à la Becker. As Heckman (1998)

emphasizes, the Becker model explores the market-level consequences of the presence of some employers

with discriminatory tastes for equilibrium wage differences unrelated to productivity. But because wages

are set at the margin, the presence of some discriminatory employers that an experiment on hiring

discrimination might detect does not necessarily imply market-level discrimination in wages. In the



9
  Indeed, Neumark and Stock (2006) find robust evidence that sex discrimination/equal pay laws introduced in earlier
decades (at the state and federal level) reduced the relative employment of black women and white women.
10
   A second complication is that this formulation of the employer discrimination model implies near-perfect
employment segregation, with almost all firms hiring only one race or the other; but that is not generally observed.
However, if we instead assume that employers care about the relative number of black employees, rather than the
absolute number, then employers can alter the cost of hiring blacks by adjusting the ratio of blacks to whites, and for
any equilibrium wage ratio firms will be willing to hire some whites and some blacks (except for indivisibility
problems).




                                                           8
formulation above, if there are enough non-discriminatory employers relative to black workers that the

former can employ all of the latter, then d at the marginal employer will equal zero, and black and white

wages will be equal. 11 However, in search models with discrimination, the presence of any fraction of

discriminatory employers that do not hire blacks can shift the offer wage distribution in the market,

lowering equilibrium wages for blacks relative to whites (Black, 1995). 12 Moreover, if these experiments

are detecting statistical discrimination (discussed below), rather than taste discrimination, there is no reason

the discrimination would not be reflected in market wages. Finally, individual-level discrimination based

on characteristics of protected groups is illegal, so field experiments on hiring discrimination help us gauge

whether policy has succeeded in rooting out this discrimination, or whether there are other forms of

discrimination that policymakers might want to address.

        Another question is whether employer discrimination can persist in the long run, or is undermined

by discrimination. If discrimination cannot persist in competitive markets, and one believes markets are

sufficiently competitive, then it is natural to be skeptical of claims of discrimination based on experiments

– at least from field experiments in real markets. However, the claim that competition necessarily

eliminates discrimination is often overstated. Even Becker (1957) clarified conditions under which

employer discrimination could persist, and subsequent theoretical work further undermined the claim that

competition had to undermine employer discrimination (Goldberg, 1982).

3.1.2 Employee and Customer Discrimination

        In the customer discrimination model, customers require a lower price when buying from blacks,

because of the disutility cost of the transaction. Some of the experimental literature tests for customer

discrimination by asking whether hiring discrimination is more severe for jobs with customer contact.



11
   These conditions were elucidated in Becker (1957), and recently explored empirically by Charles and Guryan
(2008).
12
   The wage-posting model of Lang et al. (2005) has a similar result. In this model, even mild discriminatory
preferences lead to an equilibrium with hiring discrimination and a wage difference in the market. Moreover, simply
a belief among the minority group that firms discriminate – which can presumably be fueled by the experience of
hiring discrimination at some employers – leads to the discriminatory equilibrium. Moreover, in this model no firm
engages in wage discrimination à la Becker, paying a lower wage for a minority worker of equal productivity. Rather,
wage discrimination emerges only from hiring discrimination.




                                                         9
        In the employee discrimination model, whites require a higher wage to work alongside blacks.

This implies the following expressions for the profits of a firm in each of three scenarios: an all-white

workforce, an all-black workforce, and an integrated workforce. These are, respectively:

        π W = f (W ) − wW W
        π B = f ( B) − wB B                                                                 (3.5)
        π WB = f (W + B) − ( wW + d )W − wB B

        Here d is the wage premium that has to be paid to whites to work alongside blacks, and I use a

simple specification in which they require d if they work with any blacks. This model predicts completely

segregated workforces, with equal wages, and hence appears at first blush to be unable to explain the

stylized facts, and has unclear implications for hiring discrimination experiments.

        However, Arrow (1972) discusses extensions of the model that better fit the facts, and make it

more likely that we would find lower hiring of blacks in a field experiment. The employee discrimination

model implies, over some range, large quantity changes in response to small price changes. For example,

starting from equal wages for whites and blacks, a slight decrease in the relative price of black labor should

induce a firm with an all-white workforce to switch to an all-black workforce. This seems unlikely to

occur, however, because of adjustment costs, and Arrow shows that once we account for adjustment costs,

and presume that firms initially have predominantly-white or all-white workforces, it is easier to tell a story

in which there is incomplete segregation of workforces, and blacks earn lower wages and have worse job

opportunities. The same argument would apply to cases where we are considering discrimination against

women, immigrants, etc., who may have arrived to or entered the labor market later.

3.2 Statistical Discrimination

        In the simplest formulation of the statistical discrimination model (Aigner and Cain, 1977), whites

and blacks are assumed to be identical inputs on average, and there is individual-level variation in

productivity that is unobserved by employers. Let q denote a worker’s marginal productivity, with w(q) the

density of q for whites, and b(q) the density for blacks. Employers observe a noisy signal of q, y = q + u,

and employers know that E(u) = 0, Cov(q, u) = 0, E(q) = α, and Var(u) = σ2. Employers form E(q | y), and

pay wages based on this. If q and u are jointly normally distributed, then

                          Var (q ) + Var (u )    Var (q ) + Var (u )

        The second ratio is the “reliability” of the signal, denoted γ. Average black and white wages are

equal if αW = αB, so the statistical discrimination model does not generate the key stylized fact of

unexplained wage differences groups. However, the model can be extended to obtain this result.

        If γB < γW, it may be harder for employers to optimally match black workers to jobs, resulting in

lower productivity and wages ex post. Alternatively, the noisier signal for blacks may deter blacks from

investing in human capital, since their wages will be more tightly clustered around α, lowering E(q) and

therefore wages (Lundberg and Startz, 1983). Another possibility is that initially erroneous beliefs about

differences in α can become self-fulfilling (Coate and Loury, 1993). In the case of men and women, for

example, employers may initially assume that expected tenure is lower for women than for men, and

therefore choose to invest less in women’s human capital; this can give women less incentive to stay with

the firm, leading to employers’ expectations being fulfilled, and lower wages for women.

        The statistical discrimination model is not tied to prejudice. Rather, especially for versions of the

model that generate wage differences, it is best viewed as a model of stereotyping based on assumed group

averages. Thus, the model can be directly related to many lab experiments that attempt to measure

stereotyping. The model may not imply differences in hiring if wages are free to adjust to expected

productivity differences. If there are constraints on wage differences between groups, statistical

discrimination should generate hiring differences that work against groups with lower assumed average

productivity. In addition, if matching workers’ abilities to the job is important, a noisier signal can lead to

more adverse outcomes.

        The distinction between statistical discrimination and taste discrimination is important for policy.

In response to taste discrimination, the most natural policy response is to raise the cost to the employer of

engaging in discriminatory behavior, to, effectively, try to restore equal prices for equally productive labor

from different groups. In contrast, policy interventions that increase information or the reliability of




                                                               11
information about workers may reduce statistical discrimination.13,14 This is one reason experimental

research tries to distinguish between these two broad models of discrimination.

3.3 Long-Term Incentive (Lazear) Contracts

        Lazear’s (1979) model of long-term incentive contracts (LTICs) provides an explanation for

behavior that looks like age discrimination with regard to both terminations and hiring of older workers. In

this model, incentive-compatible contracts entail paying young, low-tenured workers less than their

marginal product, and older, high-tenured workers more than their marginal product. The model offers an

explanation of mandatory retirement, which is predicted to occur when the discounted stream of wage

payments catches up to the discounted stream of marginal productivity; mandatory retirement was viewed

as discrimination by the ADEA, which abolished it over time. LTICs may also deter hiring of older

workers, by imposing fixed costs that can be amortized only over a shorter period for older workers

(Hutchens, 1986); barriers to paying newly-hired older workers much lower wages than current older

workers to create the needed incentives can lead to the same result. Finally, LTICs can encourage

employers to renege on the implicit contract, terminating higher-tenure workers when their wages exceed

marginal product. Does the differential treatment of older workers predicted by this model represent

discrimination? Clearly statistical discrimination with regard to how long workers will stay with the firm

plays a role. Moreover, differential treatment based on the Lazear model has been interpreted as

discrimination from a legal perspective (Issacharoff and Harris, 1997).

3.4 Implicit Discrimination

        The final explanation of discrimination that is also tested in the experimental literature is “implicit

discrimination.” The basic idea is that discriminatory decisions – making decisions based on race, for

example, when race is not actually predictive of differences in productivity – are unconscious rather than

conscious. Devine (1989) provides an overview of social psychology research on the difference between

13
   As an example, Holzer and Neumark (2000) suggest that affirmative action may have precisely this effect,
encouraging more investment in scrutiny of minority workers both before and after hiring, and reduced reliance on the
most-readily available signals.
14
   One possible exception is that a less noisy signal, when there is a wage floor that limits paying wages as low as
some workers’ expected productivity, can lower hiring.




                                                         12
conscious efforts that may actively combat stereotypes that can lead to discriminatory behavior, and

unconscious actions or decisions in which these stereotypes operate even among decision makers who are

not prejudiced or who deliberately try to avoid stereotypes or prejudice. 15 Bertrand et al. (2005) describe

the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which claims to measure this kind of unconscious discrimination, and

argue that scores on the IAT predict other behaviors that may translate into discriminatory behavior.16

Some experimental research tries to assess whether implicit discrimination generates discriminatory hiring

differences.

         If implicit discrimination is important in hiring and other decisions, then standard policy responses

that operate on conscious behavior, such as reinforcing the illegality (and potential financial consequences)

of discrimination, may not be very effective. In contrast, unconscious biases may be more amenable to

policy interventions (including at the employer level) that reduce the role of unconscious decision-making

– such as formalizing evaluation procedures, or things as simple as allowing more time to evaluate each

candidate.

                4. Non-experimental Approaches to Testing Hypotheses about Discrimination

         Economists have used a number of non-experimental approaches to test for and estimate the extent

of labor market discrimination, and to try distinguish among the different models of discrimination. Here I

highlight key issues that arise in the non-experimental literature that help illuminate what experimental

methods can provide, and also touch on where non-experimental approaches offer advantages relative to

the experimental work.

4.1 Regression Decompositions

         The traditional approach to studying labor market discrimination focuses on the role of

discrimination in generating wage gaps between groups. The approach entails estimating wage regressions,

15
   Greenwald and Banaji (1995) provide a broader overview of the development of the idea of unconscious or implicit
cognition – including but not limited to stereotyping race and other groups; the paper also discusses a large body of
empirical work.
16
   The reader can take these tests at https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/education.html (viewed September 1, 2015).
For a skeptical discussion of the validity of the IAT as a predictor of discriminatory behavior (or as a better predictor
than explicit measures) – in many cases in laboratory studies – see Oswald et al. (2013). Steffens (2004) presents
evidence on ability to fake the IAT.




                                                           13
trying to control for productivity-related differences between two groups, and interpreting the remaining

wage gap between the groups as an estimate of discrimination, most commonly using separate regressions

to allow wage differences between groups to vary with other characteristics (e.g., Oaxaca, 1973; Neumark,

1988). The challenge that the regression decomposition approach addresses, of course, is that the groups in

question often have differences in numerous characteristics that could be related to productivity – such as

differences in labor market attachment between men and women, or in school quality between blacks and

whites – so that unadjusted differences in wages need not reflect discrimination. 17

         Although regression adjustments can in principle account for these differences, unexplained wage

gaps can always be attributed to unmeasured productivity-related characteristics for which the regression

fails to account, rather than discrimination. This points to the principal advantage of experimental

approaches, which instead create artificial pools of labor market participants among whom there are

supposed to be no average differences by group, so that observed outcomes are more convincingly

attributed to discrimination. A second potential problem with the regression decomposition approach is

that the regression controls can reflect responses to discrimination, such as lower experience and tenure of

women because of discrimination on the job (e.g., Gronau, 1988) – sometimes termed “feedback” effects –

which can lead to understating discrimination by conditioning on its effects. Some recent natural

experiment studies (in the context of sports) have led to interesting new evidence of feedback effects.

         A potential advantage of the regression decomposition approach is that is speaks directly to wage

differences between groups. In contrast, experimental studies focus mainly on hiring, which (as discussed

above) may or may not have implications for wages depending on the underlying model, the size of the

minority group, and the share and distribution of discriminatory tastes. Experimental studies have for the

most part not provided direct evidence on the effects of discrimination on wages.

4.2 Production Function Tests

         More recently, labor economists have estimated productivity differences directly, and compared


17
  Darity and Mason (1998) provide an interesting overview of relatively recent literature using this approach,
especially with regard to race and the incorporation of test scores into such regressions.




                                                          14
these differences to wage differences. Hellerstein and Neumark (1999) developed a method of using

matched employer-employee data to do this. In an application using U.S. data, Hellerstein et al. (1999)

jointly estimate plant-level production functions and wage equations, and find a sex gap in wages that

significantly exceeds the sex gap in marginal productivity, consistent with sex discrimination. This

structural approach to estimating wage discrimination has now been used in a number of countries where

matched data have become available (Bartolucci, 2014a).

        The production function approach has the advantage, relative to the regression decomposition

approach, of direct measurement of worker productivity (although since productivity is measured at the

plant level, group differences are identified from across-plant variation in productivity and the share of

workers in different groups). In that sense, the production function approach quite clearly provides more

compelling evidence on wage discrimination. On the other hand, it is difficult to fully rule out a potential

role for sorting of workers across plants (although enhancements to the approach by Bartolucci (2014b) try

to do this). The experimental methods discussed below generally avoid this sorting problem, since

identical applicants are evaluated by potential employers (or proxies for them in the lab). Yet, again, the

experimental approach is generally focused on hiring, not wages.

4.3 Tests of Statistical Discrimination

        A few non-experimental studies test for statistical discrimination, and sometimes try to distinguish

between statistical and taste discrimination. These studies illustrate some of the same difficulties I

emphasize below with regard to experimental studies that try to distinguish between taste and statistical

discrimination. In particular, distinguishing between these models in non-experimental studies requires

strong informational assumptions regarding what is observed by firms but potentially correlated with

unobserved productivity, and how the information available to firms changes over time.

        The tight relationship between tests for statistical discrimination and what employers know about

workers, and when they know it, was first made explicit in Altonji and Pierret’s (2001) research on the

evolution of black and white wages as workers gain experience, to test for statistical discrimination based

on race. It is perhaps demonstrated most clearly in Foster and Rosenzweig (1993), who study data from the



                                                      15
Philippines that include demographic characteristics and wages paid for time-rate and piece-rate work.

Given that piece-rate work should capture differences in productivity, we might test for taste discrimination

against women by regressing time-rates (w) on a piece-rate measure of productivity (μ), and a dummy

variable for women (F):

        w = α + βμ + γF + ε .                                                                     (4.1)

        Indeed, Foster and Rosenzweig’s data show that w is lower for women (𝛾� < 0), conditional on μ.

However, if employers do not know individual-level productivity when they set time rates, but just that μ is

lower on average for women than for men, then the estimated coefficient on μ is biased towards zero, and

the average difference can load onto the female dummy variable, making statistical discrimination look like

taste discrimination. If we could measure expected productivity, E(μ), and there is no taste discrimination

but only statistical discrimination, the coefficient on E(μ) should equal one, and the coefficient on F should

equal zero. But if we still find a negative coefficient on F, conditional on E(μ), this would point to taste

discrimination.

        Since there is no proxy for E(μ), Foster and Rosenzweig instrument for μ, assuming that μ is the

sum of E(μ) and a random forecast error. Valid instruments are variables that employers use in forecasting

μ, but that do not affect wages directly – precluding, for example, taste discrimination based on these

variables. As instruments, the authors use height, age, and education. The resulting instrumental variables

estimates do not show any evidence of lower wages paid to women conditional on E(μ), consistent with all

of the initial difference in the OLS estimates being attributable to statistical discrimination. Note that this

approach hinges critically on assumptions about what employers know, and when they know it – in

particular, that employers do not know productivity μ when they set time rates, but that they observe other

characteristics that predict productivity. 18


18
   One way to mitigate the strong reliance on such assumptions is to use exogenous variation in how much employers
know about workers. As one example, Finlay (2007) studies statistical discrimination in hiring from groups more
likely to have a criminal background, estimating how the advent of criminal background checks may have enabled
employers to better distinguish among individual blacks, reducing statistical discrimination against blacks without a
criminal record. A similar approach is used – in reverse – by Agan and Starr (2016), who study the impact of recent
initiatives to ban employers from using very early elicitation of criminal background information in recruitment.




                                                         16
         There are some direct parallels to experimental studies, which try to test for statistical versus taste

discrimination by adding information that employers might use to predict differences between worker

productivity and seeing whether this changes outcomes. However, the challenge regarding who knows

what about unobserved productivity, and when, carries over to this experimental research, although as I

discuss below, the problem has not been recognized as explicitly. On the other hand, I suggest that it may

be possible to augment experimental studies with survey or other evidence that can help answer these

questions about what information employers have, and when they have it, and, hence, perhaps lead to more

definitive tests.

                                          5. Laboratory Experiments

       Lab experiments have been used to test for discriminatory decision making, to try to understand the

nature of discrimination, and to study behaviors that can lead to discriminatory outcomes. There is a

broader research literature on laboratory experiments that explores alternative, non-discriminatory

explanations of group differences in outcomes, like recent work on gender and competitiveness (e.g.,

Gneezy et al., 2003). There is also an extensive psychology literature measuring stereotypes about

different groups (e.g., Kite et al., 2005). And there are lab experiments on discrimination in settings other

than labor markets (like the public goods experiment in Andreoni and Petrie, 2008).

       I restrict attention to research that focuses on discrimination, especially research using laboratory

settings meant to mimic potential labor market discrimination. Thus, I exclude research on gender and

competitiveness, the role of race, etc., in other outcomes (like public goods experiments), and the general

literature on gender and bargaining except where it tries to address labor market outcomes directly. And I

cover research on stereotypes only to the extent that this research ties the stereotypes participants hold to

actions that could plausibly be tied to labor market outcomes. My goal is not cover every study, but to

illustrate the kinds of studies that have been done, to discuss the issues that arise, and to identify important

questions. And where survey articles are available I reference and discuss them, rather than going back to




                                                       17
the individual studies, and offer my perspectives on the larger literature they cover. 19 Most of the studies I

discuss are summarized in Table 1.

       There are standard objections regarding laboratory versus field experiments, mostly having to do

with external validity and with capturing realistic stakes for participants. 20 The latter issue may arise in a

particularly complex way in research on discrimination, because the market-level effects of competition

may be the driving force that imposes costs for engaging in discriminatory behavior, implying that it may

be hard to mimic the costs of discrimination in the laboratory. In fact, though, a good deal of the existing

laboratory experiment research does even less to incentivize behavior, imposing no actual costs on

participants to make discriminatory choices in selection of employees in hypothetical scenarios. Such

considerations might increase the evidence of discrimination in the laboratory. On the other hand, it is

possible that respondents in the lab are more prone to make socially desirable choices that could mask

discrimination (Norton et al., 2004, 2006). 21 The absence of cost-related incentives may be especially

problematic with respect to statistical discrimination, which can be profit maximizing for real-world

employers and hence detected in field experiments, but may be masked in lab experiments where social

desirability is influential and there are no costs to foregoing statistical discrimination.

5.1 Simulated Personnel Decisions (Vignette Studies)

         Vignette studies examine discrimination in the laboratory by trying to simulate personnel decisions

made by employers or managers. Researchers present participants with hypothetical scenarios regarding

selection of job candidates for hiring, or of employees for training, promotion, etc., and often subsequently

elicit attitudes towards these workers or other supplemental information that might help explain

participants’ decisions. As in the field experiments discussed below, protected-group status (age, sex, etc.)

is manipulated in these studies for otherwise identical job candidates, which is what makes vignette studies


19
   The same applies to Section 6, below, on field experiments.
20
   On the second issue, see, e.g., Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) and Flory et al. (forthcoming).
21
   Mujcic and Frijters (2013) present interesting evidence of this in a different context. In their experiment (in
Australia), black, white, Asian, and Indian testers try to get free rides on buses (claiming their bus pass was faulty,
which it was). Blacks and Indians were granted free rides at a far lower rate. But in a survey of bus drivers presented
with such a scenario, the black and Indian differences were actually reversed slightly.




                                                          18
experiments.

         It is easy to criticize vignette studies for dealing in hypotheticals. However, for personnel

decisions regarding existing workers (rather than new hires), it is difficult to conceive of a corresponding

field experiment, such as selecting otherwise identical employees for training or promotion decisions. The

only exception would be, perhaps, an experiment run internally at a company that was sufficiently large to

be able to present fictitious workers to other managers. 22 The closest laboratory experiments have gotten to

more real-world decisions is to administer vignette studies to managers likely to be actively involved in

making similar decisions – for example, administering the experiment to managers participating in a

training program. To a large extent, vignette studies simply test for discrimination in decision making,

without attempting to determine the nature of discrimination. However, some of the studies present

evidence that could be viewed as testing statistical versus taste discrimination.

         There are scores of vignette studies in the literature. Here I touch on some that are cited frequently

and that appear to be most closely related to hypotheses that arise in the economics of discrimination. 23

5.1.1 Sex

         An early vignette study (called, at the time, an “in-basket exercise”) was administered to male bank

managers participating in a management training program (Rosen and Jerdee, 1974). The managers were

given hypothetical scenarios requiring selecting bank employees for promotion or development, and the

solution of a supervisory problem based on the report of a supervisor whose sex was manipulated. The

study found significantly lower willingness to promote females, whether into complex or simple jobs, and

significantly lower selection of females for development (attending a professional training conference). In

supervisory problems, a lengthy report from a supervisor described a problem and requested that the

employee be terminated or at least transferred; the choices of participants ranged from terminating the


22
   Baert et al. (forthcoming) try to study promotions in the context of a correspondence study field experiment, but this
entails hiring at new employers into jobs at a higher level than the present one, which is different from internal
promotions.
23
   As counter-examples, Singer and Sewell (1989) discuss many studies regarding selection decisions based on age.
However, many of these studies pertain to cognitive issues (the impact of other information calling attention to age) or
sociological issues (the role of differences in the status of jobs considered).




                                                           19
employee, to arranging a transfer or “softer” solutions. Termination was more likely to be recommended

when the supervisor was male and the workplace issue concerned performance (with the evidence less clear

when the issue was personality). All of this evidence is consistent with sex discrimination in decisions

related to key labor market outcomes. The authors interpret the evidence as confirming the importance of

sex stereotypes in this discrimination, but the basis for this conclusion is not clear.

        Researchers have considered the external validity of these vignette studies, albeit in the limited

sense of asking whether outcomes using professionals instead of students as subjects yield different results.

In an early meta-analysis, Olian et al. (1988) found a similar (negative) effect size of female for studies

using the two kinds of subjects, although for some reason a higher variance of effect sizes for professionals.

This may partially mitigate concerns that outcomes for student subjects are not reflective of real-world

decision making, although what professionals do in the lab versus the real world remains an open question.

        The studies reviewed in this section are dated, and vignette studies of sex discrimination appear to

be less common in more recent literature. However, more recent experimental research has explored

questions that intersect with gender. For example, Correll et al. (2007) conduct a laboratory experiment

and a field experiment (discussed below) of the motherhood penalty, motivated by evidence suggesting that

much of the unexplained contemporaneous sex gap in in wages is attributable to motherhood. In the lab

experiment, undergraduate subjects evaluate same-sex pairs of married applicants who differ in whether

they are parents. For the female pairs, ratings of competence and commitment are significantly lower for

mothers, as are recommendations for hiring (47 percent versus 84 percent, significant at the 5-percent level)

and recommended salaries. For the male pairs, the recommended hiring rate is a bit higher for fathers (73

versus 62 percent, significant at the 10-percent level), as is recommended salary. The difference in

evaluations of competence and commitment account for about 40 percent of the hiring differential within

female pairs. Finally, there was no evidence of lower ratings or selection for hiring between non-parent

men and women (based on between-pair comparisons).

5.1.2 Ethnicity

        More recently, vignette studies have been applied to ethnic discrimination, coupled with additional



                                                       20
evidence on potential determinants or at least correlates of discrimination. Blommaert et al. (2014) present

student participants in the Netherlands with resumes signaling Moroccan, Turkish, or Dutch ethnicity via

name and parents’ country of birth (all applicants were born in the Netherlands), as well as sex, education,

and experience. Participants rated applicants (from zero to 10) on suitability for the job, and selected three

they would invite for an interview. Minority applicants received lower suitability ratings, although the

effect was very small (0.05 of the zero-to-10 ranking, yet still statistically significant). For selection for

interview, the odds ratio for selecting native Dutch applicants was 1.14, marginally significantly different

from one.

        Participants were surveyed on personal and background characteristics. Indeed, the authors argue

that the ability to interview or survey experiment participants is an advantage of laboratory versus field

experiments of discrimination – although below I will discuss field experiments that try to collect

information from recruiters. Blommaert et al. find less discriminatory behavior in selection for interviews

by those who report more positive inter-ethnic contacts (higher quality, not higher frequency), as well as

those with higher education. The first result might provide some support for a taste-based understanding of

ethnic discrimination in this experiment, although there is no way to know whether positive inter-ethnic

contacts reduce discriminatory tastes, or are simply correlated with weaker discriminatory tastes.

5.1.3 Age

        Rosen and Jerdee (1977) conducted a vignette study of age discrimination similar to their earlier

sex discrimination study, based on a survey administered to Harvard Business Review subscribers. They

provided hypothetical scenarios and asked subscribers how they would respond to managerial complaints

about workers, decisions about career development, and promotions. Age of the worker in question was

manipulated (32 or 61). In response to complaints about a worker, respondents indicated greater difficulty

in changing the behavior of older workers, and were more likely to recommend that the work be reassigned

from an older worker than from a younger worker, and conversely more likely to recommend addressing

the issue via an encouraging talk for younger workers. In response to a request for a career development

opportunity regarding production technology, older workers were viewed as less likely to want to keep up



                                                       21
with technology, and the decision was more likely to be approved for a younger worker. And in response

to promotion to a position requiring creativity and innovation, older workers were viewed as less likely to

succeed, and were less likely to be recommended for promotion. Similar results are reported in Rosen and

Jerdee (1976), using as subjects, instead, undergraduate business students.

         However, 28 years later, a replication of the latter study by Weiss and Maurer (2004) found

relatively little evidence of negative stereotypes or adverse hypothetical decisions for older workers. This

could be attributable to more older workers in the workforce, and changes in attitudes and behaviors over

three decades. It would preferable to know about changed attitudes and behavior among subjects like

subscribers to the Harvard Business Review (as in Rosen and Jerdee, 1977). Although these papers provide

suggestive evidence that age-related stereotypes are likely to affect managerial decisions, the analyses do

not tie individual responses regarding stereotypes to the recommendations of those respondents. 24

         Büsch et al. (2009) carry out a similar type of study for white-collar jobs that are not physically

demanding, using as participants both students asked to assume they were assistants of a personnel

manager, and actual personnel managers contact by mailing questionnaires (with low response rates). The

authors did the study in both Norway and Germany, hypothesizing that age discrimination would be worse

in Germany in part because of lower participation of older workers in the labor market. Artificial

applicants were ranked on 12 capabilities. I focus on the personnel manager responses, which are likely

more informative about actual labor market behavior. The Norwegian managers did not rate older workers

lower on any capabilities (point estimates were similar for young, middle-aged, and older applicants),

whereas in Germany older workers were ranked lower (than middle-aged or younger workers) on capability

to learn and on flexibility. This was reflected in the hypothetical hiring decisions as well, as the selection

rate declined significantly with age in Germany. 25


24
   Krings et al. (2011) study selection by age and stereotypes regarding age and “warmth” and competence (older
workers are rated higher on the former, and lower on the latter). The authors found lower selection of older workers,
and that this bias was mediated by age-related stereotypes regarding competence.
25
   An interesting twist was that the respondents were also asked to indicate an appropriate wage range for the
candidate. Conditioning on these wage ranges increased the evidence of discrimination in selection against older
workers.




                                                          22
5.1.4 Looks and Obesity

        Hosoda et al. (2003) provide a meta-analysis of laboratory studies of discrimination based on looks

or “attractiveness” and selection for promotion, performance evaluation, hiring, and other outcomes.

Attractiveness is typically manipulated by including a picture, although there are differences, such as

having subjects rate mock videotaped job interviews (Riggio and Throckmorton, 2006). Hosoda et al.

conclude that “Physical attractiveness is always an asset for individuals” (p. 451). The effect size is large

(although a bit hard to interpret), and the effect does not appear to vary with the sex of the applicant, the

sex type of the job, the provision of job-relevant information, or whether subjects were students or

professionals. However, the effect size declines over time (across studies), and is largest for choice of a

business partner and smallest for performance evaluation.

        Rudolph et al. (2009) provide a similar type of meta-analysis of studies of discrimination against

obese job applicants. The authors note obesity can be associated with unattractiveness, moral or emotional

impairment, unhappiness, higher absenteeism, and lower acceptance by co-workers, emphasizing the issue

of whether studies capture differences in discrimination or productivity. The manipulation of weight is

sometimes done using computer morphing programs (Polinko and Popovich, 2001) or theatrical prostheses

(Pingitore et al., 1994) to make the same “applicant” appear as both average weight and obese. The

evidence from this meta-analysis points to adverse effects for evaluation and selection for hiring.

5.2 Statistical versus Taste Discrimination

        Some laboratory studies try to estimate whether providing additional information about applicants

reduces differences in selection between groups. Such evidence might be interpreted as testing between

statistical and taste discrimination, although this interpretation is made more explicit in field experiments

taking this approach, and hence gets more attention when I discuss field experiments.

        Heilman (1984) documents inconsistent findings in past vignette studies regarding whether

providing additional information about individual applicants reduces adverse outcomes (in selection) for

women. Heilman suggests that the discrepancies can arise because sex is a salient characteristic for




                                                       23
evaluators, so that additional job relevant information will reduce the role of sex, but information not

relevant to the job can worsen outcomes for women by increasing the salience of sex. This is tested in an

experiment on selection of a recent college graduate for a managerial position. The “job-relevant”

information treatment is success in courses in economics and business. The “low-relevance” treatment is

biology and political science. (In the third treatment, neither type of information is given.) The results are

consistent with her conjectures. In particular, only the provision of job-relevant information eliminates the

lower selection of women, potentially consistent with statistical discrimination.

        The role of job-relevant information in reducing group differences is considered in three meta-

analyses. Tosi and Einbender (1985) report that, across studies, sex differences in selection and other

outcomes are smaller when subjects are given more information about applicants. Davison and Burke

(2000) focus on ratings of both sexes for “opposite-sex” jobs and similarly report that lower ratings for

opposite-sex jobs are diminished when more information is provided. The evidence that information

affects ratings of both males and females in this way suggests that the findings may reflect the reduced

salience of sex rather than statistical discrimination per se (which we might expect to disadvantage

women). In contrast, the Hosoda et al. (2003) study also reports across-study results, finding that providing

more job-relevant results about applicants does not influence group differences in outcomes based on

attractiveness.

        Three points can be made about these studies. First, we might expect less statistical discrimination

based on looks, since it not clear what unobserved productivity differences employers might associate with

attractiveness. Second, it is hard to know how to interpret evidence that more information fails to reduces

group discrimination (as in Hosoda et al., but more generally), since we do not know whether the

information provided pertains to qualifications about which employers make assumptions based on group

averages when discriminating statistically; this is a general problem with testing taste versus statistical

discrimination to which I return below. Finally, it is clearly more desirable to study variation within than

across studies, to isolate the effects of the provision of information.

        A related problem of thinking about the role of information in interpreting studies like these arises



                                                       24
in Baert and De Pauw (2014), who conduct a laboratory experiment on discrimination in Belgium against

applicants with Turkish (versus Flemish) names, using students as subjects. They find that respondents

were likely to rate minority applicants as having the required productivity for the job (indeed, more likely

than non-minorities), although respondents rate the minority group population overall as less qualified.

The authors interpret this as inconsistent with statistical discrimination, because the overall lower group

average for the minority group is not reflected in evaluation of the candidates. However, the experimental

design presents native and minority candidates with identical resumes, so subjects may have enough

information that they do not impute the group level averages to the applicants they assess. That is, thinking

back to the Aigner and Cain (1977) framework, we have no way of knowing whether subjects perceived the

signals of applicant quality as sufficiently noisy that they would put a lot of weight on group averages of

the applicant populations. Absent this information, it is hard to see how the evidence can be informative

about statistical discrimination. 26

         In my view, however, the external validity problem is particularly severe with regard to these kinds

of tests for statistical discrimination. To infer something about real-world statistical discrimination from

whether providing additional information on hypothetical applicants affects group differences in selection

requires assuming that the laboratory conditions regarding information actually mimic real-world hiring. In

the case of Heilman’s analysis, for example, it seems unlikely that employers would not know field of study

to begin with, so the experimental treatment of no information about coursework and how the outcome

changes when this information is provided may not provide evidence on how employers’ actual decisions

are changed by the provision of information that might reduce sex stereotypes.

         In contrast, Mobius and Rosenblat (2006) conduct an experimental study of the “beauty premium”

that more successfully distinguishes between taste discrimination and statistical discrimination. The

experiment involves solving mazes, for which there is no difference in ability based on looks. “Workers”

have to estimate how many mazes they can solve, and “employers” have to estimate how many mazes

26
   Moreover, since the study’s results provide no evidence of (hypothetical) employer discrimination in the first place
(there is no difference in selection for hiring), it is hard to interpret this study as testing alternative explanations of
such discrimination.




                                                            25
workers can solve (both types are incentivized to estimate correctly). Each worker is matched with five

different employers, and the interaction is manipulated to include no visual or oral (by telephone)

information, one type information or the other, both types, or face-to-face interaction. Wages paid to

workers are based on some of the employer estimates, and come out of employers’ endowments. Payments

are arranged so that the employer first evaluates or interacts with the worker, and is then told which

estimates will contribute to a worker’s earnings. This provides evidence on taste discrimination, since an

employer might sacrifice earnings to pay a higher wage to an attractive worker.

           The authors decompose the beauty premium into a number of sources. They find that one

contributor is overconfidence of better-looking workers, and another is overestimation of ability of better-

looking workers by employers. The latter is a form of statistical discrimination, albeit based on incorrect

stereotypes because better-looking people are in fact no more productive in their setting. There is no

evidence of taste discrimination, although the authors caution that this kind of result may not carry over to

real-world labor markets, where the utility gain from interacting with a good-looking person over an

extended period may matter much more than in the lab – a question, again, of realistic stakes and external

validity.

5.3 Tests for Implicit Discrimination

           There has been little or no work trying to test whether implicit discrimination can account for

group differences in labor market related outcomes in laboratory experiments. 27 Rosen and Jerdee (1977)

found that although respondents exhibited age discrimination in decisions and held age stereotypes, a large

share favored policy reforms that would help older workers, such as complete vesting of pensions and the

elimination of mandatory retirement. They suggest that these two types of responses/behavior are

discrepant, and could imply that respondents in the role of managers do not consciously discriminate, but

respond to unconscious stereotypes – which sounds like an early appeal to implicit bias. However, this

inference may not be supported. First, only some respondents (60-80 percent) supported policies to help

older workers, and the others may have driven the age differences in personnel decisions and stereotypes.

27
     Dovidio et al. (2002) survey experimental psychology research on implicit discrimination.




                                                            26
Second, the responses concern policy reforms that are not closely related to the personnel decisions

respondents were asked to make.

         More recently, Reuben et al. (2014) conduct a laboratory experiment in which “employers” hire

“workers” to do a mathematical task. They find that participants in the role of employers are much more

likely to hire males than females when they have no information about the ability of the potential hires.

This pattern is reduced, but not eliminated, when information on prior performance on the mathematical

task is provided. Finally, the researchers also administer an IAT based on associating men or women with

words more related to math/science versus liberal arts, and find more bias and less updating based on

performance data for those who, according to the IAT, have stronger implicit biases.

5.4 Discrimination in Bargaining Experiments

         There is experimental research on sex differences in bargaining outcomes (e.g., Eckel, 2008;

Solnick, 2001), which of course could influence pay. Some of the work on bargaining also pertains to taste

versus statistical discrimination (Fershtman and Gneezy, 2001). Here, though, I restrict the discussion to a

bargaining experiment that more explicitly tries to capture features of labor markets. 28

         Dittrich et al. (2014) study multi-stage, alternative-offer bargaining, which they believe is more

likely to generalize to labor market outcomes than simple bargaining experiments, and they explore

differences depending on whether males and females are playing the role of employees or employers.

Their experiment is framed as a firm bargaining with a worker. The firm needs a task done, for which it

earns a fixed amount, and proposes a wage to the worker, the remainder from which is the firm’s earnings.

The worker has an outside option of zero, and the employer has a positive outside option that is less than its

total earnings if it reaches an agreement. An initial offer is made, alternatively by the employer or the



28
  There are also field experiments on bargaining, but perhaps not surprisingly given the needs of this research, these
experiments focus on consumer transactions. Examples include sex differences in bargaining over taxi fares in Peru
(Castillo et al., 2013), race, age, and sex differences in bargaining over sports cards (List, 2004), and sex and race
differences in bargaining over car prices (Ayres and Siegelman, 1995). These studies do not pertain to the labor
market, so I do not cover them. But it is interesting to note that they often point to statistical discrimination as the
source of differences in outcomes (e.g., assumptions about the valuation of a taxi ride in the Castillo et al. study).
Taste-based discrimination might be more important in labor markets because employment entails a long-term
relationship.




                                                           27
employee, and then there are rounds of counteroffers. After the third round, if there is no agreement

reached there is an exogenously imposed probability of the negotiations ending, in which case each gets

their outside option. Pairings can be either mixed- or same-gender, and those bargaining sit across from

each other but communicate only via a fixed script.

         There are two key findings. First, males acting as employees negotiate higher wages than females

(but as employers, there are not differences in outcomes). Second, male employers make higher initial

wage offers to male employees than female employees, whereas female employers do not behave in this

way. The authors interpret this finding as wage discrimination. Third, the differences emerge because of

differences in initial offers (of male employees generally, and male employers to male employees) rather

than subsequent bargaining, suggesting that sex differences in bargaining skills are not critical. 29

                                               6. Natural Experiments

         A handful of studies on discrimination in labor markets can be considered natural experiments. In

some, variation in the race of who evaluates “workers” is effectively random, giving us information on how

different workers are evaluated depending on the characteristics of the evaluator. And in one the evaluation

mechanism exogenously changed from evaluators knowing the sex of applicants to sex-blind evaluations,

which is informative about discrimination prior to the advent of sex-blind selection. 30

         By way of analogy, suppose that, as in a traditional non-experimental study of wage discrimination,

we had data on workers’ wages, race, sex, and human capital controls. However, suppose we also had

repeated observations on the race of the supervisor who was setting wages, and this varied for reasons

exogenous with respect to pay. Alternatively, suppose we had evidence that in some cases pay was set

without the supervisor knowing the worker’s sex, again for exogenous reasons. These are not realistic

scenarios, yet we would likely regard them as natural or at least “quasi” experiments. The handful of

29
   In a related paper that asks whether bargaining differences explain sex differences in earnings, Exley et al. (2016)
develop a bargaining experiment intended to ask whether women fare worse by avoiding negotiating – i.e., by not
“leaning in” – couching the experiment in terms of workers and firms splitting revenue. The evidence suggests that
men and women fare similarly when forced to negotiate, but when given a choice, women avoid negotiation more.
However, women’s unwillingness to negotiate does not harm them. Instead, women appear to positively select into
negotiating when it will pay off, whereas men do not.
30
   Indeed, as discussed in the next section, there are a couple of field experiments where a similar change was made.




                                                           28
studies I discuss in this section, which are summarized in Table 2, have the same flavor.

6.1 Sports

        Kahn (2000) describes how detailed data in the world of sports on performance, work histories,

“supervisors,” and pay can be used to study discrimination. Some recent papers have pushed the envelope

in this area of research to consider natural experiments. These studies perhaps do not get at the most

fundamental questions, such as who gets hired and how much they are paid. But they use clever research

designs that provide clean evidence on how workers are evaluated, and how this affects performance.

        Parsons et al. (2011) study the evaluation of Major League Baseball pitchers by umpires, looking at

pitches near the edges of the strike zone where there is more uncertainty as to whether a pitch is a ball or a

strike. They assemble a large dataset in which pitchers and umpires appear multiple times, and are matched

randomly – based on both the data and the institutional assignment of umpires to games. They can

therefore estimate models conditional on pitcher and umpire fixed effects and obtain causal estimates of

how the race or ethnicity of the umpire and the player affects strike calls. Their evidence indicates that

strikes are more likely to be called when the umpire and pitcher are of the same race/ethnicity. Moreover,

umpire evaluations affect pitcher performance. A different-race pitcher is less likely to pitch to the edges

of the strike zone where they will experience this disadvantage, and this strategic response affects the

pitcher’s success adversely, because a pitch to the middle of the strike zone is easier to hit.

        The study also exploits variation in monitoring of umpires – either explicitly through the use of

technology or implicitly based on crowd size and the strategic importance of the pitches. They find that the

bias in umpiring disappears under more intensive monitoring, and appears only (and more strongly) in the

low-monitoring environments. Parsons et al. interpret the evidence as indicating that when the “cost” of

discrimination is higher, umpires engage in less of it. This might be suggestive of implicit discrimination.

        A study of calling of fouls by referees in the National Basketball Association (Price and Wolfers,

2010) provides evidence of a similar nature. The authors know the racial composition of the three-person

umpiring crew, and the race of players (they focus on blacks and non-blacks). Using similar analyses as

Parsons et al. (although with no evidence of explicit monitoring, and perhaps less clear evidence of implicit



                                                       29
monitoring), they find that fouls are more likely to be called on players whose race deviates more from that

of the umpiring crew, and that this bias appears to affect players and teams adversely. Interestingly, this

bias mainly affects white players, either via worse treatment by black referees (in contrast to what we think

generally might happen in the labor market), or favorable treatment by white referees. 31

         The evidence in these two studies, indicating that discriminatory biases in evaluation can affect

performance, means that performance measures in discrimination studies cannot necessarily be treated as

exogenous. That is, if discrimination leads to worse performance (as seems likely in these contexts, but not

necessarily in all contexts), 32 regressions of pay or related measures on performance and group membership

will understate discrimination by over-controlling. 33 This is, in a sense, another manifestation of the kinds

of feedback effects that have been discussed in non-experimental research on discrimination. Theory, also,

suggests how statistical discrimination (which is probably not what the sports studies are detecting) can

lead to behavioral responses that can mask discrimination – such as “self-fulfilling” negative stereotypes

stemming from employers’ initial erroneous beliefs about group differences (Coate and Loury, 1993).

However, note that in the audit and correspondence field experiments discussed Section 7 there is no reason

to expect feedback responses that could diminish measured discrimination, since artificial applicants are

made identical.

6.2 Orchestras

         Goldin and Rouse (2000) study how the switch to blind auditions for major orchestras affected the

selection of female auditionees. The variation in this study arises from the adoption by orchestras, over

time, of blind auditions where the musician plays behind a screen and other steps are taken to ensure that

the musician’s identity is not known when selection decisions are made. The authors find that the selection

31
   Price and Wolfers suggest that their results could reflect implicit discrimination. For a related application in sports
that claims to test for implicit discrimination, see Gallo et al. (2013). This research can be viewed as trying to exploit
variation in the conditions under which implicit discrimination is expected to occur, which can potentially provide
evidence on implicit discrimination without relying on the IAT.
32
   In contrast, think of the Charlotte Whitton quote: “Whatever women do they must do twice as well as men to be
thought half as good,” (famously followed by “Luckily, this is not difficult”).
33
   There is related evidence in a recent study by Glover et al. (2015), who find that when minority cashiers are paired
with more biased managers (as measured by the IAT), they perform relatively worse (e.g., they scan items more
slowly, and take more time between customers) than non-minority cashiers paired with those managers. Earlier
evidence of these kinds of feedback effects on job interview performance is presented in Word et al. (1974).




                                                            30
of females increased because of blind auditions, suggesting that there was discrimination against women

prior to the adoption of blind auditions. 34 The contribution of this study to understanding discrimination in

the labor market is more substantial than the sports studies, because the audition process relates directly to

hiring. Indeed, Goldin and Rouse cast their study as complementary to the kinds of audit or

correspondence studies of discrimination discussed in the next section of the paper.

         The study includes a cautionary tale about how either natural or experimental variation can induce

behavior that eliminates reverse discrimination. In particular, Goldin and Rouse discuss a semi-final stage

when affirmative action may have been used to increase the pool of women, which can no longer occur

when auditions are blind. Below, I discuss a couple of field experiments where adopting sex- or race-blind

procedures seems to have reduced hiring opportunities for women or minorities, presumably by reducing

affirmative-action-like favoritism. In the Goldin and Rouse study, however, this presumably unintended

consequence at one stage of the process was less important than the larger overall impact of blind auditions

in increasing the selection of women.

                                  7. Field Experiments on Hiring Discrimination

         The most extensive body of experimental research on labor market discrimination is audit or

correspondence (AC) studies of discrimination in hiring. There are lengthy discussions of the basic

methods elsewhere (Fix and Struyk, 1993), and a few survey papers or meta-analyses that provide broad

overviews of the findings for some groups. I focus on key issues in the design of field experiments and

analysis of data from them, to help the reader understand how these studies have developed and to try to

identify unresolved or potentially promising research questions. I also provide a more detailed overview of

results for groups that have not been the focus of the bulk of the existing studies and hence of the prior

surveys.


34
   The use of blind auditions is chosen by the orchestra, and hence the variation is not really “natural.” The authors
are careful to rule out orchestras that hire more women ex ante adopting blind auditions (or adopting them earlier) –
analogous to testing the parallel-trends assumption in a quasi-experimental panel data analysis. The study also
illustrates the importance of controlling for worker heterogeneity (via a fixed effects analysis that evaluates outcomes
for workers under different treatments), because the adoption of a more neutral screening procedure that reduced sex
discrimination increased the likelihood that less-qualified female musicians auditioned.




                                                           31
7.1 Basic Methods

        AC studies of the labor market are field experiments used primarily to address the question of

discrimination in hiring. In audit studies, fake job candidates (“testers”) of different races, ethnicities, etc.,

who are sometimes actors, are sent to interview for jobs (or in some early studies, apply by telephone). The

candidates have similar resumes and are often trained to act, speak, and dress similarly. Correspondence

studies, in contrast, use fictitious job applicants who exist on paper only (or now, electronically), and differ

systematically only on group membership. The response captured in correspondence studies is a “callback”

for an interview or a closely related positive response. In contrast, the final outcome in audit studies is

actual job offers. The earliest AC studies of discrimination were Daniel (1968) – an audit study – and

Jowell and Prescott-Clarke (1970) – a correspondence study. 35 AC studies have also been used to analyze

discrimination in housing markets and consumer markets. My focus is on labor markets and the unique

issues that arise in these markets. 36

        It is easy to see the appeal of experimental AC studies. Non-experimental regression-based

approaches to testing for and measuring discrimination use data on the groups in question in a population,

introducing regression controls to try to remove the influence of group differences in the population that

can affect outcomes. AC studies, in contrast, create an artificial pool of labor market participants among

whom there are supposed to be no average differences by group. This is clearly a potentially powerful

strategy, because if we have, e.g., a sample of blacks and whites who are identical on average, then in a

regression of the form

        Y = α + βB + ε ,                                                                         (7.1)

where Y is the outcome and B is a dummy variable for blacks, ε is uncorrelated with B, so that the OLS




35
   Schwartz and Skolnick (1962) did an early version of a correspondence study of the effects of criminal background.
But this study did not focus on a characteristic usually associated with discrimination (e.g., race).
36
   The application to housing markets originated with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
Housing Market Practices Study, in 1977. For an overview of some of the existing work, see
http://www.urban.org/features/exposing-housing-discrimination (viewed November 22, 2015). For recent research on
consumer markets, see Gneezy et al. (2012), Doleac and Stein (2013) and Zussman (2014).

estimate 𝛽̂ (or simply the mean difference in Y) provides an estimate of the effect of discrimination on Y. 37

         For some of the discussion that follows, a more formal framework is useful. 38 Suppose that

productivity depends on two individual characteristics (standing in for a larger set of relevant

characteristics), X’ = (XI, XII), so that productivity is P(X’). XI is observed by firms, and XII is unobserved.

It is simplest, for now, to think of Y as continuous, such as the wage offered, although in fact in AC studies

we should think of it as latent productivity leading to a decision to hire/callback or not. Define

discrimination as

         Y(P(X’), B=1) ≠ Y(P(X’), B=0) .                                                             (7.2)

         Assume that P(.,.) is additive, so

         P(X’) = βIXI + XII, 39                                                                      (7.3)

and

         Y(P(X’), B) = P + γB .                                                                      (7.4)

         Discrimination against blacks implies that γ < 0, so that blacks are paid less than equally

productive whites.

         In AC studies, researchers create resumes that standardize the productivity of applicants at some

level. Denote expected productivity for blacks and whites, based on what the firm observes, as PB* and

PW*. Y is observed for each tester, so each test – the outcome of applications to a firm by one black and one

white tester – yields an observation

         Y(PB*, B = 1) − Y(PW*, B = 0) = PB* + γ − PW* .                                             (7.5)

         Given that the AC study design sets PB* = PW*, we should be able to estimate γ easily from these

data, by simply running a regression of Y on the dummy variable B and a constant. 40 However, there are

potential complications.

37
   Of course, most of the regression studies focus on wages, whereas AC studies focus on hiring. In Section 3.1.1, I
discussed why hiring discrimination detected by AC studies might have implications for wage discrimination.

   Because XII is unobservable, its coefficient is normalized to one.
40
   Moreno et al. (2012) present an interesting analysis using observational data from a government job intermediation
service in Peru. They are able to obtain detailed data on applicants for jobs and on characteristics of jobs. They refer
to this as a “pseudo-audit” study, because it uses actual rather than fictitious applicants.




                                                           33
         Nearly all studies used matched pairs of testers (or even triplets or quadruplets), usually justified as

a means of controlling for heterogeneity across employers (indeed one can include employer fixed effects

in the regression models estimated). 41 In a recent paper, Phillips (2015) suggests that some existing studies

appear to understate discrimination because of positive spillovers that arise from matched-pair comparisons

in which the quality of the artificial applicants submitted influences employers’ evaluations of other

applications submitted (although the bias can go in either direction). 42 Such spillovers are unlikely if the

number of artificial applications is small relative to the number of applications the employer receives, but

typically researchers do not know the latter number. For researchers concerned with this issue, the problem

can be avoided by foregoing matched-pair designs – for example, randomizing race for each applicant

independently within pairs – so that the “treatment” of being assigned a black name is not correlated with

the applicant pool composition (as affected by the researcher).

         With matched-pair designs, some researchers discard pairs of testers in which neither gets a

callback or interview, and measure “net discrimination” as the difference between the number of pairs

where the white is favored over the black versus the opposite, divided by the number of tests with at least

one positive response (e.g., Riach and Rich, 2002). However, recent work often translates the results of AC

studies into differences in how many jobs a member of a group has to apply to in order to get a callback or

interview (e.g., Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004; Rich, 2014), for which the number of pairs in which

neither gets a response is clearly relevant. Moreover, the full data seem critical to gauging discrimination.

For example, suppose that there are 100 tests in a study, and in 97 neither tester gets a positive response, in

two the white tester does, and in one the black tester does. Discarding the pairs with no offers implies net

discrimination of 33.3 percent, whereas a more reasonable interpretation would be that it is only slightly

41
   A recent exception is Weichselbaumer (2015a), who studies discrimination in Germany against women with
Turkish names wearing headscarves (in Germany, photos are included with job applications). She sends only one
application to each employer, for two reasons: first, she argues that correspondence studies have gotten enough
publicity in Germany that employers may look for closely matching applications; and second, job applications in
Germany require extensive amounts of information, including detailed school reports, making it hard to match within
pairs. The basic statistical analysis is the same, but there can be differences in the clustering of observations and/or
the fixed effects that can be included.
42
   See also related evidence in Weichselbaumer (2015b). Although based on small sample, she finds weaker evidence
of discrimination in a paired-application design, which she conjectures may be because employers may detect the test
and avoid or reduce discrimination.

harder for a black to get a positive response than a white. Standard practice has become to report estimates

from linear probability or probit models (marginal effects), retaining all the observations; this approach

does not require matched pairs.

7.2 Data and Design Issues

        There are a number of decisions researchers have to consider in designing an AC study. 43 The first

is whether to do an audit or a correspondence study. A major advantage of audit studies is that actual job

offers are observed, which are more convincingly tied to actual labor market outcomes, although, perhaps

surprisingly, audit studies have not proceeded to the stage of wage offers. 44

        A second issue in this choice is that callback rates could be influenced by factors that make them

less reliable indicators of ultimate hiring. Suppose that a correspondence study uses high-skilled white and

black candidates. Employers may know that the representation of high-skilled blacks in the population is

lower. Hence, if they want to hire some blacks, they may make a disproportionately high number of

callbacks to blacks, expecting more competition for them from other employers, which could boost

callback rates for blacks and obscure evidence of discrimination. 45 However, some audit studies on ethnic

discrimination by the International Labor Organization (ILO), discussed in Riach and Rich (2002), separate

discrimination at the selection for interview and job offer stage, and find that most (around 90 percent) of

the discrimination occurs at the selection for interview stage, suggesting that callbacks for interviews

constitute the key part of the hiring process to study. 46 Moreover, nearly all correspondence studies find

evidence of discrimination against minorities, so at worst callback studies could be understating racial and

ethnic discrimination, rather than obscuring it. In contrast, the evidence of sex discrimination from

correspondence studies is weaker and more ambiguous. However, it is unlikely that higher callbacks per

43
   Readers interested in designing and conducting a correspondence study might find the detailed discussion and
“roadmap” in Neumark et al. (2015) useful. Here, I touch on the main issues, with less of a “how-to” flavor.
44
   Another potential advantage noted by Pager (2007) is that in audit studies testers can be debriefed regarding their
treatment during the interview, providing some qualitative evidence on what happened, although this can inject a
subjective element.
45
   Of course, this can also happen for job offers in audit studies, since not all offers are accepted.
46
   Similarly, in my audit study of sex discrimination in restaurant hiring (Neumark, 1996), we were able to compare
callbacks resulting from candidates dropping off resumes in the morning when managers were not there and there was
little personal interaction, to results for job offers based on the actual interviews. The evidence pointed to
discrimination at both the invitation for interview and job-offer stages.




                                                         35
female applicant relative to intended hiring are responsible for this evidence, because skill distributions are

more similar between men and women. Nonetheless, there are still open questions of what we learn from

differences in callback rates in correspondence studies, relative to job offers in audit studies.

         On the other hand, correspondence studies have many advantages. One is the much lower cost per

application, which permits researchers to obtain larger samples, with which they can explore a richer set of

questions. As examples, the large-scale Urban Institute audit studies of discrimination against blacks and

Hispanics (Cross et al., 1990; Turner et al., 1991) had observations numbering only in the hundreds. In

contrast, Bertrand and Mullainathan’s (2004) correspondence study of black-sounding names had over

5,000 observations, and Neumark et al.’s (2015) correspondence study of age discrimination had over

40,000 observations. Both correspondence studies (and especially the latter) exploit these large samples to

design variations in resumes to test alternative hypotheses about discrimination.

         Correspondence studies also let researchers avoid experimenter effects that can lead to bias in audit

studies. For example, Heckman and Siegelman (1993) point out, in their evaluation of the Urban Institute

audit studies, that part of the training of testers was “a general discussion of the pervasive problem of

discrimination in the United States” (p. 216), raising the possibility that testers took actions in their job

interviews that led to the “expected” result. Similarly, Pager (2003) reports that black testers posing as

having criminal records may have had negative psychological reactions that affected their performance in

interviews. Correspondence studies avoid this problem, effectively creating blind testers.47

         More generally, in audit studies the influence of small differences between testers from different

groups can be amplified by the nature of the study design. For example, Heckman and Siegelman note that

Hispanic testers in one of the Urban Institute test sites had facial hair. Any productivity difference

associated with facial hair might seem trivial compared to the productivity-related characteristics

employers care about. But when the research design matches on many productivity-related characteristics,


47
  Indeed, Jowell and Prescott-Clarke (1970) carried out the first correspondence study, rather than using what they
called “actor applicants,” because of concerns about motivation: “It has been suggested that there could well be
conscious or unconscious motivation on the part of coloured actors to prove discrimination, and that this would bias
the results” (p. 399).




                                                          36
the importance of these trivial features can be magnified. This problem is avoided in correspondence

studies because resume characteristics are randomized. 48 For the preceding reasons, the correspondence-

study method has come to dominate field experiments on labor market discrimination, and hence much of

the ensuing discussion of methods focuses on correspondence studies.

         The second key design issue – which undergirds the quality of the research project – is the

construction of applicants and their resumes. One decision concerns which kinds of jobs to study.

Typically, these studies focus on lower-skill, entry-level jobs, for three reasons: first, the ways in which job

applications are made and responses collected (e.g., by email) are more common for low-skill jobs; 49

second, websites now list numerous low-skill jobs to which researchers can apply; and third, for higher-

skill jobs there is likely a greater likelihood that candidates would be known to prospective employers or

that employers could easily learn something that reveals the applicant as fictitious. 50 Aside from missing

higher-skill jobs, correspondence studies likely miss jobs found through informal contacts and referrals,

which are important job search methods (Ioannides and Datcher Loury, 2004).

         A key goal in constructing applicant resumes is to make them realistic for the jobs being sought.

Recent studies have used websites on which resumes are posted as the basis for the resumes used in the

study (e.g., Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004; Neumark et al., 2015). 51 The devil is in the details here;

Neumark et al. (2015) provide a recent discussion of many of the potential issues that arise in constructing

resumes, and suggest how to use data, as much as possible, to resolve them.

         In correspondence studies, group membership has to be signaled on the resume. This is probably


48
   One way to test for the influence of uncontrolled tester characteristics in audit studies is to use multiple pairs of
testers and explore the robustness of the findings across different pairs of testers, perhaps using tests of the
homogeneity of results for the different pairs prior to pooling the data (Heckman and Siegelman, 1993). For example,
in my audit study of sex discrimination in restaurant hiring (Neumark, 1996), the two female testers were quite
different looking, and one had more success in getting offers at high-price (and high-pay) restaurants, so we verified
the robustness of the overall results to using only pairs with the more successful female tester.
49
   On the other hand, Zschirnt and Ruedin (2015) note that correspondence studies might not cover the very lowest-
skill jobs where written or on-line applications are not used.
50
   There are exceptions to a focus on low-skill jobs. In a recent study of discrimination against the disabled, Ameri et
al. (2015) used fictitious applicants who were either novice of experienced accountants, and had callback rates in the
5-8 percent range, only a shade lower than, for example, the 6-10 percent range for lower-skilled sales and
administrative jobs in Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004).
51
   Sometimes actual resumes posted on job-search websites are used (e.g., Siddique, 2011).




                                                          37
easiest with regard to sex, since most first names are not gender-neutral, or with respect to age, since many

resumes list year of high school graduation (Neumark et al., 2015). Race is not listed on resumes, so

Bertrand and Mullainathan use typically black and white names based on birth certificate data, as have

more recent race studies. This introduces the possibility that employers associate productivity differences

with black-sounding names rather than race per se (from their title, “Lakisha and Jamal” versus “Emily and

Greg”). Bertrand and Mullainathan try to rule this out by controlling for neighborhood quality.

        Other characteristics are even less natural to signal on resumes. For example, studies of

discrimination based on sexual orientation (e.g., Drydakis, 2009) have included a line indicating volunteer

work on behalf of the gay community or a gay organization on some resumes, versus similar work for a

different kind of organization (e.g., environmental) on other resumes, to signal sexual orientation while

making the resumes neutral with respect to activism or volunteering. In their study of disability, Ameri et

al. (2015) disclose one of two disabilities in a cover letter.

        There are potentially interesting questions as to how different ways of signaling group membership

may affect outcomes, perhaps most importantly by unintentionally providing information on productivity

differences. The issue of black-sounding names was already discussed. As another example, Figinski’s

(forthcoming) correspondence study of military reservists wrestles with whether selection into the military,

or past activations, are associated with productivity-related factors. Similarly, Ameri et al. (2015) try to

choose disabilities that are unlikely to affect productivity (suggesting that one of the disabilities they study

– Asperger’s syndrome – may even be associated with higher productivity in accounting).

7.3 Differences in Unobservables

         A correspondence study can preclude systematic differences between groups in observables. But

there can still be differences in employers’ assumptions about unobservable differences between groups. I

discuss, in turn, differences in levels and differences in variances, which raise different issues.

7.3.1 Differences in Means of Unobservables

        As noted above, the group difference in outcomes we estimate in a correspondence study is

        Y(PB*, B = 1) − Y(PW*, B = 0) = PB* + γ − PW* .                                       (7.6)



                                                        38
        Using B and W subscripts in the obvious way on XI and XII, PB* = E(βIXBI + XBII|XBI, B = 1), and

similarly for PW*. Assuming randomization, and with XBI = XWI = XI, this reduces to γ + E(XBII|XI, B = 1) −

E(XWII|XI, B = 0), implying that we only identify γ if E(XBII|XI, B = 1) = E(XWII|XI, B = 0). But employers

may have different expectations about the mean of XII for blacks and whites, conditional on what they

observe, which a labor economist would label statistical discrimination.

        Thus, absent any method of distinguishing between γ and E(XBII|XI, B = 1) − E(XWII|XI, B = 0),

correspondence studies identify the combined effects of taste discrimination and statistical

discrimination. 52 However, if the study provides much less information about applicants than employers

usually have, then the statistical discrimination that is identified as part of the sum γ + E(XBII|XI, B = 1) −

E(XWII|XI, B = 0) might have little to do with real-world statistical discrimination. On the other hand, when

a correspondence study includes a rich set of applicant characteristics, it becomes less likely that statistical

discrimination plays much of a role in group differences in outcomes. These issues come to the fore in

studies that try to distinguish between statistical and taste discrimination.

7.3.2 Differences in Variances of Unobservables

        A second problem is that employers may assume different variances of the unobservable across

groups. With data on hiring – the focus of AC studies – it is most natural to think of applicants having to

exceed some productivity threshold with sufficiently high probability, and in such threshold models,

different variances of the unobservable can matter. I refer to this problem, described in Heckman and

Siegelman (1993) and Heckman (1998), as the “Heckman critique” of AC studies. The possibility of a

difference in the variance of unobservables is in fact a central feature of early models of statistical

discrimination (Aigner and Cain, 1977).

        To isolate the problem, consider the best-case scenario where E(XBII|XI, B = 1) = E(XWII|XI, B = 0),

so there is no statistical discrimination regarding levels. But the standard deviations of the unobservables,



52
  Indeed, if implicit discrimination provides a different reason for undervaluing the productivity of a group of
workers in AC studies, the empirical implication for the framework developed here would likely be the same as the
implication of taste discrimination.




                                                        39
denoted σBII and σWII, need not be equal. 53 Assume the applicant is called back (hired) if there is a

sufficiently high probability that their productivity exceeds a given threshold. In this case, σBII ≠ σWII

generates bias in the estimate of discrimination; worse, perhaps, we cannot necessarily even sign the bias.

         To see this intuitively, suppose that the research design standardizes XI at a low level, denoted XI*.

Employers care about how likely it is that the sum βIXI + XII exceeds some threshold. Given the low value

XI*, this is more likely for a group with a high variance of XII. Thus, even in the case of no discrimination

(γ = 0), the employer will favor the high-variance group. Conversely, if standardization is at a high level of

XI*, the employer will favor the low-variance group. Because researchers do not have information on the

population of real applicants to the jobs studied, there is no definitive way to know whether XI* is high or

low relative to the actual distribution, and hence no way to sign the bias.

         I suggested a solution to this problem that can separately identify the relative variances in the

unobservables, and the discrimination coefficient γ (Neumark, 2012). 54 The intuition behind the solution

stems from the fact that a higher variance for one group (say, whites), ceteris paribus, implies a smaller

effect of observed characteristics on the probability that a white applicant meets the standard for hiring.

Thus, information from a correspondence study on how variation in observable qualifications is related to

employment outcomes can be informative about the relative variance of the unobservables, and this, in

turn, can identify the effect of discrimination. Based on this idea, the identification problem identified by

the Heckman critique is solved by invoking an identifying assumption – specifically, that the effect of

applicant characteristics that affect perceived productivity and hence callbacks have equal effects across

groups – along with the testable requirement that some applicant characteristics affect the callback

probability (since if all the effects are zero we cannot learn about σBII/σWII from these coefficient estimates).

         In a probit specification, for example, we know that can only identify the coefficients of the latent

variable model for productivity relative to the standard deviation of the unobservable. In this case, we


53
   I assume homoskedasticity within groups and hence suppress conditioning on XBI and XWI.
54
   To reiterate, in this section I assume E(XBII|XI, B = 1) = E(XWII|XI, B = 0), to simplify. Without this assumption,
references to γ in the remainder of this section should be read as references to γ + E(XBII|XI, B = 1) = E(XWII|XI, B = 0)
– i.e., the sum of taste and statistical discrimination.




                                                            40
effectively have two probit models, one for blacks and one for whites. If we normalize σWII to one, then for

a characteristic (Z) that affects the callback rate, we identify its coefficient (δW) relative to σWII, or δW/σWII.

However, if we assume that δW = δB, then we do not need to impose the normalization that σBII = 1, but

instead can identify σBII/σWII from the ratio of the coefficients on Z in the probit for whites versus blacks,

which in turn allows us to identify γ. The estimation can be done using a heteroskedastic probit model,

which also permits an approximate decomposition into the effect of race via γ and its effect via the

difference in variances of the unobservable. Finally, when there are multiple productivity-related

characteristics that shift the callback probability Zk (k =1,…, K), there is an overidentification test because

the ratio of coefficients on each Z, for whites relative to blacks should equal σBII/σWII.

        It is actually rare that correspondence studies include variables that shift the callback probability,

because these studies typically create one “type” of applicant for which there is only random variation in

characteristics that are not intended to affect outcomes. However, a handful of studies have this

information – including Bertrand and Mullainathan’s (2004), whose data I used to illustrate this approach.

Moreover, studies can be designed to include this kind of quality variation.

        This discussion raises the issue of what we are trying to measure in AC studies. To this point, I

have focused on γ, which I think of as the structural effect of race capturing the potential discounting by

employers of black workers’ productivity à la Becker as in equation (7.4) (and possibly statistical

discrimination about the mean of XII). But we just saw that employers could treat blacks and whites

differently in hiring because of different variances of the unobservable. Should differential treatment

because of unequal variances be interpreted as discrimination, in which case we might not want to

eliminate it?

        The reason the coefficient γ is the object of interest is that the taste discrimination (and possibly

“first-moment” statistical discrimination) that AC studies capture in γ generalizes from the correspondence

study to the real economy. In contrast, in the Heckman and Siegelman framework the “second-moment”

statistical discrimination described above is an artifact of how a correspondence study is done – in

particular, the standardization of applicants to particular, and similar, values of the observables, relative to


                                                         41
the actual distribution of observables among real applicants. 55 If, instead, a study used applicants that

replicated the actual distribution of applicants to the employers in the study, there would be no bias – in the

setting described here – from the different variances of the unobservable; that is, differential treatment is an

artifact of the study design. That said, the correction for bias is wedded to a specific model of hiring as

well as a distributional assumption. There is no general reason to expect that this method would eliminate

bias in the estimate of discrimination that might arise in a model in which higher-order moments affect

hiring decisions directly, or with non-normal distributions.

7.4 Testing the Nature of Discrimination

        A number of recent AC studies try to distinguish whether taste or statistical discrimination

underlies their evidence of hiring discrimination. Note that in both field and laboratory experiments, the

statistical discrimination that implicitly underlies these tests has to do with lack of employer information

and the assumptions employers may make about worker characteristics they do not see in the information

provided. The issue of whether group differences in outcomes are arising from group differences in

characteristics that arise endogenously from discrimination (as in Coate and Loury, 1993) are not at issue,

because the studies eliminate these group differences. Thus, the approach to testing for statistical

discrimination is generally to add information to resumes, and if doing so diminishes the differences in

callback rates between groups, the evidence is interpreted as indicating that employers must have been

statistically discriminating – i.e., assuming group differences with respect to the types of information

provided included in the “high-information” treatment.

        There are two potential problems with this approach. First, we do not know, ex ante, on what

unobserved characteristics employers might be statistically discriminating. If we add information that is

not the basis for employers’ statistical discrimination, then a null finding of no change in callback rates is

uninformative. Second, a reduction in the difference between callback rates from adding information to the

resumes does not necessarily imply statistical discrimination, because the experiment – and in particular the


55
  That is not to say there cannot be discrimination based on second moments with, for example, risk averse firms (see,
e.g., Dickinson and Oaxaca (2009), for lab experiment evidence).




                                                         42
“low-information” treatment – may not mimic actual employer hiring. To take an extreme case, suppose

we compare results using resumes with no information except the group identifier to resumes with other

information (like education and job histories) that employers would typically have, and we find that the

callback rate difference between the groups diminishes. This does not imply that, in the real world,

members of the disadvantaged group suffer from statistical discrimination, because employers would

actually have the information on education and job histories. A valid test requires that we know what

information is typically not provided in the job application process, on the basis of which employers

statistically discriminate, and examine the effect of adding that information.

        To see that there is no “general” result that adding information to an AC study is informative about

whether statistical discrimination generates group differences in hiring or callback rates, using the notation

from above suppose that

        E(P|B = 1) < E(P|B = 0) .                                                             (7.7)

        Then in an audit study where employers know only race (B), in the model for hiring

        Y = α + βB + ε ,                                                                      (7.8)

the estimate β reflects both taste discrimination (γ) plus the expected productivity differential. If the

resumes instead also provide information on X, and

        E(P|B = 1, X) = E(P|B = 0, X) ,                                                       (7.9)

then the estimate of β reflects only taste discrimination, and hence the effect of adding X to the resumes

might be interpreted as providing evidence of statistical discrimination. But if real-world employers know

X, then this evidence is only an artifact of using an unrealistic baseline “low-information” treatment that

excludes X. Conversely, suppose we know that employers have information on X but not on Z, and the

low-information treatment includes X while the high-information treatment also includes Z. If

        E(P|B = 1, X) < E(P|B = 0, X), but E(P|B = 1, X, Z) = E(P|B = 0, X, Z) ,              (7.10)

then adding Z reduces group differences from statistical discrimination. But if

        E(P|B, X, Z) =E(P|B, X) ,                                                             (7.11)

that is, Z is uninformative about productivity, then adding Z has no impact on estimated group differences.



                                                       43
        Thus, the validity of this kind of test for statistical discrimination in AC studies hinges in part on

how well the job applications in the low-information treatment capture the information employers actually

have, and – less knowable – the extent to which the high-information treatment conveys the information on

the basis of which employers statistically discriminate.

        Aside from the focus on statistical discrimination, a few studies try to test Becker’s model of

customer discrimination, by comparing callback rates across jobs with different degrees of customer

contact. (I am not aware of attempts to test for employee discrimination, which would require information

on the composition of the tested employers’ workforces.) Finally, a couple of recent studies, discussed

below, use creative means to try to examine whether implicit discrimination accounts for findings of

discrimination in AC studies.

7.5 Race, Ethnicity, and Sex

7.5.1 Summary of Findings

        An extensive survey of results from field experiments through 2000 is provided in Riach and Rich

(2002), and Rich (2014) surveys field experiments conducted since then. Both surveys focus on the

standard demographic categories. I do not provide a detailed study-by-study discussion of the extensive

evidence on race, ethnic, and sex discrimination that these surveys cover. Rather, I draw out the main

lessons from the surveys, and focus on issues that may pose challenges to the conclusions from these

studies and hence motivate further research. 56 In subsequent sections, I turn in more depth to some of these

issues and to evidence on other groups, especially when that evidence raises new issues that pose

interesting areas for additional research. Most of the studies I discuss are summarized in Table 3.

        Riach and Rich cover eight AC studies of race or ethnic discrimination (which they refer to with

the catchall “race”) in the United Kingdom, six studies in other European countries, five studies in the

United States, and one each in Canada and Australia. Some of these studies report more than one analysis

(e.g., for both interviews and job offers, or for different ethnic groups). The key result is that every single


56
  Riach and Rich (2002) also provide a detailed response to many points raised in the Heckman and Siegelman (1993)
chapter critiquing the Urban Institute audit studies. (See also Pager, 2007).




                                                       44
comparison in these studies is in the direction of discrimination against the minority group, and most of the

estimates of discrimination are statistically significant. 57 The authors conclude that “In view of the number

of studies involved and their geographical extent this is compelling evidence of enduring and pervasive

racial discrimination in employment” (Riach and Rich, 2002, p. F499).

         The survey of more recent studies in Rich (2014) – covering a larger number of studies and more

countries – also documents near-uniform evidence of hiring discrimination against racial and ethnic

minorities, with only a handful of exceptions. One notable finding across a number of studies (in Australia,

Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden) is the consistent evidence of labor market discrimination

against applicants of Middle Eastern origin (often immigrants). 58

         The findings on studies of sex discrimination are more ambiguous. Riach and Rich summarize

results for five studies – three in the United States, and one each in Australia and Austria. An interesting

dimension of these studies is that some of them distinguish between results for more traditionally male-

versus female-dominated fields or sectors. These studies appear to provide clear evidence of discrimination

against women in male-dominated fields, and also in higher-pay or more-senior jobs within a sector (e.g.,

high-price and higher-pay restaurants in the United States in my 1996 study), but also discrimination

against men in female-dominated jobs. Moreover, some studies fail to find evidence of sex discrimination

in more sex-integrated jobs.

57
   The significance tests are based on the net discrimination measure that excludes from the denominator tests with no
positive responses. This has no effect on the sign of the estimated discrimination, and an ambiguous effect on
statistical significance (increasing the estimate by using a smaller denominator, but reducing the sample size).
58
   There is no clear way to explicitly signal religion in these studies. However, a recent study by Weichselbaumer
(2015a) studies discrimination against Turkish women in Germany based on whether they wear a headscarf, which is
likely to signal a religious Muslim. Compared to women with German names, and women with Turkish names who
do not wear a headscarf (in the photos included), Turkish women with a headscarf experienced much lower callback
rates (roughly three times the penalty for a Turkish name).
   Two correspondence studies in India – where apparently caste and religion can be signaled by name – find mixed
evidence. In software jobs, Banerjee et al. (2009) find no evidence of discrimination against lower castes, or between
Hindu and Muslim upper-caste applicants. But in call centers they find discrimination against lower castes, which
they suggest may be attributable to employers wanting workers with better English, American telephone etiquette,
etc., on the basis of which they statistically discriminate against lower-caste applicants. Siddique (2011) finds some
evidence of discrimination against lower castes in white-collar jobs, concentrated on female applicants in front office
or administrative jobs. She also finds some evidence that caste-related differences in callback rates vary with the sex
and religion of recruiters (inferred from the name of the contact person listed in the ad, who may not be the decision
maker), and suggests that since expectations regarding the different groups of applicants should be the same across
recruiters, variation in callback rates with recruiter characteristics is more likely to reflect taste discrimination.




                                                          45
         The additional studies surveyed in Rich (2014) confirm both findings. Indeed, Rich suggests that

some of the strongest evidence of discrimination arises for men applying to typically female jobs (although

this is largely based on net discrimination measures computed relative to tests for which one or both testers

received a positive response).59 Emphasizing the absence of consistent evidence of discrimination against

women, in a study of China, Zhou et al. (2013) found statistically significant evidence of discrimination

against men in most jobs covered, including many jobs that would not be viewed as typically female.

         A recent meta-analysis by Zschirnt and Ruedin (2015) also provides summary measures, in a more

consistent form, of correspondence studies of racial and ethnic discrimination in OECD countries. The

overlap with Riach and Rich (2002) and Rich (2014) is substantial, and the simple summary statistics

therefore, not surprisingly, convey the same near-uniformity of the findings of hiring discrimination against

ethnic minorities. 60 What is unique in this study, however, is the attempt to quantify (via meta-analysis)

how the estimates of discrimination in these studies vary with a number of study characteristics, to attempt

to shed light on hypotheses about what drives relatively stronger or weaker evidence of this discrimination,

and to try to understand the nature of discrimination. Most of this part of the analysis pertains to trying to

test for statistical versus taste discrimination, which I take up below. However, another interesting finding

the authors report is that they find no association between GDP growth or unemployment rates and

measured discrimination, in contrast to the hypothesis that employers are more likely to engage in

discrimination in slack labor markets (e.g., Biddle and Hamermesh, 2013). 61


59
   And based on data from correspondence studies of sex discrimination in Sweden, Carlsson (2011) concludes that
the relationship between gender bias in callbacks and the female share in the occupation is quite weak. He also finds
that the gender of the recruiter and the proportion female at the firm (based on matching to firm-level data) does not
affect the relative treatment of female candidates, which he interprets as ruling out “in-group favoritism” (p. 90).
60
   Similarly, a very recent meta-analysis of U.S. studies on discrimination against blacks and Hispanics finds that the
evidence almost always points to discrimination against minorities (Quillian et al., n.d.).
61
   In contrast, Farber et al. (2015) report less evidence of age discrimination among employers with higher overall
callback rates, which they interpret as “employers with a high demand for workers become less selective in deciding
whether or not to call back” (p. 6). Baert et al. (2015), in a study of discrimination against Turks in Belgium, find less
ethnic discrimination in what they term “bottleneck” occupations, where vacancies take longer to fill (and which tend
to be higher skilled). This does not necessarily speak to changes in discrimination with the business cycle. It could,
for example, be related to the importance of a better match in some occupations than others, generating both longer-
duration vacancies and less tendency by employers to discriminate – paralleling the evidence on Chinese job boards
indicating that, for higher-skilled jobs, employers are less likely to express preferences based on worker demographics
(Kuhn and Shen, 2013).




                                                           46
7.5.2 Testing for the Nature of Discrimination by Race, Ethnicity, and Sex

        Based on the consistent evidence of hiring discrimination across so many groups, Riach and Rich

(2002) suggest that it is unlikely that statistical discrimination underlies most of the findings:

        “Given the very diverse cultural, social, religious and educational backgrounds of the various
        Asian, Arab and African-descendant groups who have encountered the employment discrimination
        in these studies, it would be a superficial generalization to hold that the recorded disinclination to
        hire them arises because the various ‘indigenous’ white populations have, on average, superior
        employment characteristics. The common characteristic of Asians, Arabs and African-descendant
        groups is that they are not white… White immigrant groups (for example, Italians, Greeks)
        encountered discrimination in some studies, but never at a level comparable to non-whites” (p.
        F499, F503).

        Of course, we cannot decisively rule out statistical discrimination based on this observation.

Nonetheless, the argument is somewhat compelling.

        Similarly, the findings on sex discrimination are hard to square with statistical discrimination. The

usual argument is that employers engage in statistical discrimination against women based on a higher

likelihood of leaving the firm, taking on family responsibilities, etc. It is not clear, then, why the evidence

from AC studies points to discrimination against men in typically-female jobs, and vice versa, rather than

discrimination against women generally, although it is in principle possible that these stereotypical female

behaviors are for some reason more compatible with female jobs, and similarly for male behaviors and

characteristics and male jobs. But that would seem to lead to a rather tortured argument about statistical

discrimination, and in this case, coupled with the evidence on race and ethnicity, Occam’s Razor might

well argue for a simpler taste-based discrimination model – adapted in the case of hiring discrimination by

sex to have more to do with violating stereotypes or norms than disutility from hiring women.

        Some AC studies try to test for statistical versus taste discrimination more directly, by

manipulating the amount of information provided. Rich (2014) concludes that the evidence is inconsistent

across studies, with some finding that including more information eliminates group differences (e.g., Kaas

and Manger, 2011), whereas many do not. As explained above, however, these tests may not be

informative, and the same hypothesis can generate different results in different studies because of the

relation between study design, what employers know, and what information is provided.

        Other studies report evidence that authors argue are not consistent with either model. For example,


                                                       47
Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) suggest that their evidence of similar magnitudes of race discrimination

across occupations is hard to reconcile with statistical discrimination because factors such as the

importance of unobservable skills and the ease of observing relevant characteristics should vary across

occupations. But they also note results that are hard to reconcile with some taste-based models – for

example, the similarity of results across occupations with different degrees of customer or co-worker

contact. Rich (2014) claims that, across studies, measured discrimination does not vary with customer

contact, although no formal analysis is presented.

        Carlsson and Rooth (2012) combine data from their correspondence study in Sweden with

municipal-level survey information on attitudes towards immigrants. In evidence they interpret as

consistent with taste discrimination, they find that the callback rate for Middle Eastern minorities was

lower in municipalities where respondents had more discriminatory attitudes. However, the attitudinal

question refers to the value of immigrants in contributing to the Swedish population. It is not entirely clear

what this means, but is possible that the productivity of the immigrant population relative to non-

immigrants differs across municipalities, in which case the reported differences in attitudes could reflect

these population averages, and the relationship with callback rates could reflect statistical discrimination.

Attitudinal questions focused more on discriminatory tastes or preferences would likely be more

convincing.

        Zschirnt and Ruedin’s (2015) meta-analysis focuses on statistical versus taste discrimination,

presenting three types of evidence. First, they suggest that statistical discrimination should be lower for

second-generation than for first-generation immigrants, because more information is available about the

former; for example, more of the qualifications (like schooling) are local. They find some evidence of

lower discrimination against second-generation immigrants, although the estimates point to substantial

discrimination for both groups and the difference is not large. In addition, there are other reasons measured

discrimination may change across immigrant generations, such as increased proficiency in the native

language, which may not be adequately controlled in a correspondence study. And it is not clear why taste

discrimination cannot decline for more assimilated second-generation immigrants.



                                                      48
         Zschirnt and Ruedin suggest that evidence of stronger measured discrimination against “more

distant and visible minority groups” (p. 5) would be indicative of taste discrimination. Their analysis

suggests the lowest callback rates for Arabs and those of Middle Eastern origin, followed by Indians,

Pakistani, and Bangladeshis as well as Chinese, with Turks having callback rates that are closest to natives,

but still lower. Again, though, it is difficult to distinguish taste from statistical discrimination, as group

differences or availability of information about these groups may also differ.

        Third, the authors note that in German-speaking countries, far more detailed information is

included as part of job applications (like diplomas and transcripts), and hence it is less likely that employers

need to resort to statistical discrimination. Thus, smaller measured discrimination against minorities in

these countries would be consistent with statistical discrimination. Their evidence points to lower

measured discrimination for minorities in the German-speaking countries, although the remaining

difference in German-speaking countries, despite the extensive information provided, would suggest that

taste discrimination remains important. Echoing the discussion above, however, this source of variation is

only informative if the studies in each country provide the information employers typically have. Another

limitation of this evidence is that it does not condition on the ethnic group, whereas a difference in the

German-speaking countries for the same ethnic group relative to natives would be more informative about

the difference between the two sets of countries owing to differences in the application process. The

authors also suggest that much weaker evidence of hiring differences in the public sector is consistent with

statistical discrimination, given that the public sector uses more formal and detailed applications. Of

course, the public sector may simply engage in less discriminatory behavior as a matter of policy.

        Oreopoulos (2011) uses the “information-treatment” test for statistical discrimination against

immigrants in a correspondence study in Canada. Some of his analyses are potentially more informative

because they implement this test across jobs and skills for which we might expect statistical discrimination

to be less important or more important, while the other limitations of this test that I have described are, in a

sense, held constant. One approach is varying whether an applicant with a foreign name shows Canadian

education and experience or foreign education and experience. The latter may provide a noisier signal,



                                                        49
although the domestic education or experience could have different value in terms of productivity.

Oreopoulos also compares results for which relatively more or less of the required skills might be inferred

from immigrant status. For example, in sales jobs language might matter a lot, but in computer

programming it should not. He does not find consistent evidence pointing to statistical discrimination from

adding information related to important skills. For example, listing English or French fluency increases

callback rates for foreign-educated and experienced applicants but not foreign-named applicants. And he

does not find the expected relationship between information about language skills and the skills required on

the job, even though some recruiters who responded to a survey said that a foreign name is viewed as a

signal of a lack of critical language skills. 62

         Finally, Rooth (2010) tried to test for implicit discrimination in the context of a correspondence

study, by going back to the recruiters from his earlier correspondence studies of discrimination against

Arab-Muslim men in Sweden and administering the IAT to some of them. The evidence shows that those

with a higher IAT (more discriminatory) were less likely to call back Arabs. This result is valuable, as it

appears to provide some validation of the IAT in the real world.

         Rooth then includes three explicit discrimination measures in the callback model. The evidence

indicates that recruiters have explicit discriminatory attitudes. For example, in the data from one

experiment, 54 percent say that they prefer hiring a Swedish male to an Arab Muslim male. Rooth finds

that these explicit measures do not account for the lower callback rates associated with a higher IAT. He

concludes from this evidence that “there are recruiters who implicitly discriminate, but who would not

explicitly do so” (p. 529).

         This conclusion may not be warranted, however, because the explicit measures are unconditional.

For example, the hiring preference measure asks “which group, native Swedes versus Arab-Muslim, they

prefer when hiring people,” and the performance stereotype questions has alternatives like “Swedish men

62
  A different kind of approach is taken in Hedegaard and Tyran (2014). They run an experiment where individuals
are given the opportunity to choose from among two co-workers (one of the same ethnic group, and one of a different
ethnic group). In one treatment they have information about productivity, and in the other they do not. They find
evidence of discrimination in both cases, leading them to conclude that taste-based discrimination plays an important
role.




                                                         50
perform much better at work than Arab-Muslim men” (p. 527). The responses can therefore reflect actual

differences in productivity, rather than how a recruiter would treat two candidates with equal qualifications.

The unconditional nature of the explicit discrimination measures seems likely to lead to understatement of

the effects of these measures, because recruiters who would prefer a Swede unconditionally might not have

that preference conditionally (on the characteristics for which the study controls), so the explicit measures

may misclassify recruiters with regard to their explicit biases in the conditional experiments. That is, the

correlation of the IAT with explicit conditional discrimination measures might be much higher.

Nonetheless, the idea of combining data from AC studies with the IAT is very creative, and future work

could likely make more definitive use of such information.

         Finally, in a recent paper, Bartoš et al. (2014) propose a model of statistical discrimination that

endogenizes effort devoted to learning about applicants (and hence in a sense might be viewed as blending

statistical and implicit discrimination). They consider costs and benefits of acquiring information about

applicants to model how much attention employers will pay to applications from different groups and in

different settings. The model predicts that in highly selective markets, employers will pay less attention to

applications from groups with lower qualifications. The authors test this prediction in correspondence

studies using Czech and German data with native and ethnic minority names. In the Czech study, they

measure “attention” by modifying the research design to force employers to click on hyperlinks in emails to

see resumes (having seen the name that signals minority status in the email), and then in the resume

embedding “learn more” buttons (like clicking on “Experience” to see more about the applicant’s job

responsibilities). The authors find evidence of discrimination against minorities (Roma and Asians) similar

to the many studies already discussed. They also find evidence that employers pay more attention to the

non-minority resumes, in terms of both opening resumes and looking at more information – although these

differences are generally not significant in their very small sample. 63

         In the German study a different design is used, in which employers have to open a resume, but then


63
  The test for differences in attention based on selectivity of markets by comparing data for labor markets and
housing markets, arguing that the latter are much less selective.




                                                          51
an error is generated and they have to take additional effort to try to see the resume. In this case, no

information on callbacks is obtained, since the resume is never provided, and the authors obtain

information only on information acquisition, for which they find less effort to get resumes of minority

(Turkish) applicants.

7.5.3 Studies Addressing the Heckman Critique

        In Neumark (2012), I applied the method for addressing the Heckman critique to the data from the

Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) study of black-sounding names, exploiting data on skills included on

some of their resumes – which do help predict callbacks. The estimated overall marginal effects of race

from the heteroskedastic probit model indicate callback rates that are lower for blacks (black-sounding

names) by about 2.4-2.5 percentage points, relative to a 9.65 percent callback rates for whites. The

estimated variance of the unobservable is larger for blacks (although the difference is not statistically

significant). As a result, decomposing the marginal effect, the effect via the level of the latent variable,

which captures discrimination as conventionally defined in AC studies, is larger than the marginal effect

from the probit estimation, ranging from −5.4 to −8.6 percentage points. The effect of race via the variance

of the unobservable, in contrast, is positive, ranging from 2.8 to 6.2 percentage points (although this effect

is not statistically significant). The point estimates imply that, in these data, the bias from different

variances of the unobservable leads to understatement of race discrimination (presumably reflecting both

the higher variance for blacks and standardization of the resumes at a low quality level).

        Carlsson et al. (2013) re-examine data from four previous studies of the Swedish labor market by

some of the co-authors, each of which includes some form of the data required to implement this method.

Their re-analysis does not lead to large changes in the estimates of discrimination, and sometimes the

estimated discrimination (against those with Arabic names, and in favor of women) becomes smaller –

which contrasts with the findings from the Bertrand and Mullainathan data. Baert et al. (2015)

implemented this method in a study of discrimination against Turkish school-leavers in Belgium, using

information on distance from the worker’s residence to the workplace and other application characteristics

to identify the heteroskedastic probit model, and report that this correction does not alter the conclusions.



                                                       52
They find a higher variance of the unobservable for Turks, and a larger estimate of discrimination,

consistent with a low level of standardization; again, the difference in variances is not statistically

significant. 64

         These estimates from these studies point to understatement of discrimination when the variances of

the unobservables are assumed to be equal, and none indicate that ignoring the Heckman critique leads to

strong overstatement of discrimination. In contrast, a very recent study implements this technique for five

labor market (and four housing market) studies of racial or ethnic discrimination that we identified that

include the requisite data and for which we could get the data from the authors (Neumark and Rich, 2016).

We find that the evidence of race and ethnic discrimination in the labor market studies falls to near zero or

becomes statistically insignificant in about half of the estimates re-examined, suggesting that we may need

to interpret the overall body of evidence from field experiments on race and ethnic discrimination more

cautiously than the other surveys and meta-analyses discussed above.

7.6 Age

7.6.1 Summary of Findings

         A number of studies apply AC methods to age discrimination. In general, this work follows the

paradigm used in studies of discrimination against other groups, such as blacks or women, making

applicants identical (up to random variation) in all respects except age. However, there is an issue of how

to treat potential age-related differences in experience, discussed below.

         There are also other issues that may affect the interpretation of studies applying AC methods to the

question of age discrimination. For example, employers might interpret older applicants as sufficiently

unusual for some jobs that they discount the applications. Although this might still be construed as age

discrimination, researchers try to avoid this problem by applying to jobs for which older workers do in fact

apply (e.g., Neumark et al., 2015). Second, employers might negatively evaluate an older worker who is

applying for fairly entry-level positions. This would still, however, constitute statistical discrimination,


64
  Baert (2015) does a similar analysis for a field experiment on sex discrimination, and finds no effect of this
correction on estimates of discrimination.




                                                           53
although it is likely less interpretable as taste discrimination. Neumark et al. (2015) also discuss this issue,

and discount it because evidence of lower callbacks to older applicants is similar for older applicants

moving from higher- to lower-skilled jobs near the age of retirement.

         The main studies almost uniformly find evidence of age discrimination in hiring. 65 For example,

Bendick et al.’s (1997) correspondence study looks at 32 and 57 year-old male and female applicants

(signaled by year of graduation). Among applications in which at least one of the two applicants received a

positive response, in 43 percent of cases only younger applicants received the positive response, versus

16.5 percent of cases in which the older applicant was favored, for a statistically significant net

discrimination measure of 26.5 percent.

         This study had other interesting features. First, the authors sent applications to a large list of

companies that they could identify (without reference to job postings). Drawing on other information

sources, they could study how firm characteristics such as firm size or industry affect the outcomes of their

tests. For example, they find more evidence of discrimination in the largest firms; this contrasts with other

research on discrimination (e.g., Holzer, 1998), but that may be because this other research contrasts very

small firms that may be exempt from anti-discrimination laws.

         A second feature was to vary the extent to which resumes de-emphasized age (by focusing on skills

rather than history), that highlighted experience and maturity, or that tried to combat age-related

stereotypes (by adding to the cover letter a phrase about being “energetic, adaptable to the latest

technology, and committed to my career”). Measured discrimination was about half (but still present) for

the applications de-emphasizing age or countering ageist stereotypes. The finding on stereotypes might be

viewed as evidence of statistical discrimination against older workers based on assuming they are less adept

at new technology, or are likely to retire soon. In light of the discussion of the potential limitations of tests

for statistical discrimination, this evidence might be viewed as relatively more compelling, since employers

likely do care about these things (recall the evidence from Rosen and Jerdee, 1977) and not be able to glean


65
 In this section, I exclude a few studies that focus on age differences but do not include age ranges covering older
workers (in their 50s or 60s).




                                                          54
it directly from job applications.

            Bendick et al. (1999) perform an audit study meant to provide more evidence on age discrimination

than can be obtained from a correspondence study. One goal was to capture more than just whether the

callback was positive – such as whether, when both testers received positive responses, one was treated

more favorably with regard to getting an interview, an opportunity to demonstrate skills, a job offer, or a

job offer with higher compensation. The percentage of tests with a more favorable response for younger

applicants (age 32) was 42.2 percent for age 32, versus 1 percent for older applicants (age 57), and the

evidence points to favorable treatment of younger workers, among pairs offered jobs, with respect to salary

and health insurance benefits. 66

            Another feature of this study is to document differences in outcomes at different stages of the

process. Echoing the earlier conclusions from studies of ethnic and race discrimination, about three-

quarters of the discriminatory difference in treatment is at the pre-interview stage. The study also reports

on some assessments of phone calls and interviews by the testers, including attempts to gauge whether

employers expressed age-related stereotypes, finding that this was rare. Finally, the study presents

information on characteristics of the positions offered, with some indication of less attractive positions

offered to older applicants (e.g., lower commissions on sales, part-time work, etc.), although any such

conclusions are based on a handful of observations.

            Lahey’s (2008) correspondence study focuses on women only (for reasons discussed more below).

She uses five different ages ranging from 35 to 62, and finds consistent evidence of age discrimination,

whether using age as a continuous variable or classifying workers as older (50/55/62) versus younger

(35/45). Lahey tries to address the question of statistical discrimination by including language on older

resumes intended to combat adverse stereotypes of older workers (like a statement about willingness to

embrace change in the resume), information on an attendance award (to combat expectations of greater

absences among older workers), a statement about not needing health insurance (to counter expectations of

higher health insurance costs), and information about computer skills (to combat fears of technological

66
     Details in the paper are scant, including statistical tests for each dimension of job offers.




                                                               55
obsolescence). There were not clear indications that resume features designed to counter negative age-

related stereotypes consistently helped older applicants.

        Lahey also tries to assess the importance of employer, employee, or customer discrimination. She

tests for employer discrimination by assuming that a firm with a human resources department would exhibit

less taste-based discrimination (although it is unclear why the department would not act at the owner’s

discretion), but finds evidence (not significant) suggesting a negative interaction with applicant age. She

tests for employee discrimination by asking whether the age composition of the workforce in the

employer’s PUMA is related to variation in outcomes with age, but finds no relationship (acknowledging

that this is a noisy measure and hence imprecise test). Finally, she does a related test for customer

discrimination by asking whether the age composition of the population is more important in occupations

with more customer contact; again, she finds no evidence of a relationship.

        Three closely related studies, Riach (2015) and Riach and Rich (2006 and 2010), investigate age

discrimination in applying for jobs as waiters (and, in one case, as retail managers). One paper covers

England, one covers France, and Riach (2015) covers four countries, adding Spain and Germany. In all

instances but one (applicants for jobs as retail managers in Riach and Rich (2010), who were female only),

there is strong evidence of discrimination against older applicants. This one instance is the only one I am

aware of in the research literature that finds evidence of discrimination against younger workers. However,

for correspondence studies, the samples in all of these studies are quite small; there are only 300 retail

manager applications, and the net discrimination measure is based on 24 applicants.

7.6.2 Specific Issues in Using Correspondence Studies to Test for Age Discrimination

        Strict application of the paradigm of AC methods to studying age discrimination requires giving

older and younger applicants the same low level of experience (commensurate with the young applicants’

ages), because clearly a young applicant cannot have the experience of a long-employed older worker.

This could make older applicants look unusually unqualified relative to the older applicants employers

usually see, which could generate a bias in AC studies towards finding evidence of age discrimination.

Researchers have addressed this problem in different ways, but they may not have eliminated this bias.



                                                      56
         Bendick et al. (1997) had older and younger applicants report 10 years of experience on their

resumes. To account for the gap in older applicants’ job histories, the resumes indicated they had been out

of the labor force raising children (for the female executive secretary applications), or working as a high

school teacher (for the male or mixed applications). Bendick et al. (1999) are vaguer, but note that all

applicants reported several years of experience in an occupation related to the job to which they are

applying, and older applicants also reported additional years of experience in an unrelated field. Lahey

(2008) includes only 10-year jobs histories for all applicants, although she focuses on women, for whom

time out of the labor force may be less of a negative signal than for men. Still, across these studies it is a

matter of speculation whether experience in unrelated fields or time out of the labor force negatively

affected employers’ assessments of older applicants, generating spurious evidence of age discrimination.

         Neumark et al. (2015) argue that the more relevant policy and legal question is relative hiring of

older workers and younger workers each with experience commensurate with their age. Riach and Rich

(2006, 2010) also criticize the approach of using unrealistic resumes for older workers, and in their studies

give their applicants experience commensurate with their age. Most of their findings (with the one

exception noted above) still find strong evidence of age discrimination, suggesting that low experience does

not drive the finding in other studies. However, in their sample resumes, the description of experience is

quite cursory, and not a full job history. 67 Results could differ with full job histories for older workers

showing experience commensurate with their age. Neumark et al. (2015) provide a more comprehensive

examination of this question in a large-scale correspondence study of age discrimination, drawing on a

comprehensive database of resumes to construct different kinds of older-worker resumes showing either

experience that matched that of younger applicants, or experience commensurate with age, to see whether

there was a difference. For women, perhaps consistent with Lahey’s (2008) conjecture, the outcomes

relative to younger applicants did not depend on the whether older applicants’ resumes showed matched or

commensurate experience. For men, however, in the one of the two occupations in which there was some

67
  In the 2006 paper, the resumes simply say that the person has worked as a server in restaurants since about age 20.
In the 2010 paper, one resume lists three jobs held since age 17, rising to Senior Waiter, and the second has a
paragraph description of the career since leaving school, again with rising responsibility.




                                                          57
evidence of age discrimination, the results were fully driven by the low-experience resumes for older

workers. Thus, there is some evidence that using low-experience resumes in age discrimination AC studies

is problematic, at least for men (for whom, for older cohorts, there may be more of an expectation of a

fairly continuous work history).

        The second issue we emphasize in this study is differences in the variances of the unobservables.

Unequal variances of the unobservable may be particularly plausible in comparing older and younger

workers. The human capital model predicts that earnings become more dispersed with age as workers

invest differentially in human capital and these differences accumulate (Mincer, 1974). Because this

variation is unlikely to be conveyed on the resumes used in correspondence studies, it could imply a larger

variance of unobservables for older versus younger applicants. The correspondence study was designed to

include multiple skill variables that could shift callback probabilities, and to then use these variables, in a

heteroskedastic probit model, to estimate the relative variances of the unobservables and obtain an unbiased

estimate of age discrimination. Paralleling the results on experience, the findings for women were robust to

doing this; nothing diminished the rather strong evidence of age discrimination against older women. For

men, however, the evidence was not robust to this correction.

        The findings in Neumark et al. (2015) provide decisive evidence of age discrimination against

older women. A recent U.S. correspondence study by Farber et al. (2015) provides corroborating evidence.

The study focuses more on the effect of unemployment duration than on age discrimination, but finds

evidence of lower callback rates for women aged 55-58 (compared to 35-37 and 40-42) who apply to

administrative support jobs (one of the jobs in Neumark et al., 2015). In contrast to the earlier studies,

however, the evidence in our study raise doubts about the conclusion that older men suffer much age

discrimination; certainly the finding is not robust. One possible reason older women may experience more

discrimination than older men is because physical appearance matters more for women (Jackson, 1992) and

age detracts more from physical appearance for women than for men (Berman et al., 1981) – consistent

with the shift in relative preference away from women with age that Kuhn and Shen (2013) find.

7.7 Other Groups



                                                       58
        AC studies have been conducted for many other groups of workers – some protected by anti-

discrimination laws (e.g., the disabled), and some not (e.g., the less attractive). There is typically only a

small number of studies for each such group. I review some of these studies briefly, focusing on some of

their interesting features, especially those that might prompt additional research.

7.7.1 Looks and Obesity

        I discuss experimental research on looks and obesity together. Although there are some observable

outcomes associated with obesity that employers may care about and may be health related, it is plausible

that negative visual appearance is a common factor in both of these dimensions. Indeed, Rooth’s (2009)

correspondence study of obesity in Sweden explicitly combines the two. Rooth signals obesity by digitally

manipulating photographs – which are often included in job applications in Sweden – to change a non-

obese applicant to obese. For men and women, obesity lowers the callback rate by about seven to eight

percentage points, and the sign is in this direction for all occupations but nurses. The study also

incorporates attractiveness ratings of the photographs, including the digitally-altered ones. Attractiveness

is rated lower for the obese applicants, and pooling across occupations, the attractiveness rating explains

the obesity differential for men, but not for women. 68 However, the two measures are highly correlated, so

it is hard to distinguish the effects of looks and obesity. Moreover, across occupations the relative

magnitudes of the two characteristics of the photos are not robust. The obesity penalty is larger in some

jobs requiring customer contact (such as sales), which may reflect customer discrimination. But the

occupation-specific estimates are imprecise, and the pattern is not consistent (e.g., a large penalty for

female but not male accountant applicants).

        Focusing just on obesity, Agerström and Rooth (2011) follow Rooth (2010), testing for implicit

biases against the obese by administering the IAT to some recruiters from Rooth’s (2009) correspondence

study of obesity discrimination, and asking about explicit discrimination and obesity-related stereotypes

regarding overall work performance. The results are similar to the Arab-Muslim discrimination study.

68
  Rooth used a professional firm to do the photo manipulation, and reports than none of the student evaluators he used
suggested that the photos looked odd or manipulated. The Bóo et al. study (discussed below) reproduces the original
and altered photos, so the reader can judge.




                                                         59
Recruiters with a higher IAT (more discriminatory toward the obese) were less likely to call back obese

applicants, controlling for the explicit measures did not change this result, and the explicit measures were

not significantly associated with callbacks. However, the previous criticisms apply here as well.

         Two studies focus on looks in isolation. Bóo et al. (2013) study Argentina. They use photographs

that are digitally manipulated to alter what they say are validated measures of facial beauty based on

horizontal distance between the eyes relative to a face’s width, and vertical distance between the eyes and

mouth relative to a face’s length. They find that callback rates for the attractive candidates are about one

third higher, and the effect is similar for men and women. However, when they have students rank the

photos, they get high correlations of rankings with the distance measures, but the subjective rankings do not

predict callbacks. This raises the question of what is being manipulated in the experiment, since we might

expect student ratings of looks to line up to some extent with employers’ perceptions.

         Ruffle and Shtudiner (2015) do a correspondence study of lookism in Israel, where including a

photo is discretionary. They use subjective ratings of attractiveness by a panel of working people, and find

higher callback rates for more attractive men, but not women. They also send out applications with no

photos, and among women, these get the highest callback rate, whereas for men the no-photo applications

only get higher callback rates than the non-attractive applicants. 69 These kinds of results raise questions

about which real-world applicants actually send out photos and hence about the external validity of the

findings in countries where including a photo is discretionary. 70 As in other studies, the authors test for

differences based on interaction with customers. For neither men nor women does the treatment based on

looks vary with customer contact.

         Finally, Galarza and Yamada (2014) conduct a correspondence study in Peru of discrimination

based on looks and race (signaled via photos and names). The photos are manipulated to be similar in


69
   The authors present some evidence that they interpret as suggesting that the disadvantage or lack of advantage for
attractive female applicants, in their data, may stem from jealousy or envy among females who evaluate job
applications.
70
   The authors report some results from asking their subjective raters of looks whether they would attach the picture to
an application if it was their picture, and ask employers which types of applicants tend to attach a picture to their
resume and what message applicants convey by including a photo.




                                                          60
terms of clothing, background, etc., and are rated by a group of professionals from various fields (they

sound like academics). They include both men and women. Looking only at race (indigenous origins), the

authors find strong evidence of racial discrimination in all types of jobs. However, white applicants are

rated as better looking than indigenous ones, raising the question of whether the racial discrimination in

callbacks reflects lookism or something else. The study finds a significant beauty “premium” in callback

rates, and that looks explain about half the racial gap in callbacks. In professional jobs, there is only a

difference associated with looks under this approach, and no racial difference. In technical and in unskilled

jobs, neither appears to matter when both are included in the model. Among the unskilled jobs (in results

the authors only describe), looks seem to matter for those with customer contact (sales and marketing, and

restaurants), but not in non-contact jobs (e.g., call centers and drivers), consistent with customer

discrimination that presumably makes good-looking employees more productive in such jobs. This study,

like Rooth’s (2009), raises the question of how to interpret the effects of looks and other physical

characteristics that seem to be associated with looks.

7.7.2 Women with Family Responsibilities

         Statistical discrimination against women may stem from employers’ expectations that they will

leave their job, perhaps to have or care for children. Duguet and Petit (2005) and Petit (2007) test this

hypothesis in a correspondence study of jobs in the financial sector in France. 71 They do not use the

information-treatment approach, presumably because it is hard to imagine a credible direct signal of future

turnover or childbearing intentions. Instead, they use groups with different likelihoods of future

childbearing or childrearing responsibilities. In particular, they have three types of both male and female

applicants: age 25, single and childless; age 37, single and childless; and age 37, married with three

children. Women in the first group are those for whom employers are most likely to expect future

childbearing. Consistent with past studies, they do not find significant overall differences in callback rates

by sex. Nor, for all jobs combined, do they find differences for the three kinds of applicants. They do find,


71
   The data are the same in the two papers, and the analysis and results nearly the same; I describe the results from the
first paper.




                                                           61
however, that for the jobs with higher qualifications or that offer training – jobs in which turnover costs

may be higher – the women who are 25, single, and childless receive fewer callbacks than comparable men.

In contrast, for the 37 year-old applicants there is either no sex difference or, in one case, a difference

favoring women. This evidence is consistent with statistical discrimination against women with regard to

future childbearing.

         In the Correll et al. (2007) study discussed above, the evidence from the lab experiment is coupled

with evidence from a correspondence study. The design of the correspondence study was similar to the lab

experiment, with a male pair and a female pair (signaled by names) in each of which one was a parent and

one was not, and applications made to marketing positions; marital status was not indicated. The results

indicated no significant difference in callback rates for men dependent on parental status, but a callback

rate for childless women 1.8 times that for mothers. Given that parental status was signaled as being a

Parent-Teacher Association Coordinator, and applicants had about seven years of experience, the applicants

were reasonably interpreted as having young children.

7.7.3 Criminals/Criminal Records

         Perhaps the least surprising result among field experiments on labor market discrimination is that

applicants with criminal backgrounds get fewer callbacks. Pager’s (2003) audit study of black and white

applicants in Milwaukee finds that, among whites, callback rates were lower by 50 percent for those with

criminal backgrounds (a felony drug conviction and 18 months served), and among blacks, callback rates

were lower by 71 percent. Unusually, the study uses direct employer contacts so that race could be

signaled directly, like in an audit study; but it did not have the testers go beyond the first contact, so only

callbacks are captured. 72 Strikingly, perhaps, the callback rate for the white tester with a criminal

background record is higher (not significantly) than that for the black tester without a criminal background.

However, there were only four testers, paired by race, so the comparisons by race do not come from a


72
   Like in age AC studies, there is an issue of missing labor market experience, attributable to the 18 months spent in
prison. Pager addresses this by have the testers show some work experience in prison, and having those without
criminal backgrounds graduate later. Still, there could be an experience differential that matters for the outcomes,
although my sense is this is unlikely to explain much of the difference associated with criminal background.




                                                           62
within-pair design. 73

         Baert and Verhofstadt (2015) carried out a correspondence test in Belgium, using as applicants

male school leavers applying to a number of occupations, some of whom indicated a period of juvenile

delinquency (spending time in a detention center). The applicants indicating this history also reported

having a certificate of good conduct. The callback rate for control applicants who did not report a criminal

background was 29 percent (four percentage points) higher. The difference is more pronounced for males,

and small and statistically insignificant for females.

         Of course, lower callbacks for those with a criminal background should not necessarily be viewed

as discrimination, because criminal background signals relevant information that employers not only may

care about but perhaps should care about, given that they can be held liable for an employee’s actions and

accused of negligence in hiring, which a background check does not necessarily protect against (e.g.,

Ponticas v. K.M.S. Investments, 1983). 74 In neither country covered by these studies is discrimination

against those with a criminal background explicitly illegal, although some U.S. states are trying to increase

employment protections for workers with criminal backgrounds (Pager, 2003). 75 Nonetheless, the results

do emphasize the challenge of re-integrating those with criminal backgrounds into the labor market.

7.7.4 Gays and Lesbians

         The research literature using AC methods to study discrimination against gays and lesbians is,

perhaps not surprisingly, more recent. Perhaps reflecting this, the studies in this area present some

interesting and unusual features, some of which – such as trying to learn about wage offers in the context of

73
   Pager et al. (2009) extend this study (doing it in New York) to include Latino applicants as well, using alternative
assignments of testers that permit matched-pair comparisons between non-minority ex-offenders and minorities
without a criminal background. The white ex-offenders have modestly higher (though not statistically significant)
callback rates than non-offender blacks and Latinos.
74
   Despite this, Baert and Verhorfstadt strongly interpret their results as reflecting discrimination (e.g., p. 1070). A
recent experiment (Agan and Starr, 2016) estimates the effect of state policies that restrict employers asking about
criminal background histories on on-line job application sites (“ban-the-box” policies), based on callbacks to fictitious
applicants to companies – some of which asked this information, and some of which did not – before and after the
policy change. The evidence indicates that criminal records are a significant barrier, but also that “banning the box”
increased the white versus black advantage in callback rates, presumably because it encouraged statistical
discrimination against blacks who could no longer signal at this initial stage their absence of a criminal record.
75
   The EEOC does warn that discrimination on the basis of criminal background can lead to racial or ethnic
discrimination given high incarceration rates for blacks and Hispanics
(http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/arrest_conviction.cfm#I, viewed January 18, 2016).




                                                           63
these studies – could perhaps be fruitfully emulated and extended in AC studies more generally.

         Weichselbaumer (2003) conducted a large-scale correspondence study of discrimination against

lesbians in Austria. Her analysis is motivated in part by the evidence of a wage penalty for gays but a wage

premium for lesbians, relative to same-sex heterosexuals. Weichselbaumer discusses a number of

hypotheses that might explain why lesbians earn a wage premium despite evidence that, like gays, they

self-report discrimination in the workplace, and that surveys (at the time of this research) indicated negative

attitudes towards both gays and lesbians, including in the workplace. First, the wage premium may be

confined to more “masculine” lesbians, if this masculinity is valued in the workplace. Second, the adverse

effects of discrimination may not be reflected in wages because few lesbians are “out” at work, whereas a

correspondence study that manipulates sexual orientation would reveal discrimination. Third, lesbians may

specialize less in home production, including having fewer children, boosting wages despite discrimination.

         The study submitted applications for secretarial and accounting jobs, using the detailed applications

(including photographs) typical in German-speaking labor markets. Masculinity or femininity is conveyed

via the photos, and the study used a group of student raters to confirm that the photos conform to these

stereotypes without influencing overall ratings of desirability. The stereotypes were also reinforced via

hobbies and past experience on the resumes, although it is possible that these were more strongly correlated

with productivity/desirability. Sexual orientation is signaled via work for a gay rights organization,

balanced in the heterosexual sample by work for other organizations. 76 The study successively sends two

pairs of applicants to employers in such manner as to first provide information on the effect of masculinity

among straight women, and then on sexual orientation. All women describe themselves as single.


76
  Baert’s (2014a) correspondence study of discrimination against lesbians in Belgium signals sexual orientation by
having all applicants married, with the lesbian applicants listing a female spouse (based on first name), versus listing
no spouse. Baert suggests that other studies’ use of membership or activism in a gay rights group may signal activism
or even radicalism. However, the other studies usually assigned a similar kind of activism (e.g., in an environmental
group) to the controls, so it is not clear why this method should accentuate discrimination against lesbians.
Weichselbaumer (2015b) compares results using these two approaches (in Germany, using lesbians in “registered
partnerships” to compare with married heterosexual women), and finds little difference in the callback gap between
single straight and lesbian women signaling sexual orientation via volunteer activities, and married straight and
registered-partner lesbian women signaling sexual orientation via marriage/partnerships. Of course this design may
confound the effect of differences in signaling sexual orientation and differences in the effects of orientation between
single and married/registered women.




                                                          64
        Lesbian women received substantially fewer callbacks, and this was unrelated to masculinity or

femininity. 77 Weichselbaumer argues that statistical discrimination is not likely to underlie the results.

First, as emphasized in Zschirnt and Ruedin (2015), the detailed applications in German-speaking labor

markets leave less scope for this kind of discrimination. Second, because lesbians are raised in the same

kinds of families and environments as heterosexuals, there is less reason to expect unobserved differences

like we might assume disadvantage minorities (although there could be non-random selection on which

lesbians are “out”). Third, because of the lower likelihood of having children (especially in earlier years),

if anything we might expect statistical discrimination to favor lesbians over heterosexual women.

        Drydakis (2009) used a similar strategy to study discrimination against gays in Greece, although

without attention to gender stereotype. Rather, to counter gay stereotypes regarding femininity, the gay and

straight resumes included similar hobbies that, according to the author, implied similar masculinity. He

finds strong evidence of hiring discrimination against gays, with callback rates lower by about 25

percentage points. In an interesting extension, Drydakis had fictitious applicants field return phone calls to

try to get information on wages offered. The paper only reports wage regressions for pairs where both

applicants received wage offers, and in these cases there was no detectable wage offer difference. In

Drydakis’ (2011) very similar study of discrimination against lesbian women in Greece, which finds much

lower callback rates for lesbians, he reports all of the evidence on wage offers, finding a wage penalty for

lesbians exceeding eight percent in the sample where only one or the other gets an offer, but only 4.8

percent in the matched sample where both get callbacks. These findings suggest that the finding of equal

wage offers for gay men in the first study may reflect the selection on pairs where both men received

callbacks.

        The wage evidence for women contrasts with the usual finding from non-experimental data that

lesbian women earn a wage premium. This could be due to differences in whether sexual orientation is

known to the employer (as Weichselbaumer (2003) suggested), differences in wage offers measured by


77
  Weichselbaumer (2004) uses these same data to study sex discrimination among heterosexuals, concluding that it is
not driven by whether women have more masculine or feminine identities.




                                                        65
fielding phone calls versus actual accepted wage offers, or differences in wages based on gender stereotype

(the resumes in this study did not particularly try to signal more masculine stereotypes).

        Tilcsik (2011) presents the first large-scale correspondence study of discrimination against gay

men in the United States, which includes some unique and potentially valuable features. First, it looks at

variation in whether there is a law barring discrimination based on sexual orientation (looking at the seven

states the study covers, as well as city and county laws). Second, Tilcsik examines the association

outcomes and state-level measures of attitudes towards gays. Third, the study uses text from ads to identify

those requesting stereotypically male traits, to see if gays are less likely to get callbacks for these ads –

presumably because of more feminine stereotypes, although Tilcsik does not manipulate the resumes to

generate variation in masculinity among applicants. 78

        The study finds a lower callback rate for gay applicants – 7.2 percent, versus 11.5 percent for

straight applicants. Tilcsik’s multivariate analysis suggests that anti-discrimination laws may reduce

discrimination, although the evidence does not uniformly point in this direction, and Tilcsik is asking a lot

of the data with only seven states. There is also some evidence that public support for gay rights is

associated with less discrimination, although it is hard to untangle this from the effect of laws that are

passed. The evidence also suggests that gays were less likely to receive callbacks from employers with ads

listing stereotypically male traits.

        There are two other field experiments on discrimination based on sexual orientation in the United

States. Bailey et al. (2013) used triplets of resumes with a straight male, a straight female, and a gay or

lesbian applicant (with sex alternating). And Mishel (2016) studied women only. Both studies used

gay/lesbian/LBGT organizational leadership or membership to indicate sexual orientation. Bailey et al.

found no discrimination against gay or lesbian applicants, whereas Mishel found significantly lower

callback rates (by about one-third) for lesbian/queer women.

        Ahmed et al. (2013) conducted a correspondence study in Sweden of discrimination against both


78
  To do this, ads have to be matched to specific callbacks from employers. In Neumark et al. (2015) we discuss the
difficulties of doing these matches for phone responses. Tilcsik does not indicate how this problem was handled.




                                                        66
gays and lesbians. This study signals sexual orientation via volunteer work in an organization, and there

was no manipulation of gender identity. The authors focus on many occupations, and, interestingly, find

evidence of discrimination against gays only in male-dominated occupations, and against lesbians only in

female-dominated occupations. This evidence may imply that discrimination based on sexual orientation

depends more on gender stereotypes than on sexual orientation per se, although that may be more true in a

country like Sweden with less negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians than other countries (and indeed

the overall evidence is weaker than in other countries).

        Finally, Drydakis’ (2014) correspondence study for Cyprus also focuses on both gays and lesbians.

The methods and findings are similar to his studies for Greece, with regard to both hiring and potential

wage offers. A unique feature of this study is its attempt to test for statistical versus taste discrimination

via the provision, for some applicants, of additional information on grades, positive personality traits (e.g.,

efficient, organized), and reference letters attesting to work commitment, no absenteeism, etc. However,

we should keep in mind Weichselbaumer’s (2003) argument that there is no clear reason for statistical

discrimination along these dimensions for gays and lesbians, which may explain the findings that

discrimination against gays and lesbians was similar for the more- and less-informative applications.

        The experimental literature on discrimination against gays and lesbians generally finds evidence of

discrimination, although there may be less discrimination in more recent studies (see also Baert, 2014a).

Whether this has to do with study design, the country studied, or increased acceptance of gays and lesbians

is an interesting question that can only be answered by comparing similar studies over time and across

locations, although there may not yet be enough studies to draw firm conclusions.

7.7.5 Disabled

        There are a few correspondence studies of discrimination against the disabled. Ravaud et al.

(1992) sent unsolicited applications to French companies, differentiating applicants by a sentence in the

cover letter indicating that an applicant was paraplegic (i.e., in a wheelchair) as a result of an accident in

1982. Applicants were also distinguished by high or low qualifications based on education. The non-

disabled applicants were much more likely to receive favorable responses – 1.78 times more likely for the



                                                       67
higher-qualified applicants, and 3.2 times more likely for the lower-qualified applicants. Ravaud et al.

argue that their approach rules out the possibility that the disability they study affects productivity directly,

although it is hard to be definitive about this. In particular, they argue that the disability on which they

focus has no other interactions (by which I think they mean with other types of physical problems or

disease), and that by dating the accident to the end of general education, training would have occurred after

the disability occurred. Moreover, the applications indicated that the disabled applicants (and the non-

disabled) had a driver’s license, suggesting no concerns about this kind of mobility.

           Baert (2014b) studies disability discrimination in Belgium. The disabilities considered are

blindness, deafness, and autism. The disabilities are noted in the cover letter and the resume, along with

language about how the worker accommodates (e.g., a guide dog), and a statement that “my disability does

not make me less productive.” The disabled candidates were about half as likely to receive a positive

callback. 79 As Baert notes, it is hard to know whether to interpret the difference as discrimination, given

potential productivity differences, although he asserts that he assigned disability to occupations where

disabled workers would be equally productive, perhaps after reasonable workplace adjustments (e.g.,

accountant for blind applicants, and carpenter for deaf applicants). The author seems to have information

on the reasons employers give for positive or non-positive callbacks (which apparently is common, and

also legally obligatory in Belgium), and employers rarely point to the disability. But it is not clear that they

would honestly reveal this information. Finally, Baert also implements the correction for differences in the

variances of unobservables, using the identifying assumption that distance from the worker’s residence to

the workplace (which is significantly negatively associated with callbacks) has an equal effect for the

different groups, and reports that this correction does not alter the conclusions.

             Finally, Ameri et al. (2015) conducted a larger-scale correspondence study in the United States.

They focus on positions in accounting, and two different disabilities – spinal cord injuries, and Asperger’s

syndrome – which the authors argue would not affect productivity in this field. Information on these

disabilities was revealed in the cover letter, with all cover letters indicating volunteer work for a disability

79
     The study also focuses on the effect of a wage subsidy for hiring disabled workers.




                                                            68
organization, and the disabled applicants signaling their disability directly, along with a statement that “my

disability does not interfere with my ability to perform the skills needed in a finance environment.” The

results point to significantly lower callbacks for disabled applicants (26 percent lower, on a base response

rate to the non-disabled of 6.6 percent). The gap was larger for the more-skilled applicants, and small and

not statistically significant for the less-experienced applicants. The type of disability made little difference.

        Ameri et al. also provide evidence on the effects of anti-discrimination laws. Noting that both

disabilities are clearly covered by the (ADA), they break out results based on whether private employers

have fewer than 15 employees and hence are not covered by the ADA. Second, they explore whether

employers were in states where state disability laws extend to smaller employers. 80 A variety of analyses

confirm the apparent effect of the ADA at the 15 cutoff, but there is not consistent evidence of effects of

state laws. It is also possible that large employers can more easily accommodate disabled workers.

7.7.6 Long-term Unemployed

        After the Great Recession in the United States, unemployment durations increased, particularly for

older workers (Neumark and Button, 2014). This raised concerns of “discrimination” against the long-term

unemployed, even leading to President Obama proposing, in the American Jobs Act, to prohibit employers

from discriminating against unemployed workers when hiring. 81 These developments prompted the

extension of AC studies to the difficulties of the long-term unemployed in finding new jobs, with particular

attention paid to the question of what long-term unemployment signals to employers.

        Kroft et al. (2013) conducted a correspondence study across 100 U.S. cities. They found that

applicants with long-term unemployment spells were much less likely to receive callbacks. 82 (In a similar

study, Ghayad (n.d.) similarly documents lower hiring of those in long-term unemployment spells.) Kroft

et al. also find that while employers are less likely to call back those unemployed for a longer spell, the

stigmatizing effect of a long unemployment spell is weaker in slacker labor markets, and stronger in tight


80

                                                         69
labor markets, consistent with employers viewing long-term unemployment as a more negative signal when

it is easier to find jobs.

         Eriksson and Rooth (2014) also find that, in Sweden, fictitious applicants currently in long

unemployment spells are less likely to get callbacks. They also study the longer-term stigmatizing effect of

unemployment, and find no adverse effect on callbacks of long unemployment spells in the past, suggesting

that any negative signals or loss of skills from earlier spells are offset by more recent experience. This is a

particularly nice application of the correspondence study technique, because sorting out the effect of past

unemployment spells on current labor market outcomes poses a severe challenge of controlling for

heterogeneity, especially in models for the length of current unemployment spells.

         To be clear, the authors of these studies interpret this evidence in the context of understanding

duration dependence in unemployment spells, rather than discrimination (and as a result I do not include

the studies discussed in this sub-section in Table 3). Nonetheless, the application of the experimental

methods from the discrimination literature is interesting. And the evidence in Kroft et al. (2013), in

particular, fits to some extent into the broader issue of statistical discrimination, in that it seems to confirm

that employers have imperfect information about applicants and, in this case, use external information to

draw inferences about them. However, Farber et al. (2015), in their correspondence study of women in the

U.S. labor market, do not find evidence of lower callback rates for those with long unemployment

durations. (Kroft et al. find this effect more strongly for women than for men, while Ghayad uses male

applicants only.) Farber et al. suggest that the most likely source of the difference is that Kroft et al. cover

considerably younger ages, and for younger applicants where the work history is less informative,

employers may place more weight (in tight labor markets) on the length of unemployment duration. Yet

they also note that another recent correspondence study on unemployment durations for the United States,

by Nunley et al. (2014), focuses on relatively recent college graduates and finds no effect of unemployment

duration on callbacks.

7.8 Wages and Other Outcomes

         AC studies of labor market discrimination focus almost exclusively on hiring, as the preceding



                                                       70
extensive review demonstrates. However, much of the non-experimental literature on discrimination is

about wages, and in that literature the problem of group-related unobservables looms large. Can AC

studies leverage their ability to control for unobservables and also tell us more about other labor market

outcomes – in particular, whether wage offers or other benefits reflect discrimination? Audit studies can do

this in principle, since testers actually receive job offers. Yet very few studies have tried to capture wage

outcomes, and none have done so convincingly.

         Bendick et al. (1999) report evidence of potentially worse job characteristics offered to older testers

who received job offers, but based on very few observations. Pager et al. (2009) report some evidence of

“channeling” of black and Latino applicants, during the interview, to lower-level jobs than those for which

ads were posted. As noted above, Drydakis’ (2009, 2011) correspondence studies on discrimination against

gays and lesbians tried to get information on potential wage offers from callbacks, although it is not clear

what these mean in the context of correspondence studies, in part because not all callbacks result in a job

offer.

         Finally, note that answering the question of wages offered in AC tests is different from the question

raised by Heckman (1998) as to whether evidence of hiring discrimination necessarily implies that a

discriminatory wage gap will result, which is a question about the effect of discrimination at the market

level. It may be that the best answer to this market-level question, to date, comes from Charles and

Guryan’s (2008) work on discriminatory attitudes and wage differentials. Nonetheless, it would be useful

to know just how strongly the evidence on hiring discrimination from the large body of AC studies helps to

explain wage gaps that, in non-experimental studies, are often viewed through the lens of discrimination.

7.9 Anonymized Job Applications

         An interesting and different kind of experimental method to study discrimination in hiring is to

anonymize applicants and see if selection for interviews (and potentially hiring) is affected. This parallels

the Goldin and Rouse (2000) study of orchestras, albeit with experimentally-induced variation. This

anonymization would presumably only work for selection for interviews. While past research has indicated

that most of the discrimination seems to occur at this stage, that could change if the ability to discriminate



                                                      71
in selecting candidates for interviews was eliminated, although perhaps not if it is easier to enforce non-

discrimination in hiring from a pool of interviewees.

        Krause et al. (2012) studied economics Ph.D. applicants to a European research institute, which on

its own randomized the anonymization of demographic information before the applications went to the

hiring committee. 83 After the hiring process was complete, applicants were asked for permission to use

their data in the study; 65 percent agreed. The key result is that female applicants were more likely to be

invited for interviews in the non-anonymous sample, whereas this advantage was erased in the anonymous

sample. Taken literally, this means that there was discrimination in favor of female candidates in the non-

anonymous setting, which could not occur with anonymous applications. On the other hand, the hiring

committee was aware of the experiment, and this could have motivated them to be non-discriminatory in

evaluating the non-anonymous applications. 84 There was, however, no such pattern regarding non-Western

applications, although that may be because discrimination in this case it not as much of a social taboo

(perhaps because of the demographic composition of the research staff at the institute). 85 Regardless, at

this point this study could be viewed as providing additional confirmation of an absence of discrimination

against women from experimental methods.

        A second application of this method, to hiring of minority job candidates in France, found that

minorities fared worse under anonymization, getting a smaller share of interviews (Behaghel et al., 2015).

(The hiring gap also widens, but not as much as the interview gap.) This conclusion contrasts sharply with

the results from AC studies, although the authors suggest reasons why this experiment may give misleading

results. In this study, the French public employment service offered firms the choice of participating, in

which case they were randomized to receive standard or anonymized job applications. Among the

participating firms, those that received anonymous applications interviewed fewer minority candidates.


83
   This kind of study echoes the call in Bendick and Nunes (2012) for more experimental research on strategies to
reduce discrimination, which likely have to be undertaken by employers.
84
   Behaghel et al. (2015), discussed below, refer to this as the “John Henry” effect.
85
   Åslund and Nordströum Skans (2012) present evidence on anonymized job application procedures from non-
experimental data in Sweden, in which they find increased interviews and job offers for women, but only increased
interviews for ethnic minorities.




                                                        72
The authors suggest that this happens because, under anonymization, negative characteristics of job

applicants, which are more likely to be associated with minority group membership but that firms might

downweight for minorities, have a larger effect than when minority status is revealed. They find evidence

consistent with this interpretation, based on ratings of applicants in both treatments that they obtained from

counselors from the public employment service. 86

        Behaghel et al. note that the firms that agreed to participate were similar on most observables,

except that they hired more minorities. When they joined the study, then, those that received anonymous

applications may have been unable to continue preferential hiring of minorities. Under this interpretation,

extending anonymization to all employers would have ambiguous effects, depending on to what extent the

non-participating employers engage in discrimination against minorities, and to what extent anonymization

prevents this. 87 The considerations raised here suggest that while anonymization of resumes is potentially

promising as a research strategy, it will need to avoid experimenter effects. At this point, the far greater

body of research on discrimination using AC studies provides more convincing evidence. By the same

token, from a policy perspective, I would caution against concluding, yet, that anonymization of resumes

will not reduce discrimination; the results could well differ in other contexts.

                              8. Conclusions and Directions for Future Research

What Have We Learned from this Vast Body of Experimental Research on Labor Market Discrimination?

        We have learned that for most groups for which non-experimental data on wages is consistent with

labor market discrimination, much of the experimental research provides confirming evidence of hiring

discrimination. This is most evident with respect to race and ethnicity, perhaps because there is so much

more evidence.88 There is also pervasive evidence consistent with discrimination gays, criminals, and the


86
   An alternative explanation is the John Henry effect mentioned above, whereby the controls change their behavior to
avoid appearing discriminatory, which the treatments cannot do because their job applications are anonymous. The
authors suggest they can rule this out based on no difference in behavior among the controls during the experiment
and after, when they are no longer being observed. It would be better to have data from before and during the
experiment, because the experiment could have a residual effect.
87
   This same issue arose in the Agan and Starr (2016) study discussed above, where restricting information on criminal
background seems to have increased statistical discrimination against blacks.
88
   Recall, however, the finding that evidence of race and ethnic labor market discrimination sometimes weakens
substantially when the estimates are corrected for bias from different variances of the unobservable (Neumark and




                                                         73
disabled. In addition, the experimental research points to hiring discrimination against groups for which

the prima facie evidence (most notably, for wages) does not point to discrimination – in particular, lesbians,

and older workers (at least older women).

        The audit and correspondence study evidence on sex discrimination provides an interesting

exception. Despite a great deal of non-experimental evidence consistent with sex discrimination, the

experimental research does not give a clear indication that women are treated less favorably in hiring

decisions. Indeed, the evidence appears to point more to discrimination against women in some jobs and

men in other jobs, in a manner that helps replicate the existing sex segregation of jobs. If this is in fact

what happens, it poses a bit of a puzzle for labor economists, since our models of discrimination do not

naturally predict this pattern. Perspectives on discrimination from other fields, such as those emphasizing

norms regarding who does which job, might fit these facts better. And the experimental evidence does not

necessarily imply that the unexplained wage gaps between men and women do not reflect discrimination.

What Are the Policy Implications?

        Overall, though, this review reinforces the conclusion that hiring discrimination is pervasive. This

may be in part because, even with aggressive anti-discrimination laws such as in the United States, it is

hard to root out discrimination in hiring. Enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in the United States

relies on the legal process, and hence on potential rewards to plaintiffs’ attorneys. In hiring cases it is

difficult to identify a class of affected workers, inhibiting class action suits and thus substantially limiting

awards. In addition, economic damages can be small in hiring cases because one employer’s action may

extend a worker’s spell of unemployment only modestly. (Terminations, in contrast, can entail substantial

lost earnings and benefits, and, for older workers, significant lost pension accruals.)

        What does this evidence, and these considerations, imply for policy? First, if discrimination along

the hiring dimension is particularly hard to root out, the evidence of hiring discrimination may not carry

over to other labor market decisions (e.g., pay, promotions, and layoffs). Thus, the evidence in this review


Rich, 2016). Additional approaches to the Heckman critique may therefore prove instructive in sharpening our
interpretation of this evidence.




                                                        74
should be taken primarily as posing the challenge of how to reduce hiring discrimination.

        More substantively with respect to policy, the pervasive evidence of discrimination in hiring,

coupled with reasons to believe the current enforcement mechanisms may be inadequate, may have a few

important policy implications. First, we may need to consider policies to reduce hiring discrimination that

are less reliant on attorneys and plaintiffs, and perhaps more proactive rather than reactive. Affirmative

action is of course such a policy, but in the United States its scope is limited to federal contractors.

        Second, if it is true that hiring discrimination is particularly impervious to enforcement via private

lawsuits, the EEOC and state Fair Employment Practices agencies may have to do more to focus their

resources on discrimination in hiring. On this score, it is noteworthy that the EEOC’s most recent strategic

enforcement plan (for 2013-2016) lists, as its first priority, targeting “class-based recruitment and hiring

practices that discriminate against racial, ethnic and religious groups, older workers, women, and people

with disabilities.” 89 This has been interpreted a change in EEOC policy that will increase the focus on

hiring patterns and reduce the focus on individual claims of discrimination 90 – exactly what may be needed

to better root out discrimination in hiring.

        Finally, the appropriate policy response to statistical discrimination is likely quite different from

the response to taste discrimination. Although current law makes both types of discrimination illegal, the

law is very much focused on the cost approach that seems to directly target taste discrimination, as opposed

to perhaps considering other policies mandating how screening and evaluation of candidates is done that

might reduce statistical discrimination with reduced reliance on ex post enforcement and the courts. An

example is recent “ban-the-box” policies that eliminate the collection of information on criminal

background at the earliest screening stage, which can be interpreted as encouraging employers to rely less

on this cheap screen at the outset, and instead to evaluate the candidate – including his or her criminal

record – at a later stage when the employer also has other information. Affirmative action policies may

also act in this fashion, reducing reliance on cheap screens like race (Holzer and Neumark, 2000; Miller,

forthcoming). 91 At the same time, the anonymization studies caution that removing group identifiers from

applications – which may seem like an intuitively appealing way to eliminate discrimination – can cut

against these efforts. And if we add implicit discrimination to the mix, the best policy response may be

different still.

What Are the Important Questions for Future Research?

         There are open questions about precisely what we learn from the experimental evidence on some

groups, which probably revolve mainly around the question of “is the differential treatment

discrimination?” This arises most sharply, I think, with respect to research on those with a criminal

background, and the disabled, who – for very different reasons – might be viewed as having different

productivity. With regard to the disabled, further progress on this question likely requires incorporating

more information on the relationships between specific disabilities and productivity.

         Many papers using experimental methods to study labor market discrimination have tried to extend

their results to uncover the nature of discrimination. This is a critical question, as it can inform how both

policymakers and employers might respond to reduce discrimination. More work is needed to pin down

compelling tests, and to replicate these results across studies. In particular, I have explained why I find

many studies trying to distinguish between statistical and taste discrimination less than convincing, because

we do not know – to paraphrase Senator Howard Baker’s famous question at the Watergate hearings –

“what does the employer know, and when does he know it?” 92 But that should be taken as a challenge to

come up with more compelling tests, perhaps by supplementing field experiments with survey or interview

evidence on what employers know, what information they use, what assumptions they make, etc., and how

this changes during the recruitment, interview, and hiring process. This strategy parallels recent work such

as Rooth (2010) in incorporating supplemental information on participants in field experiments. This is not

91
   Both of these studies present evidence that affirmative action is associated with firms investing more in screening,
training, and evaluation of employees, including once they begin work. Miller argues that this helps explain his
finding that the relative rate of black hiring at firms bound by affirmative action continued to increase after they
became bound (because of federal contractor status).
92
   There is some quite compelling evidence of statistical discrimination in other markets (e.g., Castillo and Petrie,
2010; Laouenan, 2015; List, 2004), made easier in some cases because of the availability of information on learning
about market participants (as in Laouenan’s study).




                                                           76
easy, and is likely to require studies of smaller numbers of job applicants with more intensive efforts to

enlist employers in the research endeavor.

         Moreover, the evidence on the nature of discrimination that does exist is all over the map, with no

clear indication from the existing studies. There is some evidence that supports each of the three central

explanations of discrimination (taste, statistical, and implicit), some evidence against both statistical and

taste discrimination, and a number of places where conclusions drawn in support of one of these

explanations may not be well founded. This is likely a reflection of two things. First, all three types of

discrimination may matter, and perhaps differently for different groups. There may, for example, be more

taste discrimination against groups whose “otherness” is most pronounced (say, Middle Eastern

immigrants), and more statistical discrimination against groups with well known but hard to predict

differences (e.g., women of childbearing age). Second, distinguishing among the competing explanations

is simply difficult.

         Researchers have frequently noted that audit and correspondence studies have somewhat limited

scope – applying only to certain segments of the labor market, excluding some common channels of job

search, etc. But there has been virtually no work trying to understand what these limitations might mean,

or how we might expand the boundaries of experimental studies to reduce these limitations. Can we do

more to figure out the role of the kinds of on-line job applications now used in field experiments in the

overall job search of workers, perhaps in part by exploiting cross-country differences in reliance on

government employment offices versus more private search? With changes in the technology of how

people search for jobs, can we expand the types of jobs covered? Can social media be harnessed to

improve these studies? (Alternatively, does the ability to use social media and other information

technology to check credentials and identities undermine future field experiments? 93)


93
  If, for example, a correspondence study uses minority applicants with high credentials relative to the population,
employers may be more likely to try to verify these credentials for minorities, and failing to do say may be less likely
to call them back, leading to an overestimate of discrimination. In their study of race, ethnicity, and criminal
background, Pager et al. (2009) set up voicemail boxes to see if employers checked references. Almost none did (four
employers out of 350 that were tested). This finding may not generalize, perhaps especially with respect to higher-
skilled jobs when the stakes may be higher for employers, and more information available. That said, these methods




                                                          77
         And what about the other side of the market? How important is the kind of hiring we study relative

to the hiring employers do, and does the behavior these experiments study accurately capture a large extent

of the hiring that at least these same employers – not to mention other employers – do? In general,

researchers doing field experiments on labor market discrimination might consider how to assess the

representativeness of the results from these experiments, and try to extend such experiments into a more

diverse set of jobs and job search methods.

         The focus on the application and hiring stage in field experiments on discrimination typically

precludes gathering evidence on other types of discriminatory behavior – perhaps most importantly pay.

There have been a few recent efforts to try to incorporate information on pay-related outcomes into field

experiments, but nothing like proceeding all the way to final wage offers in an audit study. A recent

experimental study of race discrimination in consumer markets goes all the way through to transaction

prices (Doleac and Stein, 2013). However, that study could consummate the actual transactions, so there

presumably was not a problem of getting human subjects approval. It is an open question whether an

institutional review board would currently approve even a standard audit study (as opposed to a

correspondence study), let alone one that extended the interview process to try to settle on pay.

         Finally, I find the research on policy interventions to reduce discrimination intriguing, even if the

two field experiments discussed (Krause et al., 2012; Behaghel et al., 2015) are so far discouraging in

suggesting that women or minorities did worse following these interventions. The contexts studied – a

research institute that may have been engaging in affirmative action, and an employment service into which

there may have been self-selection of firms – may have been unique, and more evidence from run-of-the-

mill employers would clearly be of value. Alternatively, the research strategy of using field experiments

before and after broader policy changes may prove informative, although requiring some serendipity in the

timing of such studies.

         Based on these considerations, if I were advising a highly ambitious graduate student who wanted

have rarely been used to study high-skilled jobs. Nonetheless, the evidence available thus far indicates that at least for
the kinds of studies generally conducted, concerns that AC studies might be invalidated because of employers having
more access to information to check on the resumes may be largely unfounded.




                                                           78
to do a significant audit or correspondence study, I would discourage them from simply doing another

study of differential treatment in hiring between two groups – even if they were groups that have not been

studied much. Such a study would, to a large extent, provide another data point in a field where I think we

know where most data points are going to lie – although such work can play a role in advocacy or even

litigation on behalf of such groups. Rather, I think the important gains are going to come from embedding

an AC study in a research project that is going shed additional light that helps us understand the findings,

whether concerning the nature of discrimination, the implications of the experiment for the broader labor

market, or perhaps how policy variation or other differences impact the discrimination these experiments

are intended to measure.
