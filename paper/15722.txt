                                                ABSTRACT

I analyze the effects of a program that pays both 11th and 12th grade students and teachers for passing
scores on Advanced Placement exams on college outcomes. Using a difference-in-differences strategy,
I find that affected students of all ethnicities attend college in greater numbers, have improved college
GPAs, and are more likely to remain in college beyond their freshman year. Moreover, the program
improves college outcomes even for those students who would have enrolled in college without the
program. I also find evidence of increased college graduation for black and Hispanic students suggesting
that late high-school interventions may confer lasting positive effects on students, and may be effective
at improving the educational outcomes of minority students. The finding of enduring benefits when
extrinsic motivators are no longer provided is important in light of concerns that incentive-based-interventions
may lead to undesirable practices such as “teaching-to-the-test” and cheating.

         College matriculation and completion rates for low-income and ethnic-minority students
in the United States are much lower than those for affluent whites.1 These disparities are
sobering because much of the differences in wages between whites and minorities can be
attributed to differences in skills prior to labor market entry (Neal and Johnson 1996).2 While
there are differences in college going across groups, much of the gaps in educational attainment
across sociodemographic groups occur among those who enter college but do not persist
(Adelman 1999, Bowen and Bok 1998, Jencks and Phillips 1998).3 Because academic
preparedness is key to college success (Tinto 1993, Kalsner 1991) policies that improve
scholastic ability of low-income and ethnic-minority students before college entry may reduce
these differences in college enrollment and college persistence across groups.
         Early educational interventions have been found to have large effects on adult outcomes
(Currie 2001, Deming 2009) and some argue that that remediation of inadequate early
investments is difficult and costly (Cunha and Heckman 2007, Cunha, Heckman and Lochner
2006). However, if academic underperformance is a result of some economic inefficiency (such
as imperfect information, student myopia, suboptimal teacher or student effort), late
interventions that alleviate such inefficiency could be very cost effective. While there are
numerous programs aimed at high school students with the aim of increasing college-going and
readiness, rigorous evaluations of these interventions on college outcomes are lacking.4 Because
students often self-select into college preparation programs, most studies on the efficacy of pre-
college interventions on college success are largely descriptive.5
         In this paper I analyze the effects of a high-school intervention that includes cash
incentives for both teachers and students for each passing score earned on an AP exam, teacher
training, curricular oversight, and test-prep sessions on students college outcomes. The

   Using the August 2006 Current Population Survey, I find that 71 percent of white high-school graduates or GED
holders between the ages of 25 and 29 ever enrolled in some college program. The corresponding figures are 60 and
52 percent for blacks and Hispanics respectively. The share of entrants who have earned an AA or BA degree for
these same groups are 68% for whites, 51% for blacks and 53% for Hispanics.

   Cameron and Heckman (2001) and Belley and Lochner (2007) find that long-run factors associated with family
environment such as parental education account for most of the differences in college-going across ethnic groups.

  It is well documented that the majority of college attrition occurs in the first year - so that persistence through the
first year is a key predictor of subsequent college success (Brawer 1996, Horn 1998, Bradburn 2002).

   For example, evaluations of the GEAR UP program have looked at the effect on college aspiration, but not on
actual college outcomes. Source: http://www.gearupdata.org/GearUpEvaluation.cfm.

   There are two notable exceptions. Using random assignment, Seftor, Mamun and Schirm (2009) find no effect of
Upward Bound overall, but provide some evidence of increased postsecondary enrollment and completion for
students with low educational expectations. Also using a randomized design Kemple and Willner (2008) find that
career academics improved the labor market outcomes of young men.

level data, Jackson (2010) finds that the APIP increases AP participation, improves SAT and
ACT performance and may increase college enrollment. The rich student-level data employed in
this study allow me to account for student selection, and tests for the underlying mechanisms ─
providing a more conclusive analysis. Moreover, this study builds on Jackson (2010) by
analyzing the effect of the APIP on important longer-run college outcomes.
         I investigate how the APIP, which affected 11th and 12 grade students, affected (1) their
college attendance (2) sophomore year college persistence (3) college GPA and (4) college
completion. I link Texas high-school data to administrative Texas college records ─ allowing me
to compare the college outcomes of students exposed to the APIP to those of students not
exposed to the APIP, if they attended college in Texas.7 Because the administrators of the APIP
did not roll out the program to all interested high-schools at once, there is variation in the timing
of APIP adoption within the sample of interested schools. This allows for a difference-in-
difference strategy ─ comparing the change in outcomes between observationally similar
students from the same high-school before and after APIP adoption to the change in outcomes
across cohorts from other high-schools that did not adopt the APIP over the same time period.
Comparing cohorts from the same high-school removes (1) the differences in unobserved
attributes that make one student take AP courses while another does not and (2) the differences
in unobserved attributes that make students from certain schools more likely to excel at college
than others. Using changes at similar schools over the same time period as a comparison removes
the effects of state policies and influences that may coincide with adoption at some schools.
         While the identification strategy removes several sources of bias, there are three
remaining endogeneity concerns. The first is that APIP adoption may be endogenous. To address
this, I limit the sample to schools that ever adopt the APIP, with similar levels of motivation. The
timing of adoption within this sub-sample is determined by the idiosyncratic preferences and

 These data also allow me to account for selection to college, a source of bias in many studies on the pre-college
determinants of college success (Breland 1979, Camara and Echternacht 2001).

availability of private donors. Supporting this assertion, I show that outcomes change after
adoption, conduct falsification tests on other school and principal inputs, and show that the
results are robust to including school-specific trends. The second concern is that students may
select to schools. I address this in three ways. First, I define “intention to treat” based on
enrollment in 10th grade rather than actual enrollment in 11th and 12th grade. Second, I show that
the results are robust to eliminating students from non-feeder middle-schools, and making
inferences within students who attended both the same middle- and high school. Lastly, I show
that there is little empirical evidence of selective migration. The last concern is that with Texas
college data only, shifting from out-of-state to in-state colleges as a result of the APIP would
look like improved outcomes. To address this concern, using National Student Clearinghouse
data I show that APIP adoption increases in-state, but not out-of-state, college going. In sum, I
am reasonably confident that the estimates presented reflect a real causal effect.
        While secondary school interventions may improve contemporaneous student outcomes
and increase college-going8, there are a variety of reasons why such schemes may not improve
outcomes after students enroll in college. First, improvements in outcomes may reflect test-
taking effort so that the contemporaneous gains in test scores may not persist.9 Second, marginal
college enrollees may subsequently fail or drop-out if they are not sufficiently college ready.
Third, improved AP performance could come at the expense of other important unrewarded
skills. For incentive-based interventions, such as the APIP, some psychologists argue that
external rewards can supplant intrinsic motivation, such that performance may be worse after
incentives are removed than if they had never been introduced.10As such, it is important to study
the longer-term effects of high-school interventions such as the APIP.

8
  Angrist and Lavy (2010) find that student incentives improve outcomes for girls, and Lavy (2009) and Figlio and
Kenny (2007) find that teacher incentives are associated with contemporaneous improvements in achievement for all
students. Angrist, Lang and Oreopoulos (2009) find that cash rewards for academic achievement lead to higher
GPAs for females. Berry (2009) finds that performance incentives given to children improve educational outcomes
when children have low initial test scores. Also, Dynarski (2008) and Scott-Clayton (2008) study the incentive
effects of grade-contingent scholarships among college students.
9
  There is evidence that test scores can be boosted “artificially” by providing performance incentives on the day of
the exam (Braun and Kirsch 2008) or giving students calorie rich meals before an exam (Figlio and Winicki 2005).
Also, Glewwe, Ilias and Kremer (2003) find that students did not retain the test score gains associated with teacher
cash incentives, while Bettinger (2009) finds a similar lack of persistence over time for student cash rewards.
However, Kremer, et al. (2004) find that gains associated with a merit scholarship program for girls in Kenya
persisted, and Angrist, Lang and Oreopoulos (2009) find that females offered cash rewards for academic
achievement had higher GPAs that persisted after the rewards were provided.
10
   This notion is discussed in Deci and Ryan (1985) and has been popularized in Kohn (1999). For a balanced meta-
analysis of this literature see Cameron and Pierce (1994).

                                                         4
           I find that affected students took and passed more AP exams, and enrolled in college in
greater numbers─ consistent with Jackson (2010). Moreover, conditional on college enrollment,
affected students had higher grades and increased persistence. Improvements were relatively
larger for black and Hispanic students and I find suggestive evidence that affected black and
Hispanic students were more likely to graduate with a four-year degree. I show that these
graduation results are unlikely to reflect faster time to degree. While the short-run outcomes
were similar across schools (as in Jackson 2010), the long-run college effects were largest in
schools with established AP programs before APIP adoption (and had little AP course
expansion) and schools with high-powered incentives ─ suggesting that increased supply of AP
courses was not the driving mechanism, and that increased teacher and student effort are
important aspects of the program's success. Also, the program effects grow over time, indicating
that the non-incentive aspects of the APIP are important. Guidance counselors credit increased
AP participation to increased encouragement from teachers, better student information, and
changes in teacher and peer norms ─ consistent with the APIP reducing suboptimal decisions.
           These findings indicate that both maintaining high standards, and increasing participation
in rigorous high-school programs can improve college readiness. The results suggest that
incentive programs that include resources to turn increased effort into achievement may have
lasting positive effects even after rewards are no longer provided. These findings also contribute
to the debate on early versus late interventions as they show that an inexpensive program
targeted to high-school students is effective at increasing educational attainment.
           The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the APIP
program. Section III presents the theoretical framework. Section IV presents the data. Section V
discusses the empirical strategy. Section VI presents the results, specification and robustness
tests, shows that the results cannot be driven by changes in out-of-state college going, and
presents evidence on mechanisms. Section VII concludes.


II.        Description of the AP incentive program
           AP courses are common in US high schools and are typically taken by students in 11th
and 12th grade. The courses are intended to be “college level” and most colleges allow successful
AP exam takers to use them to offset degree requirements.11 The fact that selective colleges pay

11
     While this is true in general, some highly selective colleges only allow students to use AP credits to pass out of

                                                             5
attention to a student’s AP scores in the admissions process demonstrates that the exams are
considered to be revealing about a student’s likely preparation for and achievement in college.
The AP program has 35 courses and examinations across 20 subject areas. The length of a course
varies from one to two semesters. The cost per examination is $82 and a fee reduction of $22 is
granted to those students with demonstrated financial need. AP exams are administered by the
College Board, making teacher cheating unlikely. Exams are graded from 1 through 5, where 3
and higher are regarded as a passing grades. AP courses are taught during regular class time and
generally substitute for another course in the same subject (AP Chemistry instead of 11th grade
science for example), for another elective course, or a free period. While AP courses count
towards a student’s high school GPA, they are above and beyond what is required for high
school graduation. As a rule, AP courses substitute for less demanding activities.12
         The APIP is run by AP Strategies, a non-profit organization based in Dallas, and is
entirely voluntary for schools, teachers, and students. The heart of the program is a set of
financial incentives for teachers and students based on AP examination performance. It also
includes teacher training conducted by the College Board and a curriculum that prepares students
for AP courses in earlier grades. The APIP uses “vertical teams” of teachers. At the top of a
vertical team is a lead teacher who teaches students and trains other AP teachers.13 Vertical
teams also include teachers whose grade precedes those in which AP courses are offered. For
example, a vertical team might create a math curriculum starting in 7th grade designed to prepare
students for AP calculus in 12th grade. In addition to the AP courses taught at school, there may
be extra time dedicated to AP training. For example, the APIP in Dallas includes special “prep
sessions” for students once or twice a year, where up to 800 students gather at a single high
school to take seminars from AP teachers as they prepare for their AP exams (Hudgins 2003).
         The APIP’s monetary incentives are intended to encourage participation and induce effort
in AP courses. AP teachers receive between $100 and $500 for each AP score of 3 or over
earned by an 11th or 12th grader enrolled in their course and can receive discretionary bonuses of
up to $1,000 based on results. In addition, lead teachers receive between $3,000 and $10,000
annual salary bonus, and a further $2,000 to $5,000 bonus opportunity based on results. While
the amount paid per passing AP score and the salary supplements are well defined in each

prerequisites, but not towards regular graduation credit.

school, there is variation across schools in the amounts paid. Overall, the APIP can deliver a
considerable increase in compensation for teachers.14
        Students in 11th and 12th grade also receive monetary incentives for performance. The
program pays half of each student’s examination fees so that students on free or reduced lunch
would pay $15 (instead of $30) while those who are not would pay $30 (instead of $60) per
exam. Students receive between $100 and $500 for each score of 3 or above in an eligible subject
for which they took the course. The amount paid per exam is well defined in each school, but
there is variation across schools in the amount paid per passing AP exam. A student who passes
several AP examinations during their 11th and 12th grades can earn several hundred dollars. For
example, one student earned $700 in his junior and senior years for passing scores in AP
examinations (Mathews 2004). Since students must attend the AP courses and pass the AP
exams to receive the rewards, students who did not take the AP courses would not take the
exams in an attempt to earn the cash rewards. This aspect of the incentives makes them relatively
difficult to game and likely to increase overall student learning.
        The total cost of the program ranges from $100,000 to $200,000 per school per year,
depending on the size of the school and its students’ propensity to take AP courses. The average
cost per student in an AP class ranges from $100 to $300. Private donors pay for between 60 and
75 percent of the total costs, and the district covers the remainder. Districts pay for teacher
training and corresponding travel, release time and some of the supplies and equipment costs.
Donors fund the cash rewards to students and teachers, stipends to teachers for attending team
meetings, bonuses to teachers and administrators for AP performance, and some of the supplies
and equipment costs. Today, districts can fund their contribution to the APIP using earmarked
funds from the statewide AP incentive program and No Child Left Behind. However, in the first
few years of the program such funds were not available.
        As a rule, adoption of the APIP works as follows. First, interested schools approach AP
Strategies and are put on a list.15 AP Strategies then tries to match interested schools to a donor.
When a private donor approaches AP Strategies, he or she selects which schools to fund from


14
   One AP English teacher in Dallas had 6 students out of 11 score a 3 or higher on the AP examination in 1995, the
year before the APIP was adopted. In 2003, when 49 of her 110 students received a 3 or higher, she earned $11,550
for participating in the program; this was a substantial increase in annual earnings (Mathews 2004).
15
   There are a few exceptions. Schools in Austin were approached by the donor to adopt the APIP in 2007. Also, five
schools in Dallas secured a donor before approaching AP strategies.

within the group of willing schools. In most cases the donor wants a specific district.16 Once a
willing group of schools has been accepted by the donor preparations are made (such as training
and creation of curricula) and the program is implemented the following calendar year.17 It takes
about two years to fully implement the APIP after a school expresses interest. Donors choose the
subjects that are rewarded and ultimately determine the size of the financial rewards. While there
are differences across schools, most schools reward English, mathematics and sciences.
        There is variation in the timing of the introduction of the program across schools that I
exploit to identify the effect of the program. As illustrated in Figure 1, there are 58 schools that
adopted the APIP by 2008 (56 of which were early enough to have college outcomes). Because
donor preferences determine the schools that will adopt the program in any given year, among
interested schools donor availability and preferences are the primary reasons for variation in the
                                            18
timing of program implementation.                To quote the Vice President of AP Strategies, “Many
districts are interested in the program but there are no donors. So there is always a shortage of
donors.” I argue that the exact timing of program adoption, within the group of willing schools,
is orthogonal to changes in potentially confounding school characteristics. I test this assumption
empirically in section VI and show that it is likely valid.


III.    Theoretical Framework
        In this section I provide a theoretical framework within which think about how the APIP
may affect AP course and exam taking, college going, and subsequent college performance.

   For example: The first ten Dallas schools were chosen based on proximity to AP strategies; ST Microelectronics
is located in the Carrolton-Farmers community and funded this district’s schools; The Priddy Foundation
specifically requested the Burkburnett and City View schools; anonymous donors specifically requested Amarillo
and Pflugerville schools; The Dell foundation (headquartered in Austin) funds the Austin and Houston programs;
The remaining Dallas schools were funded by the O’Donnell foundation to complete the funding of Dallas ISD.
17
   The seven schools to adopt the APIP in 2008, however, decided to have the pre-AP preparation portion of the
program in place for at least a year before the rewards were provided.
18
   For example, in 2005 four high-schools were chosen by The Michael and Susan Dell Foundation from a list of
seven willing Houston schools. The remaining three schools may adopt the program at a later date.

III.2    Effect on College Going: Because the APIP likely increases the number of AP exams
students pass, these students may be more desirable candidates and would therefore be more
likely to be admitted to college. Also, students can earn scholarships based on their AP
performance and can obtain college credit for passing AP scores ─ reducing the direct costs of
college attendance and therefore increasing enrollment. While the APIP should increase college
going, conditional on applying for college, the APIP could affect students’ college application
decisions for two reasons. First, because the APIP provides information to students about the
benefits to taking APs, the program may provide a signal that college is attainable and important
such that affected students are more likely to apply. Second, the decision to attend college is an
investment under uncertainty. One of the potential benefits of the APIP is to expose students to
college-level material, thus providing information to students about the desirability of college
and their likelihood of success in college.19 If students are pessimistic/optimistic about their
chances of success at college, the APIP may lead them to adjust their expected costs and benefits
of attending college so that they may be more/less likely to apply.20 In sum, the total effect
reflects a combination of the effect on college application behaviors and the effect on being

19
   This idea is similar to Costrell (1993), who models the information value of matriculating in college to learn ones
suitability. He argues that this could explain the low college completion rates among certain populations.
20
   Findings by Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2009) suggest the latter is more likely. One implication of this
information story is that changes in college application behaviors may reflect an optimal response to new
information – such that reductions in the likelihood of applying to college need not be a bad outcome per se.

admitted to college conditional on applying. While the APIP should increase the college going of
college applicants, the total effect on college going is ambiguous in sign.
III.3    Effect on College Performance: The APIP increases student exposure to more rigorous
material either through (1) increased AP participation, (2) increased effort in AP courses, or (3)
by improvements in the quality of AP courses. As such, the APIP could have positive effects on
college outcomes even with no increase in AP participation. The APIP should increase student
knowledge, which should be associated with improved academic outcomes. All else equal, if the
APIP only affects students through these three mechanisms, APIP exposure should be associated
with improved college outcomes. I refer to this as the human capital mechanism.
         However, the APIP may not improve student college outcomes: First, there is evidence
that test scores can be improved by increasing test taking effort (Braun and Kirsch 2008), having
a good meal (Figlio and Winicki 2005) or gaining familiarity with the test. As such, the increase
in AP exams passed may not reflect increased knowledge so that APIP students may not perform
any better in college than non-APIP students while in college. Second, a psychology literature
suggests that students may be sapped of their intrinsic motivation as a result of being exposed to
monetary incentives (Kohn 1999, Deci and Ryan 1985, Cameron and Pierce 1994)., so that APIP
students may actually perform worse in college than students who were never offered rewards.
Third, improved AP performance may come at the expense of other important skills if teachers
teach-to-the-test or students neglect their non-AP courses. Fourth, the APIP may make students
overly ambitious such that they apply to more difficult programs than they would otherwise and
have worse outcomes as a result. That is, the APIP could lead to a sort of “mismatch”21 between
students and colleges that may ultimately lead to worse outcomes.22
         In sum, while a human capital explanation suggests that the APIP would improve college
outcomes, the APIP could lead to worse outcomes so that the overall effect of the APIP on long-
run college outcomes is an empirical question.


IV.      The APIP Schools and The Data
         To show how APIP schools differ from other schools in Texas, I present school level
21
   Under the “mismatch” hypothesis students who wouldn't ordinarily be admitted to selective schools may be
                                                                                                                    .




inadequately prepared, so that they would fare better at schools better matched to their preparation (Summers 1970)
22
   This mismatch hypothesis is counter to the information story – such that affected students are more likely to make
sub-optimal college going decisions.


                                                         10
summary statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics and the Texas Education
Agency (TEA) in Table 1. Schools that were selected for the APIP were different from schools
that have not been selected and may never be selected for the APIP. The APIP schools had
average enrollments during 2000 through 2005 of 1836 students compared to 751 students for
non-APIP schools in Texas. During these years, 74 percent of the APIP schools were in a large
or mid-sized city compared to under 20 percent for non-APIP schools. During these years, only
25 percent of students at APIP schools were white compared to 53 percent for non-APIP schools,
and 10 percent of students were limited English proficient at APIP schools compared to less than
4 percent for other schools. Both groups, however, have similar shares of economically
disadvantaged students, reflecting the fact that Texas has both urban, and rural poor.
         The regression data used combines student records from every public tertiary institution
in Texas23 between 1995 and 2010 and every private institution in Texas between 2003 and
201024 from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board with student-level high-school and
middle-school data (including standardized 10th grade test scores that all students must take by
state law) from the TEA for the years 1994 through 2007. AP exam data come from the College
Board. 25 The standardized test scores are normalized and standardized to be mean zero with unit
variance for each test administration. For each student, I use the most recent administration of
the test (i.e the year directly preceding expected exposure to the APIP).26 The final dataset
contains college outcomes, high-school, and middle-school data of all students who were in 10th
grade between 1994 and 2007. Using the population of 10th graders allows me to account for
attrition that may take place after APIP exposure in 11th and 12th grade.27
         I present the pre and post APIP adoption summary statistics for the schools that will have
adopted the APIP by 2008 (note: schools adopt the APIP at different times so that the pre-
adoption years differ across schools). About 22.9 percent of students who were in 10th grade


23
   In Texas there are 145 institutions of higher learning. Of the public institutions, there are 35 universities, 50
community colleges, 9 health related institutions, 4 technical colleges and 3 state colleges. On the private side, there
are 39 universities, 2 junior colleges and 3 heath related institutions.
24
   Because private school data are only available after 2003, I have run all models using only those cohorts that
would have expected high school graduation after 2003 and the results are largely the same.
25
   TAKS (1994-2003) and TASP (2003-2007).
26
   The 10th grade retention rate was about 7% in Texas in 1995, among minorities this figure is over 10 percent.
http://www.tea.state.tx.us/reports/1996cmprpt/04retain.html
27
   For example, if the APIP caused student to drop out of high school in 11th grade before the 11th grade enrolment
data are collected, then using the population of 11th graders at will yield results that suffer from attrition bias. Basing
all estimates on the population of 10th graders before potential exposure to the APIP avoids such bias.

                                                            11
during the pre-adoption years took an AP course while in high school compared to 30.4 percent
in the post adoption period. There were similar increases in AP examination taking where those
in 10th grade during the pre-period took 0.097 exams and those in the post period took 0.127
exams during their high school career. The 10th grade math and reading standardized scores
were below zero for both periods─ indicating that the APIP schools were low achievement
schools on average. Also, these scores were slightly lower after adoption than before - suggesting
possible negative selection into APIP schools.
        The average student before adoption was in 10th grade in 1999 compared to 2003 for the
post adoption sample. As such, variables that increase with age such as college attendance and
completion are difficult to compare without directly taking age into account (as is done the
regression analysis). However, to allow for a simple comparison, I compute enrolment by the
time since expected high school graduation. About 35, 46, and 53 percent of 10th graders in the
pre-treatment cohorts were a freshman in college within 1, 2, and 3 years of expected high school
graduation respectively. The 10th graders in post adoption cohorts were more likely to attend
college such that 41, 50, and 56 percent of 10th graders in the post-treatment cohorts were a
freshman in college within 1, 2 and 3 years of expected high school graduation, respectively.28
The implied sophomore year persistence (the share of students who were sophomores divided by
the share who were freshmen) is 0.53 and 0.544 for the pre- and post-adoption cohorts,
respectively.29 Comparing figures for ever being a freshman to the enrolment figures above
reveal that 59, 79, and 89 percent of college going occurs within one, two and three years of
expected high-school graduation, respectively. Because analyzing enrolment within four years of
expected high-school graduation ignores enrolment that occur after four years (one tenth of the
variation), I analyze eventual enrolment and control for cohort differences directly.


V.      Empirical Strategy
        Before presenting the identification strategy, In section V.1, I discuss methodological
concerns facing this and similar studies and I present my proposed solutions. In section V.2, I
present the identification strategy and discuss the source of plausibly exogenous variation.

28
   Texas has the second largest and well developed community college system in the United States so that a sizable
share of these students enroll in 2-year colleges.
29
   The sophomore variables are not computed for the 2007 cohort, because they would be freshman in 2010 if they
enrolled directly after expected high-school graduation. Also, college graduation variables are only computed for
cohorts before 2004 because subsequent cohorts would not typically have graduated from a 4-year college by 2010.

                                                        12
V.1     Methodological Issues: Because the APIP affects students in 11th and 12th grade, it
affects the characteristics of students while still in high school so that one must compare students
who were similar before exposure to the APIP. As such, I compare the outcomes of students with
similar attributes before exposure to APIP from the same high-school and do not control for
potentially endogenous covariates such as SAT scores or high-school GPA. 30
        Other important methodological issues are the choice of population and how the
outcomes are defined. If the APIP increases college going, the population of college students
who were exposed to the APIP may have worse outcomes merely because APIP-exposed
students will have a higher proportion of marginal (and likely less well-prepared) college
attendees. Using the sample of college attendees leads to sample selection bias. To avoid this, I
compare the outcomes of all potential college students. Basing the estimates on prospective
college students allows one to uncover the true causal effect, but introduces the methodological
issue that changes in outcomes such as sophomore year persistence and GPA may reflect effects
through increased college enrolment and effects due to changes for students who would have
enrolled in college absent the APIP (effects conditional on college entry).
        While it is impossible to identify those who would have attended college absent the APIP
I use three approaches to estimate of the effect of the APIP conditional on college entry. The first
approach is to impute outcome values for students who do not enroll in college. Specifically, I
predict freshman year GPA and sophomore year enrollment as a function of observable pre-
treatment characteristics and use the predicted values for those who do not enroll in college. The
second approach is a control function methodology. Specifically, following Angrist (1995) I use
the sample of college enrollees, while controlling for the estimated likelihood of attending
college (estimated using the full sample).31 The third approach is to trim the data following Lee
(2002) to obtain a lower-bound estimate of the effect for those who would have enrolled in
college absent the APIP.32
        The final methodological issue is how treatment is defined. Because students may enroll
                                                                                                        (

31
   I estimate a probit model of attending college on all control variables and obtain an estimated propensity.
32
   One estimates the proportion X of the treated group that attends college because of the APIP. Under the extreme
assumption that the marginal enrollees have the best outcomes, one ranks the treated sample by the outcome and
removes the top X percent of the treated sample. Estimates using the trimmed sample of college enrollees will yield
a lower-bound estimate of the effect conditional on enrolling.

at APIP schools in 11th and 12th grade to benefit from the program, defining treatment based on
actual school enrollment in 11th and 12th grade could be subject to self-selection bias. To avoid
such bias, I use intention-to-treat instead of whether a student is actually affected by the APIP.
Specifically, I define intention-to-treatment (ITT) based on whether a student would be treated if
they remain in their 10th grade high school and are never held back a grade. For example, a
student is intended for treatment if they are enrolled at a school in 10th grade in year t, and the
school will have adopted the APIP by year t+2. The benefit of using ITT is that it is not
endogenously determined by student selection into APIP schools in 11th and 12th grade, or
subject to biases due to attrition or retention.33 Using ITT yields a clean policy-relevant estimate
of the effect of introducing the APIP on the target population.
V.2      Identification Strategy: The identification strategy is to compare the difference in college
outcomes across cohorts of students who attended the same high-school before and after APIP
adoption to the difference in college outcomes between cohorts of students at schools that did not
adopt the APIP over the same time period. Comparing students from the same high school
addresses the concern that students at schools that adopt the APIP may differ from students who
attend schools that do not adopt the APIP. By comparing cohorts, as opposed to students within
cohorts, I address the concern that certain types of students tend to take AP courses and exams
for unobserved reasons while others do not. Furthermore, by comparing the college outcomes of
students with the same 10th grade test scores and demographics, I address the concern that the
incoming preparation of students may have changed in APIP schools after adoption of the
program. Finally, this approach helps to account for potentially confounding statewide policies.34
         This strategy relies on the assumption that the difference in outcomes across cohorts for
comparison schools is the same, in expectation, as the difference in outcomes across cohorts that
adopting schools would have experienced if they had not adopted the APIP. For this to be
plausible, the comparison schools must be similar to APIP adopting schools. To ensure that this
is the case, I restrict the estimation sample to those schools that had adopted the APIP by 2008 –
using the change in outcomes for other APIP schools that did not yet have the opportunity to
implement the program as the counterfactual change in outcomes. This sample restriction has

33
   The downside of this measure is that it will not capture the full effect of the treatment on the treated since (1)
students who leave APIP schools after 10th grade will not be treated but will be intended for treatment, (2) students
who enter APIP schools after 10th grade will be treated but will not be intended for treatment, and (3) retained
students, who should have graduated before APIP adoption, will be treated but will not be intended for treatment.
34
   For a description of such policies see the Appendix Note 2.

                                                          14
two important benefits: (1) because APIP willing schools are observationally similar, they likely
share common time shocks and (2) because APIP willing schools are similarly motivated and
interested, restricting the sample in this way avoids comparing schools with motivated principals
to schools with unmotivated principals who have no interest in the program.35
        Because I do not compare schools that adopt the APIP to those that do not, using a within
school estimation strategy controls for school selection on unobserved time invariant
characteristics such as time-constant school enthusiasm or motivation. Identification relies on the
assumption that the timing of APIP implementation is exogenous to other within-school changes.
Since the timing of actual adoption relies on idiosyncratic donor preferences and availability, this
assumption is plausible. However, because donor choices are not random, I cannot entirely rule
out that the timing of adoption is uncorrelated with changes in school characteristics. As such, to
assuage concern that timing of adoption may be endogenous, I identify those schools where
donors had prior relationships and verify that all the main results are robust to excluding these
schools.36 Also, in section VI, I show that improvements only take place after APIP adoption,
and the timing of adoption is unrelated to other school changes or the timing of the arrival of a
new principal - suggesting the assumption of exogenous timing of adoption is valid.
        This within-school cohort-based comparison is implemented by estimating the following
equation by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).
                                                      4

In [1], Yich is the outcome of student i in 10th grade cohort c, from high school h. X i is a matrix

Ai is a vector of student achievement scores from 10th grade. To control for differences in
student attributes across high-schools, changes in performance over time, and differences in

35
   Some schools adopt the APIP after 2007 and are therefore never treated in-sample for the purposes of analyzing
college outcomes but serve as comparison schools. The results are similar (albeit less precise) when using only
schools that adopt the APIP in-sample so the findings are not driven by the particular choice of comparison schools.
36
   For a detailed discussion see Appendix Note 1.

intention to treat year. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the school level.
       It is important to point out that a simple before/after comparison likely understates the
full effect of the APIP because the first affected cohort (ITT year=1) is exposed to the two-year
program for only one year. As such, the first cohort to receive the "full treatment" is the second
cohort (ITTyear=2). Because there are likely learning-by-doing effects, and it may take time for
the AP program to mature, outcomes may continue to improve beyond the second cohort. As
such, I estimate dynamic treatment effects in addition to a simple before and after comparison.
To identify the dynamic APIP effect, I use four binary variables denoting the first, second, third,
and fourth plus intention-to-treatment years. For example, the first ITT cohort for a school has
ITT year=1 and the 3rd ITT cohort for a school has ITT year=3, so that ITT year denoted how
long the APIP had been in place when the student was expected to graduate from high school.
For example, if the APIP was adopted in school h in the 2002-03 school year, the 10th grade
cohort for the school year 2000-01 would be coded as ITT year=1, while the 10th grade cohort
for the school year 2002-03 would be coded as ITT year=3).


VI.    Results
VI.1   Graphical Evidence: Before showing the regression results, it is helpful to present some
visual evidence. Figure 2 shows the results of estimating a flexible version of equation [1], where
I estimate effects for both pre-adoption years and post adoption years. For each outcome, I plot
the estimated coefficients of ITT years -5 through 4 (the first year of adoption is year 0). For AP
course taking, AP exam passing, and freshman year enrollment, there is a clear increase after
APIP adoption. However, there is some visual evidence of upward trends in AP course taking
and college enrollment (I test for trending formally below). For the longer-run outcomes,
freshman year GPA, sophomore year enrollment, and sophomore year persistence (being a
sophomore conditional on ever being freshman) there is clear visual evidence of improved
outcomes after APIP adoption and little evidence of pre-existing trends. The improved outcomes
conditional on college entry are evidence irrespective of how one accounts for sample selection.
       To test for trending formally, I test the null hypothesis that the pre-adoption year effects
differ from the first pre-adoption year, and I fail to reject at the 5 percent level for all outcomes.
In contrast, for all outcomes, the test that the post-adoption years differ from the year prior to
adoption is rejected at the 1 percent level ─ statistical evidence of an APIP effect (including

                                                  16
conditional on college enrollment) that is not driven by underlying trends. Moreover, in section
VI.4, I show that the main findings are robust to including school-specific linear trends.
VI.2   Effects on AP outcomes and college enrollment: Table 3 presents the regression results
for AP outcomes, and college enrollment. In the top panel, I report the coefficient on the simple
before/after adoption indicator and in the lower panel I report the coefficients on the first,
second, third and fourth plus intention-to-treat years. For AP course taking (column 1) a there is
a statistically significant 0.165 increase (about a 21 percent increase) in year three, but a
statistically insignificant 7.4 percent increase in year four and beyond. Even though the simple
before/after coefficient is not statistically significant, the null hypothesis that all the dynamic
APIP effect are zero is rejected at the 5 percent level ─ indicating that the APIP does increase
AP course taking. Columns 2 and 3 show that the increases AP exam taking and passing and that
this effect increases over time. The adoption indicator and all the ITT treatment year dummies
are statistically significant and by the fourth year the APIP is associated with a 0.098 increase
(about a 100% increase) in the number of AP exams taken, and a 0.043 increase (about a 45%
increase) in the number of AP exams passed. The increases are primarily in the English and
Science AP exams (Appendix Table 4). It is important to point out that the APIP may affect
unmeasured outcomes (such as aspirations or self-confidence) that could affect college outcomes
but may not be reflected in these AP outcomes. As such, while these AP effects are important,
they may not measure all of the APIP effects and should therefore not be used to scale the effects
on college outcomes as if it were a "first stage".
       Columns 4,5, and 6 show the effect on the likelihood of ever being a freshman in any
college, a two-year college, and a four-year college, respectively. The before/after comparisons
show that the APIP increases college going by about 4.2 percentage points on average and that
this is driven by both two-year and four-year college going. The dynamic effects show that the
effect of the APIP increases over time, so that by the fourth year of the APIP college going
overall increases by 4.8 percentage points (an 8 percent increase), four year college going
increases by 2.8 percentage points (a 16 percent increase) and two year college going by a
statistically insignificant 2 percentage points (a 5 percent increase). Also, there were small




                                                 17
statistically insignificant increases in college selectivity among college goers (not shown).37
        Because the outcomes analyzed are using Texas college data, it is important to ensure
that increased college enrolment does not reflect shifting of college going from out-of-state to
in-state. I test this directly using data from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) for the
10th grade cohorts of 2005 and 2006. These data measure college enrollment both at in-state and
out-of-state colleges and universities. Because I only have NSC data for two cohorts, I can only
estimate effects for the first and second ITT cohorts. The results in columns 7 and 8 show that by
the second ITT year the APIP increases in-state college going by 3.5 percentage points
(significant at the 5 percent level) but has no effect on out-of-state college going (a point
estimate of -0.0001 that is not close to statistical significance in the second ITT year). These
results are similar to those obtained using the THECB data (for all years and also for these two
cohorts) thus validating the college going numbers from the THECB data and showing that the
enrollment effects measured in this study reflect real increases in college going and are not
confounded with changes in out-of state college going.
IV.3    Effects on Freshman GPA: In columns 1 through 3 of table 4, I present the effect on
Freshman year GPA conditional on college enrollment. In models of college enrollees that
include the estimated propensity scores to account for selection to college (column 3), treated
cohorts had freshman year GPAs that were 0.03 points higher (significant at the 10 percent
level). This GPA effect increases over time so that GPAs were 0.067 points higher in the fourth
treated cohort than in untreated cohorts (significant at the 5 percent level). Using all students and
imputing GPAs for non-enrollees (based on observable characteristics) yields a before/after
effect of 0.015 points (significant at the 5 percent level), and a fourth year effect of 0.031 grade
points (significant at the 1 percent level). I also implemented a trimming procedure to obtain a
lower bound effect. However, the lower-bound effect is large negative, and therefore
uninformative and not presented in the table. To shed further light on how much of the APIP
effect is driven by the extensive margin (college entry) as opposed to the intensive margin (GPA
conditional on enrolling in college), in Figure 3, I present the coefficient on the simple post
adoption indicator variable using the full sample under different imputed GPA values for those
who do not attend college. If one assumes students who do not enroll in college would have

37
  I linked the college identifiers for college enrollees to the mean SAT scores of admitted students from IPEDS.
Treated cohort attended colleges with slightly higher SAT scores. The increase in the 25th percentile of combined
math and reading SAT scores was 32 points (not statistically significant).

                                                        18
received a GPAs of 0, 1, and 2 (an F, D, and C average, respectively) then the before/after effects
would be 0.048, 0.034, and 0.021 grade points, respectively. If one makes the unrealistic
assumption that non-enrollees would have had the same GPA as those who did enroll (2.3 about
a C+ average) the adoption effect would be 0.017 grade points (significant at the 5 percent level).
In fact, the 95 percent confidence interval of the estimated APIP effect to includes zero for all
assumed values below 2.7 (a B- average), the point estimates are positive until an assumed GPA
of 3.6 (an A- average), and is essentially zero (-0.006) if one assumes that non-enrollees would
have had a 4.0 (straight As). Figure 3 shows that under reasonable assumptions of what the
GPAs would have been for non-enrollees, APIP exposure is associated with improved freshman
year GPAs conditional on college enrollment.
       To provide a sense of where in the achievement distribution these improvements in
freshman GPA might come from, Figure 4 presents cumulative densities of the freshman GPA of
treated and untreated cohorts. It is evident that there are slight improvements in GPA for treated
cohorts below the 40th percentile (GPA between 0 and 2), but that the 40th through 90th
percentiles are clearly higher in the treated group (corresponding to GPAs between 2 and 4). This
suggests that much of the improved GPAs came from student between the 40th and 90th
percentile of the achievement distribution in college who would have had averages between a C
and an A- without the APIP.
IV.4   Effect on sophomore year enrollment and persistence: Most college attrition occurs in
the first year so that persistence through the first year is a key predictor of college success. In
Table 4 I present the effect on being a college sophomore and persisting to sophomore year
(enrolled as a college sophomore conditional on ever being a college freshman). Column 4
shows the results for the full sample, and columns 5,6,7 and 8 show the results conditional on
college enrollment with no sample selection correction, with propensity scores, with imputed
values for non-enrollees, and the lower-bound trimming effect, respectively.
       APIP adoption is associated with a 3 percentage point increase in ever being a college
sophomore on average, and a 6 percentage point increase for the fourth ITT cohort and beyond.
All estimates of the effect conditional on college enrolment yield pooled adoption effects of
about 2.5 percentage points and fourth year effects between 5.5 and 8.6 percentage points (all
significant at the 1 percent level). Given a base persistence rate of 52 percent, these increases
represent increases between a 10 and 17 percent. The results that trim to top GPA earners in the

                                                19
treated sample for a lower-bound effect yield a statistically insignificant pooled effect of 1
percentage point, but a 6.6 percentage point increase by year four (significant at the 5 percent
level). These results show real increases in sophomore year attendance, due, in large part, to
increased persistence for those who would have enrolled in college absent the APIP.
       Another way to obtain a lower-bound persistence effect is to make the extreme
assumption that all the marginal freshman enrollees would persist to sophomore year (Dynarski
2008). The average persistence rate is 0.52 so this is unlikely. The fourth year freshman and
sophomore enrollment effects are 4.8 and 6 percentage points, respectively. If all the marginal
enrollees would have persisted, this leaves 6-4.8 = 1.2 percentage points that must be due to the
non-marginal students. As such, even under the lower-bound assumption, the APIP increases
college persistence conditional on college enrolment by at least 2.3 percent by year four. A more
realistic, but still conservative, assumption is that the marginal student would persist at the same
rate as the average student. Under this assumption 4.8*0.52= 2.5 percent may be due to marginal
enrollees, so that 6-2.5=3.5 percentage points is due to the infra-marginal students (yielding a 6.7
percent increase in sophomore year persistence conditional on enrolling).
Timing of the Enrollment effect: Readers may wonder if these enrollment effect merely reflect
that the APIP causes students to enroll in school sooner. To assess this, I analyze enrollment
within 1,2,3 and 4 years of expected high school graduation in Table 5. If the effects were due to
students enrolling in school sooner rather than later, one would see stronger effects on
enrollment close to high school graduation and no effect within longer time horizons. For
example, if students attended college within one year of high-school graduation rather than two
or three, one would see effects on "ever a freshman within 1 year of high-school graduation" but
would see no effect on "ever a freshman within 4 years of high-school graduation". The effects
on freshman enrollment and sophomore enrollment grow as one looks to longer time horizons,
which is exactly what one would see if the effect reflects increased college going overall, and is
inconsistent with the results being due to shifting to earlier college entry. This also indicates that
much of the increased college going occurs after four years after expected high school
graduation, so that analyzing short run college going would miss an important part of the story.


VI.5   Threats to Validity and Endogeneity Concerns: While I am careful to compare cohorts
within the same school to avoid self-selection within a cohort and selection across schools, and I

                                                 20
limit the estimation sample to only the APIP schools that are of similar motivation, there are a
few remaining endogeneity concerns regarding whether the estimates reflect a true causal
relationship. I address these in this section.
The timing of APIP adoption may be endogenous. There is the concern that schools that had an
increase in motivation were more likely to apply to have the APIP implemented. The APIP takes
about two full years to be implemented after a school expresses interest. As such, if the results
merely reflected changes in school motivation that coincided with expressing interest in the
APIP, one should see an improvement in outcomes two years prior to adoption. There is no
visually evidence of this and I fail to reject the null hypothesis of improvements in outcomes
before adoption. As a direct test of the "timing of interest" hypothesis, I regressed the outcomes
on the two-year lag of adoption. This yielded very small coefficient estimates and p-values larger
than 0.4 for all outcomes.
         To provide further evidence that the timing of APIP adoption is exogenous, I predict
having a new high school principal as a function of whether program will be adopted in 3 years,
2 years, 1 year, or was adopted in the same year. These models include school fixed effects and
year fixed effects only. In each of these 4 regressions (shown in appendix Table 4) the p-values
associated with the null hypothesis of no systematic relationship is larger than 0.2. I also estimate
a specification similar to equation (1) and find no effect on subsequent principal turnover
(Appendix Table 6). This is consistent with assertions that timing of adoption is idiosyncratic,
and suggests that adoption is likely exogenous to changes in schools over time.
High-ability, motivated students may self-select into APIP schools after adoption. Another
concern is that these improvements are the result of motivated students self-selecting into
secondary schools that adopt the APIP.38 If there were positive selection driving the results, the
APIP should be associated with characteristics associated with better outcomes. To test for this I
predict the main outcomes as a function of observable student characteristics before APIP


38
   This is a potential problem because there is the possibility of selective migration. While none of the treated
districts allow students from outside the district to enroll, the large urban school districts in Texas (Dallas, Houston,
and Austin) practice intradistrict choice where students have the option to attend their neighborhood school, or
another school in the district (including magnet and charter schools) subject to space limitations at the receiving
school. Because Houston and Austin schools do not adopt the APIP until 2007, this only poses a problem for Dallas
schools. To further ensure that selective migration does not drive the results, I estimate the APIP effect without
Dallas schools and the results are similar. In is also worth noting that under No Child Left Behind, students
attending a Title I school designated as "in need of improvement" have the right to attend a higher-performing
school in the district. However in most districts the APIP school are the lower performing schools.

                                                           21
adoption. I then regress the predicted outcomes on the adoption indicator variables, school
effects, and year effects. If there were selection on observable characteristics, APIP adoption
would have an effect on these predicted outcomes. For all the predicted outcomes the point
estimates are close to zero and the p-value associated with the hypothesis that the adoption year
variables are correlated with the predicted outcomes are above 0.4 (Table 6).39 To assuage any
concerns that the results are driven by controlling for selection I show that results that that
exclude student controls (Appendix Table 1) are similar to those in Table 3.
There may be selection in unobserved dimensions. To ensure that the results are not driven by
selective migration on unobservable characteristics I estimate equation [1] while including
indicator variables for each middle-school by high-school combination. Students that self-select
into high school because of the APIP, will come from middle schools that are not the natural
feeder middle schools for the APIP schools (if they were, there would be no need to select). I can
avoid comparing the outcomes of students who do self-select to APIP schools from non-feeder
middle schools to those of students who attended the natural feeder middle schools and did not
self-select by making inferences based on the within middle-school-by-high-school variation.
That is, only compare the outcomes of students who attended the same middle school and the
same high school so that variation in treatment cannot arise from differences in students'
potentially endogenous choice of school. Furthermore, I remove all students who attended
middle schools that sent fewer than 300 students to any given APIP high school during the
sample period. This removes almost all potential for bias from student selection. The results
(Appendix Table 1) are similar to the results in Table 3─ again, suggesting no selection.
APIP schools were already on a trajectory of improvement before adoption. The visual
evidence shows and the test for pre-existing trends indicate that the results are not driven by
underlying trends. However, it is instructive to see that the results are robust to including high-
school trends. I augment the main estimation model to include both a high-school specific
intercept and a linear time trend for each high school (Appendix Table 1). While less precise,
the estimates are similar to those in Table 3 with the exception of AP course taking, where the
estimated effect is larger with the inclusion of a linear time trend for each high-school.
The benefits of the APIP are driven by general improvements in schools. One may wonder if

39
  I also present effects on individual covariates in columns 1 through 6 which indicate that treated cohorts had lower
10th grade test scores, were less likely to be low income and less likely to be Hispanic. While there are these
differences, overall treated students had very similar predicted outcomes as untreated students.

                                                         22
the benefits to the APIP are driven by improvements in or increased effort in the AP program, or
due to other school-wide changes (such as better inputs, or change in teaching philosophy) that
might have been affected by APIP adoption. If improved outcomes are driven by improved AP
instruction, increased AP participation, or both, one should see large effects for students who
take AP courses and little effect for students who do not. I test this by comparing the effect of the
APIP on students who are ex-ante (based on pre-adoption characteristics) likely and unlikely to
take AP courses (Figure 5).40 While one cannot reject the null hypothesis of no adoption effect
for those with estimated likelihood below 0.33 at the 10 percent level, there are large statistically
significant APIP effects for students with estimated likelihood above 0.66. This suggests that (a)
the benefits of the APIP are experienced by AP students and (b) the estimated effects are not
driven by other confounding changes at schools.
         As an additional test, I look at the APIP effect on school-level outcomes that should not
be affected by the APIP as a falsification exercise. Appendix Table 5 shows the effect of APIP
adoption on high-school graduation, teacher turnover, total school expenditures, the number of
teachers, teacher experience, and average class size. By the fourth year of APIP adoption the
only outcome for which there is a statistically significant effect is the number of AP teachers -
consistent with an expansion of the AP program. For all other outcomes, there is no significant
effect, suggesting that the estimated effects are not due to general improvements in schools.
VI.5     Effects by Gender and Ethnicity. In light of a literature showing larger positive treatment
effects for females than for males (Kling, Liebman and Katz 2007, Jackson 2009, Hastings, Kane
and Staiger 2006, Angrist, Lang and Oreopoulos 2009, Angrist and Lavy forthcoming), one

                                             As such, I estimate equation [1] with the inclusion of

interactions of the ITT year indicator variables with "female", "black", "Hispanic", and "other-
ethnicity" indicator variables. I report the adoption variables and their interactions in Table 8.
         In general the estimated effects are larger for females than for males, however these
differences are not large. Of the 10 outcomes analyzed, only for two of them does one reject the

   I estimate a probit model of the likelihood that a student takes at least one AP course based on all observed pre-
treatment covariates. I then put those with estimated propensities higher than 0.66 into the highly likely group and
those with estimated propensities below 0.33 in the low propensity group.

college graduation for the students who were in 10th grade before 2003. These students are old
enough to have graduated from a 4-year college by 2010. An implication of this data truncation
problem is that I may confound reduced time to degree with increased college completion.
However, I present evidence that this is likely not the case so that this truncation bias is likely to
attenuate the estimates and understate the effects of the APIP on graduation.
       Columns 1 and 2 of Table 9 presents the main specification where the outcomes are
graduating with any degree, graduating with any degree within 4 years, and graduating with a
bachelors (BA) degree. I present results for all students in the top panel, and also black,
Hispanic, and white, separately in the lower panels. The results in the top panel show that the
APIP has no effect on the graduation variables, on average. However, the results broken up by
ethnicity reveal that while there are no graduation effects for whites, treated black and Hispanic
students were more likely to earn a bachelors degree (one can reject the null hypothesis of no
adoption effect at the 5 percent level for both groups). For black students, the first and third
APIP cohorts are 1.8 percentage points more likely to earn a BA degree than those who were not
exposed to the APIP, while the effect for Hispanic students increases monotonically with
program age. By the fourth year of the APIP Hispanic students are 2.5 percentage points more
likely to earn a BA degree. These increases represent a 20 and 31 percent increase for black and
Hispanic students, respectively. The large effects for Hispanics are striking given the lack of a
college enrollment effect─ indicating that this effect is all conditional on college entry.
       To assess whether these effects reflect decreased time to degree rather than increased
degree attainment overall, I analyze the effect of earning a degree within 4 years of expected
high school graduation. As with the enrollment effects, if the effects were due to black and
Hispanic students earning degrees faster, one would see stronger effects on this variable that only
measures degree receipt close to high school graduation. That is, the effects would increase as
we look at degree receipt within shorter time horizons and disappear as one looks to long time
horizons. There is no effect on earning a degree within four years for any group ─ showing that
the degree effect is not driven by students being more likely to graduate on time. In fact one has
to look seven years out to find effects on graduation similar to those for the ever earned a BA
degree variable. To provide further evidence that this graduation effect reflects increased
persistence and more completed schooling (rather than shorter time to degree), I look at total
credits earned and total credits earned within four years of expected high school graduation.

                                                 26
Again, there are larger positive effects on total credits earned than on credits earned within four
years of expected high school graduation ─ further evidence that the effects are due to increased
schooling rather than reduced time to degree. As a final check, I look at junior year enrollment
and junior year enrollment within four years of expected high school graduation. The pattern is
the same; all groups have modest increases in junior year enrollment within four years and larger
effects on ever enrolling as a junior ─ further evidence that the effect are due to increased
schooling rather than reduced time to degree. To assuage any lingering concerns that these
findings are due to differential trends by ethnicity, I estimated models with school-specific trends
by ethnicity and the results are qualitatively similar.42
VI.8    Evidence of the Mechanisms: Having established that there is an effect of the APIP, in
this section, I try to shed light on the underlying mechanisms with a variety of empirical tests.
Are the improvements driven by increased supply of AP courses and sections? It is natural to
wonder whether the improved outcomes were driven by merely an increase in the availability of
AP courses and sections. To speak to this question I analyze the APIP effect on schools that had
above the median number of AP sections before 1996 (schools that had no statistically
significant growth in the number of AP sections after adoption) and those that had below the
median (schools that experienced a statistically significant 150 percent increase in AP sections
offered by the fourth adoption year). If the benefits of the APIP were solely due to an increase in
the supply of AP sections one would expect large effects in the high growth schools and small
effects in the low growth schools. Exactly the opposite is true. There are small improvements in
college outcomes for the high growth schools and large improvements for the low growth
schools (Figure 5) ─ indicating that increases on AP course supply do not drive the results.
Are schools/teachers/students motivated by the incentives? If better resource utilization (caused
by the monetary incentives) drives the success of the APIP, and effort is proportional to the size
of the rewards, schools that paid higher powered incentives would have better outcomes than
those that did not. To test this, I compare the adoption effect for high power schools (paid
between $101 and $500 per exam) and low powered schools (paid $100 per exam) in Figure 5.
While the effect on AP exam passing is similar across these school types (as found in Jackson


42
   For visual evidence Appendix Figure A1 shows the evolution of the graduation and junior year enrollment for
black white and Hispanic students. The F-tests on pre treatment years yield p-values 0.21, 0.36, and 0.09 for white,
Hispanic and black students respectively, suggesting some possible trending only for black students.


                                                        27
2010), for all college outcomes, the effects are larger in the high-power schools. This suggests
that the monetary incentives, and the increased effort they induced, were an important
component of the success of the program.
How important are the non-incentive aspects of the program? The improved curricula in earlier
grades, teacher training, curricular oversight, vertical teams, and college counseling could all be
partially responsible for the success of the APIP. Because the first cohort is only exposed to the
APIP for one year, the first cohort to have the full incentive component of the APIP is the second
treatment cohort. As such, if the effects are driven by incentives alone, the effects would be the
same in the second year as all subsequent years. For most outcomes this is not the case,
suggesting that there is learning by doing or the other components of the APIP that would take a
few years to take effect (such as improvements in earlier grades, or changes in norms) are central
to the effects. One can test for improvements in earlier grades by looking at the incoming 10th
grade test scores. The results in Table 4 show that incoming test scores are slightly lower after
adoption than before, suggesting that improvements in incoming academic preparedness is not
the driving force. This suggests that learning-by-doing and changes in school culture are the
likely explanation for the increases in the APIP effect over time.
IV.9   Discussion: The large increases in AP participation are difficult to reconcile with the
full-information full-rationality models of the schooling decision, and are more consistent with
there being sub-optimal effort on the part of teachers and/or students or a large increase in the
supply of AP courses. Guidance counselors at three different APIP high schools in Dallas
indicate that there were school-wide campaigns to increase participation in AP courses after
APIP adoption. At two of the three high schools an additional guidance counselor was hired to
improve the school’s ability to identify those students who should be encouraged to take AP
courses. At all three schools, the guidance counselors were given explicit instructions to identify
those students who should be taking AP courses and to encourage AP participation. A large part
of this campaign involved providing information. Guidance counselors and AP teachers sold the
AP program to students who were interested in going to college, citing the scholarships one
could earn based on AP scores, the tuition one could save by graduating at an accelerated pace,
and the potential increase in high school GPA, which could increase the student’s likelihood of
being in the class’s top ten percent and gaining admittance into a good college. Guidance
counselors mentioned a shift in student and teacher attitudes toward AP courses such that AP

                                                28
courses are no longer considered only for the very brightest of students.
       The tests above suggest that increased supply of courses was not the driving force behind
the AP participation response or the improvements in college. The fact that the effects are larger
in the high incentive schools, suggests that providing additional supply and removing barriers to
taking AP courses alone would not lead to success, but that increased student and teacher effort
is an important component of the story. The fact that the effects grow over time suggest that the
program aspect emphasized by guidance counselors such as information and outreach (that
schools will have gotten better at over time) are also important. The body of evidence indicates
that all aspects of the program are important and that providing cash incentives to students or
teacher alone, or providing teacher training alone, or expanding the AP course offerings alone,
would not have yielded the same results as the full intervention.


VII    Conclusions
       Using a carefully selected of group of comparison schools within which APIP adoption is
likely exogenous, I find that students who were affected by the APIP were more likely to
matriculate in college (with no effect on out-of state college going), had higher GPAs, and were
more likely to persist beyond their freshman year. These improvements were due both to
increased college enrolment and improvements in college outcomes for those students who
would have enrolled in college absent the program. I present a variety of tests, robustness checks,
and falsification exercises that suggest that the estimates are not confounded by student selection,
school selection, pre-existing trends, changes in leadership, other coincident school policies.
       While there small differences by gender, the APIP led to larger improvements in student
performance and persistence conditional on college attendance for black and Hispanic students
than white students. Looking to college graduation, there is little evidence of an increase overall.
However, there is suggestive evidence of increased college graduation for Hispanic and black
students. This implies that programs like the APIP may be effective at reducing some of the
educational gaps that persist across ethnic groups.
       Given that I find no evidence of worse outcomes associated with the APIP, these
improvements in college outcomes were likely the result of increased exposure to rigorous
material induced by the APIP. Consistent with this interpretation, APIP adoption is associated
with increased AP course taking, AP examination taking, and the effects only exist for students

                                                29
who were ex ante likely to take AP courses. The evidence on mechanisms indicate that both the
incentive aspects and the non-incentive aspects are important. The finding that the program
confers enduring benefits on students when extrinsic motivators are no longer provided is
important for the literature on student and teacher incentives in light of concerns that incentive-
based-interventions may lead to undesirable practices such as “teaching-to-the-test” and
cheating. More generally, the lack of any documented ill-effects of the APIP, suggests that many
of the hypothesized detrimental effects of using student incentives or teacher performance pay
need not pose a large practical problem in a well designed incentive-based scheme that combines
incentives with additional recourses to help translate increased effort into results.
        To get a sense of the cost-effectiveness of the APIP, consider the following conservative
back-of-the-envelope cost/benefit calculation. The program costs about $200 per student who
takes an AP exam per year. Roughly 7 percent of 10th graders take an AP exam after APIP
adoption so the cost per 10th grader is about $14. Assuming a student is affected for two years,
this comes to $28 per 10th grader. By the fourth year of implementation, the APIP increases the
likelihood of ever being a sophomore by 6 percentage points. Under the conservative assumption
that those students only complete one additional year of school, this would lead to an increase in
the average overall years of schooling of 0.06 years. This implies that using the APIP program,
one can increase the average years of educational attainment by 1 year at a cost of about $466
per 10th grade student. For this program to not be cost effective would require the implausible
scenario that the present discounted value of an additional year of education is less than $466. As
such, this program is likely a worthwhile investment.43 Given that the large increases in AP
participation imply that low AP participation may reflect some sub-optimality, and anecdotal
evidence from guidance counselors that the increased AP participation was the result of
increased information, changes in peer norms, an reduced barriers to taking AP exams, it is not
surprising that the economic returns to the program are large. The large effects of the APIP
imply that it may be possible improve the outcomes of students by improving their decision
making and increasing access to well taught rigorous courses.

43
  To make this point more clear consider the following calculation; suppose the rate of return to an additional year
of education was one percent. For someone earning the median household income of approximately $42,000 per
year a one percent increase in wages would provide an additional $420 per year. For a worker with 35 years of work
ahead of them, at an interest rate of 10 percent, an additional $420 per year is worth a lump sum payment of $4035
today. This is so much larger than the per pupil cost of $300 that the rate of return to education would have to be
much less than one percent for this program not to be cost effective.

                                                        30
        Overall, the findings suggest that providing monetary incentives to both students and
teachers to promote increased participation and improved performance in rigorous courses in
addition to providing additional resources to support the increased efforts can lead to
meaningfully improved student outcomes. The fact that the positive effects were larger for ethnic
minority students suggests that similar program programs may help reduce some of the
educational differentials that currently exists across ethnic and socioeconomic groups. In light of
research on the efficacy of early versus late interventions, these findings are noteworthy because
they suggest that a relatively inexpensive program targeted relatively late in a student’s
educational career can increase their eventual educational attainment to a considerable degree
and likely has a high rate of return.

           Appendix Note 1: Relationships with donors

                    Given that APIP adoption was not random, readers may worry that schools could self-select into
           the APIP. Because the analytical sample includes only those schools that may have selected into the
           program and all analysis are based on within-school variation, this kind of self-selection will not bias the
           result as long as there are not changes in schools that coincide with the exact timing of APIP adoption
           [which is about two years after when selection would take place). In any case, it is important to ascertain
           the extent to which schools may have selected into the APIP. One natural question to ask is whether the
           APIP donors had previous contact with the schools. If so, it would imply that the APIP schools are those
           kinds of schools with relationships to donor organizations. However, is does not imply that the timing of
           adoption is endogenous to changes within schools. Of the schools that were treated in sample, 7 of them
           had donors for which there were previous projects.44 However, none of these schools had any coincident
           projects that would confound the APIP effects. To ensure that the results are not driven by these schools, I
           ran the main models excluding these schools and the results are unchanged. Of the comparison APIP
           schools [i.e. those APIP school that have not yet adopted), 7 of the Austin schools had relationships with
           the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation. These 7 Austin schools adopt the APIP in 2008, so they serve as
           comparison schools in my data. However, starting in 2002 there was the Advancement Via Individual
           Determination [AVID) program, Project Advance, and Project Smart in these schools. All of these
           programs are College readiness programs that would lead to an underestimate of the APIP effect [because
           these schools serve as comparison schools rather than treatment schools in these data). Again, I have
           determined that the results are robust to excluding these seven schools.
                    Another important related question is whether any of the donors were involved in other
           concurrent projects in schools that would confound the APIP effect. While the answer for most school is
           no, there is one potentially problematic donor relationship that requires some discussion. In 5 of the

             Dodge Jones Foundation in Abilene (2 in 2003); Perkins Prothro Foundation in Wichita Falls (3 in 2002); Munson
           Foundation in Denison (1 in 2004); Fourth Partner Foundation in Tyler (2 in 2002).

                                                                     48
Dallas schools that started the program in 200345, the donor offered scholarships to any student who was
accepted to college. As such, for these schools the APIP effect is potentially confounded with a financial
aid effect. To ensure that these 5 schools do not drive the main results, I have replicated the analysis
without these five schools and the treatment effects are slightly larger with these school excluded. As
such, I can rule out that the few potentially problematic donor relationships bias the results.


Appendix Note 2: Related Statewide Policies During the Sample Period.

       The Texas ten percent rule was put in place in 1997 and ensured that the top ten percent of students
from each high school in the state would be guaranteed admission to a Texas public university. One
would expect college matriculation rates to have increased in schools that have on average low
achievement, such as the selected APIP schools, even if these schools did not adopt the APIP. However,
none of the APIP schools adopted the APIP in 1997 so that the timing of adoption is not coincident with
the introduction of the new state policy. Furthermore, all the main results are robust to using only those
schools that adopted the APIP after 2000.
       The Texas statewide Advanced Placement Incentive Program was introduced in academic year
1999-2000. Under the statewide program, the state appropriated $21 million over the years 1998-2000 for
the Texas APIP, up from $3 million the previous biennium. The statewide program provides a $30
reduction in exam fees for all public school students who are approved to take the AP exams, teacher
training grants of up to $450, up to $3,000 in equipment and material grants for AP classes, and financial
incentives to the schools of up to $100 for each student who scores 3 or better on any AP exam. One
would expect this policy to increase AP participation and effort even if the APIP was not adopted by the
selected APIP schools. However all the estimated effects are above and beyond any effect from the
statewide program. [Source: Texas Education Agency Press Release: “Number of Advanced Placement
Exams Taken by Texas Students Increases Dramatically”. August 23, 2000).
