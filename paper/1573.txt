                  Exchange Rate Flexibility and
               the Transmission of Business Cycles


                              ABSTRACT




     This paper presents a very simple model of the effects of flexible

exchange rates in the transmission of business cycles. The starting

point is the traditional "locomotive" effect, through exports and

imports. Aside from this horizontal transmission, the intertemporal

exchange rate model presented here allows for the effect of future

internal shocks on home income (horizontal transmission) as well as for

the effect of future external shocks on home income (diagonal

transmission). These channels highlight the role of flexible rates and

follow from an intertemporal constraint on the trade balance.

     In the presence of foreign-held debt, furthermore, the locomotive

effect can be reversed, so that a foreign boom can cause a recession at

home. The determinants of the debt ceiling are derived.

     The model is simulated in the case of two symmetric countries with

constant values for the policy variables and the interest rates at home

and abroad.

Introduction



     As economies of similar size become increasingly open to interna-

tional trade in goods and assets, business cycles in one country are

transmitted to the others and vice-versa. Throughout the prosperous

sixties, it was well understood that the then prevailing international

economic order was generating structural as well as policy interdepen-

dence among industrial countries. But it was also thought that moving to

a system of exchange rate flexibility could decrease interdependence.

     Instead, over the last ten years, interdependence among industrial

countries has increased and it has also spread to middle-income coun-

tries. Few national economies have been insulated from external shocks.

No doubt, the global supply shocks of the 1970s, especially the oil

shocks, played an important role in the transmission process. However,

the focus of this paper is on the role of flexible exchange rates. We

analyze it first by means of a theoretical model. In the second part of

the paper, we simulate the transmission of demand shocks across countries

in a world with floating rates.

     In order to focus on the international transmission of business

cycles, we develop a model different from the standard monetary and asset

market approaches, reviewed, for example, in Jones and Kenen (1984).

While fully consistent with the emphasis on stock equilibria that charac-

terizes both approaches, the model presented below allows us to study the

transmission of business cycle across countries more directly. As in

Meerschwam (1982), a requirement of intertemporal balance of the balance

of trade is used to determine the exchange rate. Having determined the
                                   -2—




exchange rate, comparative static results can then show the effects of,

for instance, a current or expected foreign cyclical upturn on the home

economy. Hence, it will be possible to see in an intertemporal set-up

under what conditions the foreign country acts as a "locomotive" to pull

the home economy along.




1. The Model



     The interaction of goods and asset markets in the determination of a

floating exchange rate appears, in different ways, in the two popular

models of exchange rate determination. In the monetary model, perfect

goods arbitrage ensured rchasing power parity. In the portfolio model,

trade in goods determinec the long-run equilibrium level of the exchange

rate. In our presentatiot asset accumulation is tied to the basic

insight of the so-called aI.;orption approach.1

     To obtain an explicit solution for the level of the exchange rate,

we assume unitary trade elasticities. We also identify throughout real

and nominal magnitudes.. All the results can be interpretated in real

terms when prices vary. This is particularly useful when the nominal

rates happen to be fixed.



1.1 Income determination under fixed exchange rates



     The current account balance is defined as net exports plus the

 interest account:
                                         -3-




            C = eB + erF                                                (1)




                =     - life                                            (1')




where       B       is the trade balance in foreign currency

            r       is the foreign interest rate

            F       is the stock of foreign assets at the beginning of the

                 period

            e is the exchange rate (units of home per foreign currency)

            C is the current account balance in domestic currency

            I exports of the home country in foreign currency

and         M imports of the home country in domestic currency


                                 *
      Note that (1') implies that Be > 0 (unitary trade elasticities).

The effect of an exchange rate change on the current account is, given by

h +   F   rather than by , so that it will be dampened by the existence of

foreign held debt and magnified by claims on foreigners.

        The absorption approach uses the open-economy identity to note that

the current account equals the difference between income and expenditure

at home and abroad:



             CY-A-e(-A)*        J-

                                                                        (2)




where       Y() is disposable income at home (abroad)

            A(A) is absorption at home (abroad)
                                     -4-



      We specify imports and non-autonomous absorption as a proportion of

income (m and 1 - s respectively), and allow the government to fix the

current government budget deficit or surplus. In fact, we assume for

simplicity that it will move the budget in such a way as to offset the

interest account.2

where       T =    -eF   0




and         E() is autonomous expenditure at home (abroad)

        Using (1), (1'), (2), (3) and (4) (respectively (3') and (4')) in

the open economy income identity, collecting terms, and substituting, we

obtain the equilibrium level of income in both countries and the trade

balance:



                                                                   (5)




                                                                    (5')




                                                                    (6)




where          =   s + s + s is the open economy multiplier with
                   repercussion.
                                              —5—




    Equation (5) shows that higher foreign income (autonomous expendi-

ture) leads to higher domestic income through greater import demand.

Hence the foreign country can easily transmit cyclical behavior and serve

as a locomotive or brake for the home economy. The transmission mecha-

nism is quite straightforward, provided the exchange rate is exogenous.

Consider, though, the effects of a flexible exchange rate in this pro-

cess. Is it possible that higher foreign income leads to such an appre-

ciation of the exchange rate that domestic income actually falls? To

answer this question, we develop a model of exchange rate determination

that recognizes the existence of an intertemporal budget constraint.3




1.2 The intertemporal budget constraint



     Since the interest account is explicit in this model, the equality

of the current and capital accounts, in the absence of central bank

intervention, can be stated as:




          fi+F=F1-F                                              (7)




     Equation (7) shows that the flow of foreign exchange, i.e., the

current account, is reflected in the change in the stocks of foreign

assets, i.e., the capital account. Note that this identity is expected

to hold in each future period i:



          fl.
            1
                +   'F.1   = F.
                              i+1
                                    -   F.1                      (7t)
                                           -6-




     In (7'), the interest rates are assumed to be fixed. Substituting

sequentially backward into (7) and using a term structure equation for

interest rates we find that, given suitable transversality conditions:4




             1
          Z (—)     B. =   -(1   +   r)F                             (8)
                     1
         i0 1+r


     Equation (8) shows the intertemporal budget constraint. The dis-
counted value of present and expected future trade surpluses and deficits

must exactly offset the current stock of foreign assets. The intuition

behind this result is that foreign asset holdings represent purchasing

power over foreign goods: their ultimate use lies in consumption. The

balance of trade is a vehicle for intertemporal saving and consumption.

Current output claims on the future consumption of foreign goods are thus

accumulated through savings.

     Suppose that initially no foreign assets are held (F = 0).     A

country will then only be able to run a balance of trade deficit if it is

expected that future net surpluses will, after discounting, allow for

"repayment" of the debt incurred in the interim. For example, it is

expected (with certainty) that after 2 periods onward balances will be in

equilibrium but the country is currently running a deficit of size 13.

Given an interest rate, , a surplus of B(1 +     ) has   to be expected for

period I in order to observe the intertemporal balance constraint.

     Because of the intertemporal balance constraint, it is the role of

the exchange rate in this model to force the current and expected trade

balances into line. We can therefore find an equilibrium exchange rate
                                             —7—




path that allows for intertemporal balance. Since (6) is expected to

hold for each period i, we write:




            i =!
                              * E.
                       i             e.
                                                                 (6')
                                         1



      Under conditions of speculative efficiency, the exchange rate

expected in period i is linked to the current rate by the given i-period

interest rate differential:



                                 1
           e.=(
                  1+r                e                           (9)
            1       *)
                  1+r

      Substituting (9) into (6'), and using (8), we get the current

exchange rate, denoted by , which would only obtain if the present

discounted value of future trade inbalances were zero, that is to say if

F = 0.   This depends on the expected path of expenditures at home and

abroad

           e =                                                    (10)

                                              -8-




      We now allow F to differ from zero. Using the intertemporal budget

constraint (8), we obtain a relationship between the current exchange

rate and the initial stock of foreign assets as a proportion of exports.


            e=j                                                               (11)



where        4,   = (l ÷     )F/sL                                            (11')




      Equation (11) gives the outcome for the exchange rate in this model.

It shows how expected future levels of expenditure determine the current

exchange rate both via the ratio of their discounted expected paths, i.e.

via     and via 4,.

        It is seen from (11) that in order to have a well-behaved exchange

rate 4, has to exceed -1. This implies a ceiling on initial debt, F, so

that we can write:

                         e
             e=              -                                                (12)

      where- F——
               smE



        Because of the infinite horizon, the extra interest rate terni is

subsumed in [.           According to equation (12), the largest stock of initial
foreign debt allowed in the model equals the discounted value of the

largest potential intertemporal accumulation of trade surpluses.

        We can draw (12) as an hyperbola in e and F (see Figure 1). It is

clear that an increase in               will shift the hyperbola as F, its

asymptote, shifts to the left. As a result, given constant F, e will

fall as will .           Instead,     an increase in E will only affect the

curvature of the hyperbola without changing the asymptote, leading to a

rise in e and e.

     Thus the role of exchange rate in this setup is to influence the

balances of trade, current and expected, so that the sum of the discount-

ed values equals the initial stock of foreign assets. As a result, a

change in foreign income which causes one of the balances to change, will

cause an exchange rate adjustment so as to retain intertemporal balance.

It is therefore possible to analyze the effects of higher foreign income

on domestic income while allowing the exchange rate to fluctuate.




1.3 Comparative statics



     Suppose that the exchange rate is such that the balance of trade is

in intertemporal equilibrium, but that the foreign country is expected to

experience a cyclical upturn, in period j, relative to what was expected

before (L increases). With an unchanged exchange rate, the simple

effect discussed below equation (6) obtains: higher foreign income

improves the expected balance of trade for period j and is transmitted to

the home economy through higher exports for that period. Hence, if we

expect future foreign income to rise, we can also expect future domestic

income to increase.

     This "locomotive" story is not complete because, had the exchange

rate remained unchanged, the improved balance in period j would, in

combination with the unchanged other balances, violate the intertemporal

budget constraint. This implies that, in order to retain intertemporal

balance, the balances expected for periods other than j have to worsen.
                                                        —11—




Since the exchange rates for different periods are linked together by

(9), the whole path of current and expected exchange rates has to fall

(all rates must appreciate). Thus, because of the exchange rate effect,

current domestic income will fall as future foreign income is expected to

rise.

        The balance for period j is the only balance that is affected both

by the exchange rate effect (that tends to worsen it) and by the foreign

income effect (that tends to improve it). The foreign income effect

dominates in this period because, if it did not, all balances would

worsen, which would be inconsistent with intertemporal balance. The

simple locomotive story therefore provides the direction of change.

        To show the effect of expenditure changes on the exchange rate

     A proportional increase in foreign expenditure has an unambiguous

effect on the exchange rate which is dampened or magnified depending on

whether the initial shock of foreign assets is positive or

negative (i.e. 4       0). The reason for this can be seen from (6) or (6'). The

increase in L, the income effect, improves . by a certain amount,

irrespective of the level of e, which is the only endogenous variable

affected by F. The newly generated surplus has to be offset by the

effects of the induced exchange rate change in order to retain

intertemporal balance. This exchange rate effect operates only through

the foreign currency value of home imports. The level of the exchange

rate itself enters there, so that, for a certain improvement of the

balance in period i, a larger proportional (and absolute) appreciation is

needed, the lower the initial level of e. Since this level varies

inversely with the stock of foreign assets, debtor nations will experi-

ence larger absolute and proportionate appreciations than do creditor

nations (similarly the larger the stock of the smaller the appreciation).

It is easily seen from (13) that the discounted income and exchange rate

effects offset each other when dE =            0, ij and dE = 0,    all i:6

     Equation (13) also shows that the further in the future the distur-

bance occurs the lesser its impact on the current exchange rate.

Furthermore, global demand expansion (dE. =                  leaves the current

that s/rn =    /i). Given          (9), the increases in expenditure have to be

    To show the effects on the balance of trade, differentiate (6)

totally for period j and substituting for the exchange rate by using

        If c. < 1, the combined contemporaneous income and exchange rate

effect of an increase in domestic (foreign) autonomous expenditure is

negative (positive). When c. = 1, the two exactly offset each other and

there is no net effect. An increase in E() only causes an exchange

rate effect, improving (worsening) fi.. Since the sum of the discounted

values of all changes in the trade balances is zero and                            =   1, we see

trade balance will deteriorate and the others will improve. If the two

countries are symmetric all trade balances remain unchanged.




1.5 Three types of transmission



     The analysis indicates that in the transmission of cycles across

countries in a two-country setting, where both countries fully interact,

the exchange rate establishes intertemporal equilibrium and, in so doing,

transmits to the present shocks expected in the future. As a result,

expected future cyclical upswings and downturns abroad will affect

current domestic income. Aside from the "own" effect of a contemporane-

ous upturn, three kinds of cyclical transmission can be identified in

this framework. The first is the effect of an upswing abroad in period i

on home income in the same period i. In this horizontal transmission,

home income will typically rise too; the standard locomotive pulls ahead

but not as fast as usual, due to the exchange rate effect. The exchange

rate effect will not dominate unless initial foreign debt is very large.

     The second is the effect of an expected internal shock in period i

on home income in period j. Since in this case it is only the exchange

rate that matters, a future upswing will be transmitted vertically to a

current upswing. This intertemporal effect is also responsible for the

third type of transmission: expected foreign shocks in period i to home

income in period j, or diagonal transmission. This is illustrated in

Figure 2.

1.6. The reverse locomotive



     The contemporaneous effect of a foreign boom -                    horizontal   transmis-

sion -   is   only ambiguous when the domestic economy is a sufficiently

large debtor initially. The condition for the reverse locomotive effect

to obtain is 4 >             - 1.     In that case the exchange rate effect exceeds

the income effect. Using (12), we see that the reverse locomotive effect

will occur if and only          if:
                                   -18-

     As argued before, in this case the ex—ante exchange rate is at such

a high level that the relative required appreciation gives an exchange

rate effect that more than offsets the income effect. It is also seen in

(18) that, given a certain stock of initial debt, it is more likely that

the reverse locomotive operates the larger the foreign autonomous expen-

ditures during that period.'

     The intertemporal balance model can be used to study various unan-

ticipated shocks, for example, the consequences on export competitiveness

of a natural resource boom in the home country. Suppose it finds a

marketable resource (whose world price is fixed) that can only be export-

ed in period i and exports are maintained at the new level forever after.

At a given exchange rate, the higher future autonomous exports of the

home country cause an intertemporal imbalance. In order to offset the

expected surpluses, the currency appreciates. In other words: the

expectation of future revenues causes the current exchange rate to

appreciate. Since for the current period nothing else has changed, the

domestic economy will experience a drop in income. This is seen by

setting j     0 in equation (18) and interpreting i as all periods at the

new export level. The appreciating exchange rate affects export competi-
                                                                           -
tiveness and lowers current income through the export sector of the

economy.    This is sometimes referred to as the "Dutch disease".

     Before we turn to. the simulation results, it should be stressed that

other, especially interteraporal, transmission channels can be found using
                                      —19—




different models. What we showed was the simplest flexible exchange rate

model that would bring out the transmission mechanism.



2. Simulation Results


2.1. The Base Case


     We now show simulation results, which bring to the fore the central

aspects of the theoretical model. Recall that one of the strong assump-

tions made in the model is that expectations about future levels of

autonomous expenditures, both at home and abroad, are held with certain-

ty. Even though this assumption does not affect the structure of the

model, it.   allows   us to characterize the solutions in the particular form

we do.

     We also assume that the exogenous variables are expected (with

certainty) to be constant over time.8 While the model could still be

simulated, with particular paths for autonomous expenditures or interest

rates, the results presented below are sufficient for our purposes.

     In the base case, domestic and foreign interest rates are set equal

to 10%, savings propensities are 5% and import propensities are 15%. The

countries are assumed to be perfectly symmetric except for the fact that

only the foreign country can issue international assets. Given the

initial specification, the open economy income multiplier, 1/, is equal

to 57.Autonomous expenditure - denoted by E and E* -     is   set at 500 units

for a time horizon of 50 periods.9

     Due to symmetry, the spot equilibrium exchange rate which, given the

present discounted values of autonomous expenditure, intertemporally

equilibrates the trade balance when F = 0 is unity. This is clear from
                                     -20-



equation (11) above. Because there is no interest differential, the

exchange rate, and therefore the trade balance, are expected to remain

constant, see equations (9) and (6').

     In order to determine the largest stock of debt acceptable, F,

recall the condition set in equation (12). Since 4)        is   proportional to F,

4)/F is independent of the initial stock, so that the maximum debt capaci-

ty of the home country (F such that 4)      = -1)   is simply the absolute value

of the inverse of 4)/F.   In   the base case 4)/F = .00047 and F =     -2130.   The

initial stock of foreign assets runs from 2000 to the debt ceiling.

     Figure 1 above showed clearly that as the stock of foreign assets

falls, the exchange rate depreciates. The country has to "save" more on

its international accounts to make good its lost international wealth.

Recall also the asymptotic behavior of the exchange rate as the stock of

foreign debt reaches the implied maximum.

     The depreciation of. the exchange rate induces a less than propor-

tional rise in domestic income as foreign assets are reduced. Since the

exchange rate effect is the only one operating, domestic income measured

in foreign currency falls. Similarly foreign income is seen to fall.

Domestic absorption also rises as F falls, because Y rises and T becomes

a smaller negative number. This can be seen from equation (3).

     The sign of the current account is equal to that of the trade

balance: interest flows do not offset the trade adjustments needed to

maintain interteniporal balance. Fewer foreign assets thus imply smaller

trade deficits while larger foreign debts call for larger trade

surpluses.

     The sensitivity of the model to changes in exogenous variables and

parameters is reported in Table 2, which presents the results for the

initial period and when F=2000 units.'° The base case is in the first

row. In the second row, the domestic rate rises to 15%. Column (2) in

that row shows that the debt capacity of the home country, as measured by

F, is unaffected. According to equation (11'), the upper bound of debt

is determined by the largest intertemporal international accumulation of

the home country. But the value of        changes and this affects the

determination of the spot rate. As shown in column (3), it lowers         and,

given the unchanged value of ,   the   spot exchange rate falls (fourth

column). Higher domestic interest rates will therefore lead to an

appreciating exchange rate. It should be stressed here that this effect

is not the standard capital account adjustment effect often discussed.

Even though it seems that the capital account for the first period does

indeed go into significant surplus as the domestic interest rate rises

(the current account deficit goes from 1 to 64 units as shown in the

fifth column), this effect is obtained without specifying asset demand

functions. The cause of the capital account adjustment is the stock

adjustment that takes place on the asset side of the model, in order to

assure that there is zero intertemporal accumulation of foreign assets.

     The lower level of the exchange rate causes domestic income to fall,

as shown in column (6) and in equation (5). Similarly, foreign income

rises in column (7) and a large increase is seen in the foreign currency

value of home income, column (8). The effects on B are a direct result

of the exchange rate change. The domestic currency value of the trade

deficit becomes 104, column (10) the service account is in surplus at 72,

column (5), and the current account shows an initial deficit of 64 units.

     The effects of an increase in the foreign interest rate are shown in

the third row of Table 2. Now, in contrast to a change in the domestic

interest rate, the debt capacity of the home country is affected. As

shown in column (2), it falls to -1430 units. This result has direct

implications for the current debate about the so-called "debt crisis"

since it indicates that a rise in the interest rate charged to a debtor

nation can result in a situation in which no level of domestic restraint

(i.e., maximum possible international surpluses) allows the country to

pay off its debt. Indeed, as foreign interest rates rise, it becomes

more likely that the "reverse locomotive" operates.

     Columns (2) and (3) show opposite effects on the exchange rates. In

the absence of foreign assets, the exchange rate depreciates because the

present discounted value of foreign expenditures has fallen. This is

offset, however, by the larger interest account, so that the exchange

rate appreciates slightly. As a consequence, the ratio of the two rates

falls from 51.5% (base case and rise in the domestic interest rate) to

34.6%, the lowest value in the various experiments of Table 2.

     The effects on income and the balance of trade are straightforward:

column (6) shows that the higher exchange rate raises domestic income

through the higher value of home exports. Foreign income falls and the

same is true for the domestic currency value of home income, see columns

 (7) and (8) respectively. The increased interest income brings the

current account into surplus, column (2).

     In row (4) we increase the domestic marginal propensity to save by

20%. The debt capacity increases by 7.5%, column (2). As the export

side in equation (6') rises, i.e., at unchanged e, B* in (6') would go to

surplus. To offset this,    appreciates, as does e, see columns (3) and

(4). The rise in    induces a counterforce, which does not however offset

the tendency for e to fall. Changes in m and m* also affect the debt

capacity of the home country less than proportionally but the elastici-

ties are slightly higher than with respect to s and .   The difference is

due to the larger size of import propensities in the base case.

     Table 3 reports some implied elasticities from the experiments of

Table 2.   It is evident that they are generally smaller than one. The

exceptions are the more than proportional increase in the trade deficit

due to the rise in the d•mestic interest rate and the proportional effect

of s and m on e. The reponse of the debt ceiling is highest in

connection with the foregn interest rate. The elasticities with respect

to the trade balance are zero unless interest rates change.

     With an infinite horizon, the constant exchange rate and trade

balance in the base case imply that there is no asset accumulation or

decumulation, so that the terminal stock of foreign assets would be 2000

units. In a 50 period horizon, however, a small accumulation (less than

1%) takes place.11 At the long-run equilibrium foreign asset level the

current account is in balance. Interest payments from abroad precisely

offset the trade balance, again due to the infinite horizon property of

the model. Had we specified a finite model with zero foreign asset

holdings at the end point, the current account would be non-zero.

     Even when the terminal stock of foreign assets is the same as

initially, there is substantial accumulation and decumulation when

interest rates change. Basically, when the foreign interest rate rises,

the exchange rate appreciates, so that a creditor country experiences a

greater trade deficit, more than offset by the larger interest inflow.

Over time, the exchange rate effect becomes stronger and decumulation of

foreign assets takes place. A debtor country starts with a larger

surplus than in the base case, pays its debt, and even accumulates assets

before it returns to its initial debt. This pattern is required by the

appreciating exchange rate and would be exacerbated if the terminal debt

were smaller than initially. When the domestic interest rate increases,

there is a depreciation of the exchange rate and the reverse pattern

obtains. Assets are decuinulated initially and accumulated later.

Therefore the pattern of asset accumulation is strongly influenced by the

expected path of the exchange rate.


2.3 Transmission of business cycles


     To analyze the transnission process, we raise domestic and foreign

expenditure by 50% both ci 'rently (period 0) and in the future (period

10). Table 4 summarizes te results for three levels of the stock of

foreign assets: 2000 units, 0 and a value close to the debt ceiling

(_2000).12 An increase in E depreciates the exchange rate independently

of the stock of foreign assets. The further away the increase is expect-

ed, the less of a depreciation is seen. It falls from 1% when E0 rises

to about .4% when E10 rises. Domestic income rises, by 8% at F = 2000,

6% at F = 0 and 2% at F = -2000.   Again the asymptotic behavior of e is

responsible for this lower response. Foreign income rises in response to

the income effect (horizontal transmission), but falls due to the ex-

change rate effect (diagonal transmission). Domestic absorption always

rises but the current account deficit deteriorates with the current

expansion and improves slightly with the future expansion.

     Suppose now E* is raised to 10%. If the home country's initial debt

is larger than 1930 units, the present or future increase in foreign

lowers home income; the exchange rate effect exceeds the income effect.

Specifically, with an initial debt of 1920 units, the elasticity of home

income with respect to foreign expenditure is 4, with a debt of 1930

units it becomes -.1. Nearer the debt limit, the reverse locomotive

effect explodes. If F    -2120, the elasticity becomes -8, that is home

income falls by 80%! The large value of home income is of course due to

the very high valuation of home exports implied by the asymptotic behav-

ior of the exchange rate as F approaches F.

     Foreign income rises by more than the increase in E* itself due to

the exchange rate effect. The absolute amount of the improvement in 1*

due to the "own" transmission is independent of the stock of debt but it

increases from 4% to 6% to 10% as the debt increases. For domestic

income measured at foreign prices, we see that the transmission of

business cycles is not disturbed. There is no reverse locomotive effect

but a smaller improvement than in the foreign country, respectively by

3%, 5% and 10%. The balance of trade in foreign currency goes into

higher surplus for at the initial period. The interteniporal accuinula-

tion, as governed by F, has not changed and thus other balances will move

towards deficits.

     We saw above that the domestic currency value of home income may

fall depending on F but that the foreign currency value will rise, i.e,

there is no problem with the transmission of business cycles measured in

foreign currency. The reverse locomotive effect leads domestic absorp-

tion to fall as the stock of debt exceeds 1920 units. In other words, a
                                    -29-


debtor   nation may see home absorption fall as foreign countries move

through a cyclical upturn.

     Note also that the current account measured in home currency of

these countries improves; as foreign income rises, and e falls (the

appreciation discussed before) the interest payments measured in home

currency are significantly reduced.

     In the case of an expected future cyclical upturn abroad, the

exchange rate appreciates once again to insure intertemporal balance. At

2000 units of debt, domestic income falls.by 4% if       rises and by 6% if

    rises. The foreign currency value rises by 10% and 0, respectively.

     When the stock of foreign assets is positive, a current cyclical

upturn abroad is transmitted to the home country as a current home

upturn, while an expected foreign upturn will have current downturn (but
                                           *
possibly   future upturn) effects. When
                                           E10 rises, domestic absorption
falls at all levels of F but the current account remains in surplus when

F is negative. When f rises, absorption only falls in that latter case.



Conclusion



     The model presented here was designed to show, in the simplest

framework, how the traditional view of cyclical transmission via the

"locomotive" is changed if a flexible exchange rate model is used. The

model has its roots in the flow-equilibrium models of the old interna-

tional finance literature but, in contrast to those, it fully accounts

for stock accumulation and decumulation through intertemporal con-

straints. A change in the present or expected trade balance has to be

offset by an exchange rate change that retains intertemporal balance in
                                 -30-



the sense that the sum of the discounted values of the expected future

surpluses equals the current holdings of foreign assets. It is the

exchange rate effect that can put a counterveiling influence on the

standard locomotive effect.

    Three types of transmission are identified, aside from the 'town"

effect of domestic demand expansion on domestic output. The second is

the vertical transmission of future domestic demand expansion to current

domestic output. The third, which is negative, associates future foreign

demand expansion to current domestic recession.

     The analytical results were simulated, with an emphasis on the

condition for existeIce of a reverse locomotive effect. Thus, when the

interest account is in surplus and 1.3% of domestic income, the elastici—

ty of horizontal transmission is 2.6%. Conversely, when the interest

account is in deficit and accounts for 4.3% of domestic income, the

elasticity becomes negative and equal to 4.5%.

1.   Models sharing some of the features of the present one are in Kouri

     and Macedo (1978), Krugman (1981) and Kouri (1983). On the absorp-

     tion approach, see Macedo (1972).

2.   This allows us to ignore the interest payments on the absorption

     side and simplifies both the model and intuition, without altering

     the results.

3.   Note from (6) and (1'), that a zero trade balance in the current

     period would imply an exchange rate e, such that:


                            —
                                  *
                            e   = sinE
                                  smE

     Higher    expenditure at home relative to abroad depreciates the

     one-period exchange rate. The same is true for an increase in the

     home country's openness--as measured by the marginal propensity to

     import--or a decrease in the home country's marginal propensity not

     to spend. By specifying a Cambridge money demand function H = kY     (IL


     =   i),   this effect is seen as an increase in domestic velocity

     (decrease in k). Indeed, substituting for M and       in (1') from (4)

     and (4'), a "monetary looking" equation is obtained:


                            -     Hmk
                            e =
                                  Hmk

4.   The present discounted value of the stock of foreign assets in the

     last period is of course zero when we have an infinite horizon:

                      ii
           lim     (—) F.1        —
                                  — 0
           i-     1+r
                                  -32-




     In a finite horizon, the terminal value must be given to solve for

     the initial exchange rate.

5.   Suppose that autonomous expenditures at home and abroad are expected

     to grow over time at a constant rate, respectively g and g. In

     order for E and      to be finite, these rates have to be less than

     the respective rates of discount. In this special case, the

     zero-intertemporal-trade-balance exchange rate, ,   depreciates
     relative to the zero-current-trade-balance exchange rate, e, if the

     expected rate of growth of domestic expenditure increases:

                    -
              e = e

     where    p =   (r-g)/l+r)
     and        =   (-)/' 4)
6.   For an increase in doaestic income we find that, if the income and

     exchange rate effect offset each other, the level of e drops out.

     The reason is that in this case the initial improvement of the

     balance is itself affected by the level of e.

7.   It. is easy to show that the foreign currency value of domestic

     income always increase as foreign expenditures rise.

8.   While it avoids the complications associated with the infinite

     horizon, the constant growth rate case cannot be used for the

     analysis of temporary shocks. Even when the initial value is

     allowed to change, and therefore the whole path of autonomous

     expenditures also changes, it is easy to show that an increase in

     domestic expenditure will have no effect on foreign income. See

     Appendix 1 to Macedo and Meerschwam (1984).

9.   Note that at a 10% interest rate the terminal value of expenditure

     is 4.7, so that the 50 period horizon reduces the sums of the

     discounted values of E and E to 5453 instead of the infinite

     horizon level of 5500. The 1% error implied by the finite horizon

     does not affect the exchange rate, which is within 2.7% of the

     infinite horizon one after 10 periods and within .07% after 20

     periods (assuming the terminal stock is the same as the initial

     stock).

     Row 1 in Table 2, Rows 2 through 7 in Tables Al through A6.

11. Since      is constant in the base case, it follows from equation (8)

     that




            B iO [1}1 = fi       [11-ri = -(1+')F
                    l+r      -    r
                *
     Therefore B =
                      *
                      —rF and this is true for all periods as shown in

     Appendix 2 to Macedo and Meerschwam (1984). In a 50 period horizon,

     however, we find fi =   -201.7,   so that the long run   value   of F is 2017

     when the foreign interest rate is 10%.

     Row 1 in Table 4; Row 2 in Table Al; Row 3 in Table A8; Row 4 in

     Table 5 and Row 5 in Table 6.
