                                              ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the impact of the first nation-wide e-commerce expansion program on rural households.
To do so, we combine a randomized control trial with new survey and administrative microdata. In
contrast to existing case studies, we find little evidence for income gains to rural producers and workers.
Instead, the gains are driven by a reduction in cost of living for a minority of rural households who
tend to be younger, richer and in more remote markets. These effects are mainly due to overcoming
logistical barriers to e-commerce, rather than to additional investments to adapt e-commerce to the
rural population.

The number of people buying and selling products online in China has grown from practically
zero in the year 2000 to more than 400 million by 2015, surpassing the US as the largest e-
commerce market.1 Most of this growth has taken place in cities, but the Chinese government
recently announced the expansion of e-commerce to the countryside as a national policy prior-
ity. The objective is to foster rural economic development and reduce the rural-urban economic
divide.2 Other developing countries with large rural populations, such as Egypt, India and Viet-
nam, have recently announced similar e-commerce expansion plans.3
     These policies have been motivated by a growing number of case studies on highly successful
“e-commerce villages” that have experienced rapid output growth by selling both agricultural
and non-agricultural products to urban markets via e-commerce. One of the most prominent
examples is China: by 2018, the largest e-commerce platform, Taobao, had branded more than
3000 rural market places as “Taobao Villages” based on their high concentration of online sales
(AliResearch, 2018).4 Inspired by these success stories, much of the current policy focus has been
on rural producers. By lowering trade and information costs to urban markets, e-commerce is
meant to raise rural incomes through higher demand for local production, better access to inputs
and stronger incentives for rural entrepreneurship. There has been less emphasis on the potential
benefits to rural consumers. However, recent descriptive evidence from urban China suggests
that e-commerce demand is strongest in smaller and more remote cities, pointing to potentially
large consumer gains in rural areas.5
     The recent growth of e-commerce in a number of rural markets has captured the imagination
of policy-makers, but important questions remain about whether market integration through on-
line trading platforms can have a broad and significant impact on rural development. There is
also little available evidence on the characteristics of households and markets that may benefit
more or less from e-commerce, and on the effectiveness of investments targeted at lifting differ-
ent types of barriers to rural e-commerce access.6 To answer these questions, this paper studies
the first nationwide e-commerce expansion program. From 2014 to 2018, this program connected
more than 40,000 Chinese villages to e-commerce. Our analysis combines a randomized control
trial (RCT), that we implement across villages in collaboration with a large Chinese e-commerce
firm, with a new collection of household and store price survey microdata and the universe of
transaction records from the firm’s internal database.
     E-commerce is the ability to buy and sell products through online transactions coupled with
    1 In both number of users and total sales. See e.g. PFSweb (2016) and Statista (2016).
    2 The  policy agenda of “Alleviating Poverty through E-Commerce” has featured in the government’s “No.1
Central Document” each year since 2014.
    3 See e.g. Egypt’s “National E-Commerce Strategy” (MCIT, 2016), “Digital India” (MEITY, 2016), Vietnam’s

“E-Commerce Development Masterplan” (PM, 2016) and UNCTAD’s new technical assistance platform “eTrade For
All: Unlocking the Potential of E-Commerce in Developing Countries” (UNCTAD, 2016).
    4 See e.g. World Bank publications by Luo & Niu (2019) and Luo et al. (2019). E-commerce villages have also

received widespread media attention (e.g. “China’s Number One E-Commerce Village” (BBC Global Business, 01 May
2013), “Inside China’s Tech Villages” (The Telegraph, 05 Nov 2016), “Once Poverty-Stricken, China’s Taobao Villages
Have Found a Lifeline” (QZ, 01 Feb 2017), “Taobao Villages Are Turning Poor Communities into Huge Online Retail
Hubs” (Business Insider, 27 Feb 2017)).
    5 In the US, the share of e-commerce in 2015 retail sales was about 10-15 percent (e.g. FRED (2016)). In China,

McKinsey (2016) reports this share to be as high as 20-30 percent in smaller cities, and Fan et al. (2016) find this share
increases by 1.2 percentage points as city population decreases by 10 percent.
    6 These questions complement the recent literature on the consumer gains from e-commerce in the US (e.g.

Brynjolfsson et al. (2003); Goldmanis et al. (2010); Dolfen et al. (2017)).

                                                            1
transport logistics for local parcel delivery and pickup from producers. Bringing e-commerce
to the countryside in developing countries requires more than internet access. The internet is
already available in most of the Chinese countryside due to both smartphones and expanding
broadband access. Instead, there are two current barriers to rural e-commerce trading, which we
refer to as the logistical and the transactional barriers. The logistical barrier relates to the lack of
modern commercial parcel delivery services. These providers already operate distribution net-
works across Chinese cities, but have not entered large parts of the countryside. One well-known
challenge to rural transport logistics is the so-called “last mile” between urban logistical hubs and
small pockets of rural population. The transactional barrier refers to the potential lack of familiar-
ity with navigating online platforms or access to online payment methods that rural households
may face. Villagers may also not trust transactions that occur before inspecting the product or
without interacting with buyers in person.
    To overcome these barriers, the Chinese government recently partnered with a large firm that
operates a popular Chinese e-commerce platform. The program aims to invest in the necessary
transport logistics to offer e-commerce in rural villages at the same price, convenience and ser-
vice quality that buyers and producers face in their county’s main city center. To this end, the
e-commerce firm builds warehouses as logistical nodes for rural parcel delivery/pickup near the
urban center, and fully subsidizes transport between the county’s city center to and from the par-
ticipating villages. To address additional transactional barriers specific to the rural population,
the program installs an e-commerce terminal in a central village location. A terminal manager
employed by the firm is available to assist villagers in buying and selling products through the
firm’s e-commerce platform. Villagers can pay upon receipt of their products, or get paid upon
pickup of their shipments in cash at the terminal location. The terminal is available in addition to
the platform’s online app-based interface for buying and selling.
    An advantage of this setting is that we can study the reduction in trading frictions through
e-commerce without confounding the counterfactual with the effects of first-time internet access
or reductions in transport costs more broadly. The participating villages were already connected
to the internet, and the program makes no changes on this front. Furthermore, the program
only directly affects trading partners through e-commerce, while other trade costs, e.g. to control
villages, remain unchanged.7 The RCT and data analysis that we describe below exploit this em-
pirical setting to provide evidence on the local economic effects of e-commerce trading access on
rural households.8 In addition to evaluating the program’s overall impact, we use the features
of this setting to provide evidence on the relative importance of trade cost reductions (logisti-
cal barrier) and additional investments targeted at adapting e-commerce to the rural population
(transactional barrier).
    The analysis proceeds in two steps. In the first step, we randomize the arrival of e-commerce
across 100 villages in 3 provinces and 8 counties, and use our survey microdata to estimate the

    7 Inthis way we relate but also differ from existing literature on the effects of transport cost reductions on rural
markets (e.g. Van de Walle (2009); Casaburi et al. (2013); Asher & Novosad (2018)) and on the effects of the internet
on rural markets (e.g. Chapman & Slaymaker (2002); Goyal (2010); Forman et al. (2012); WB (2016)). The empirical
context and RCT allow us to study a different counterfactual of recent policy interest.
    8 We do not also attempt a social cost-benefit analysis of this program, which would require additional detailed

and confidential information on the cost side from both the e-commerce firm and local and national governments, to
which we do not have access.

impact on local economic outcomes. We then bring to bear the firm’s internal database cover-
ing the universe of transactions for about 12,000 villages in 5 provinces where the program had
entered by April 2017. These data allow us to provide additional evidence on a number of ques-
tions outside the scope of the fieldwork. In particular, we investigate whether consumption or
production-side effects take longer to materialize than the 12-month window we are able to study
in the experiment, and whether our household survey data may have missed rare but highly suc-
cessful tail events on the producer side.
    We interpret these results through the lens of a simple theoretical framework to quantify their
implications for household welfare. We find no evidence of significant gains or losses on the
production and income sides of the local economy. This finding remains when using the firm’s
database to quantify village out-shipments up to 2.5 years after program arrival and using the
universe of transaction records instead of survey samples. Instead, we find that the gains from e-
commerce are driven by a reduction in cost of living for retail consumption. This effect is sizable
(5 percent) among the group of rural households who are induced to use the new e-commerce
option. These users, however, only represent about 15 percent of rural households, who are on
average richer, younger and living in more remote markets. In terms of channels, we find that
the gains are concentrated among villages that were not previously serviced by commercial par-
cel delivery, suggesting the program’s effects are mainly due to overcoming the logistical barrier,
rather than additional investments to lift transactional barriers specific to rural households. Con-
sumer gains are strongest for durable product groups, such as electronics and appliances. We
also find suggestive evidence of additional product variety in local stores, from sourcing new
products through e-commerce. However, we find no evidence of pro-competitive effects on local
store prices for pre-existing merchandise.
    Overall, our findings put into context the transformative effects of e-commerce on rural mar-
kets that have been documented in numerous case studies on “e-commerce villages” in China and
elsewhere. Our results suggest that such success stories are not representative of the countryside
as a whole, and should not be used as a guide to set policy expectations. Adding to this insight
the significant heterogeneity that we document on the consumption side, access to e-commerce
appears to offer economic gains to certain groups of the rural population and in certain places,
rather than being broad-based. As this evidence is based on one of the first and so far largest e-
commerce expansion policies in the developing world, these findings are particularly relevant for
the growing number of governments who have recently announced similar plans using China as
a blueprint.9 In this light, we hope that our work inspires future research aimed at investigating
the local factors and potential complementary interventions, such as e.g. business training for
e-commerce or access to credit, that enable certain groups and places to reap the gains from trade
through e-commerce.

1    Experimental Design and Data
   The experiment takes place in 8 counties located in Anhui, Henan and Guizhou provinces.
The unit of randomization is the village. For each county, we obtain a list of villages where the
    9 In
       addition to the country plans discussed above, e.g. Thailand’s recent “Smart Village” program has been
designed based on field visits to Taobao Villages in China (“Commerce Ministry Touts Taobao Village Model”
(Bangkok Post, 24 Dec 2018)).

                                                     3
firm plans to introduce the e-commerce program. We ask the firm to extend this list by 5 suitable
village candidates in the county that would not have been part of the list in the absence of our
research. We then randomly select 5 control villages and 7-8 treatment villages per county from
this extended list. The remaining villages receive the e-commerce program as planned. The full
sample in which we collect survey data thus includes 40 control villages and 60 treatment vil-
lages, randomly selected from 432 village candidates. Compliance with our assignments is not
complete: the program was rolled out in 38 of the 60 treatment villages and in 5 out of the 40 con-
trol villages. We therefore report both intent-to-treat and treatment-on-treated effects. The main
reason for imperfect compliance is that we are able to randomize treatments before the terminal
manager applicants receive job offers, and some candidates end up rejecting.10 Finally, in one of
the counties, the local government suspended our team’s data collection mid-way, leaving 4 of
the 100 villages without endline data. The online appendix provides additional details, maps and
descriptive statistics discussed below.
Household Survey Data
    For the baseline survey at the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016, we collect data from 28
households per village. 14 of those households are randomly sampled within a 300 meter radius
of the planned terminal location (“inner zone”), and 14 households are randomly sampled from
other parts of the village (“outer zone”). The second round of data collection occurs one year
after the baseline.11 We collect data from the same households as in the first round, and were also
able to extend the original sample by 10 randomly sampled households within the inner zone.
We collect detailed information about household retail consumption expenditures split across 9
categories and for production inputs. We also collect information on household incomes, hours
worked, occupations and sectors of different members, asset ownership, financial accounts, in-
ternet use, and migration.
    The median age of all household members in the baseline survey is 44 and the median house-
hold size is 3. The primary earner is a farmer in 60 percent of households, and 82 percent of
them completed at least primary school. Rural households are significantly poorer than in urban
China: mean monthly income and retail expenditure per capita are about RMB876 and RMB732
respectively. 80 percent of primary earners work inside the village. However, on average half
of household retail expenditures occur outside the village, requiring a round-trip to the nearest
township center that takes on average one hour. Close to 40 percent of households report having
used the internet, more than 50 percent own smartphones and close to 30 percent report owning a
laptop or PC. Almost all households own a TV. At the same time, e-commerce penetration is very
limited compared to urban regions: both the average share of household retail expenditure on
e-commerce deliveries and the share of revenues from online selling in monthly income are less
than 1 percent. Neither of these change over time in the endline survey among control villages.



   10 Incomplete acceptance rates are standard in this setting and unrelated to the experiment (as applicants were

unaware).
   11 The fast pace of the program’s expansion places bounds on the timing of the endline. Our control villages ranked

highly when the firm decided to launch additional waves of program expansion that were rolled out shortly after the
endline.

Local Retail Price Survey Data
    We aim to collect 115 price quotes in each village. We sample products across 9 retail con-
sumption categories based on expenditure shares of rural households in Anhui and Henan from
the 2012 China Family Panel Study (CFPS). We also include production and business inputs. We
sample stores to be representative of local retail outlets (stores and market stalls). In villages with
few stores, we sample all of them. We sample products within stores to capture a representative
selection of locally purchased items within that store and product group. Each price quote is at the
barcode-equivalent level where possible (recording brand, product name, packaging type, size,
flavor if applicable). In the endline survey, we collect price quotes of the same products and retail
outlets. In cases of either store closure or product disappearance, we include a new price quote
within the same product category. The median number of sampled stores is 3 per village. The me-
dian floor space is 50m2 , and the median store has not added new products within the last month.
Firm’s Admin Database
    We complement the survey data with administrative records from two different divisions of
the firm covering 5 provinces (the three RCT provinces plus Guangxi and Yunnan where the
firm was also active). The first database covers the universe of e-commerce purchases made
through the program in every participating village from November 2015 to April 2017. The data
cover approximately 27.3 million transaction records across 12,000 villages over this period. For
each transaction, the database contains information about the product category, number of units,
amount paid and a unique buyer identifier. Given that many villages had already been in oper-
ation for several months prior to November 2015, these data cover adjustment periods beyond
the 12-months window that our RCT captures: transactions are observed up to two years and 4
months post-installation. The second database covers the universe of sales transactions, i.e. out-
shipments from the villages, through the firm’s distribution network for the same universe of
roughly 12,000 villages in the 5 provinces from January 2016 to April 2017. For each transaction,
the database records the village of origin and the weight of the out-shipment in kilograms (kg).
The total number of e-commerce out-shipments over this period is roughly 500,000.

2     Analysis
2.1     Evidence from Survey Data
      We run regressions of the following form:

                                        Post                      Pre
                                       yhv   = α + β 1 Treatv + γyhv  + ehv ,                                          (1)

where yhv is an outcome of interest for household h living in village v.12 For outcomes from the
retail price data, h indexes individual price quotes or store-level outcomes instead. Treatv is ei-
ther an indicator of randomly assigned treatment status when estimating the intent-to-treat effect
(ITT) or actual treatment status when estimating the treatment-on-the-treated effect (TOT) and
instrumenting with intended treatment. We cluster standard errors at the level of the treatment
(village level), and report point estimates both individually and after combining outcomes into

                                                                                                                      yhv

category indices following Kling et al. (2007) (“K-L-K”).
    Table 1 presents estimation results for the average effects on household consumption (Panel
A), incomes (Panel B) and local retail prices (Panel C). Our discussion here focuses on the TOT
results. On the consumption side, we find that the program leads to an uptake of on average 9
percent of households using the new e-commerce option in treatment villages compared to con-
trol villages. As documented by the non-zero mean among control villages, this effect masks
additional uptake due to users in nearby control villages, increasing the effect on uptake to about
14 percent of village households. We further investigate such spillovers at the end of this sec-
tion. The treatment effect on the new option’s share in total household retail expenditure is
1.24 percent for the average village household. Thus, households that report having used the
e-commerce option spent on average 0.0124/0.089=14.1 percent of their retail consumption dur-
ing the past month. We find stronger effects on durables compared to non-durables: for durables,
the share of household expenditure is 6.9 percent for the average household, indicating a 45 per-
cent shift in durable consumption to the new e-commerce option among uptaking households.13
For non-durables, the treatment effect on the share of household retail expenditure is 1 percent
for the average household, indicating that ever-users spend on average about 11 percent of to-
tal non-durables expenditure on the new e-commerce option. While households do shift part
of their expenditures to e-commerce, there are no significant treatment effects on total monthly
retail expenditures. The last column of Panel A combines 11 outcomes related to substitution
into e-commerce into a single index, defined as the equally weighted average of z-scores that are
calculated by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the control group.
The treatment effect on this index is 0.89 and significant at the one percent level.14
    Panel B reports point estimates on incomes per capita that are close to zero and not statisti-
cally significant. As above, we also report a single income-related index combining 14 outcomes
related to income generation. We find no effects on either annual or monthly incomes, from
agricultural or non-agricultural sources, on labor supply as measured by hours worked by the
primary (or secondary) earner or on online selling activity, online revenues, sourcing of business
inputs or business creation offline or online. In terms of precision, the ITT point estimate on
the income index indicates detectable positive effects down to about 2.6 percent of a standard
deviation (one-sided 95% CI).
    In Panel C, we find no significant reduction in local store prices for continuing products that
we observe in the same local retailer in both baseline and endline data. The point estimate is
close to zero and positive, and not statistically significant. Given our sampling framework, the
unweighted average effect on local retail prices is akin a Laspeyres price index for local retail
consumption. We also find no effect when combining 4 outcomes related to local retail prices and
product exit/additions into a single index. We find one piece of evidence suggestive of knock-on
effects on pre-existing local stores. The effect on the number of new products per store over the
past month is 4 goods and is significant at the 10% level.


   13 For households who purchase durables over the past three months, the treatment effect on uptake is 15.3

percent instead of 9 percent. This yields an effect on the average durables consumption share among uptakers of
0.069/0.153=45 percent.
   14 See Appendix B for details on the K-L-K indices in Table 1.


                                                      6
Heterogeneity
    In Table 2 we explore the heterogeneity of these effects. We begin by investigating the effect
of the program as a function of pre-existing availability of commercial parcel delivery at the vil-
lage level. Villages serviced by commercial parcel delivery operators during our baseline survey
already had access to local e-commerce deliveries. Interacting the treatment with pre-existing
parcel delivery status therefore allows us to shed light on the combined effect of removing both
logistical and transactional barriers (among villages without pre-existing parcel delivery), from
the effect of removing only the transactional barrier (adding a terminal interface in villages with
pre-existing parcel delivery).15 Next, we investigate heterogeneity across a basic set of household
demographics that have been documented in recent studies of internet and e-commerce use in
China (respondent age, education and income per capita) (CNNIC, 2015a,b). We also consider
residential distance to the planned terminal location and a measure of village remoteness (mo-
tivated by Fan et al. (2016)) based on road travel distance to the nearest township center. One
should note that these interaction terms are not causally identified by experimental variation and
provide additional suggestive evidence.
    We first run regressions in which one characteristic at a time is interacted with the treatment,
then a combined regression with all interactions included jointly. On the consumption side, we
find that the effect on program uptake is driven by villages that were not initially connected to
commercial parcel delivery services. The treatment effect is 10.6 percent among the roughly 85
percent of villages not previously connected to commercial parcel delivery, but a relatively pre-
cise zero for villages with pre-existing parcel delivery. On the production and local retail sides,
we find no significant effects in either group of villages, confirming the earlier pooled results.16
Turning to other potential sources of heterogeneity, we find that younger, richer households who
live in closer proximity to the planned terminal, and in more remote villages experience stronger
uptake on the consumption side. For example, consumption uptake would close to double if av-
erage incomes were to double and primary earners were on average 10 years younger. Somewhat
surprisingly, we find no significant heterogeneity with respect to the years of education.
Spillovers
    We investigate the role of spillovers that could bias findings from the survey data. For exam-
ple, if trade linkages with surrounding villages are an important driver of the local economy, then
the comparison between treated and control villages could miss income or retail price effects.
More simply, residents in control villages could use e-commerce terminals in a nearby treated
village. To investigate these forces, we follow Miguel & Kremer (2004) and use variation in a
village’s exposure to other nearby treated villages after controlling for proximity to all villages.17
On the consumption side, we find evidence of positive spillovers from nearby terminals in other
villages, as previewed above. In contrast, we find no evidence of cross-village spillovers on retail
stores or on the production side. Consistent with the absence of income or price spillovers, we

   15 The transport subsidy does not affect villages previously serviced by parcel delivery, as logistics operators

offered service in a few rural locations at the same rate as elsewhere in the county prior to program entry.
   16 In line with the pooled results, Appendix A reports some evidence that effects on product additions and stores

sourcing online are stronger in villages without pre-existing parcel delivery.
   17 See Online Appendix C.

also confirm in microdata from the 2010 Census that the fraction of village market access driven
by trade with other nearby rural markets is minor (less than 3 percent).18
2.2   Evidence from Firm Database
    We use the firm’s internal transaction database to provide evidence on two questions that are
outside the scope of the fieldwork.19 First, to what extent are consumption and production re-
sponses to e-commerce access increasing beyond our survey’s 12-month time window? Second,
are our survey data missing rare but highly successful tail events on the production side that
could shift the average effect on local household incomes?
    To answer these questions, we use the universe of transaction records from 5 provinces and
about 12,000 villages that had been treated by April 2017 to estimate the following event study
specification:

                                                24
                           yvm = θv + δm +      ∑     β j MonthsSinceEntry jvm + evm .                          (2)
                                               j=−3

    where v indexes villages, δm is a set of month fixed effects between November 2015 and April
2017, θv is a village fixed effect. Each observation in equation (2) is a village in a given month. yvm
is one of 4 village-level monthly outcomes: number of buyers, number of purchase transactions,
number of out-shipments and total weight of out-shipments in kg. We create a balanced panel in
the sense that each of the villages appears once per month in the panel, for each of the 18 months
for which we have data (16 months in the shipment data). This spans terminal observations of
up to 17 months pre-installation for villages connected in April 2017, and up to 28 months post-
installation for the earliest villages connected by the program. A negative index j denotes the
number of months prior to program entry. A positive j indexes the number of months since the
program started operation, so β 0 is a measure of average outcomes for villages during the month
of their installation, β 1 captures averages one month after installation, and so on. We assign an
index of j = 24 to all observations equal or beyond 24 months after program entry, so β 24 captures
average outcomes among villages that have been in operation for more than two years. Each of
the β 0 -β 24 are estimated relative to the omitted category that are periods pre-program entry (zeros
by construction since the program did not exist).
    Figure 1 presents the event-study plots for village-level outcomes on the consumption and
production sides. On the consumption side, we find little evidence of increasing uptake past our
survey’s one-year timeline. Program usage increases rapidly for about 2 to 4 months after open-
ing, and then plateaus at around 85 buyers and 280 transactions per month per village. On the
production side, we find evidence that the number and total weight of out-shipments increase
smoothly over time after program entry, and beyond the 12-month window that we cover in
our survey data. The effect increases by roughly 50 percent when comparing the point estimate
on the total weight of out-shipments 12 months post-entry to that more than 2 years post-entry.
These results suggest that production-side adjustments take longer to fully materialize than our

   18 Given how small villages are compared to cities, and that a small fraction of all villages participate in the

program, GE effects on urban centers are unlikely in our setting.
   19 Online Appendix D also uses these data to investigate the representativeness of our RCT village sample and the

timing/seasonality of the survey data collection.

                                                          8
survey’s 1-year horizon. Despite this positive trend, the average monthly estimated effects at the
village level remain small more than two years post implementation, at around 10 out-shipments
with a combined weight of 30 kg.
    Turning to the second question, our sampling of 38 households per village in the survey data
collection may be insufficient to capture rare but very successful events on the production side.
To investigate this issue, we use the universe of out-shipments depicted in Figure 1 and make the
following assumptions to get an upper-bound estimate for these shipments’ potential income cre-
ation in the local village economy: we assume i) that the entire value of these shipments is local
value-added, and ii) that the average value per kg of these shipments is as high as that of Chi-
nese exports to the rest of the world.20 Even under these assumptions, we find that e-commerce
out-shipments account for on average at most a 0.17 percent increase in local income per capita
more than 2 years after the program’s arrival. To conclude, this average longer-term effect—that
we can estimate precisely in Figure 1 using the firm’s transaction data—would still be consistent
with the statistical zero results on incomes and the production side that we find using the RCT
survey data after one year.21

3     Evaluation
    In the final part, we interpret the program’s observed effects through the lens of a simple the-
oretical framework. The most robust effect that we find is on the substitution of local households’
retail expenditures to the new e-commerce shopping option. To quantify the cost of living im-
plications consistent with these estimates, we follow a revealed-preference approach as in recent
work by Atkin et al. (2018) and structure household preferences into three tiers: the upper tier is
Cobb-Douglas over broad product groups g ∈ G (durables and non-durables) in total consump-
tion, the middle tier is CES across retailers s ∈ S selling that product group (e.g. local stores,
market stalls or the e-commerce option), and the final tier is across individual products within
groups b ∈ Bg which can be left unspecified.22 The direct consumer gains from the arrival of
the e-commerce option, measured as a percentage of initial household expenditure, can then be
expressed as follows:
                                                                                          αgh
                                  Gainsh                                             1

                          Initial Expenditureh
                                               =      ∏ ( ∑             φ1gsh )   σg −1         − 1,         (3)
                                                      g∈ G       s∈SCg

where σg is the elasticity of substitution across retail options to source consumption in product
group g, α gh is the initial expenditure share on that product group for household group h and
∑s∈SCg φ1gsh is the share of retail expenditures that is not spent on the new e-commerce option post-
intervention (where s ∈ SCg indexes continuing local retailers and φ1gsh is the endline expenditure
share on retailer s in product group g of household group h).
    To estimate this expression, we require information about the program’s effect on ∑s∈SCg φ1gsh

    20 On average RMB66.5 per kg in 2015 and 2016 (WITS database).
    21 Relatedto this, much of the existing literature on ICT in developing countries have estimated effects after
relatively short periods: e.g. Jensen (2007) documents significant effects of Indian cell phone towers on market
prices and other outcomes within weeks post-installation. More recently, Hjort & Poulsen (2018) document effects of
fast-speed internet on local employment and incomes in Africa that arise within 3-12 months post-installation.
   22 See Online Appendix E for more details.


                                                        9
and the parameters α gh and σg . For the α gh , we use our baseline data on household expenditure
shares across product groups. For ex-post expenditure shares on the new e-commerce option, we
use the treatment effects among the 85 percent of villages without pre-existing parcel delivery
connections reported in Table 2. These villages experienced the removal of both logistical and
transactional barriers to e-commerce trading. We include mean program usage among control
villages in these treatment effects to account for program spillovers as discussed above.
    We perform this welfare computation for two different groups of local households. First for
the average sample household, for whom the average effect on the terminal share of total retail
consumption is 1.6 percent, and second for households who report ever having used the ter-
minal for consumption, for whom this effect is 14 percent. We also estimate price index effects
separately for durable and non-durable consumption. And we report estimates both with and
without re-weighting households according to sampling weights. Finally, we calibrate σg using
estimates from Atkin et al. (2018) for households in Mexico with incomes comparable to those of
rural Chinese households in our survey (σN = 3.87 for non-durables and σD = 3.85 for durables).
    Table 3 reports the estimation results. The average reduction in retail cost of living among
households who experienced the lifting of both logistical and transactional barriers is 0.82 per-
cent. This effect increases to 5.6 percent among the roughly 15 percent of households who ever
used the new e-commerce option. These effects are slightly lower at 0.73 and 4.7 percent respec-
tively when weighting our sample households to represent the average population living in these
villages. Underlying these effects are strong consumer gains in durable consumption: 3 percent
for the average village household and 16.6 percent among users. For reference, retail consump-
tion across all product groups accounts for on average 55 percent of total household expenditure
among the rural households in the sample.23
    Finally, to investigate the distribution of these gains, we use treatment effects from the joint
heterogeneity specification in the bottom panel of Table 2. We estimate this specification with
the dependent variable being the household expenditure share on the new e-commerce option
for either durables or non-durables. For each sample household in treatment villages without
                                                                                       t1 , based on
pre-existing parcel delivery, we then compute a fitted value of the effect on ∑s∈SCg φgsh
the primary earner’s age, income per capita, residential distance to the planned terminal and dis-
tance to the nearest township center (remoteness), included jointly. Figure 2 shows these graphs.
Ranking households along each of these dimensions, we find more than 4-fold differences in the
price index effect within the sample. For example, the average rural household with a 25 year-
old primary earner experiences a reduction in retail cost of living of about 1.5 percent (without
conditioning on uptake), which drops below 1 percent past the age of 40 and close to zero past
the age of 60.
    Overall, our findings suggest that the welfare gains from e-commerce trading access are lim-
ited to certain groups of rural households and particular markets, rather than being broad-based.
First, we show that the income and production-side effects that have been the focus of the existing
literature on “e-commerce villages” are not representative of the countryside, even when focusing
on a sample of rural markets in the RCT that were chosen by the firm for successful e-commerce
  23 We  also evaluate robustness to alternative σg . Assuming σN = 2.87 and σD = 2.85 yields larger gains (a 1.27
percent reduction in retail cost of living on average and 8.74 percent among users). Assuming σN = 4.87 and
σD = 4.85 yields slightly smaller effects (0.61 and 4.12 percent respectively).

                                                       10
expansion. Second, we find strong heterogeneity in the consumer gains from e-commerce across
villages and households within them. In this light, we hope this work can inspire additional
research to investigate what types of local factors or complementary interventions allow rural
markets to reap the gains from trade through e-commerce for both producers and consumers.

     buyers (top left), the number of transactions (top right), the number of out-shipments (bottom left) and the total weight of out-shipments (bottom right) per village. The data are
     from the e-commerce firm’s internal database and contain the universe of village purchase transactions from November 2015 to April 2017 and the universe of sales transations
     from January 2016 to April 2017 in the five provinces of Anhui, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, and Yunnan (roughly 11,900 villages in total). The last point estimate of each plot pools

     Notes: Figure shows predicted average gains (users and non-users) in terms of percentage point reductions in household retail cost of living as a function of household per capita
     income (top left), age of primary earner (top right), residential distance to terminal (bottom left), and distance to the nearest township center (bottom right). Predictions are based
     on treatment effects from bottom panel of Table 2. The figure depicts 95 percent confidence intervals that are based on clustering standard errors at the village level. See Section 3
     for discussion.

Notes: Table reports average household gains in terms of percentage point reductions in retail cost of living for different consumption
categories and groups of households. Estimates are based on equation (3) using treatment effects on household substitution into the new
e-commerce option. The left panel reports unweighted results, and the right panel adjusts the weight of each household using sampling
weights. Standard errors are bootstrapped across 1000 iterations, taking into account that the treatment effects are point estimates. See
Section 3 for discussion.

           Appendix B: K-L-K Indices
               Table 1 reports treatment effects after combining several outcomes related to consumption,
           incomes and local retail prices into three indices. We follow Kling et al. (2007) (“K-L-K”) and
           construct equally weighted averages of z-scores that we compute by subtracting outcomes by the
           mean of the variable in the control group and dividing by the standard deviation of the variable
           in the control group. The z-scores are signed such that effects on all index components point
           in the same direction (i.e. price index reductions or income growth). If a household (or store)
           has a valid response to at least one component measure of an index, then any missing values for
           other component measures are imputed at the random assignment group mean. This results in
           differences between treatment and control means of an index being the same as the average of
           treatment and control means of the components of that index, so that the index can be interpreted
           as the average of results for separate measures scaled to standard deviation units.1

               1 For two outcomes of the consumption index discussed below, the control mean and standard deviation were
           zero. In those cases, we instead use the standard deviation of the variable observed in the full sample.

                                                                16
    The consumption index is based on 11 variables related to household substitution of expendi-
tures into the new e-commerce shopping option, all entering the index positively. Those outcomes
are whether a household reports ever having used the new option, reported usage over the past
month, and the shares of household total retail expenditure spent on 9 consumption categories
(food and beverages, tobacco and alcohol, medicine and health, clothing and accessories, other
every-day products, fuel and gas, furniture and appliances, electronics, transport equipment).
The treatment effects on each of these outcomes are reported as part of appendix Table A.6.
    The income index is based on 14 variables related to income generation, labor supply, online
selling activity and online sourcing of inputs. Those outcomes are monthly income per capita, an-
nual income per capita, monthly income from agriculture, monthly income from non-agriculture,
monthly hours of work by primary earner, monthly hours of work by secondary earner, whether
anyone in household has ever sold online, sold over the last month, revenues from online sales
over past month, share of online revenues in total monthly income, whether primary earner is
a farmer (entering negatively), whether any household member has started a new business over
past 6 months, whether the new business sells in part online, and the share of monthly online
purchases in total expenditures on inputs and materials. The treatment effects on each of these
outcomes are reported as part of appendix Table A.7.
    The local retail index is based on 4 store-level measures related to effects on the local retail
cost of living. Those outcomes are the average of log price changes of continuing product items
within the store (entering negatively), the number of new product additions over the past month
(positively), the number of product replacements (measured as the fraction of products reported
in the baseline survey that were no longer available at endline) (negatively), and whether or not
the store owner reports sourcing products online (positively). The treatment effects on each of
these outcomes are reported as part of appendix Table A.8.

Appendix C: Role of Spillovers
   To investigate the role of spillovers, we pursue two different approaches. First, we follow an
approach similar to Miguel & Kremer (2004):

               Post
              yhv   = α + β 1 Treatv + β 2 Exposuretreat
                                                   v     + β 3 Exposurevall + γyhv
                                                                                Pre
                                                                                    + ehv ,     (A.1)

where Exposurevk treat measures the proximity of village v to other program villages, and Exposure all
                                                                                                    vk
measures proximity to all villages on the candidate list from which we randomly selected our
control villages. Even though exposure to other program villages is not randomly assigned, our
randomization means that conditional on exposure to all candidate villages, exposure to other
treatment villages is plausibly exogenous. Using this design, β 2 is an estimate of the the strength
of cross-village spillovers. We measure exposure as the number of intent-to-treat villages within 3
or 10 km distance bins of a given village. Table A.10 reports the estimation results. We find some
evidence of positive spillover effects of nearby terminals within 3 km of the village. These effects
imply a larger total average effect on e-commerce uptake. Consumption uptake increases from
9 percent in Table A.6 to 14 percent once we take into account positive spillovers from nearby
villages, which is 13 percent of the village population after adjusting for sampling weights. In
contrast, we find no evidence of cross-village spillovers on local retail stores, or on the production

                                                   17
side of the economy.
    Second, to further investigate these channels in the absence of experimental variation in pro-
gram saturation rates,2 we also pursue an approach grounded in trade theory. In particular, we
can quantify the fraction of a rural location’s total trade market access that is due to trading ex-
posure to other rural markets in the same county. This fraction provides additional information
on the extent of rural-to-rural spillovers from other sample villages in our setting. If a sizable
share of local market access is due to trading relations with other local rural markets, then indi-
rect effects on local product prices and incomes from treatments in other villages could become
an important force. If, on the other hand, local product and factor prices are predominantly de-
termined by access to larger urban markets, then rural-to-rural spillovers could have negligible
effects on local prices and incomes across our sample villages.
    Following e.g. Head & Mayer (2014), the market access of location v to all other rural and
urban markets j 6= v is:

                                                MAv =     ∑ τjv−θ Yj                                           (A.2)
                                                          j6=v

    where τjv is the bilateral trade cost, θ is the elasticity of trade flows with respect to trade costs,
and Yj is a measure of j’s market size.3 MAv is thus a weighted sum of economic activity outside
of market v, with weights that are inversely related to bilateral trade costs. To compute the frac-
tion of total market access that is due to bilateral linkages with other rural markets in the same
county (i.e. MAvR /MAv ), we compute (6) both across bilateral connections to all other markets
(denominator), and only summing across bilateral connections with other rural markets in the
same county (numerator). Alternatively, we restrict the numerator to bilateral connections with
respect to the fraction of rural markets in the county that are participating in the program to com-
pute the share of market access due to rural locations with program terminals. That fraction was
about 1/6th of all rural markets in participating counties over our sample period.
    To compute these measures, we use the township-level data from the Chinese Population
Census in 2010 described in Appendix F below. These data provide us with the populations re-
siding in each of roughly 45,000 township-level administrative units. In addition, we use the
coordinates of township centroids to construct the full matrix of bilateral distances in km. Fol-
                                                                                    −θ
lowing the trade literature, we use these bilateral distances to parameterize τjv      : using the finding
                                                                                    4                 −θ
that the elasticity of trade flows with respect to distance is approximately -1, we measure τjv          as
the inverse bilateral distance in km when summing across the j market sizes. Alternatively, we
also use a larger distance elasticity of -1.5 that gives more weight to markets in closer proximity.
For market size Yj , we use either population or population multiplied by the value added per
worker for rural and non-rural workers measured at the province level for 2010. The first met-

    2 As part of our negotiations and collaboration with the firm’s local implementation teams, it was not feasible to

also attempt a two-stage cluster randomization design that would have allowed us to randomly vary saturation rates.
    3 To be consistent with structural gravity in trade models, the measure Y of j’s market size should include a
                                                                                 j
multilateral resistance term capturing j’s own degree of access to all other markets (see e.g. Head & Mayer (2014)).
In (A.2), we abstract from this and compute a first-order approximation of the structural gravity expression for MAv .
In practice, both measures have been found to yield very similar results in recent empirical work, as they are highly
correlated (e.g. Donaldson & Hornbeck (2016)).
    4 See e.g. Disdier & Head (2008) for a meta-analysis of this point estimate.

ric provides an inverse distance-weighted measure of market access to populations outside the
township, while the second provides an approximate measure of access to GDP. Finally, we define
rural and urban markets following the administrative classification across township-level units
we obtain in the census data. For computational feasibility, when constructing the full matrix of
bilateral connections, we compute the total market access of rural townships with respect to all
other township units (both rural and urban) within each of the 3 broad administrative regions
of China in which our sample counties are located: East China (7 provinces), Middle China (3
provinces) and Southwest China (5 provinces).5
    The above provides us with four measures of the ratio of total market access that is due to ac-
cess to other rural populations or rural GDP within the the same county: measured either in terms
of access to population or to GDP, and measured either in terms of access to all rural markets in
the county or only the fraction of rural markets that on average participate in the e-commerce
program. We compute the median, mean and standard deviations of these 4 ratios for all rural
townships located in the three regions of China, as well as only for townships in our 3 sample
provinces, or only for townships in the 8 sample counties. Furthermore, we compute each of
these measures both for the baseline distance elasticity of -1, and when using -1.5 instead.
    Appendix Table A.11 presents the estimation results. Overall, we find that other rural markets
in the same county account for a tiny fraction of total trade market access for the median or the
average rural market place. This result is driven by the fact that nearby rural markets within the
same county account for a small fraction of the market size that is concentrated in vastly larger
urban centers. This is particularly the case when using economic output as the measure of market
size, but also holds for raw populations. For example, the median fraction of market access from
nearby rural markets in terms of GDP is 0.37 percent in our sample provinces, and 1.2 percent in
terms of population access. These fractions slightly increase when giving more weight to nearby
markets using a higher distance elasticity, but remain close to zero in both cases when computing
rural-to-rural market access only with respect to the average fraction of rural markets that are
participating in the program in any given county over our sample period. These findings are
in line with the absence of significant GE spillover effects on market prices or nominal incomes
shown in our first approach above, and serve to provide some further corroborating evidence in
this context.

Appendix D: Additional Results from the Firm’s Database
Are the RCT Sample Villages Representative?
   One concern is that the 8 counties that our RCT takes place in may not be representative of
program villages in the Chinese countryside more broadly. To assess whether the RCT villages are
representative of the population of program villages in China, we use the 5-province transaction
database on both purchases and sales transactions to estimate regressions of the following form:

                     yvm = θm + βRCTSamplev + γMonthsSinceEntryvm + evm ,


   5 The 8 counties of our RCT fall into one these three zones. Omitting regions outside each zone is somewhat
conservative, as their inclusion would increase the denominator of the rural-to-total market access ratios.

                                                     19
where v indexes villages and θm is a set of monthly dummies indexed by m for the 18 months
of operation from November 2015 to January 2017. yvm is one of five village-level monthly out-
comes (number of buyers, number of purchase transactions, total terminal sales, number of out-
shipments and total weight of out-shipments in kg), RCTSample is a dummy for whether the
village is in our RCT sample, and MonthsSinceEntry controls for the number of months that the
program has been in operation in v as of month m. The standard errors evm are clustered at the
village level.
    The results in appendix Table A.12 show no remarkable differences between our RCT villages
and the population of program villages in these 5 provinces. The same is true if we compare our
RCT villages to all villages in our 3 survey provinces. The RCT sample seems marginally more
successful on the out-shipment side, but the magnitudes are tiny. These results provide some
reassurance against the potential concern that the e-commerce firm directed our team towards 8
counties that systematically differ from the program’s target locations in the Chinese countryside.
Did We Collect Endline Data During Particular Months?
    The timeline of pre-treatment data collection was determined by the roll-out schedule of the
e-commerce firm, and we could not finance more than a single post-treatment round. As a result
of these constraints, our survey cannot measure the impact of seasonality on treatment effects.
We therefore use the transaction database to study seasonality effects by estimating:

                    yvm = θv + βRCTMonthm + γMonthSinceEntryvm + evm ,

where RCTMonth is a dummy for our survey months i.e., a dummy equal to 1 if month m is ei-
ther in December, January, April or May, which are the four calendar months during which we
conducted our survey. We again cluster standard errors evm at the village level. The results are
in appendix Table A.13. We find slightly higher numbers of buyers during survey months rel-
ative to the rest of the calendar year, and slightly lower numbers of purchase transactions and
out-shipments. In both cases, the point estimates are very small: about one additional buyer per
month, a reduction of between 4 to 5 in the number of monthly purchase transactions, and a re-
duction of less than one out-shipment per month on the selling side. We conclude that seasonality
is unlikely to be a significant driver underlying the findings of the RCT.

Appendix E: Welfare Evaluation
    Following recent work by Atkin et al. (2018), we propose a three-tier demand system to de-
scribe household retail consumption across product groups, retail shopping options and prod-
ucts. In the upper tier, shown in equation A.3, there are Cobb-Douglas preferences over broad
product groups g ∈ G (durables and non-durables) in total consumption. In the middle tier,
shown in equation A.4, there are asymmetric CES preferences over local retailers selling that
product group s ∈ S (e.g. local stores, market stalls or the e-commerce option). In the final tier,
there are preferences over the individual products within the product groups b ∈ Bg that we can

where α gh and β gsh are (potentially household group-specific) preference parameters that are fixed
across periods. Q gh and q gsh are product-group and store-product-group consumption aggregates
with associated price indices Pgh and r gsh respectively, and σg is the elasticity of substitution across
local retail outlets. For each broad product group, consumers choose how much they are going
to spend at different retail outlets based on the store-level price index r gsh (which itself depends
on the product mix and product-level prices on offer across outlets).
    While the demand system is homothetic, we capture potential heterogeneity across the in-
come distribution by allowing households of different incomes to differ in their expenditure
shares across product groups (α gh ) and their preferences for consumption bundles at different
stores within those product groups (β gsh and the preference parameters that generate q gsh ). As
shown by Anderson et al. (1992), these preferences can generate the same demands as would be
obtained from aggregating many consumers who make discrete choices over which store to shop
in. Building on Feenstra (1994), the following expression provides the exact proportional cost of
living effect (CLE) under this demand system as a fraction of initial household expenditures:

a Sato-Vartia (i.e. CES) price-index for price changes in continuing local stores that forms the
pro-competitive price effect.7 The price terms r tgsh are themselves price indices of product-specific
prices ptgsb within local continuing stores which, in principle, could also account for new product
varieties or exiting product varieties using the same methodology. While we name these price
changes pro-competitive, they may derive from either reductions in markups or increases in
productivity at local stores (distinctions that do not matter on the cost-of-living side, but would
generate different magnitudes of profit and income effects that we capture on the nominal
income side).

merator, from both a direct price index effect due to the new shopping option and potential other
local store entry induced by this change, and local store exit in the denominator, i.e. the exit effect.
    Now consider the case—as in the final section of the paper—where the program’s effect on
cost of living is driven by the direct price index effect. In that case, the expenditure share spent
on continuing local retailers (∑s∈SCg φ1gsh ) is lower than unity only due to substitution into the new
e-commerce option. The consumer gains from the program as a proportion of initial household
spending are then:                                                                    α gh

The welfare gain from a new shopping option is a function of the market share of that outlet
post-entry and the elasticity of substitution across stores. The revealed preference nature of this
approach is clear. If consumers greatly value the arrival of the new option—be it because it
offers low prices p1gsb , more product variety that reduces r1gsh or better amenities β gsh –the market
share is higher and the welfare gain greater. Hence, these market share changes capture all the
potential consumer benefits of shopping through the e-commerce option. The magnitude of
the welfare gain depends on the elasticity of substitution. Observed e-commerce market shares
will imply smaller welfare changes if consumers substitute between local shopping options very
elastically, and larger welfare changes if they are inelastic. A similar logic would apply to effects
on the entry of local retailers, or on the exit of local stores (where a large period 0 market share
means large welfare losses, again tempered by the elasticity of substitution).

Appendix F: RCT and Data Appendix
F.1 Program Description and Background
    Following the announcement of the policy objective to expand e-commerce to the Chinese
countryside as part of the so-called Number One Central Document in January 2014, the Chinese
government entered a partnership with a large firm that operates a popular Chinese e-commerce
platform. The program’s objective is to provide e-commerce access in rural markets at the same
price, convenience and service quality that buyers and producers face in their county’s main city
center. The firm’s objective as part of the program is to penetrate the vast and largely untapped
e-commerce market outside of Chinese cities. Rural expansion is one of the firm’s strategic
priorities over the coming years.
    The program makes two main types of investments to enable villagers to buy and sell online
through the firm’s platform. First, the program invests in the local distribution network, which
the firms views as a necessary condition to provide e-commerce access in rural areas. Before the
arrival of the program, most villages were not serviced by commercial parcel delivery operators,
who had not solved the problem of the “last mile” transportation between dispersed rural
households and urban county centers.8
    The program sets out to change this lack of service with logistics investments targeted at
e-commerce. In particular, the firm oversees the construction of warehouses that serve as logis-
tical nodes to pool all e-commerce-related transportation requests to and from the participating
   8 To  receive packages via mail in absence of commercial parcel delivery services, rural households have to travel
to the county or township center to pick up the package after receiving notification by mail that it has arrived.

                                                          22
villages. These warehouses are located close to the main urban center of the counties with good
cross-county transport access. The program also fully subsidizes the transportation cost between
these warehouses and participating villages, so that rural households face the same delivery
costs and prices as households in the urban parts of the county. The rationale for this subsidy
is that village deliveries and pickups start from a low basis, which due to economies of scale
in rural transportation makes the starting phase of e-commerce prohibitively costly for village
customers despite the investments in warehouses. The calculation of the government and the
firm is that as the scale of rural e-commerce grows, per unit transport costs will decline enough
to remove the need for a subsidy. Neither the warehouses nor the last-mile subsidy can be used
for shipments outside of the firm’s e-commerce platform.
    The second investment is the installation of a program terminal in a central village location.
The e-commerce terminal is a PC, keyboard and mouse connected to a flat-screen monitor
mounted on the wall of a dedicated shop space and displaying the firm’s website. On the screen,
consumers and producers can choose their purchases or see their sales requests on the platform.
The firm employs a terminal manager to assist local households in buying and selling products
through the firm’s e-commerce platform. The terminal manager receives a reward of about 3-5
percent for each transaction completed through the terminal. Before deciding on terminal instal-
lations, the firm solicits applications from potential local store operators and schedules an exam
for the applicants. The score of this exam is one of the criteria that the firm uses to determine
whether a village is a candidate. Villagers can pay in cash when the products arrive at the store
for pickup, or they get paid upon delivery of their products for pickup at the store location
if selling online. Instead of using the terminal interface, households can also use the firm’s
e-commerce platform remotely on smartphones or PCs to order product deliveries or pickups at
the terminal location. When referring to the new e-commerce option in the text, we include all
types of use of the e-commerce platform. The firm views the option to use the village terminals
as overcoming three challenges that are specific to the rural population. First, local households
may not be used to or comfortable with navigating online platforms. Second, they often do not
have access to online payment methods. And third, they may not trust online purchases or sales
before inspecting the goods in person or having interacted with buyers directly.
F.2 Surveyor Training and Quality Management
Piloting and Surveyor Training Our survey supervisors are professionals from the Research
Center for Contemporary China (RCCC) at Peking University. All RCCC supervisors have
previous experience conducting large scale surveys in rural China. Before each of the two
survey rounds, we traveled to Beijing to lead a one-day training workshop targeted at the
supervisors and a group of graduate students from Renmin University and Jinan University,
who were working with us as research assistants on this project. This training walked the RCCC
supervisors and our graduate students through each step of the survey design, data collection
protocols and quality control protocols that we had shared with them to study carefully in
advance. Given budget and time constraints, the survey was paper based. Prior to our baseline
survey, RCCC supervisors and our team of graduate students tested our survey design in a pilot
survey of 45 households in two villages located in the rural parts of Hebei Province.
   In the field, each supervisor was in charge of a team of six surveyors. In addition to the

                                               23
supervisors, two of our trained graduate students accompanied each team in the field. The
role of the graduate students was to both support and monitor the recruitment and training
of the local surveyors and the data collection, and to report back to us with detailed daily
progress reports. Given differences in local dialects and rural conditions, the RCCC recruited
surveyors among local university students from the provinces in which the data collection took
place. All surveyors were familiar with the local dialect and customs of the rural areas in their
home province. Each surveyor completed at least two full days of training and supervised
practice questionnaire interviews before joining our field survey team. As part of the training,
we provided surveyors with a number of supporting documents. In particular, they received
an example of a completed representative survey questionnaire, detailed instructions on how
to assist households in answering the questionnaire, a set of cards containing descriptions and
examples of consumption products within categories or income-generating activities within
sectors, and a set of solutions and best practices for common survey challenges. As described in
Appendix F.5 below, we also trained surveyors to use separate pre-prepared spreadsheets to list
individual household purchase transactions within product categories or income flows by type of
activity. These spreadsheets were used for households to list individual transactions over a given
period of time and within categories, before aggregating this information up to complete the final
survey questionnaire cells. As part of their training, surveyors were trained to double-check with
respondents any answer to the questionnaire that appears inconsistent with a previous answer.
Data Quality Management and Cleaning Surveyors conducted the household survey in teams
of two. During the interview, surveyors completed the questionnaire, along with supporting
documents used to help households recall, categorize and sum up their consumption expendi-
tures or earnings (we further describe data collection and variable construction for expenditure
and earning variables below). As part of quality control, supervisors reviewed one randomly
chosen completed questionnaire, supporting documents, and interview audio tape from each
surveyor at the end of every day.9 In addition, our graduate students monitored the survey
teams by accompanying them for part of their interviews, and reported back to the supervisors
and our team in case of concerns. During recruiting and surveyor training, the surveyors had
been informed that lack of accuracy, diligence or patience in the interviews would lead to
the termination of employment, while a good record guaranteed a letter of recommendation
confirming participation in our research project.
    We also asked our surveyors to rate each household respondent along a number of di-
mensions such as cooperativeness, reliability, level of understanding, and level of interest in
our survey. Surveyors also recorded the presence of any other household or non-household
member whose presence could affect answers to our questionnaire. In our analysis of the data,
we paid special attention to the reliability rating: 1. completely reliable, 2. mostly reliable,
and 3. sometimes not reliable. Whenever surveyors rated a respondent as “sometimes not
reliable”, they also wrote down an explanation for this rating. On the basis of these written
explanations, we created a clean household survey dataset. This dataset excludes 0.25 percent
of unreliable/uncooperative households entirely from the sample. In other cases, surveyors’
explanation suggested that only answers to a particular section of our questionnaire were
   9 Some   households opted out of audio-recording.

                                                       24
unreliable. Using this information, we set all income variables to missing for 1.06 percent of all
household respondents, all consumption variables to missing for 0.4 percent of households, and
all income and consumption variables to missing for 1.31 percent of households. The descriptive
statistics in Tables A.1 to A.4 are based on this cleaned household survey dataset. When using
total nominal retail expenditure or incomes in RMB as part of the dependent variables on the
left-hand side of the regressions, we censor these reported values at the one-percent level from
the left and right tails within the survey round.10 Similarly, price changes between rounds are
censored at the 1 percent level. The point estimates remain statistical zeros in all these cases, as
is the case post-censoring in the draft, but the standard errors slightly increase. Appendix F.5
below provides additional information about variable construction.
F.3 Experimental Design
    Appendix Figure A.1 presents a map of the locations where the RCT takes place. Tables A.1
to A.4 present descriptive statistics.
Selection of Provinces and Counties
    There are two main factors determining our survey location in Anhui, Henan and Guizhou,
and the 8 counties within these provinces. First, our survey location depended on the timing
of the program’s roll-out across different provinces and counties, which had been decided
before our collaboration with the firm. Second, we were guided by the internal evaluation of
the program’s senior managers as to whether the provincial and county managers in question
would be willing to cooperate with our research protocol. These counties are: Huoqiu (Anhui),
Linying (Henan), Linzhou (Henan), Minquan (Henan), Suixi (Anhui), Tianchang (Anhui),
Xifeng (Guizhou) and Zhenning (Guizhou). In Appendix D, we are also able to investigate the
representativeness of our sample villages relative to all participating villages using the firm’s
internal transaction data in 5 provinces over this period.
Selection of Villages and Randomization
    The unit of randomization is the village. For each county, we obtain a list of candidates that
had been extended by 5 promising village candidates that would have not been part of the list in
absence of our research. The three main factors determining the village selection within a county
from the firm’s operational perspective are i) a sufficient level of local population, ii) accessibility
by roads, and iii) the presence of a capable store applicant (as measured by the applicant’s test
score). Overall, we are able to implement randomization on a broad pool of villages selected
for participation in the program. This pool, however, is not a random sample of China’ rural
areas, but instead is likely a group of villages positively selected within each county, with better
expected conditions for e-commerce usage on both consumption and production sides.
    Upon receipt of this extended list of village candidates for each county, we randomly select
5 control villages and 7-8 treatment villages. The remaining villages on the extended list receive
program terminals as planned. The full sample thus includes 40 control villages and 60 treatment
villages across the 8 counties, which we selected from a total number of candidates of 432 villages
that we received in the extended listings from the 8 county operations teams (on average 54

  10 Given more than one percent of observations report zero incomes, nominal incomes are only censored at the
one-percent level from the right tail.

                                                     25
villages per county). We restrict the list of villages entering the stratification and randomization
to villages with at least 2.5 km distance to the nearest village on the county list, where possible.11
We then stratify treatment and control villages along four dimensions. First, we balance the
selection of treatment and control to both have a ratio of 85:15 with respect to pre-existing
availability of commercial package delivery (85% not available, 15% available), which is close
to the observed ratio among all candidate villages. We obtain information on the availability
of commercial package delivery for each village on the candidate list from the program’s local
county managers (who are not aware what we require that piece of information for). As we
discuss below, having villages in our sample with pre-existing commercial delivery services
allows us to further investigate the effect of the program that is driven by the terminal access
point (i.e. the effect of lifting only the transactional barrier), relative to the effect of providing
both the terminal access point and the necessary logistics for local e-commerce deliveries and
pick-ups (i.e. the effect of lifting both the transactional and logistical barrier to e-commerce). We
further stratify the selection of treatment and control villages on the basis of the equally-weighted
average of the z-scores for three village variables: the local store applicants’ test score, the village
population, and the ratio of non-agricultural employment over the local population. We obtain
the last variable from the establishment-level data of the Chinese Economic Census of 2008
which surveys every non-agricultural establishment in the counties.
Sampling of Households, Response Rates and Attrition
    Our team was granted a two-week window for data collection, after receiving the extended
candidate list of candidate villages from the local operation team in each county. Given this
tight timeline, we were unable to conduct a village census for sampling purposes. Instead, our
survey teams created detailed maps of all residences in the village to implement a random walk
procedure.12
    From each village’s map, we defined an “inner zone” of residences within a 300 meter radius
of the planned terminal location and an “outer zone” outside that radius. In the baseline data
collection (December 2015 and January 2016 in Anhui and Henan, and April and May 2016 in
Guizhou), the objective was to sample 14 households from the inner zone and 14 households
from the outer zone. To randomly sample households within these zones, we selected 24
residences in both inner and outer zones. The household sampling proceeds as follows: we
first randomly assign numbers to all residences within the zone on the map from 1 to n, and
then define a rounded integer number n/24. Starting from household number 1, we then collect
survey data from every household number in steps of the integer n/24 until we have completed
14 surveys within the zone. For the endline data collection (12 months after baseline in each
village), we implement the same procedure for all households that were not part of the baseline


    11 In counties with relatively short candidate lists we had to marginally extent this threshold, leading to a small

number of villages with less than 2.5 km distances to the nearest other villages on the candidate list. The mean and
median distances for villages without terminals to the nearest terminal location were 10.6 and 9.1 km respectively.
Also see related spillover analysis in Appendix C.
    12 We use the boundary of the “natural village” as opposed to the “administrative village”. Both of these are known

delineations in China. The natural village captures a geographically contiguous rural population. Administrative
villages are units with a village committee. In some cases, the administrative village includes more than one natural
village.

                                                          26
survey to select 10 additional households within the inner zone.13 In the few cases in which there
were fewer than 24 residences within the inner zone, we extended the radius until we obtain
at least 24 residences on the map. If either the survey respondent or the primary earner of the
initially surveyed household no longer resides at the same address, we record this in our data
and replace the household with another randomly sampled household within the same sampling
zone (inner or outer). In our welfare analysis, we report results both before and after weighting
each sampled household in proportion to the share of the village population in its sampling zone.
    After introducing our survey to households, our surveyors asked for the household member
with the best knowledge of household consumption expenditures and household incomes to
respond to the questionnaire. In case nobody answered the door, or in case this most suited
household member was not at home during our surveyors’ first visit, the surveyors returned
at least twice to complete the interview, often outside of working hours. Surveyors were also
instructed to skip households with a most knowledgeable respondent older than 75. Overall, our
surveyors found willing and able respondents in two thirds of visited residences (66.1 percent).14
In the endline, we sampled 10 additional households from the inner zone. We used the same
sampling methodology as in the baseline. Given expected sample attrition and the objective of
10 randomly selected additional households, the survey teams created a list of 22 new residential
addresses in the inner zone and 6 new addresses in the outer zone. In the endline, we replaced a
household respondent from the baseline whenever either the household had moved, the primary
earner was no longer living there or the original baseline respondent was unavailable after
three interview attempts. Using this rule, 71 percent of baseline respondents completed our
questionnaire in the endline. As documented in appendix Table A.15, this percentage does not
differ in treatment and control villages.
F.4 Retail Price Survey
Store Sampling Prior to the field survey, RCCC supervisors performed a census of all retail
stores and market stalls (“stores” for short) located in the village and within a 15-minute walking
distance of the boundaries of the natural village. Most villages have fewer than five stores, so in
most villages we sampled products from all stores and market stalls in the vicinity of the village.
If there were more than 15 stores in a village, we instructed supervisors to collect a representative
sample of local retail information, giving more weight (i.e. more price quotes) to more popular
establishments within product groups.
Product Sampling and Data Collection The data collection for the local retail price survey
was conducted by the trained RCCC supervisors. We aim to collect data on 115 price quotes
for each village. 100 of these prices are from the same 9 household consumption categories for
retail products as in our household survey (food and beverages, tobacco and alcohol, medicine
and health, clothing and accessories, other every-day products, fuel and gas, furniture and
appliances, electronics, transport equipment), and 15 price quotes are for local production and
business inputs. Our protocol for the price data collection closely follows the IMF/ILO standards
   13 This extended sample was possible due to a small remaining positive balance on the project account that we

decided to invest in expanding the household survey sample.
   14 Of the one third of addresses at which our surveyors did not encounter willing and able respondents, 56.6

percent had nobody at home during any of our three visits, 30.5 percent refused to participate in the survey, 7.5
percent had no qualified respondent (due to old age), and 5.4 percent had no one living there.

                                                       27
for store price surveys that central banks collect to compute the CPI statistics. The sampling of
products across consumption categories is based on budget shares of rural households in Anhui
and Henan that we observe in the microdata of the China Family Panel Study (CFPS) for 2012.
Reflecting these consumption weights, supervisors in the baseline survey data aim to collect
47/100 price quotes in food and beverages, 15/100 in tobacco and alcohol, 9/100 in medicine and
health, 9/100 in clothing and accessories, 4/100 in other every-day products, 4/100 in fuel and
gas, 4/100 in furniture and appliances, 4/100 in electronics and 4/100 in transport equipment.
In addition, we collect 15 price quotes for purchases of inputs to production or businesses.15
    We provided supervisors with pre-prepared price surveys reflecting the number of observa-
tions to be collected for each product group. As for the collection of data on household expenses
that we discuss above and in Appendix F.5 below, the supervisors were provided with detailed
product cards that list product groups within each of the 10 broad categories above, as well as
examples of product types within those subgroups of products. They also received instructions
on product sampling, for instance about how to evaluate the popularity of an individual product
by measuring shelf space and recurrence across different stores. To ensure that we can match
identical products in both survey rounds, supervisors saved a picture of each product and
recorded product characteristics at the barcode-equivalent level, including packaging type, size,
and a detailed product description (name, brand, flavor, etc) wherever possible.16 For 78 percent
of products collected in the baseline, we were able to find the exact same product in the same
store one year later in the endline. As documented in appendix Table A.8, this percentage is
somewhat smaller in intent to treat villages than in control villages, but this difference is not
statistically significant. One challenge of surveying prices in rural China is a frequent lack of
price tags displayed in store. As shown in Table A.4, about two thirds of the surveyed products
lacked a price tag. In these cases, supervisors asked the store owner for the price that villagers
would pay for the product. As part of quality control, we asked supervisors to rate the reliability
of store owners’ price quotes as good, average or poor. None of the reported findings change
in sign, size or statistical significance when limiting the sample to price quotes from labeled
products only or excluding reportedly unreliable price quotes.
F.5 Variable Construction
    To collect data on household consumption expenditures and incomes from different activities,
we trained the surveyors in using separate pre-prepared spreadsheets before filling out the final
survey questionnaires. For expenditures, there is one spreadsheet for each of the nine categories
that we include in retail consumption, and a separate sheet for business inputs. This allowed
households to recall and list all relevant expenses or income flows within a given product group
or type of activity over a given period of time. This transaction-level information was then
aggregated in the presence of the household to complete the final survey questionnaire sections
on expenditures or income flows.
    To help respondent recall and categorize their expenditures, surveyors also received cards

   15 Supervisors sometimes failed to find enough products in a given category within the village. This was often the

case for the durable goods categories. In such cases, supervisors replaced products in these missing categories with
additional price quotes for products in “other every-day products”.
   16 Some store owners refused to let supervisors take pictures. In such cases, we identify identical products in the

endline data based on the same store and the detailed recorded product description.

with examples of products in each category. The product cards break down the retail consump-
tion space into 169 product types within the 10 broad categories we list above. After recording
each item in a given category, surveyors go through the list of items and ask respondents how
much they paid for each listed purchase. In addition to allocating transactions to different
consumption product groups, the surveyors also recorded the modality of each listed purchase
transaction (e.g. online vs offline, in the village vs outside the village). This procedure was
implemented covering a two-week time window for non-durable household consumption,
and a three-month time window for durable goods categories. To obtain total monthly retail
expenditure, we multiply the bi-weekly expenditure on non-durables by a factor of 2 and divide
durable good expenditure by a factor of 3, and sum up across the 9 consumption categories.
For expenditures on the new e-commerce option, we include both direct use of the terminal
interface as well as remote usage by ordering deliveries to the terminal through the firm’s app.
The majority of terminal usage are done in person at the terminal rather than remotely. In most
village cases, deliveries and pickups can be made at the terminal location (90 percent). In about
10 percent of cases, the logistics operators offered delivery to the home address too.
    To construct total household income, our surveyors again used a pre-prepared spreadsheet
to assist households in recording each of their individual income sources over the last month.
We defined four income categories: farm earnings, non-farm earnings, remittances (money
or in-kind) from family not living in the home, and all other income (e.g. pension, returns
from savings, gifts). In addition, we recorded sector of activity and occupation categories for
each economically active member of the household. To help household respondents recall and
categorize earnings, surveyors used cards with detailed examples of income sources in each
category and proceeded to collect each flow on the spreadsheet before filling out the final survey
questionnaire in the presence of the household. Our measure of income per capita is the sum
of all income sources in these four categories, divided by the number of household members.
Our measure of income net of transfers subtracts gifts and remittances from family not living
in the home.17 Our measure of income per capita net of costs subtracts the recorded household
expenses used to generate the reported flows of income. The income variables exclude the
market value of home production for own consumption.18 Including this as part of household
income has no effect on the statistical zeros that we report in the analysis.
    Finally, for households who were either replaced or added as part of our extended sample
in the second round (from 28 to 38 households), we define yhv     Pre in specification (1) as the mean

pre-treatment outcome of households living in the same zone (inner or outer) in the same
village. The implicit assumption is that households were not induced to move within or across
villages as a result of the program. As reported in appendix Table A.15, we find no evidence that
households in treated villages are more or less likely to reside at the same address at endline. We
also find no treatment effect on migration decisions of members within households.




  17 Remittances  represent on average 13 percent of total household income in our sample.
  18 The market value of all food and beverages that the household produces for its own consumption amounts to on
average less than 10 percent of household incomes.

F.6 Township-Level Data on Trade Market Access
    As part of our analysis of potential spillover effects on the control group in Appendix C,
we estimate the fraction of a rural location’s total trade market access that stems from trading
relationships with other rural locations in the same county, as opposed to access to larger urban
markets within and outside the county. To do this, we use geocoded township-level data from
the Chinese Population Census in 2010, which contains information on the recorded population
for each of roughly 45,000 township-level administrative units in China,19 the coordinates of
the centroid of each of those units, the type of township-level unit (e.g. urban zones, rural
townships) and data on the value added per rural and urban worker at the province level for
2010. See Appendix C for further discussion and details about the estimation.

   19 This includes both the registered and non-registered population currently residing in the unit at the time of the

census. Townships are the most disaggregated unit of observation that we can obtain the full census database for. In
China’s administrative hierarchy, townships are one layer above villages. In the countryside, townships include on
average about 14 villages. In urban regions, township-level units are one level below urban districts.
