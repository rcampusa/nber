Evaluating Public Programs with Close Substitutes: The Case of Head Start
Patrick Kline and Christopher Walters
NBER Working Paper No. 21658
October 2015, Revised March 2016
JEL No. H43

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper empirically evaluates the cost-effectiveness of Head Start, the largest early-childhood
education program in the United States. Using data from the Head Start Impact Study (HSIS), we
show that Head Start draws roughly a third of its participants from competing preschool
programs, many of which receive public funds. Accounting for the public savings associated with
reduced enrollment in other subsidized preschools substantially increases estimates of the
program's rate of return. To parse Head Start's test score impacts relative to home care and
competing preschools, we selection correct test scores in each care environment using excluded
interactions between experimental offer status and household characteristics. We find that Head
Start's effects are greater for children who would not otherwise attend preschool and for children
that are less likely to participate in the program.

I.     Introduction
Many government programs provide services that can be obtained, in roughly comparable form, via
markets or through other public organizations. The presence of close program substitutes compli-
cates the task of program evaluation by generating ambiguity regarding which causal estimands are
of interest. Standard intent-to-treat impacts from experimental demonstrations can yield unduly
negative assessments of program effectiveness if most participants would receive similar services
in the absence of an intervention (Heckman et al., 2000). On the other hand, experiments that
artificially restrict substitution alternatives may yield impacts that are not representative of the
costs and benefits of actual policy changes.
     This paper assesses the cost-effectiveness of Head Start – a prominent public education program
for which close public and private substitutes are widely available. Head Start is the largest early-
childhood education program in the United States. Launched in 1965 as part of President Lyndon
Johnson’s war on poverty, the program has evolved from an eight-week summer program into a
year-round program that offers education, health, and nutrition services to disadvantaged children
and their families. By 2013, Head Start enrolled about 900,000 3- and 4-year-old children at a cost
of $7.6 billion (US DHHS, 2013).
     Views on the effectiveness of Head Start vary widely (Ludwig and Phillips, 2007 and Gibbs,
Ludwig and Miller, 2011 provide reviews). A number of observational studies find substantial short-
and long-run impacts on test scores and other outcomes (Currie and Thomas, 1995; Garces et al.,
2002; Ludwig and Miller, 2007; Deming, 2009; Carneiro and Ginja, forthcoming). By contrast,
a recent randomized evaluation – the Head Start Impact Study (HSIS) – finds small impacts on
test scores that fade out quickly (Puma et al., 2010, 2012). These results have generally been
interpreted as evidence that Head Start is ineffective and in need of reform (Barnett, 2011; Klein,
2011).
     Two observations suggest such conclusions are premature. First, research on early childhood
interventions finds long run gains in adult outcomes despite short run fadeout of test score impacts
(Heckman et al., 2010, 2013; Chetty et al., 2011, 2014b). Second, roughly one-third of the HSIS
control group participated in alternate forms of preschool. This suggests that the HSIS may have
shifted many students between different sorts of preschools without altering their exposure to
preschool services. The aim of this paper is to clarify how the presence of substitute preschools
affects the interpretation of the HSIS results and the cost-effectiveness of the Head Start program.
     Our study begins by revisiting the experimental impacts of the HSIS on student test scores.
We replicate the fade-out pattern found in previous work but find that adjusting for experimental
non-compliance leads to imprecise estimates of the effect of Head Start participation beyond the
first year of the experiment. As a result, the conclusion of complete effect fadeout is less clear than
naive intent-to-treat estimates suggest. Turning to substitution patterns, we find that roughly one
third of Head Start compliers in the HSIS experiment would have participated in other forms of
preschool had they not been lotteried into the program. These alternative preschools draw heavily
on public funding, which mitigates the net costs to government of shifting children from other

                                                  2
preschools into Head Start.
   These facts motivate a theoretical analysis clarifying which parameters are (and are not) pol-
icy relevant when publicly subsidized program substitutes are present. We work with a stylized
model where test score impacts are valued according to their effects on children’s after-tax lifetime
earnings. We show that, when competing preschool programs are not rationed, the policy-relevant
causal parameter governing the benefits of Head Start expansion is an average effect of Head Start
participation relative to the next best alternative, regardless of whether that alternative is a com-
peting program or home care. This parameter coincides with the local average treatment effect
(LATE) identified by a randomized experiment with imperfect compliance when the experiment
contains a representative sample of program “compliers” (Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin, 1996).
Hence, imperfect compliance and program substitution, often thought to be confounding limita-
tions of social experiments, turn out to be virtues when the substitution patterns in the experiment
replicate those found in the broader population.
   We use this result to derive an estimable benefit cost ratio associated with Head Start expan-
sions. This ratio scales Head Start’s projected impacts on the after-tax earnings of children by
its net costs to government inclusive of fiscal externalities. Chief among these externalities is the
cost savings that arise when Head Start draws children away from competing subsidized preschool
programs. While such effects are typically ignored in cost-benefit analyses of Head Start and other
similar programs (e.g., Council of Economic Advisers, 2015), we find via a calibration exercise that
such omissions can be quantitatively important: Head Start roughly breaks even when the cost
savings associated with program substitution are ignored, but yields benefits nearly twice as large
as costs when these savings are incorporated. This appears to be a robust finding – after accounting
for fiscal externalities, Head Start’s benefits exceed its costs whenever short run test score impacts
yield earnings gains within the range found in the recent literature.
   A limitation of our baseline analysis is that it assumes changes in program scale do not alter
the mix of program compliers. To address this issue, we also consider “structural reforms” to
Head Start that change the mix of compliers without affecting test score outcomes. Examples
of such reforms might include increased transportation services, marketing efforts, or spending on
program features that parents value. Households who respond to structural reforms may differ from
experimental compliers on unobserved dimensions, including their mix of counterfactual program
choices. Assessing these reforms therefore requires knowledge of parameters not directly identified
by the HSIS experiment. Specifically, we show that such reforms require identification of a variant
of the marginal treatment effect (MTE) concept of Heckman and Vytlacil (1999).
   To assess reforms that attract new children, we develop a selection model that parameterizes
variation in treatment effects with respect to counterfactual care alternatives as well as observed
and unobserved child characteristics. We prove that the model parameters are identified, and
propose a two-step control function estimator that exploits heterogeneity in the response to Head
Start offers across sites and demographic groups to infer relationships between unobserved factors
driving preschool enrollment and potential outcomes. The estimator is shown to pass a variety of


                                                   3
specification tests and to accurately reproduce patterns of treatment effect heterogeneity found in
the experiment. The model estimates indicate that Head Start has large positive short run effects
on the test scores of children who would have otherwise been cared for at home, and insignificant
effects on children who would otherwise attend other preschools – a finding corroborated by Feller
et al. (2014), who reach similar conclusions using principal stratification methods (Frangakis and
Rubin, 2002). Our estimates also reveal a “reverse Roy” pattern of selection whereby children with
unobserved characteristics that make them less likely to enroll in Head Start experience larger test
score gains.
   We conclude with an assessment of prospects for increasing Head Start’s rate of return via
outreach to new populations. Our estimates suggest that expansions of Head Start could boost
the program’s rate of return provided that the proposed technology for increasing enrollment (e.g.
improved transportation services) is not too costly. We also use our estimated selection model
to examine the robustness of our results to rationing of competing preschools. Rationing implies
that competing subsidized preschools do not contract when Head Start expands, which shuts down
a form of public savings. On the other hand, expanding Head Start generates opportunities for
new children to fill vacated seats in substitute programs. Our estimates indicate that the effect on
test scores (and therefore earnings) of moving children from home care to competing preschools is
substantial, leading us to conclude that rationing is unlikely to undermine the favorable estimated
rates of return found in our baseline analysis.
   The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II provides background on Head Start.
Section III describes the HSIS data and basic experimental impacts. Section IV presents evidence on
substitution patterns. Section V introduces a theoretical framework for assessing public programs
with close substitutes. Section VI provides a cost-benefit analysis of Head Start. Section VII
develops our econometric selection model and discusses identification and estimation. Section VIII
reports estimates of the model. Section IX simulates the effects of structural program reforms.
Section X concludes.


II.    Background on Head Start
Head Start provides preschool for disadvantaged children in the United States. The program is
funded by federal grants awarded to local public or private organizations. Grantees are required
to match at least 20 percent of their Head Start awards from other sources and must meet a set of
program-wide performance criteria. Eligibility for Head Start is generally limited to children from
households below the federal poverty line, though families above this threshold may be eligible if
they meet other criteria such as participation in the Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF)
program. Up to 10 percent of a Head Start center’s enrollment can also come from higher-income
families. The program is free: Head Start grantees are prohibited from charging families fees for
services (US DHHS, 2014). It is also oversubscribed: in 2002, 85 percent of Head Start participants
attended programs with more applicants than available seats (Puma et al., 2010).


                                                  4
    Head Start is not the only form of subsidized preschool available to poor families. Preschool par-
ticipation rates for disadvantaged children have risen over time as cities and states expanded their
public preschool offerings (Cascio and Schanzenbach, 2013). Moreover, the Child Care Develop-
ment Fund program provides block grants that finance childcare subsidies for low-income families,
often in the form of childcare vouchers that can be used for center-based preschool (US DHHS,
2012). Most states also use TANF funds to finance additional childcare subsidies (Schumacher et
al., 2001). Because Head Start services are provided by local organizations who themselves must
raise outside funds, it is unclear to what extent Head Start and other public preschool programs
actually differ in their education technology.
    A large non-experimental literature suggests that Head Start produced large short- and long-
run benefits for early cohorts of program participants. Several studies estimate the effects of Head
Start by comparing program participants to their non-participant siblings (Currie and Thomas,
1995; Garces et al., 2002; Deming, 2009). Results from this research design show positive short run
effects on test scores and long run effects on educational attainment, earnings and crime. Other
studies exploit discontinuities in Head Start program rules to infer program effects (Ludwig and
Miller, 2007; Carneiro and Ginja, forthcoming). These studies show longer run improvements in
health outcomes and criminal activity.
    In contrast to these non-experimental estimates, results from a recent randomized controlled
trial reveal smaller, less-persistent effects. The 1998 Head Start reauthorization bill included a
congressional mandate to determine the effects of the program. This mandate resulted in the HSIS:
an experiment in which more than more than 4,000 applicants were randomly assigned via lottery
to either a treatment group with access to Head Start or a control group without access in the Fall
of 2002. The experimental results showed that a Head Start offer increased measures of cognitive
achievement by roughly 0.1 standard deviations during preschool, but that these gains faded out
by kindergarten. Moreover, the experiment showed little evidence of effects on non-cognitive or
health outcomes (Puma et al., 2010, 2012). These results suggest both smaller short-run effects
and faster fadeout than non-experimental estimates for earlier cohorts. Scholars and policymakers
have generally interpreted the HSIS results as evidence that Head Start is ineffective and in need
of reform (Barnett, 2011). The experimental results have also been cited in the popular media
to motivate calls for dramatic restructuring or elimination of the program (Klein, 2011; Stossel,
2014).1
    Differences between the HSIS results and the non-experimental literature could be due to
changes in program effectiveness over time or to selection bias in non-experimental sibling compar-
    1
      Subsequent analyses of the HSIS data suggest caveats to this negative interpretation, but do not overturn the
finding of modest mean test score impacts accompanied by rapid fadeout. Gelber and Isen (2013) find persistent
effects on parental engagement with children. Bitler et al. (2014) find larger experimental impacts at low quantiles of
the test score distribution. These quantile treatment effects fade out by first grade, though there is some evidence of
persistent effects at the bottom of the distribution for Spanish-speakers. Walters (2015) finds evidence of substantial
heterogeneity in impacts across experimental sites and investigates the relationship between this heterogeneity and
observed program characteristics. Walters finds smaller effects for Head Start centers that draw more children from
other preschools rather than home care, a finding we explore in more detail here.

isons. Another explanation, however, is that these two research designs identify different parame-
ters. Most non-experimental analyses have focused on recovering the effect of Head Start relative to
home care. In contrast, the HSIS measures the effect of Head Start relative to a mix of alternative
care environments, including other preschools.


III.       Data and Experimental Impacts
Before turning to an analysis of program substitution issues, we first describe the HSIS data and
report experimental impacts on test scores and program compliance.

III.A. Data
Our core analysis sample includes 3,571 HSIS applicants with non-missing baseline characteristics
and Spring 2003 test scores. Appendix A describes construction of this sample. The outcome of
interest is a summary index of cognitive test scores that averages Woodcock Johnson III (WJIII)
test scores with Peabody Picture and Vocabulary Test (PPVT) scores, normed to have mean zero
and variance one in the control group by cohort and year. We use WJIII and PPVT scores because
these are among the most reliable tests in the HSIS data; both are also available in each year of
the experiment, allowing us to produce comparable estimates over time.
       Table I provides summary statistics for our analysis sample. The HSIS experiment included
two age cohorts: 55 percent of applicants were randomized at age 3 and could attend Head Start
for up to two years, while the remaining 45 percent were randomized at age 4 and could attend
for up to one year. The demographic information in Table I shows that the Head Start population
is disadvantaged. Less than half of Head Start applicants live in two-parent households, and the
average applicant’s household earns about 90 percent of the federal poverty line. Column (2) of
Table I compares these and other baseline characteristics for the HSIS treatment and control groups
to check balance in randomization. The results here indicate that randomization was successful:
baseline characteristics were similar for offered and non-offered applicants.2
       Columns (3) through (5) of Table I report summary statistics for children attending Head
Start, other preschool centers, and no preschool.3 Children in other preschools tend to be less
disadvantaged than children in Head Start or no preschool, though most differences between these
groups are modest. The other preschool group has a lower share of high school dropout mothers, a
higher share of mothers who attended college, and higher average household income than the Head
Start and no preschool groups. Children in other preschools outscore the other groups by about
0.1 standard deviations on a baseline summary index of cognitive skills. The other preschool group
   2
     Random assignment in the HSIS occurred at the Head Start center level, and offer probabilities differed across
centers. We weight all models by the inverse probability of a child’s assignment, calculated as the site-specific fraction
of children assigned to the treatment group. Because the numbers of treatment and control children at each center
were fixed in advance, this is an error-free measure of the probability of an offer (Puma et al., 2010).
   3
     Preschool attendance is measured from the HSIS “focal arrangement type” variable, which combines information
from parent interviews and teacher/care provider interviews to construct a summary measure of the childcare setting.
See Appendix A for details.

also includes a relatively large share of four-year-olds, likely reflecting the fact that alternative
preschool options are more widely available for four-year-olds (Cascio and Schanzenbach, 2013).

III.B. Experimental Impacts
Table II reports experimental impacts on test scores. Columns (1), (4) and (7) report intent-to-
treat impacts of the Head Start offer, separately by year and age cohort. To increase precision,
we regression-adjust these treatment/control differences using the baseline characteristics in Table
I.4 The intent-to-treat estimates mirror those previously reported in the literature (e.g., Puma et
al., 2010). In the first year of the experiment, children offered Head Start scored higher on the
summary index. For example, three-year-olds offered Head Start gained 0.19 standard deviations in
test score outcomes relative to those denied Head Start. The corresponding effect for four-year-olds
is 0.14 standard deviations. However, these gains diminish rapidly: the pooled impact falls to a
statistically insignificant 0.02 standard deviations by year three. Our data includes a fourth year
of follow-up for the three-year-old cohort. Here too, the intent-to-treat is small and statistically
insignificant (0.038 standard deviations).
       Interpretation of these intent-to-treat impacts is clouded by noncompliance with random as-
signment. Columns (2), (5) and (8) of Table II report first-stage effects of assignment to Head Start
on the probability of participating in Head Start and Columns (3), (6) and (9) report instrumental
variables (IV) estimates, which scale the intent-to-treat estimates by the first stage estimates.5
These estimates can be interpreted as local average treatment effects (LATEs) for “compliers” –
children who respond to the Head Start offer by enrolling in Head Start. Assignment to Head Start
increases the probability of participation by two-thirds in the first year after random assignment.
The corresponding IV estimate implies that Head Start attendance boosts first-year test scores by
0.247 standard deviations.
       Compliance for the three-year-old cohort falls after the first year as members of the control
group reapply for Head Start, resulting in larger standard errors for estimates in later years of the
experiment. The first stage for three-year-olds falls to 0.36 in the second year, while the intent-
to-treat falls roughly in proportion, generating a second-year IV estimate of 0.245 for this cohort.
Estimates in years three and four are statistically insignificant and imprecise. The fourth-year
estimate for the three-year-old cohort (corresponding to first grade) is 0.110 standard deviations,
with a standard error of 0.098. The corresponding first grade estimate for four year olds is 0.081
   4
     The control vector includes gender, race, assignment cohort, teen mother, mother’s education, mother’s marital
status, presence of both parents, an only child dummy, a Spanish language indicator, dummies for quartiles of family
income and missing income, urban status, an indicator for whether the Head Start center provides transportation,
an index of Head Start center quality, and a third-order polynomial in baseline test scores.
   5
     Here we define Head Start participation as enrollment at any time prior to the test. This definition includes
attendance at Head Start centers outside the experimental sample. An experimental offer may cause some children
to switch from an out-of-sample center to an experimental center; if the quality of these centers differs, the exclusion
restriction required for our IV approach is violated. Appendix Table A.I compares characteristics of centers attended
by children in the control group (always takers) to those of the experimental centers to which these children applied.
These two groups of centers are very similar, suggesting that substitution between Head Start centers is unlikely to
bias our estimates.



                                                           7
with a standard error of 0.060. Notably, the 95-percent confidence intervals for first-grade impacts
include effects as large as 0.2 standard deviations for four-year-olds and 0.3 standard deviations
for three-year-olds. These results show that although the longer-run estimates are insignificant,
they are also imprecise due to experimental noncompliance. Evidence for fadeout is therefore less
definitive than the naive intent-to-treat estimates suggest. This observation helps to reconcile
the HSIS results with observational studies based on sibling comparisons, which show effects that
partially fade out but are still detectable in elementary school (Currie and Thomas, 1995; Deming,
2009).6


IV.       Program Substitution
We now turn to documenting program substitution in the HSIS and how it influences our results. It
is helpful to develop some notation to describe the role of alternative care environments. Each Head
Start applicant participates in one of three possible treatments: Head Start, which we label h; other
center-based preschool programs, which we label c; and no preschool (i.e., home care), which we
label n. Let Zi ∈ {0, 1} indicate whether household i has a Head Start offer, and Di (z) ∈ {h, c, n}
denote household i’s potential treatment status as a function of the offer. Then observed treatment
status can be written Di = Di (Zi ).
    The structure of the HSIS leads to natural theoretical restrictions on substitution patterns. We
expect a Head Start offer to induce some children who would otherwise participate in c or n to
enroll in Head Start. By revealed preference, no child should switch between c and n in response
to a Head Start offer, and no child should be induced by an offer to leave Head Start. These
restrictions can be expressed succinctly by the following condition:

                                         Di (1) 6= Di (0) =⇒ Di (1) = h,                                             (1)

which extends the monotonicity assumption of Imbens and Angrist (1994) to a setting with multiple
counterfactual treatments. This restriction states that anyone who changes behavior as a result of
the Head Start offer does so to attend Head Start.7
    Under restriction (1), the population of Head Start applicants can be partitioned into five groups
defined by their values of Di (1) and Di (0):

   1. n-compliers: Di (1) = h, Di (0) = n,

   2. c-compliers: Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c,
   6
     One might also be interested in the effects of Head Start on non-cognitive outcomes, which appear to be important
mediators of the effects of early childhood programs in other contexts (Chetty et al., 2011; Heckman et al., 2013).
The HSIS includes short-run parent-reported measures of behavior and teacher-reported measures of teacher/student
relationships, and Head Start appears to have no impact on these outcomes (Puma et al., 2010; Walters, 2015). The
HSIS non-cognitive outcomes differ significantly from those analyzed in previous studies, however, and it is unclear
whether they capture the same skills.
   7
     See Engberg et al. (2014) for discussion of related restrictions in the context of attrition from experimental data.



                                                           8
  3. n-never takers: Di (1) = Di (0) = n,

  4. c-never takers: Di (1) = Di (0) = c,

  5. always takers: Di (1) = Di (0) = h.

The n- and c- compliers switch to Head Start from home care and competing preschools, respec-
tively, when offered a seat. The two groups of never takers choose not to attend Head Start
regardless of the offer. Always takers manage to enroll in Head Start even when denied an offer,
presumably by applying to other Head Start centers outside the HSIS sample.
   Using this rubric, the group of children enrolled in alternative preschool programs is a mixture
of c-never takers and c-compliers denied Head Start offers. Similarly, the group of children in home
care includes n-never takers and n-compliers without offers. The two complier subgroups switch
into Head Start when offered admission; as a result, the set of children enrolled in Head Start is a
mixture of always takers and the two groups of offered compliers.

IV.A. Substitution Patterns
Table III presents empirical evidence on substitution patterns by comparing program participation
choices for offered and non-offered households. In the first year of the experiment 8.3 percent of
households decline Head Start offers in favor of other preschool centers; this is the share of c-never
takers. Similarly, column (3) shows that 9.5 percent of households are n-never takers. As can be
seen in column (4), 13.6 percent of households manage to attend Head Start without an offer, which
is the share of always takers. The Head Start offer reduces the share of children in other centers
from 31.5 percent to 8.3 percent, and reduces the share of children in home care from 55 percent
to 9.5 percent. This implies that 23.2 percent of households are c-compliers, and 45.5 percent are
n-compliers.
   Notably, in the first year of the experiment, three year olds have uniformly higher participation
rates in Head Start and lower participation rates in competing centers, which likely reflects the
fact that many state provided programs only accept four year olds. In the second year of the
experiment, participation in Head Start drops among children in the three year old cohort with a
program offer, suggesting that many families enrolled in the first year decided that Head Start was
a bad match for their child. We also see that Head Start enrollment rises among those families that
did not obtain an offer in the first round, which reflects reapplication behavior.

IV.B. Interpreting IV
How do the substitution patterns displayed in Table III affect the interpretation of the HSIS test
score impacts? Let Yi (d) denote child i’s potential test score if he or she participates in treatment
d ∈ {h, c, n}. Observed scores are given by Yi = Yi (Di ). We shall assume that Head Start offers
affect test scores only through program participation choices. Under assumption (1), IV identifies
a variant of the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of Imbens and Angrist (1994), giving the


                                                  9
average effect of Head Start participation for compliers relative to a mix of program alternatives.
Specifically, under (1) and excludability of Head Start offers:

           E [Yi |Zi = 1] − E [Yi |Zi = 0]
                                                  = E [Yi (h) − Yi (Di (0))|Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h]
  E [1 {Di = h} |Zi = 1] − E [1 {Di = h} |Zi = 0]                                                    (2)
                                                  ≡ LAT Eh .

The left-hand side of (2) is the population coefficient from a model that instruments Head Start
attendance with the Head Start offer. This equation implies that the IV strategy employed in Table
II yields the average effect of Head Start for compliers relative to their own counterfactual care
choices, a quantity we label LAT Eh .
     We can decompose LAT Eh into a weighted average of “subLATEs” measuring the effects of
Head Start for compliers drawn from specific counterfactual alternatives as follows:

                             LAT Eh = Sc LAT Ech + (1 − Sc )LAT Enh ,                                     (3)

where LAT Edh ≡ E [Yi (h) − Yi (d)|Di (1) = h, Di (0) = d] gives the average treatment effect on
                                                       P (Di (1)=h,Di (0)=c)
d−compliers for d ∈ {c, n} and the weight Sc ≡         P (Di (1)=h,Di (0)6=h)   gives the fraction of compli-
ers drawn from other preschools.
     Column (7) of Table III reports estimates of Sc by year and cohort, computed as minus the ratio
of the Head Start offer’s effect on other preschool attendance to its effect on Head Start attendance
(see Appendix B). In the first year of the HSIS experiment, 34 percent of compliers would have
otherwise attended competing preschools. IV estimates combine effects for these compliers with
effects for compliers who would not otherwise attend preschool.
     As detailed in Appendix D, the competing preschools attended by c-compliers are largely
publicly funded and provide services roughly comparable to Head Start. The modal alternative
preschool is a state-provided preschool program, while others receive funding from a mix of public
sources (see Appendix Table A.II). Moreover, it is likely that even Head Start-eligible children at-
tending private preschool centers receive public funding (e.g., through CCDF or TANF subsidies).
We next consider the implications of substitution from these alternative preschools for assessments
of Head Start’s cost-effectiveness.


V.      A Model of Head Start Provision
In this section, we develop a model of Head Start participation with the goal of conducting a cost-
benefit analysis that acknowledges the presence of publicly subsidized program substitutes. Our
model is highly stylized and focuses on obtaining an estimable lower bound on the rate of return
to potential reforms of Head Start measured in terms of lifetime earnings. The analysis ignores
redistributional motives and any effects of human capital investment on criminal activity (Lochner
and Moretti, 2004; Heckman et al., 2010), health (Deming, 2009; Carneiro and Ginja, forthcoming),
or grade repetition (Currie, 2001). Adding such features would tend to raise the implied return to

                                                  10
Head Start. We also abstract from parental labor supply decisions because prior analyses of the
Head Start Impact Study find no short term impacts on parents’ work decisions (Puma et al., 2010,
2012).8 Again, incorporating parental labor supply responses would likely raise the program’s rate
of return.
    Our discussion emphasizes that the cost-effectiveness of Head Start is contingent upon assump-
tions regarding the structure of the market for preschool services and the nature of the specific
policy reforms under consideration. Building on the heterogeneous effects framework of the previ-
ous section, we derive expressions for policy relevant “sufficient statistics” (Chetty, 2009) in terms
of causal effects on student outcomes. Specifically, we show that a variant of the Local Average
Treatment Effect concept of Imbens and Angrist (1994) is policy relevant when considering pro-
gram expansions in an environment where slots in competing preschools are not rationed. With
rationing, a mix of LATEs becomes relevant, which poses challenges to identification with the HSIS
data. When considering reforms to Head Start program features that change selection into the
program, the policy relevant parameter is shown to be a variant of the Marginal Treatment Effect
concept of Heckman and Vytlacil (1999).

V.A. Setup
Consider a population of households, indexed by i, each with a single preschool-aged child. Each
household can enroll its child in Head Start, a competing preschool program (e.g., state subsidized
preschool), or care for the child at home. The government rations Head Start participation via
program offers Zi , which arrive at random via lottery with probability δ ≡ P (Zi = 1). Offers are
distributed in a first period. In a second period, households make enrollment decisions. Tenacious
applicants who have not received an offer can enroll in Head Start by exerting additional effort.
We begin by assuming that competing programs are not rationed and then relax this assumption
below.
    Each household has utility over its enrollment options given by the function Ui (d, z). The
argument d ∈ {h, c, n} indexes child care environments, while the argument z ∈ {0, 1} indexes offer
status. Head Start offers raise the value of Head Start and have no effect on the value of other
options, so that:
                        Ui (h, 1) > Ui (h, 0) , Ui (c, z) = Ui (c) , Ui (n, z) = Ui (n).

    Household i’s enrollment choice, as a function of its offer status z, is given by:

                                          Di (z) = arg max Ui (d, z) .
                                                     d∈{h,c,n}


It is straightforward to show that this model satisfies the monotonicity restriction (1). Since offers
are assigned at random, market shares for the three care environments can be written P (Di = d) =
   8
     We replicate this analysis for our sample in Table A.III, which shows that a Head Start offer has no effect on
the probability that a child’s mother works or on the likelihood of working full- vs. part-time. Recent work by Long
(2015) suggests that Head Start may have small effects on full- vs. part-time work for mothers of three-year-olds.

δP (Di (1) = d) + (1 − δ) P (Di (0) = d).

V.B. Benefits and Costs
Debate over the effectiveness of educational programs often centers on their test score impacts. A
standard means of valuing such impacts is in terms of their effects on later life earnings (Heckman
et al., 2010, 2013; Chetty et al., 2011, 2014b).9 Let the symbol B denote the total after-tax lifetime
income of a cohort of children. We assume that B is linked to test scores by the equation:

                                          B = B0 + (1 − τ ) pE [Yi ] ,                                    (4)

where p gives the market price of human capital, τ is the tax rate faced by the children of eligible
households, and B0 is an intercept reflecting how test scores are normed. Our focus on mean test
scores neglects distributional concerns which may lead us to undervalue Head Start’s test score
impacts (see Bitler et al., 2014).
      The net costs to government of financing preschool are given by:

                          C = C0 + φh P (Di = h) + φc P (Di = c) − τ pE [Yi ] ,                           (5)

where the term C0 reflects fixed costs of administering the program and φh gives the administrative
cost of providing Head Start services to an additional child. Likewise, φc gives the administrative
cost to government of providing competing preschool services (which often receive public subsidies)
to another student. The term τ pE [Yi ] captures the revenue generated by taxes on the adult earnings
of Head Start-eligible children. This formulation abstracts from the fact that program outlays must
be determined before the children enter the labor market and begin paying taxes, a complication
we will adjust for in our empirical work via discounting.

V.C. Changing Offer Probabilities
Consider now the effects of adjusting Head Start enrollment by changing the rationing probability
δ. An increase in δ draws additional households into Head Start from competing programs and
home care. As shown in Appendix C, the effect of a change in the offer rate δ on average test scores
is given by:

                         ∂E [Yi ]                                   ∂P (Di = h)
                                    =          LAT Eh        ×                  .                         (6)
                           ∂δ                  | {z }                   ∂δ
                                         Effect on compliers
                                                                    |   {z    }
                                                                  Complier density

In words, the aggregate impact on test scores of a small increase in the offer rate equals the average
impact of Head Start on complier test scores times the measure of compliers. By the arguments
                                        ∂
in Section IV, both LAT Eh and          ∂δ P   (Di = h) = P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h) are identified by the
  9
    Appendix C considers how such valuations should be adjusted when test score impacts yield labor supply re-
sponses.

HSIS experiment. Hence, (6) implies that the hypothetical effects of a market-level change in offer
probabilities can be inferred from an individual-level randomized trial with a fixed offer probability.
This convenient result follows from the assumption that Head Start offers are distributed at random
and that δ does not directly enter the alternative specific choice utilities, which in turn implies that
the composition of compliers (and hence LAT Eh ) does not change with δ. Below we explore how
this expression changes when the composition of compliers responds to a policy change.
   From (4), the marginal benefit of an increase in δ is given by:

                               ∂B                      ∂P (Di = h)
                                  = (1 − τ ) pLAT Eh ×             .
                               ∂δ                          ∂δ

The offsetting marginal cost to government of financing such an expansion can be written:
                                                                        
           ∂C                                               ∂P (Di = h)
              =      φh      −     φc S c   − τ pLAT Eh  ×             .                          (7)

           ∂δ        |{z}           |{z}        | {z }           ∂δ
                Provision Cost Public Savings Added Revenue

This cost consists of the measure of compliers times the administrative cost φh of enrolling them
in Head Start minus the probability Sc that a complying household comes from a substitute
preschool times the expected government savings φc associated with reduced enrollment in sub-
stitute preschools. The quantity φh − φc Sc can be viewed as a local average treatment effect of
Head Start on government spending for compliers. Subtracted from this effect is any extra revenue
the government gets from raising the productivity of the children of complying households.
   The ratio of marginal impacts on after-tax income and government costs gives the marginal
value of public funds (Mayshar, 1990; Hendren, 2014), which we can write:

                                        ∂B/∂δ      (1 − τ ) pLAT Eh
                           M V P Fδ ≡         =                        .                            (8)
                                        ∂C/∂δ   φh − φc Sc − τ pLAT Eh

The M V P Fδ gives the value of an extra dollar spent on Head Start net of fiscal externalities. These
fiscal externalities include reduced spending on competing subsidized programs (captured by the
term φc Sc ) and additional tax revenue generated by higher earnings (captured by τ pLAT Eh ). As
emphasized by Hendren (2014), the MVPF is a metric that can easily be compared across programs
without specifying exactly how program expenditures are to be funded. In our case, if M V P Fδ > 1
a dollar of government spending can raise the after-tax incomes of children by more than a dollar,
which is a robust indicator that program expansions are likely to be welfare improving.
   An important lesson of the above analysis is that identifying costs and benefits of changes to offer
probabilities does not require identification of treatment effects relative to particular counterfactual
care states. Specifically, it is not necessary to separately identify the subLATEs. This result
shows that program substitution is not a design flaw of evaluations. Rather, it is a feature of the
policy environment that needs to be considered when computing the likely effects of changes to
policy parameters. Here, program substitution alters the usual logic of program evaluation only by


                                                  13
requiring identification of the complier share Sc , which governs the degree of public savings realized
as a result of reducing subsidies to competing programs.

V.D. Rationed Substitutes
The above analysis presumes that Head Start expansions yield reductions in the enrollment of
competing preschools. However, if competing programs are also over-subscribed, the slots vacated
by c−compliers may be filled by other households. This will reduce the public savings associated
with Head Start expansions but also generate the potential for additional test score gains.
   With rationing in substitute preschool programs, the utility of enrollment in c can be written
Ui (c, Zic ), where Zic indicates an offered slot in the competing program. Household i’s enrollment
choice, Di (Zih , Zic ), depends on both the Head Start offer Zih and the competing program offer.
Assume these offers are assigned independently with probabilities δh and δc , but that δc adjusts to
changes in δh to keep total enrollment in c constant. In addition, assume that all children induced
to move into c as a result of an increase in δc come from n rather than h.
   We show in Appendix C that under these assumptions the marginal impact of expanding Head
Start becomes:

                         ∂E [Yi ]                                  ∂P (Di = h)
                                    = (LAT Eh + LAT Enc ) ×                    ,
                          ∂δh                                          ∂δh

where LAT Enc ≡ E [Yi (c) − Yi (n) |Di (Zih , 1) = c, Di (Zih , 0) = n]. Intuitively, every c−complier
now spawns a corresponding n-to-c complier who fills the vacated preschool slot.
   The marginal cost to government of inducing this change in test scores can be written:

                      ∂C                                               ∂P (Di = h)
                              = [φh − τ p (LAT Eh + LAT Enc )] ×                   .
                      ∂δh                                                  ∂δh

Relative to (7), rationing eliminates the public savings from reduced enrollment in substitute pro-
grams but adds another fiscal externality in its place: the tax revenue associated with any test
score gains of shifting children from home care to competing preschools. The resulting marginal
value of public funds can be written:

                                             (1 − τ )p (LAT Eh + LAT Enc · Sc )
                            M V P Fδ,rat =                                      .                  (9)
                                             φh − τ p (LAT Eh + LAT Enc · Sc )

While the impact of rationed substitutes on the marginal value of public funds is theoretically
ambiguous, there is good reason to expect M V P Fδ,rat > M V P Fδ in practice. Specifically, ignoring
rationing of competing programs yields a lower bound on the rate of return to Head Start expansions
if Head Start and other forms of center based care have roughly comparable effects on test scores and
competing programs are cheaper (see Appendix C). Unfortunately, effects for n-to-c compliers are
not nonparametrically identified by the HSIS experiment since one cannot know which households
that care for their children at home would otherwise choose to enroll them in competing preschools.



                                                      14
We return to this issue in Section IX.

V.E. Structural Reforms
An important assumption in the previous analyses is that changing lottery probabilities does not
alter the mix of program compliers. Consider now the effects of altering some structural feature f of
the Head Start program that households value but which has no impact on test scores. For example,
Executive Order #13330, issued by President Bush in February 2004, mandated enhancements to
the transportation services provided by Head Start and other federal programs (Federal Register,
2004). Expanding Head Start transportation services should not directly influence educational
outcomes but may yield a compositional effect by drawing in households from a different mix of
counterfactual care environments.10 By shifting the composition of program participants, changes
in f may boost the program’s rate of return.
       To establish notation, we assume that households now value Head Start participation as:

                                        Ũi (h, Zi , f ) = Ui (h, Zi ) + f.

Utilities for other preschools and home care are assumed to be unaffected by changes in f . This
implies that increases in f make Head Start more attractive for all households. For simplicity, we
return to our prior assumption that competing programs are not rationed. As shown in Appendix
C, the assumption that f has no effect on potential outcomes implies:

                                     ∂E [Yi ]            ∂P (Di = h)
                                              = M T Eh ×             ,

and S c gives the share of children on the margin of participating in Head Start who prefer the
competing program to preschool non-participation. Following the terminology in Heckman et al.
(2008), the marginal treatment effect M T Eh is the average effect of Head Start on test scores
among households indifferent between Head Start and the next best alternative. This is a marginal
version of the result in (6), where integration is now over a set of children who may differ from
current program compliers in their mean impacts. Like LAT Eh , M T Eh is a weighted average
of “subMTEs” corresponding to whether the next best alternative is home care or a competing

preschool program. The weight S c may differ from Sc if inframarginal participants are drawn from
different sources than marginal ones.
       The test score effects of improvements to the program feature must be balanced against the
  10
    This presumes that peer effects are not an important determinant of test score outcomes. Large changes in the
student composition of Head Start classrooms could potentially change the effectiveness of Head Start.

costs. We suppose that changing program features changes the average cost φh (f ) of Head Start
services, so that the net costs to government of financing preschool are now:

                         C (f ) = C0 + φh (f ) P (Di = h) + φc P (Di = c) − τ pE [Yi ] ,                         (10)

where ∂φh (f ) /∂f ≥ 0. The marginal costs to government (per program complier) of a change in
the program feature can be written:

                ∂C (f ) /∂f                                                   ∂φh (f ) /∂f

                                           Public Savings Added Revenue

The first term on the right hand side of (11) gives the administrative cost of enrolling another child.
The second term gives the increased cost of providing inframarginal families with the improved
program feature. The third term is the expected savings in reduced funding to competing preschool
programs. And the final term gives the additional tax revenue raised by the boost in the marginal
enrollee’s human capital.
                        ∂ ln φ(f )/∂f
       Letting η ≡   ∂ ln P (Di =h)/∂f   be the elasticity of costs with respect to enrollment, we can write
the marginal value of public funds associated with a change in program features as:

                                           ∂B/∂f               (1 − τ ) pM T Eh
                         M V P Ff ≡                   =                 →
                                                                        −               .                        (12)
                                          ∂C (f ) /∂f   φh (1 + η) − φc S c − τ pM T Eh

As in our analysis of optimal program scale, equation (11) shows that it is not necessary to sepa-
rately identify the “subMTEs” that compose M T Eh to determine the optimal value of f . Rather,
it is sufficient to identify the average causal effect of Head Start for children on the margin of
participation along with the average net cost of an additional seat in this population.


VI.        A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Program Expansion
We next use the HSIS data to conduct a formal cost-benefit analysis of changes to Head Start’s
offer rate under the assumption that competing programs are not rationed (we consider the case
with rationing in Section IX). Our analysis focuses on the costs and benefits associated with one
year of Head Start attendance.11 This exercise requires estimates of each term in equation (7). We
estimate LAT Eh and Sc from the HSIS, and calibrate the remaining parameters using estimates
  11
     Children in the three-year-old cohort who enroll for two years generate additional costs. As shown in Table
III, a Head Start offer raises the probability of enrollment in the second year by only 0.16, implying that first-year
offers have modest net effects on second-year costs. Enrollment for two years may also generate additional benefits,
but these cannot be estimated without strong assumptions on the Head Start dose/response function. We therefore
consider only first-year benefits and costs.



                                                          16
from the literature. Calibrated parameters are listed in panel A of Table IV. To be conservative,
we deliberately bias our calibrations towards understating Head Start’s benefits and overstating its
costs in order to arrive at a lower bound rate of return. Further details of the calibration exercise
are provided in Appendix D.
    Panel B of Table IV reports estimates of the marginal value of public funds associated with an
expansion of Head Start offers (M V P Fδ ). To account for sampling uncertainty in our estimates
of LAT Eh and Sc we report standard errors calculated via the delta method. Because asymptotic
delta method approximations can be inaccurate when the statistic of interest is highly nonlinear
(Lafontaine and White, 1986), we also report bootstrap p-values from one-tailed tests of the null
hypothesis that the benefit/cost ratio is less than one.12
    The results show that accounting for the public savings associated with enrollment in substitute
preschools has a large effect on the estimated social value of Head Start. We conduct cost-benefit
analyses under three assumptions: φc is either zero, 50%, or 75% of φh . Our preferred calibration
uses φc = 0.75φh , reflecting that fact that roughly 75 percent of competing centers are publicly
funded (see Appendix D). Setting φc = 0 yields a M V P Fδ of 1.10. Setting φc equal to 0.5φh and
0.75φh raises the M V P Fδ to 1.50 and 1.84, respectively. This indicates that the fiscal externality
generated by program substitution has an important effect on the social value of Head Start.
Bootstrap tests decisively reject values of M V P Fδ less than one when φc = 0.5φh or 0.75φh .
Notably, our preferred estimate of 1.84 is well above the estimated rates of return of comparable
expenditure programs summarized in Hendren (2014, Table 1), and comparable to the marginal
value of public funds associated with increases in the top marginal tax rate (between 1.33 and 2.0).
    To assess the sensitivity of our results to alternative assumptions regarding the relationship
between test score effects and earnings, Table IV also reports “breakeven” relationships between
test scores and earnings that set M V P Fδ equal to one for each value of φc . When φc = 0 the
breakeven earnings effect is 9 percent per test score standard deviation, only slightly below our
calibrated value of 10 percent. This indicates that when substitution is ignored, Head Start is
close to breaking even and small changes in assumptions will yield values of M V P Fδ below one.
Increasing φc to 0.5φh or 0.75φh reduces the breakeven earnings effect to 8 percent or 7 percent,
respectively. The latter figure is well below comparable estimates in the recent literature, such
as estimates from Chetty et al.’s (2011) study of the Tennessee STAR class size experiment (13
percent; see Appendix Table A.IV). Therefore, after accounting for fiscal externalities, Head Start’s
costs are estimated to exceed its benefits only if its test score impacts translate into earnings gains
at a lower rate than similar interventions for which earnings data are available.
  12
     This test is computed by a non-parametric block bootstrap of the studentized t-statistic that resamples Head
Start sites. We have found in Monte Carlo exercises that Delta method confidence intervals for M V P Fδ tend to
over-cover, while bootstrap-t tests have approximately correct size. This is in accord with theoretical results from
Hall (1992) that show bootstrap-t methods yield a higher-order refinement to p-values based upon the standard delta
method approximation.




                                                        17
VII.        Beyond LATE
Thus far, we have evaluated the return to a marginal expansion of Head Start under the assumption
that the mix of compliers can be held constant. However, it is likely that major reforms to Head
Start would entail changes to program features such as accessibility that could in turn change the
mix of program compliers. To evaluate such reforms, it is necessary to predict how selection into
Head Start is likely to change and how this impacts the program’s rate of return.

VII.A. Instrumental Variables Estimates of SubLATEs
A first way in which selection into Head Start could change is if the mix of compliers drawn from
home care and competing preschools were altered while holding the composition of those two groups
constant. To predict the effects of such a change on the program’s rate of return we need to estimate
the “subLATEs” in equation (3).
       One approach to identifying subLATEs is to conduct two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation
treating Head Start enrollment and enrollment in other preschools as separate endogenous variables.
A common strategy for generating instruments in such settings is to interact an experimentally as-
signed program offer with observed covariates or site indicators (e.g., Kling, Liebman and Katz,
2007; Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2014). Such approaches can secure identification in a constant effects
framework but, as we demonstrate in Appendix E, will typically fail to identify interpretable pa-
rameters if the subLATEs themselves vary across the interacting groups (see Kirkeboen et al., 2014
and Hull, 2015 for related results).
       Table V reports 2SLS estimates of the separate effects of Head Start and competing preschools
using as instruments the Head Start offer indicator and its interaction with 8 student- and site-
level covariates likely to capture heterogeneity in compliance patterns.13 These instruments strongly
predict Head Start enrollment but induce relatively weak independent variation in enrollment in
other preschools, with a partial first stage F-statistic of only 1.8. The 2SLS estimates indicate
that Head Start and other centers yield large and roughly equivalent effects on test scores of
approximately 0.4 standard deviations. This finding is roughly in line with the view that preschool
effects are homogeneous and that program substitution simply attenuates instrumental variables
estimates of the effect of Head Start relative to home care. Cautioning against this interpretation
is the 2SLS overidentification test, which strongly rejects the constant effects model, indicating the
presence of substantial effect heterogeneity across covariate groups.
       A separate source of variation comes from experimental sites: the HSIS was implemented at
hundreds of individual Head Start centers, and previous studies have shown substantial variation
in treatment effects across these centers (Bloom and Weiland, 2015; Walters, 2015). Using site
  13
    Previous analyses of the HSIS have shown important effect heterogeneity with respect to baseline scores and first
language (Bitler et al., 2014; Bloom and Weiland, 2015) so we include these in the list of student level interactions. We
also allow interactions with variables measuring whether a child’s center of random assignment offers transportation
to Head Start, whether the center of random assignment is above the median of the Head Start quality measure, the
education level of the child’s mother, whether the child is age four, whether the child is black, and an indicator for
family income above the poverty line.


                                                           18
interactions as instruments again yields much more independent variation in Head Start enrollment
than in competing preschools.14 However, now the estimated impact of Head Start is smaller and
competing centers are estimated to yield no gains relative to home care. While these site-based
estimates are nominally more precise than those obtained from the covariate interactions, with 183
instruments the asymptotic standard errors may provide a poor guide to the degree of uncertainty
in the parameter estimates (Bound, Jaeger, and Baker, 1995). We explore this issue in Appendix
Table A.V, which reports limited information maximum likelihood and jackknife IV estimates of
the same model. These approaches yield much larger standard errors and very different point
estimates, suggesting that weak instrument biases are at play here.
       To deal with these statistical problems, we use a choice model with discrete unobserved hetero-
geneity (described in more detail later on) to aggregate Head Start sites together into six groups
with similar substitution patterns. Using the site group interactions as instruments yields signifi-
cant independent variation in both Head Start and competing preschool enrollment, and produces
results more in line with those obtained from the covariate interactions. Pooling the site group
and covariate interaction instruments together yields the most precise estimates, which indicate
that both preschool types increase scores relative to home care and that Head Start is slightly
more effective than competing preschools. However, the overidentification test continues to reject
the constant effects model, suggesting that these estimates are still likely to provide a misleading
guide to the underlying subLATEs. Another important limitation of the interacted 2SLS approach
is that it conditions on realized selection patterns and therefore cannot be used to predict the
effects of reforms that change the underlying composition of n− and c− compliers. We now turn
to developing an econometric selection model that allows us to address both of these limitations.

VII.B. Selection Model
Our selection model parametrizes the preferences and potential outcomes introduced in the model
of Section V to motivate a two-step control function estimator. Like the interacted 2SLS approach,
the proposed estimator exploits interactions of the Head Start offer with covariates and site groups
to separately identify the causal effects of care alternatives. Unlike the interacted 2SLS approach,
the control function estimator allows the interacting groups to have different subLATEs that vary
parametrically with the probability of enrolling in Head Start and competing preschools.
       Normalizing the value of preschool non-participation to zero, we assume households have utilities
over program alternatives given by:

                                     Ui (h, Zi ) = ψh (Xi , Zi ) + vih ,
                                         Ui (c) = ψc (Xi ) + vic ,                                         (13)
                                         Ui (n) = 0,
  14
    To avoid extreme imbalance in site size, we grouped the 356 sites in our data into 183 sites with 10 or more
observations. See Appendix G for details.




                                                      19
where Xi denotes the vector of baseline household and experimental site characteristics listed
in Table I and Zi again denotes the Head Start offer dummy. The stochastic components of
utility (vih , vic ) reflect unobserved differences in household demand for Head Start and competing
preschools relative to home care. In addition to pure preference heterogeneity, these terms may
capture unobserved constraints such as whether family members are available to help with child
care. We suppose these components obey a multinomial probit specification:
                                                               "                        #!
                                                                     1        ρ (Xi )
                              (vih , vic ) |Xi , Zi ∼ N   0,                                 ,
                                                                   ρ (Xi )       1

which allows for violations of the Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) condition that
underlies multinomial logit selection models such as that of Dubin and McFadden (1984).
    As in the Heckman (1979) selection framework, we model endogeneity in participation decisions
by allowing linear dependence of mean potential outcomes on the unobservables that influence
choices. Specifically, for each program alternative d ∈ {h, c, n}, we assume:

                           E [Yi (d) |Xi , Zi , vih , vic ] = µd (Xi ) + γdh vih + γdc vic .                            (14)

The {γdh , γdc } coefficients in (14) describe the nature of selection on unobservables. This spec-
ification can accommodate a variety of selection schemes. For example, if γdh = γh > 0, then
conditional on observables, selection into Head Start is governed by potential outcome levels –
those most likely to participate in Head Start have higher test scores in all care environments. But
if γhh > 0 and γnh = −γhh , then households engage in Roy (1951)-style selection into Head Start
based upon test score gains – those most likely to participate in Head Start receive larger test score
benefits when they switch from home care to Head Start.
    By iterated expectations, (14) implies the conditional expectation of realized outcomes can be
written:
                 E [Yi |Xi , Zi , Di = d] = µd (Xi ) + γdh λh (Xi , Zi , d) + γdc λc (Xi , Zi , d) ,                    (15)

where λh (Xi , Zi , Di ) ≡ E [vih |Xi , Zi , Di ] and λc (Xi , Zi , Di ) ≡ E [vic |Xi , Zi , Di ] are generalizations
of the standard inverse Mills ratio terms used in the two-step Heckman (1979) selection correction
(see Appendix F for details). These terms depend on Xi and Zi only through the conditional
probabilities of enrolling in Head Start and other preschools.

VII.C. Identification
To demonstrate identification of the selection coefficients {γdh , γdc } it is useful to eliminate the
main effect of the covariates by differencing (15) across values of the program offer Zi as follows:

        E [Yi |Xi , Zi = 1, Di = d] − E [Yi |Xi , Zi = 0, Di = d]        = γdh [λh (Xi , 1, d) − λh (Xi , 0, d)]
                                                                             +γdc [λc (Xi , 1, d) − λc (Xi , 0, d)] .   (16)




                                                          20
This difference measures how selected test score outcomes in a particular care alternative respond
to a Head Start offer. Responses in selected outcomes are driven entirely by compositional changes
– i.e. from compliers switching between alternatives.
   With two values of the covariates Xi , equation (16) can be evaluated twice, yielding two equa-
tions in the two unknown selection coefficients. Appendix F details the conditions under which this
system can be solved and provides expressions for the selection coefficients in terms of population
moments. Additive separability of the potential outcomes in observables and unobservables is es-
sential for identification. If the selection coefficients in (16) were allowed to depend on Xi , there
would be two unknowns for every value of the covariates and identification would fail. Heuristically
then, our key assumption is that selection on unobservables works “the same way” for every value of
the covariates, which allows us to exploit variation in selected outcome responses across subgroups
to infer the parameters governing the selection process.
   To understand this restriction, suppose (as turns out to be the case) that college educated
mothers are more likely to enroll their children in competing preschools when denied access to
Head Start. Our model allows Head Start and other preschools to have different average treatment
effects on the children of more and less educated mothers. However, it rules out the possibility that
children with college educated mothers sort into Head Start on the basis of potential test score
gains, while children of less educated mothers exhibit no sorting on these gains. As in Brinch et
al. (2012), this restriction is testable when Xi takes more than two values because it implies we
should obtain similar estimates of the selection coefficients based on variation in different subsets
of the covariates. We provide evidence along these lines by contrasting estimates that exploit site
variation with estimates based upon household covariates.

VII.D. Estimation
To make estimation tractable, we approximate ψh (X, Z) and ψc (X) with flexible linear functions.
The non-separability of ψh (X, Z) is captured by linear interactions between Z and the 8 covari-
ates used in our earlier 2SLS analysis. We also allow interactions with the 183 experimental site
indicators but, to avoid incidental parameters problems, constrain the coefficients on those dum-
mies to belong to one of K discrete categories. Results from Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) and
Saggio (2012) suggest that this “grouped fixed effects” approach should yield good finite sample
performance even when some sites have as few as 10 observations. As described in Appendix G,
we choose the number of site groups K using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Finally,
all of the interacting variables (both site groups and covariates)
                                                                 are allowed
                                                                             to influence the corre-
                                                           1     1+ρ(X)
lation parameter ρ (X). We assume that arctanhρ(X) = 2 ln 1−ρ(X) is linear in these variables,
a standard transformation that ensures the correlation is between -1 and 1 (Cox, 2008).
    The model is fit in two steps. First, we estimate the parameters of the Probit model via sim-
ulated maximum likelihood, evaluating choice probabilities with the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane
(GHK) simulator (Geweke, 1989; Hajivassiliou and McFadden, 1998; Keane, 1994). Models includ-
ing site groups are estimated with an algorithm that alternates between maximizing the likelihood
and reassigning groups, described in detail in Appendix G. Second, we use the parameters of the

                                                 21
                                                                                        
choice model to form control function estimates λ̂h (Xi , Zi , Di ) , λ̂c (Xi , Zi , Di ) , which are then
used in a second step regression of the form:

Yi = θn0 + X 0 θnx + γnh λ̂h (Xi , Zi , Di ) + γnc λ̂c (Xi , Zi , Di )                                               (17)
                 h                                                                                               i
   + 1 {Di = c} (θc0 − θn0 ) + Xi0 (θcx − θnx ) + (γch − γnh ) λ̂h (Xi , Zi , c) + (γcc − γnc ) λ̂c (Xi , Zi , c)
                 h                                                                                                 i

The covariate vector Xi is normed to have unconditional mean zero, so the intercepts θd0 can be
interpreted as average potential outcomes. Hence, the differences θh0 − θn0 and θh0 − θc0 capture
average treatment effects of Head Start and other preschools relative to no preschool. To avoid
overfitting, we restrict variables other than the site types and 8 key covariates to have common
coefficients across care alternatives.15 Inference on the second step parameters is conducted via the
nonparametric block bootstrap, clustered by experimental site.


VIII.         Model Estimates
VIII.A. Model Parameters
Table VI reports estimates of the full choice model obtained from exploiting both covariates and site
heterogeneity. The BIC selects a specification with six site groups for the full model (see Appendix
Table A.VI), with group shares that vary between 12% and 21% of the sample. These assignments
comprise the site groups used in the earlier 2SLS analysis of Table V.
       Columns (1) and (2) of Table VI show the coefficients governing the mean utility of enrollment
in Head Start. We easily reject the null hypothesis that the program offer interaction effects in the
Head Start utility equation are homogenous. Panel A of Column (2) indicates that the effects of
an offer are greater at high-quality centers and lower among non-poor children that would typically
be ineligible for Head Start enrollment.16 Panel B of Column (2) reveals the presence of significant
heterogeneity across site groups in the response to a program offer, which likely reflects unobserved
market features such as the presence or absence of state provided preschool.
       Column (4) of Table VI reports the parameters governing the correlation in unobserved tastes
for Head Start and competing programs. The correlation is positive for four of six site groups,
indicating that most households view preschool alternatives as more similar to each other than
to home care. This establishes that the IIA condition underlying logit-based choice models is
empirically violated. While there is some evidence of heterogeneity in the correlation based upon
mother’s education, we cannot reject the joint null hypothesis that the correlation is constant across
covariate groups. However, we easily reject that the correlation is constant across site groups.
       The many sources of heterogeneity captured by the choice model yield substantial variation
  15
    This restriction cannot be statistically rejected and has minimal effects on the point estimates.
  16
    The quality variable aggregates information on center characteristics (teacher and center director education and
qualifications, class size) and practices (variety of literacy and math activities, home visiting, health and nutrition)
measured in interviews with center directors, teachers, and parents of children enrolled in the preschool center.


                                                          22
in predicted enrollment shares for Head Start and competing preschools. Appendix Figure A.I
shows that these predictions match variation in choice probabilities across subgroups. Moreover,
diagnostics indicate this variation is adequate to secure separate identification of the second stage
control function coefficients. From (16), the model is under-identified if, for any alternative d, the
control function difference λh (Xi , 1, d) − λh (Xi , 0, d) is linearly dependent on the corresponding
difference λc (Xi , 1, d) − λc (Xi , 0, d). Appendix Figure A.II shows that the deviations from linear
dependence are visually apparent and strongly statistically significant.
       Table VII reports second-step estimates of the parameters in (17). Column (1) omits all controls
and simply reports differences in mean test scores across care alternatives (the omitted category
is home care). Head Start students score 0.2 standard deviations higher than students in home
care, while the corresponding difference for students in competing preschools is 0.26 standard
deviations. Column (2) adds controls for baseline characteristics. Because the controls include a
third order polynomial in baseline test scores, this column can be thought of as reporting “value-
added” estimates of the sort that have received renewed attention in the education literature (Kane
et al., 2008; Rothstein, 2010; Chetty et al., 2014a). Surprisingly, adding these controls does little
to the estimated effect of Head Start relative to home care but improves precision. By contrast,
the estimated impact of competing preschools relative to home care falls significantly once controls
are added.
       Columns (3)-(5) add control functions adjusting for selection on unobservables based on choice
models with covariates, site groups, or both. Unlike the specifications in previous columns, these
control function terms exploit experimental variation in offer assignment. Adjusting for selection
on unobservables dramatically raises the estimated average impact of Head Start relative to home
care. However, the estimates are fairly imprecise. Imprecision in estimates of average treatment
effects is to be expected given that these quantities are only identified via parametric restrictions
that allow us to infer the counterfactual outcomes of always takers and never takers. Below we
consider average treatment effects on compliers, which are estimated more precisely.
       While some of the control function coefficient estimates are also imprecise, we reject the hy-
potheses of no selection on levels (γkd = 0 ∀(k, d)) and no selection on gains (γdk = γjk for d 6= j,
k ∈ {h, c}) in our most precise specification. The selection coefficient estimates exhibit some in-
teresting patterns. One regularity is that estimates of γhh − γnh are negative in all specifications
(though insignificant in the model using site groups only). In other words, children who are more
likely to attend Head Start receive smaller achievement benefits when shifted from home care to
Head Start. This “reverse-Roy” pattern of negative selection on test score gains suggests large
benefits for children with unobservables making them less likely to attend the program.17 Other
preschool programs, by contrast, seem to exhibit positive selection on gains: the estimated dif-
ference γcc − γnc is always positive and in the full model is significant. A possible interpretation
of these patterns is that Head Start is viewed by parents as a preschool of last resort, leading to
  17
     Walters (2014) finds a related pattern of negative selection in the context of charter schools, though in his setting
the fallback potential outcome (as opposed to the charter school outcome) appears to respond positively to unobserved
characteristics driving program participation.


                                                           23
enrollment by the families most desperate to get help with child care. Such households cannot be
selective about whether the local Head Start center is a good match for their child, which results
in lower test score gains. By contrast, households considering enrollment in substitute preschools
may have greater resources that afford them the luxury of being more selective about whether such
programs are a good match for their child.
          Estimates of the control function coefficients are very similar in columns (3) and (4), though
the estimates are less precise when only site group interactions are used. This indicates that the
implied nature of selection is the same regardless of whether identification is based on site or
covariate interactions, lending credibility to our assumption that selection works the same way
across subgroups. Also supporting this assumption are the results of score tests for the additive
separability of control functions and covariates, reported in the bottom row of Table VII. These
tests are conducted by regressing residuals from the two-step models on interactions of the control
functions with covariates and site groups, along with the main effects from equation (15). In all
specifications, we fail to reject additive separability at conventional levels (see Appendix F for
some additional goodness of fit tests). While these tests do not have the power to detect all forms
of nonseparability, the correspondence between estimates based on covariate and site variation
suggests that our key identifying assumption is reasonable.

VIII.B. Treatment Effects
Table VIII reports average treatment effects on compliers for each of our selection-corrected models.
The first row uses the model parameters to compute the pooled LAT Eh , which is nonparametrically
identified by the experiment. The model estimates line up closely with the nonparametric estimate
obtained via IV. Appendix Figure A.III shows that this close correspondence between model and
non-parametric LAT Eh holds even across different covariate groups, across which there is enormous
heterogeneity. The remaining rows of Table VIII report estimates of average effects for compliers
relative to specific care alternatives (i.e. subLATEs).18 Estimates of the subLATE for n-compliers,
LAT Enh , are stable across specifications and indicate that the impact of moving from home care to
Head Start is large – on the order of 0.37 standard deviations. By contrast, estimates of LAT Ech ,
though more variable across specifications, never differ significantly from zero.
          Our estimates of LAT Enh are somewhat smaller than the average treatment effects of Head
Start relative to home care displayed in Table VII. This is a consequence of the reverse Roy pattern
captured by the control function coefficients: families willing to switch from home care to Head
Start in response to an offer have stronger than average tastes for Head Start, implying smaller
than average gains. We can reject that predicted effects of moving from home care to Head Start
are equal for n-compliers and n-never takers, implying that this pattern is statistically significant
(p = 0.038). Likewise, LAT Ehc is slightly negative, while the average treatment effect of Head
Start relative to other preschools is positive (0.47 - 0.11). In other words, switching from c to h
     18
          We compute the subLATEs by integrating over the relevant regions of Xi , vih and vic as described in Appendix
F.



                                                             24
reduces test scores for c-compliers, but would improve the score of an average student. This reflects
a combination of above average tastes for competing preschools among c-compliers and positive
selection on gains into other preschools. Note that the control function coefficients in Table VII
capture selection conditional on covariates and sites, while the treatment effects in Table VIII
average over the distribution of observables for each subgroup. The subLATE estimates show that
the selection patterns discussed above still hold when variation in effects across covariate and site
groups is taken into account.
   Another interesting point of comparison is to the 2SLS estimates of Table V. The 2SLS ap-
proach found a somewhat smaller LAT Enh than our two-step estimator.               It also found that
Head Start preschools were slightly more effective at raising test scores than competing programs
(LAT Ech > 0), while our full control function estimates suggest the opposite. Importantly, the
control function estimates corroborate the failed overidentification tests of Table V by detecting
substantial heterogeneity in the underlying subLATEs. This can be seen in the last four rows of
Table VIII, which report estimates for the top and bottom quintiles of the model-predicted distri-
bution of LAT Eh (see Appendix F for details). Fixing each group’s Sc at the population average
brings estimates for the top and bottom quintiles closer together, but a large gap remains due to
subLATE heterogeneity.
   Finally, it is worth comparing our findings with those of Feller et al. (2014), who use the principal
stratification framework of Frangakis and Rubin (2002) to estimate effects on n- and c-compliers
in the HSIS. They also find large effects for compliers drawn from home and negligible effects
for compliers drawn from other preschools, though their point estimate of LAT Enh is somewhat
smaller than ours (0.21 vs. 0.37). This difference reflects a combination of different test score
outcomes (Feller et al. look only at PPVT scores) and different modeling assumptions. Since
neither estimation approach nests the other, it is reassuring that we find qualitatively similar
results.


IX.        Policy Counterfactuals
We now use our model estimates to consider policy counterfactuals that are not non-parametrically
identified by the HSIS experiment.

IX.A. Rationed Substitutes
In the cost-benefit analysis of Section VI we assumed that seats at competing preschools were not
rationed. While this assumption is reasonable in states with universal preschool mandates, other
areas may have preschool programs that face relatively fixed budgets and offer any vacated seats
to new children. In this case, increases in Head Start enrollment will create opportunities for new
children to attend substitute preschools rather than generating cost savings in these programs. Our
model-based estimates allow us to assess the sensitivity of our cost/benefit results to the possibility
of rationing in competing programs.


                                                  25
    From (9), the marginal value of public funds under rationing depends on LAT Enc – the average
treatment effect of competing preschools on “n-to-c compliers” who would move from home care
to a competing preschool program in response to an offered seat. We compute the M V P Fδ,rat
under three alternative assumptions regarding this parameter. First, we consider the case where
LAT Enc = 0. Next, we consider the case where the average test score effect of competing preschools
for marginal students equals the corresponding effect for Head Start compliers drawn from home
care (i.e. LAT Enc = LAT Enh ). Finally, we use our model to construct an estimate for LAT Enc .
Specifically, we compute average treatment effects competing preschools relative to home care for
students who would be induced to move along this margin by an increase in Ui (c) equal to the
utility value of the Head Start offer coefficient.19 This calculation assumes that the utility value
households place on an offered seat at a competing program is comparable to the value of a Head
Start offer.
    Table IX shows the results of this analysis. Setting LAT Enc = 0 yields an M V P Fδ,rat of
1.10. This replicates the naive analysis with φc = 0 in the non-rationed analysis. Both of these
cases ignore costs and benefits due to substitution from competing programs. Assuming that
LAT Enc = LAT Enh produces a benefit-cost ratio of 2.36. Finally, our preferred model estimates
from Section VIII predict that LAT Enc = 0.294, which produces a ratio of 2.02. These results
suggest that, under plausible assumptions about the effects of competing programs relative to home
care, accounting for the benefits generated by vacated seats in these programs yields estimated social
returns larger than those displayed in panel B of Table IV.

IX.B. Structural Reforms
We next predict the social benefits of a reform that expands Head Start by making it more attractive
rather than by extending offers to additional households. This reform is modeled as an improvement
in the structural program feature f , as described in Section V. Examples of such reforms might
include increases in transportation services, outreach efforts, or spending on other services that
make Head Start attractive to parents. Increases in f are assumed to draw additional households
into Head Start but to have no effect on potential outcomes, which rules out peer effects generated
by changes in student composition. We use the estimates from our preferred model to compute
marginal treatment effects and marginal values of public funds for such reforms, treating changes
in f as shifts in the mean Head Start utility ψh (X, Z).
    Panel A of Figure I displays predicted effects of structural reforms on test scores. Since the
program feature has no intrinsic scale, the horizontal axis is scaled in terms of the Head Start
attendance rate, with a vertical line indicating the current rate (f = 0). The right axis measures
→
−
S c – the share of marginal students drawn from other preschools. The left axis measures test
   19
      Ideally we would compute LAT Enc for students who do not receive offers to competing programs but would attend
these programs if offered. Since we do not observe offers to substitute preschools, it is not possible to distinguish
between non-offered children and children who decline offers. Our estimate of LAT Enc therefore captures a mix of
effects for compliers who would respond to offers and children who currently decline offers but would be induced to
attend competing programs if these programs became more attractive.



                                                         26
score effects. The Figure plots average treatment effects for subgroups of marginal students drawn
from home care and other preschools, along with M T Eh , a weighted average of alternative-specific
effects.
       Figure I shows that Head Start’s effects on marginal home compliers increase modestly with
enrollment and then level out in the neighborhood of the current program scale (f = 0). This
pattern is driven by reverse Roy selection for children drawn from home care: increases in f attract
children with weaker tastes for Head Start, leading to increases in effects for compliers who would
otherwise stay home. Predicted effects for children drawn from other preschools are slightly negative
for all values of f . At the current program scale, the model predicts that the share of marginal
students drawn from other preschools is larger for structural reforms than for an increase in the
offer rate (0.44 vs. 0.35). This implies that marginal compliers are more likely to be drawn from
other preschools than inframarginal compliers. As a result, the value of M T Eh is comparable to
the experimental LAT Eh , despite very large effects on marginal children drawn from home care
(roughly 0.5σ).
       To investigate the consequences of this pattern for the social return to Head Start, Panel B plots
M V P Ff , the marginal value of public funds for structural reforms. This Figure relies on the same
parameter calibrations as Table IV. Calculations of M V P Ff must account for the fact that changes
in structural program features may increase the direct costs of the program. This effect is captured
in (12) by the term η which gives the elasticity of the per-child cost of Head Start with respect to
the scale of the program. Without specifying the program feature being manipulated, there is no
natural value for η. We start with the extreme case where η = 0, which allows us to characterize
costs and benefits associated with reforms that draw in children on the margin without changing
the per-capita cost of the program. We then consider how the cost-benefit calculus changes when
η > 0.
       As in our basic cost/benefit analysis, the results in panel B of Figure I show that accounting for
the public savings associated with program substitution has an important effect on the marginal
value of public funds. The red curve plots M V P Ff setting φc = 0. This calibration suggests
a marginal value of public funds slightly above one at the current program scale, similar to the
naive calibration in Table IV. The blue curve accounts for public savings by setting φc equal to
our preferred value of 0.75φh . This generates an upward shift and steepens the M V P Ff schedule,
indicating that both marginal and average social returns increase with program scale. The implied
marginal value of public funds at the current program scale (f = 0) is above 2. This is larger than
the M V P Fδ of 1.84 reported in Table IV, which indicates the social returns to marginal expansions
that shift the composition of compliers are greater than those for expansions that simply raise the
offer rate.
       The final scenario in Panel B shows M V P Ff when φc = 0.75φh and η = 0.5.20 This scenario
implies sharply rising marginal costs of Head Start provision: an increase in f that doubles enroll-
  20
    For this case, marginal costs are obtained by solving the differential equation φ0h (f ) = ηφ(f ) (∂ ln P (Di = h) /∂f )
with the initial condition φh (0) = $8, 000. This yields the solution φh (f ) = $8, 000 exp (η (ln P (Di = h) − ln P0 ))
where P0 is the initial Head Start attendance rate.


                                                            27
ment raises per-capita costs by 50 percent. In this simulation the marginal value of public funds is
roughly equal to one when f = 0, and falls below one for higher values. Hence, if η is at least 0.5,
a dollar increase in Head Start spending generated by structural reform will result in less than one
dollar transferred to Head Start applicants. This exercise illustrates the quantitative importance
of determining provision costs when evaluating specific policy changes such as improvements to
transportation services or marketing.
     Our analysis of structural reforms suggests increasing returns to the expansion of Head Start in
the neighborhood of the current program scale – expansions will draw in households with weaker
tastes for preschool with above average potential gains. These findings imply that structural reforms
targeting children who are currently unlikely to attend Head Start and children that are likely to
be drawn from non-participation will generate larger effects than reforms that simply create more
seats. Our results also echo other recent studies finding increasing returns to early-childhood invest-
ments, though the mechanism generating increasing returns in these studies is typically dynamic
complementarity in human capital investments rather than selection and effect heterogeneity (see,
e.g., Cunha et al., 2010).


X.      Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that Head Start, in its current incarnation, passes a strict cost-benefit test
predicated only upon projected effects on adult earnings. It is reasonable to expect that this
conclusion would be strengthened by incorporating the value of any impacts on crime (e.g. as
in Lochner and Moretti, 2004 and Heckman et al., 2010), or other externalities such as civic
engagement (Milligan et al., 2004), or by incorporating the value to parents of subsidized care (e.g.,
as in Aaberge et al., 2010). We find evidence that Head Start generates especially large benefits for
children who would not otherwise attend preschool and for children with weak unobserved tastes
for the program. This suggests that the program’s rate of return can be boosted by reforms that
target new populations, though this necessitates the existence of a cost-effective technology for
attracting these children.
     The finding that returns are on average greater for nonparticipants is potentially informative for
the debate over calls for universal preschool, which might reach high return households. However,
it is important to note that if competing state level preschool programs become ubiquitous, the
rationale for expansions to federal preschool programs could be undermined. To see this, consider
how the marginal value of expanding Head Start changes as the compliance share Sc approaches
one, so that nearly all denied Head Start applicants would otherwise enroll in competing programs.
If Head Start and competing program have equivalent effects on test scores, then (8) indicates that
we should decide between federal and state level provision based entirely on cost criteria. Since
state programs are often cheaper (Council of Economic Advisers, 2015) and are expanding rapidly,
the case for federal preschool may actually be weaker now than at the time of the Head Start
Impact Study.


                                                  28
   It is important to note some other limitations to our analysis. First, our cost-benefit calculations
rely on literature estimates of the link between test score effects and earnings gains. These calcu-
lations are necessarily speculative, as the only way to be sure of Head Start’s long-run effects is to
directly measure long-run outcomes for HSIS participants. Second, we have ignored the possibility
that substantial changes to program features or scale could, in equilibrium, change the education
production technology. For example, implementing recent proposals for universal preschool could
generate a shortage of qualified teachers (Rothstein, forthcoming). Finally, we have ignored the
possibility that administrative program costs might change with program scale, choosing instead
to equate average with marginal provision costs.
   Despite these caveats, our analysis has shown that accounting for program substitution in the
HSIS experiment is crucial for an assessment of the Head Start program’s costs and benefits. Similar
issues arise in the evaluation of job training programs (Heckman et al., 2000), health insurance
(Finkelstein et al., 2012), and housing subsidies (Kling et al., 2007; Jacob and Ludwig, 2012). The
tools developed here are potentially applicable to a wide variety of evaluation settings where data
on enrollment in competing programs are available.

Notes: This figure plots predicted test score effects and marginal values of public funds for various values of the program feature f , which shifts the utility of Head Start attendance.
Horizontal axes shows the Head Start attendance rate at each f , and a vertical line indicates the HSIS attendance rate (f = 0). Panel A shows marginal treatment effects and competing
preschool compliance shares. The left axis measures test score effects. MTE h is the average effect for marginal students, while MTE nh and MTE ch are effects for subgroups of
marginal students drawn from home care and other preschools. The right axis measures the share of marginal students drawn from other preschools. The shaded region shows a 90-
percent symmetric bootstrap confidence interval for MTE h . Panel B shows predicted marginal values of public funds for structural reforms, using the same parameter calibrations as
Table IV. P -values come from bootstrap tests of the hypothesis that the marginal value of public funds is less than or equal to one at f = 0.

Notes: All statistics weight by the reciprocal of the probability of a child's experimental assignment. Standard errors are clustered at the center level. The
transportation and quality index variables refer to a child's Head Start center of random assignment. The quality variable combines information on center
characteristics (teacher and center director education and qualifications, class size) and practices (variety of literacy and math activities, home visiting,
health and nutrition). Income is missing for 19 percent of observations. Missing values are excluded in statistics for income. The joint p -value is from a
test of the hypothesis that all coefficients equal zero.

Notes: This table reports experimental estimates of the effects of Head Start on a summary index of test scores. Columns (1), (4) and (7) report
coefficients from regressions of test scores on an indicator for assignment to Head Start. Columns (2), (5) and (8) report coefficients from first-
stage regressions of Head Start attendance on Head Start assignment. The attendance variable is an indicator equal to one if a child attends Head
Start at any time prior to the test. Columns (3), (6) and (9) report coefficients from two-stage least squares (2SLS) models that instrument Head
Start attendance with Head Start assignment. All models weight by the reciprocal of a child's experimental assignment, and control for sex, race,
Spanish language, teen mother, mother's marital status, presence of both parents in the home, family size, special education status, income quartile
dummies, urban, and a cubic polynomial in baseline score. Missing values for covariates are set to zero, and dummies for missing are included.
Standard errors are clustered by center of random assignment.

Notes: This table reports shares of offered and non-offered students attending Head Start, other center-based preschools, and no
preschool, separately by year and age cohort. All statistics are weighted by the reciprocal of the probability of a child's
experimental assignment. Column (7) reports estimates of the share of compliers drawn from other preschools, given by minus the
ratio of the offer's effect on attendance at other preschools to its effect on Head Start attendance.

Notes: This table reports results of cost/benefit calculations for Head Start. Parameter values are obtained from the sources listed in column (4). Standard errors for MVPF
ratios are calculated using the delta method. P -values are from one-tailed tests of the null hypotheses that the MVPF is less than one. These tests are performed via
nonparametric block bootstrap of the t -statistic, clustered at the Head Start center level. Breakevens give percentage effects of a standard deviation of test scores on earnings
that set MVPF equal to one.

Notes: This table reports two-stage least squares estimates of the effects of Head Start
and other preschool centers in Spring 2003. The model in the first row instruments
Head Start attendance with the Head Start offer. Models in the second row instrument
Head Start and other preschool attendance with interactions of the offer and
transportation, above-median quality, race, Spanish language, mother's education, an
indicator for income above the federal poverty line, and baseline score. The third row
uses the Head Start offer interacted with 183 experimental site indicators as
instruments. The fourth row uses interactions of the offer and indicators for groups of
experimental sites obtained from a multinomial probit model with unobserved group
fixed effects, as described in Appendix G. The fifth row uses both covariate and site
group interactions. All models control for main effects of the interacting variables
and baseline covariates. First stage F -statistics are Angrist/Pischke (2009) partial F 's.
Standard errors are clustered at the center level.

Notes: This table reports simulated maximum likelihood estimates of a multinomial probit model of
preschool choice. The model includes fixed effects for six unobserved groups of experimental sites,
estimated as described in Appendix G. The Head Start and other center utilities also include the main
effects of gender, test language, teen mother, mother's marital status, presence of both parents, family size,
special education, family income categories, and second- and third-order terms in baseline test scores. The
likelihood is evaluated using the GHK simulator, and likelihood contributions are weighted by the
reciprocal of the probability of experimental assignments. P -values for site heterogeneity are from tests
that all group-specific constants are equal. P -values for covariate heterogeneity are from tests that all
covariate coefficients in a column are zero. Standard errors are clustered at the Head Start center level.

Notes: This table reports selection-corrected estimates of the effects of Head Start and other preschool
centers in Spring 2003. Each column shows coefficients from regressions of test scores on an intercept,
a Head Start indicator, an other preschool indicator, and controls. Column (1) shows estimates with no
controls. Column (2) adds controls for gender, race, home language, test language, mother's education,
teen mother, mother's marital status, presence of both parents, family size, special education, income
categories, experimental site characteristics (transportation, above-median quality, and urban status)
and a third-order polynomial in baseline test score. This column interacts the preschool variables with
transportation, above-median quality, race, Spanish language, mother's education, an indicator for
income above the federal poverty line, and the main effect of baseline score. Covariates are de-meaned
in the estimation sample, so that main effects can be interpreted as estimates of average treatment
effects. Column (3) adds control function terms constructed from a multinomial probit model using the
covariates from column (3) and the Head Start offer. The interacting variables from column (2) are
allowed to interact with the Head Start offer and enter the preschool taste correlation equation in
column (3). Column (4) omits observed covariates and includes indicators for experimental site groups,
constructed using the algorithm described in Appendix G. The multinomial probit model is saturated in
these site group indicators, and the second step regression interacts site groups with preschool
alternatives. Column (5) combines the variables used in columns (3) and (4). Standard errors are
bootstrapped and clustered at the center level. The bottom row shows p -values from a score test of the
hypothesis that interactions between the control functions and covariates are zero in each preschool
alternative (see Appendix F for details).

Online Appendix

Appendix A: Data
This appendix describes the construction of the sample used in this article. The data come from
the Head Start Impact Study (HSIS). This data set includes information on 4,442 children, each
applying to Head Start at one of 353 experimental sites in Fall 2002. The raw data used here includes
information on test scores, child demographics, preschool attendance, and preschool characteristics.
Our core sample includes 3,571 children (80 percent of experimental participants) with non-missing
values for key variables. We next describe the procedures used to process the raw data and construct
this sample.

Test scores
Outcomes are derived from a series of tests given to students in the Fall of 2002 and each subsequent
Spring. The followup window extends through Spring 2006 for the three-year-old applicant cohort
and Spring 2005 for the four-year-old cohort.
   We use these assessments to construct summary indices of cognitive skills in each period. These
summary indices include scores on the Peabody Picture and Vocabulary Test (PPVT) and Wood-
cock Johnson III Preacademic Skills (WJIII) tests. The WJIII Preacademic Skills score combines
performance on several subtests to compute a composite measure of cognitive performance. We use
versions of the PPVT and WJIII scores derived from item response theory (IRT), which uses the
reliability of individual test items to construct more a more accurate measure of student ability than
the simple raw score. The summary index in each period is a simple average of standardized PPVT
and WJIII scores, with each score standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one in
the control group, separately by applicant cohort and year. Our core sample excludes applicants
without PPVT and WJIII scores in Spring 2003.
   The HSIS data includes a number of other test scores in addition to the PPVT and WJIII.
Previous analyses of the HSIS data have looked at different combinations of outcomes: Puma et
al. (2010) show estimates for each individual test, Walters (2015) uses a summary index that
combines all available tests, and Bitler et al. (2014) show separate results for the PPVT and
WJIII. We focus on a summary index of the PPVT and WJIII because these tests are among
the most reliable in the HSIS data (Puma et al., 2010), are consistently measured in each year
(which allows for interpretable intertemporal comparisons), and can be most easily compared to
the previous literature (for example, Currie and Thomas, 1995 estimate effects on PPVT scores).
Estimates that include additional outcomes in the summary index or restrict attention to individual
outcomes produced similar results, though these estimates were typically less precise.




                                                 45
Demographics
Baseline demographics come from a parental survey conducted in Fall 2002. Parents of eighty-one
percent of children responded to this survey. We supplement this information with a set of variables
in the HSIS “Covariates and Subgroups” data file, which includes additional data collected during
experimental recruitment to fill in characteristics for non-respondents. When a characteristic is
measured in both files and answers are inconsistent, the “Covariates and Subgroups” value is used.
Our core sample excludes applicants with missing values for baseline covariates except income,
which is missing more often than other variables. We retain children with missing income and
include a missing dummy in all specifications.

Preschool attendance
Preschool attendance is measured from the HSIS “focal arrangement type” variable, which rec-
onciles information from parent interviews and teacher/care provider interviews to construct a
summary measure of the childcare setting. This variable includes codes for centers, non-relative’s
homes, relative’s homes, own home (with a relative or non-relative), parent care, and Head Start.
Children are coded as attending Head Start if this variable is coded “Head Start;” another preschool
center if it is coded “Center;” and no preschool if it takes any other non-missing value. We exclude
children with missing focal arrangement types in constructing the core sample.

Preschool characteristics
Our analysis uses experimental site characteristics and characteristics of the preschools children
attend (if any), such as whether transportation is provided, funding sources, and an index of quality.
This information is derived from interviews with childcare center directors conducted in the Spring
of 2003. This information is provided in a student-level file, with the responses of the director of
a child’s preschool center included as variables. Site characteristics are coded using values of these
variables for treatment group children with focal care arrangements coded as “Head Start” at each
center of random assignment. In a few cases, these values differed for Head Start attendees at the
same site; we used the most frequently-given responses in these cases. An exception is the quality
index, which synthesizes information from parent, center director, and teacher surveys. We use the
mean value of this index reported by Head Start attendees at each site to construct site-specific
measures of quality.

Weights
The probability of assignment to Head Start differed across experimental sites. The HSIS data
includes several weight variables designed to account for these differences. These weights also in-
clude a factor that adjusts for differences in the probability that Head Start centers themselves
were sampled (Puma et al., 2010). This weighting can be used to estimate the average effect of
Head Start participation in the US, rather than the average effect in the sample; these parameters

                                                 46
may differ if effects differ across sites in a manner related to sampling probabilities. Probabilities of
sampling differed widely across centers, however, leading to very large differences in weights across
children and decreasing precision. Instead of using the HSIS weights, we constructed inverse prob-
ability weights based on the fraction of applicants at each site offered Head Start. The discussion
in Puma et al. (2010) suggests that the numbers of treated and control students at each site were
specified in advance, implying that this fraction correctly measures the ex ante probability that a
child is assigned to the treatment group. Results using other weighting schemes were similar, but
less precise.
   We also experimented with models including center fixed effects rather than using weights.
These models produced similar results, but our multinomial probit model is much more difficult to
estimate with fixed effects than with weights. We therefore opted to use weights rather than fixed
effects for all estimates reported in the article.

Appendix B: Identification of Complier Characteristics
This appendix extends results from Abadie (2002) to show identification of population shares,
characteristics and marginal potential outcome distributions for subpopulations of compliers drawn
from other preschools and no preschool. Under the monotonicity restriction (1), we have

        E [1 {Di = c} |Zi = 1] − E [1 {Di = c} |Zi = 0]    −E [1 {Di (0) = c} − 1 {Di (1) = c}]
    −                                                   =−
        E [1 {Di = h} |Zi = 1] − E [1 {Di = h} |Zi = 0]    E [1 {Di (1) = h} − 1 {Di (0) = h}]

                                            −P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c)
                                       =−
                                            P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h)

                                                      = Sc .

The share of compliers drawn from competing preschools can therefore be estimated as minus
the ratio of the Head Start offer’s effect on other preschool attendance to its effet on Head Start
attendance.
   Observed characteristics and marginal potential outcome distributions for complier subgroups
are also identified. Let g (Yi , Xi ) be any measurable function of outcomes and exogenous covariates.
Consider the quantity

                     E [g(Yi , Xi ) · 1 {Di = c} |Zi = 1] − E [g (Yi , Xi )) · 1 {Di = c} |Zi = 0]
              κc ≡                                                                                 .
                                  E [1 {Di = c} |Zi = 1] − E [1 {Di = c} |Zi = 0]

The numerator can be written

              E [g (Yi (Di (1)), Xi ) · 1 {Di (1) = c}] − E [g(Yi (Di (0)), Xi ) · 1 {Di (0) = c}],

where the conditioning on Zi has been dropped because offers are independent of potential outcomes
and covariates. This simplifies to

     κc = E [g (Yi (c), Xi ) |Di (1) = c] P (Di (1) = c) − E [g (Yi (c), Xi ) |Di (0) = c] P (Di (0) = c)

                     = E [g (Yi (c), Xi ) |Di (1) = c, Di (0) = c] P (Di (1) = c, Di (0) = c)

                     −E [g (Yi (c), Xi ) |Di (1) = c, Di (0) = c] P (Di (1) = c, Di (0) = c)

                     −E [g (Yi (c), Xi ) |Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c] P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c)

                 = −E [g (Yi (c), Xi ) |Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c] P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c),

where the first equality uses the fact that P (Di (0) = c|Di (1) = c) = 1. The denominator is the
effect of the offer on the probability that Di = c, which is minus the share of the population shifted
from c to h, −P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c). Hence,

                       −E [g (Yi (c), Xi ) |Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c] P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c)
                κc =
                                             −P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c)

                                                        48
                               = E [g (Yi (c), Xi ) |Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c],

which completes the proof.
   An analogous argument shows identification of E [g (Yi (n), Xi ) |Di (1) = h, Di (0) = n] by replacing
c with n throughout. Moreover, replacing c with h, the same argument shows identification of
E [g (Yi (h), Xi ) |Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h], which can be used to characterize the distribution of Yi (h)
for the full population of compliers.
   Note that κc is the population coefficient from an instrumental variables regression of g(Yi , Xi ) ·
1 {Di = c} on 1 {Di = c}, instrumenting with Zi . The characteristics of the population of compliers
shifted from c to h can therefore be estimated using the sample analogue of this regression. In
Appendix Table A.II we estimate the characteristics of non-Head Start preschool centers attended
by compliers drawn from c by setting g (Yi , Xi ) equal to a characteristic of the preschool center a
child attends (set to zero for children not in preschool). In Appendix Table A.VII we set g(Yi , Xi ) =
Yi to estimate the means of Yi (c), Yi (n), and Yi (h) for compliers.

Appendix C: Derivation of Marginal Value of Public Funds
This appendix derives the expressions for the marginal value of public funds in equations (8), (9)
and (12). Section C.4 discusses the use of earnings vs. wage changes to value test score impacts.

C.1 Program Scale
First, consider the case where competing programs are not rationed. From (4), the effect of a
change in δ on the average after-tax lifetime income of children is

                                           ∂B             ∂E [Yi ]
                                              = (1 − τ )p          .
                                           ∂δ               ∂δ
The test score for child i can be written

                                  Yi = Yi (Di (1))Zi + Yi (Di (0))(1 − Zi ),

so

                     E [Yi ] = E [Yi (Di (1))|Zi = 1] δ + E [Yi (Di (0))|Zi = 0] (1 − δ)

                                 = E [Yi (Di (1))] δ + E [Yi (Di (0))] (1 − δ),

where the second line follows from the assumption that Head Start offers are independent of po-
tential outcomes and potential treatment choices. Then

                                  ∂E [Yi ]
                                           = E [Yi (Di (1))] − E [Yi (Di (0))]
                                    ∂δ
                                        = E [Yi (Di (1)) − Yi (Di (0))]

                     = E [Yi (Di (1)) − Yi (Di (0))|Di (1) 6= Di (0)] P (Di (1) 6= Di (0)).

     Since Ui (n) and Ui (c) do not depend on Zi and Ui (h, 1) > Ui (h, 0), the condition Di (1) 6= Di (0)
implies that Di (1) = h. We can therefore rewrite the last expression as

            ∂E [Yi ]
                     = E [Yi (h) − Yi (Di (0))|Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h] P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h)
              ∂δ
                                  = LAT Eh · P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h),

which is equation (6). It follows that

                          ∂B
                             = (1 − τ )p · LAT Eh · P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h).
                          ∂δ
     From equation (5), the effect of a change in δ on the government budget is

                          ∂C      ∂P (Di = h)      ∂P (Di = c)      ∂E [Yi ]
                             = φh             + φc             − τp          .
                          ∂δ          ∂δ               ∂δ             ∂δ

                                                      50
The probability of Head Start participation is

                   P (Di = h) = E [1 {Di (1) = h}] δ + E [1 {Di (0) = h}] (1 − δ),

which implies

                         ∂P (Di = h)
                                     = E [1 {Di (1) = h}] − E [1 {Di (0) = h}]
                             ∂δ
                                 = E [1 {Di (1) = h} − 1 {Di (0) = h}]

                                    = E [1 {Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h}]

                                     = P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h),

where the second-to-last equality again used the fact that Di (1) 6= Di (0) implies Di (1) = h.
Similarly,

                           ∂P (Di = c)
                                       = E [1 {Di (1) = c} − 1 {Di (0) = c}]
                               ∂δ
                                   = −E [1 {Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c}]

                                    = −P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c).

Plugging these expressions into ∂C/∂δ yields

                ∂C
                     = φh P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h) − φc P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) = c)
                ∂δ
                           −τ pLAT Eh P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h)
                     = (φh − φc Sc − τ pLAT Eh ) P (Di (1) = h, Di (0) 6= h) ,

which is equation (7).
   The marginal value of public funds associated with a change in δ is the ratio of the impact on
B to the impact on C:

                                                        ∂B/∂δ
                                         M V P Fδ ≡           .
                                                        ∂C/∂δ

By plugging in expressions for these derivatives we obtain

                                                 (1 − τ )pLAT Eh
                                 M V P Fδ =                          ,
                                              φh − φc Sc − τ pLAT Eh

which is equation (8).

C.2 Rationed Substitutes
We next consider the case where seats in competing programs are rationed. As in Head Start, we
assume that seats in the competing program are distributed randomly. Let Zih and Zic denote
offers in options h and c, and let δh and δc denote the corresponding offer probabilities. Preferences
now depend on both offers. Utilities are described by

                                           Ui (h, Zih ), Ui (c, Zic ), Ui (n),

and preschool enrollment choices are defined by

                                     Di (zh , zc ) = arg max          Ui (d, zh , zc ).
                                                          d∈{h,c,n}

     Let πd (zh , zc ) = P (Di (zh , zc ) = d) denote the probability of enrollment in option d as a function
of the two offers. Total enrollment in option c is

 P (Di = c) = δh δc πc (1, 1) + δh (1 − δc )πc (1, 0) + (1 − δh )δc πc (0, 1) + (1 − δh )(1 − δc )πc (0, 0). (18)

We assume that competing preschools adjust δc so that dP (Di = c)/dδh = 0. Totally differentiating
equation (18) with respect to δh yields

                       dδc    δc (πc (1, 1) − πc (0, 1)) + (1 − δc ) (πc (1, 0) − πc (0, 0))
                           =−                                                                .
                       dδh    δh (πc (1, 1) − πc (1, 0)) + (1 − δh ) (πc (0, 1) − πc (0, 0))

                                          P (Di (1, Zic ) = h, Di (0, Zic ) = c)
                                      =                                           .
                                          P (Di (Zih , 1) = c, Di (Zih , 0) 6= c)

To keep enrollment constant, δc adjusts by the ratio of the effect of an offer at h on attendance at
c to the effect of an offer at c on attendance at c.
     Average test scores are given by

                          E [Yi ] = δh (δc E [Yi (Di (1, 1))] + (1 − δc )E [Yi (Di (1, 0))])

                          +(1 − δh ) (δc E [Yi (Di (0, 1))] + (1 − δc )E [Yi (Di (0, 0))]) ,

so
                                 dE [Yi ]
                                          = δc (E [Yi (Di (1, 1)) − Yi (Di (0, 1))])
                                  dδh

                                 +(1 − δc ) (E [Yi (Di (1, 0))] − E [Yi (Di (0, 0))])

              dδc
          +       · (δh E [Yi (Di (1, 1)) − Yi (Di (1, 0))] + (1 − δh )E [Yi (Di (0, 1)) − Yi (Di (0, 0)]) ,
              dδh
which can be rewritten
                                  dE [Yi ]
                                           = E [Yi (Di (1, Zic )) − Yi (Di (0, Zic ))]
                                   dδh

                                                           52
                                   dδc
                               +       · (E [Yi (Di (Zih , 1)) − Yi (Di (Zih , 0))])
                                   dδh

                              = LAT Eh · P (Di (1, Zic ) = h, Di (0, Zic ) 6= h)

                              +LAT Ec · P (Di (1, Zic ) = h, Di (0, Zic ) = c).

Here the local average treatment effects are defined as

                  LAT Eh = E [Yi (h) − Yi (Di (0, Zic ))|Di (1, Zic ) = h, Di (0, Zic ) 6= h],

                  LAT Ec = E [Yi (c) − Yi (Di (Zih , 0))|Di (Zih , 1) = c, Di (Zih , 0) 6= c].

This can be further simplified to

                 dE [Yi ]
                          = (LAT Eh + Sc LAT Ec ) · P (Di (1, Zic ) = h, Di (0, Zic ) 6= h).
                  dδh

    The effect of an increase in δh on the government’s budget is

                                   dC         dP (Di = h)        dE [Yi ]
                                       = φh ·             − τp ·          .
                                   dδh            dδh             dδh

Since δc adjusts to keep P (Di = c) constant, we have dP (Di = c)/dδh = 0. We assume that
all marginal children drawn into c by offers come from n rather than h. This implies LAT Ec =
LAT Enc , and furthermore

                            dP (Di = h)
                                        = P (Di (1, Zic ) = h, Di (0, Zic ) 6= h).
                                dδh

Then the marginal value of public funds is

                                                              dB/dδh
                                            M V P Fδ,rat =
                                                              dC/dδh

                 = (1 − τ )p (LAT Eh + Sc LAT Enc ) P (Di (1, Zic ) = h, Di (0, Zic ) 6= h)



× [φh P (Di (1, Zic ) = h, Di (0, Zic ) 6= h) − τ p (LAT Eh + Sc LAT Enc ) P (Di (1, Zic ) = h, Di (0, Zic ) 6= h)]−1

                                        (1 − τ )p (LAT Eh + LAT Enc · Sc )
                                    =                                      ,
                                        φh − τ p (LAT Eh + LAT Enc · Sc )

which is equation (9).
    This implies that M V P Fδ,rat > M V P Fδ whenever Head Start and other preschools have similar
test score effects and other preschools are cheapt\er. Specifically, when LAT Enc = LAT Enh =
                                                                  (1−τ )pLAT E                     (1−τ )pLAT E
LAT E > 0 and LAT Ech = 0, we have M V P Fδ,rat =                 φh −τ pLAT E   > M V P Fδ =    φh −φc Sc
                                                                                                   1−Sc
                                                                                                           −τ pLAT E
whenever φc < φh .

C.3 Structural Reforms
Next, consider structural reforms that alter the program feature f . A change in f generates the
following impacts on income and the government budget:

                                              ∂B             ∂E [Yi ]
                                                 = (1 − τ )p          ,
                                              ∂f              ∂f

            ∂C       ∂P (Di = h)                               ∂P (Di = c)      ∂E [Yi ]
                = φh                 + φ0h (f )P (Di = h) + φc             − τp
            ∂f             ∂f                                      ∂f            ∂f
                                                                                                
   ∂P (Di = h)         0                             −1     ∂P (Di = c)/∂f          ∂E [Yi ] /∂f
 =               φh + φh (f )∂ (ln P (Di = h)/∂f ) + φc                     − τp                  .
       ∂f                                                   ∂P (Di = h/∂f )      ∂P (Di = h)/∂f

We can write mean test scores as

                   E [Yi ] = E [Yi (h) · 1 {Ui (h, Zi ) + f ≥ Ui (c), Ui (h, Zi ) + f ≥ 0}]

                                +E [Yi (c) · 1 {Ui (c) ≥ Ui (h, Zi ) + f, Ui (c) ≥ 0}]

                                 +E [Yi (n) · 1 {Ui (h, Zi ) + f ≤ 0, Ui (c) ≤ 0}] ,

where we have normalized Ui (n) to zero. The third term in this expression is
                                                               ´∞ ´0´ −f
      E [Yi (n) · 1 {Ui (h, Zi ) + f ≤ 0, Ui (c) ≤ 0}] =       −∞ −∞ −∞ y       · gyu (y, uh , uc )duh duc dy,

where gyu (·) is the joint density function of Yi (n), Ui (h, Zi ) and Ui (c). Using Leibniz’s rule for
differentiation under the integral sign and Fubini’s theorem, we have

   ∂E [Yi (n) · 1 {Ui (h, Zi ) + f ≤ 0, Ui (c) ≤ 0}] ´ ∞ ´ 0 ∂ h´ −f                          i

                           ∂f                                ∂f −∞


               ˆ   ∞   ˆ   0

               ˆ 0

          =−           gu (−f, uc )duc · E [Yi (n)|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = 0, Ui (c) < 0]
                −∞

          = − guh (−f )P (Ui (c) < 0|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = 0) · E [Yi (n)|Ui (h) + f = 0, Ui (c) < 0]

where gy|u (·) is the density of Yi (n) conditional on the utilities, gu (·) is the joint density of the
utilities, and guh (·) is the marginal density of Ui (h, Zi ). The last factor in this expression is the
average of Yi (n) for individuals who are indifferent between Head Start and home care, and strictly

                                                          54
prefer home care to the competing program. The first two factors give the total density associated
with this event.
   Similar arguments show the effects of a change in f on scores in c and h:

  ∂E [Yi (c) · 1 {Ui (c) ≥ Ui (h, Zi ) + f, Ui (c) ≥ 0}]
                                                         = −gc−h (f )P (Ui (c) > 0|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = Ui (c))
                           ∂f
                                                         × E [Yi (c)|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = Ui (c), Ui (c) > 0] ,


∂E [Yi (h) · 1 {Ui (h, Zi ) + f ≥ Ui (c), Ui (h) + f ≥ 0}]
                                                           = {gc−h (f )P (Ui (c) > 0|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = Ui (c))
                             ∂f
                                                            + guh (−f )P (Ui (c) < 0|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = 0)}
                                                            × E [Yi (h)|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = max {Ui (c), Ui (n)}] ,

where gc−h (·) is the density of Ui (c) − Ui (h, Zi ).
   The corresponding effects on choice probabilities are

                      ∂P (Di = h)
                                  = guh (−f )P (Ui (c) < 0|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = 0)
                          ∂f
                                     + gc−h (f )P (Ui (c) > 0|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = Ui (c)) ,

                     ∂P (Di = c)
                                 = −gc−h (f )P (Ui (c) > 0|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = Ui (c)).
                         ∂f

The share of marginal children drawn from the competing program is then given by

                                         →
                                         −     ∂P (Di = c)/∂f
                                         Sc =−
                                               ∂P (Di = h)/∂f

                                gc−h (f )P (Ui (c) > 0|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = Ui (c))
     =                                                                                                  .
         guh (−f )P (Ui (c) < 0|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = 0) + gc−h (f )P (Ui (c) > 0|Ui (h, Zi ) + f = Ui (c))

By plugging these equations into the expressions for costs and benefits and dividing by the total
density of marginal compliers, we obtain

                                                    (1 − τ )pM T Eh
                               M V P Ff =                   →
                                                            −               ,
                                            φh (1 + η) − φc S c − τ pM T Eh


which is equation (12).

C.4 Valuing test score impacts
Here we consider more carefully how to value test score impacts in dollar terms. Specifically,
we show that if test score impacts yield corresponding labor supply responses, an adjustment to
lifetime earnings impacts is necessary to properly capture the welfare benefits of a policy change.


                                                      55
This argument implies that we should use projected impacts on wages (as opposed to earnings) to
value test score gains.
    Letting y denote a child’s human capital level (as proxied by test scores), we are interested in
deriving a child’s willingness to pay (as an adult) for an intervention shifting her human capital
level from y0 to y1 > y0 . If this willingness to pay exceeds the net cost to government of financing
the human capital increase, then the intervention is efficiency improving in the Kaldor-Hicks sense
that all parties could be made better off.
    We work with a simple static model where children face a competitive labor market with no
uncertainty and are free to choose lifetime labor supply in accord with utility maximization. Sup-
                                                                                            
pose children have utility over consumption (q) and leisure (l) given by the function u q, l . The
lifetime budget constraint of a child with human capital level y can be written:

                                        q = w (y) T − ¯l + b,
                                                        


where w (y) = (1 − τ ) py ≡ ω is the after-tax wage, T is a time endowment, and b is unearned
income. The uncompensated (Marshallian) labor supply function is l (ω, b).
    Define the excess expenditure function:

                             e (ω, ū) ≡ min q − ω T − ¯l : u q, ¯l ≥ ū
                                                                 


as the minimal level level of unearned income necessary to obtain utility level ū at wage level ω.
By the envelope theorem
                                         ∂
                                           e (ω, ū) = −lc (ω, ū) ,
                                        ∂ω
where lc (ω, ū) is the compensated (Hicksian) labor supply function.
    Suppose that at human capital level y0 the child is able to obtain utility level u0 . The compen-
sating variation:
                            CV (y0 , y1 ) ≡ e (w (y0 ) , u0 ) − e (w (y1 ) , u0 ) ,

measures how much income a child could give away at human capital level y1 and still obtain his
old utility level u0 . A first order Taylor approximation yields:

                          CV (y0 , y1 ) ≈ (1 − τ ) plc (w (y0 ) , u0 ) (y1 − y0 )
                                         = (1 − τ ) pl (w (y0 ) , b) (y1 − y0 ) .               (19)

In words, the value to a child of a small increase in test scores is given by the mechanical impact
this increase in her wage would have on her lifetime earnings if her labor supply were fixed at
l (w (y0 ) , b).
    This is to be contrasted with the actual effect of the human capital increase on his earnings




                                                      56
which can be written:

            w (y1 ) l (w (y1 ) , b) − w (y0 ) l (w (y0 ) , b) ≈ (1 − τ ) pl (w (y0 ) , b) (1 + ) (y1 − y0 )

              w(y0 )     ∂
where  ≡   l(w(y0 ),b) ∂ω l (w (y0 ) , b)   gives the uncompensated elasticity of labor supply. Relative to
(19), this expression has an extra term (1 + ) that reflects how the child adjusts her lifetime labor
supply in response to the increase in her after-tax wage. By the envelope theorem, these behavioral
changes (when they are small) do not yield additional utility.
   The upshot of this analysis is that empirical estimates of the impact of test scores on earnings
                            1
need to be deflated by     1+   to reflect the child’s valuation of the intervention. Much of the literature
finds small (or even negative) long run uncompensated labor supply elasticities suggesting that the
necessary adjustment is probably small (Ashenfelter et al., 2010; Blundell et al., 2015). Consistent
with this view, Lindqvist and Vestman (2011) find the proportional response of wages to test scores
to be only slightly below the corresponding response of earnings (see Appendix Table A.IV).

Appendix D: Empirical Cost Benefit Analysis
This appendix discusses in more detail the assumptions underlying the cost-benefit analysis of
Section VI.

Representativeness of the HSIS data
The HSIS data are a nationally-representative random sample of Head Start applicants, and HSIS
offers are distributed randomly (Puma et al., 2010). The HSIS is therefore ideal for estimating
values of LAT Eh and Sc in the population of Head Start applicants.21 Fortunately, the current
Head Start application rate is high, which limits the scope for selection into the applicant pool
that might change with program scale. Currie (2006) reports that two-thirds of eligible children
participated in Head Start in 2000. This is higher than the Head Start participation rate in the
HSIS sample (49 percent). However, fifteen percent of participants attend undersubscribed centers
outside the HSIS sample, which implies that about 57 percent (0.85 · 0.49 + 0.15) of all applicants
participate in Head Start (Puma et al., 2010). For this to be consistent with a participation rate
of two-thirds among eligible households, virtually all eligible households must apply. Therefore,
selection into the Head Start applicant pool is unlikely to be quantitatively important for our
analysis.

Program benefits
The term p in equation (4) gives the dollar value of a one standard deviation increase in test
scores. Although earnings are unavailable for the HSIS sample, a growing body of evidence shows
a consistent link between short-run test score effects and earnings impacts. Rather than choose a
particular value for p, we consider a range of values consistent with the literature, focusing on how
low of a value would be necessary to undermine the conclusion that Head Start pays for itself.
       Appendix Table A.IV summarizes several studies that compare test score and earnings impacts
for the same intervention. The most closely related study is by Chetty et al. (2011), an analysis
of the Tennessee STAR class size experiment. Chetty et al. (2011, p.7 online appendix) show that
a one standard deviation increase in kindergarten test scores induced by an experimental change
in classroom quality yields a 13.1 percent increase in earnings at age 27.22 The STAR results also
  21
      As detailed in Appendix A, our analysis excludes HSIS applicants without followup data (20 percent of the
sample), and we use weights that capture the probability a child is assigned to Head Start but not the probability a
Head Start center is sampled from the larger population of centers. Our estimates may not be representative of the
full population of Head Start applicants if children without followup data differ systematically from other children
or if applicant populations differ in a way that is systematically related to center-level sampling probabilities.
   22
      Effects in standard deviation units may have different meanings if score distributions differ across populations
or over time. For example, Cascio and Staiger (2012) show that test score norming partially explains fadeout in
effects of educational interventions. Sojourner (2009) shows that the standard deviation of nationally-normed scores
in the STAR sample is 87 percent of the national standard deviation. The standard deviations of Spring 2003 PPVT
and WJIII scores in the HSIS are 70 percent and 91 percent of the national standard deviation, for a mean of 81
percent. This suggests we should rescale the STAR estimate of 13.1 percent to 12.2 percent in our sample; our
baseline calibrations use a more conservative estimate of 10 percent.



                                                         58
suggest that immediate test score effects of early-childhood programs predict earnings gains better
than test score effects in other periods: classrooms that boost test scores in the short run increase
earnings in the long run despite fadeout of test score impacts in the interim. We therefore project
earnings gains based on our first-year estimates of LAT Eh .
       The STAR classroom quality estimate of 13.1 percent is smaller than a corresponding OLS
estimate controlling for rich family characteristics in the STAR sample (18 percent), and comparable
to estimates from Chetty et al. (2014b) linking test score and earnings impacts for teacher value-
added (10.3 percent for value-added, 12 percent for OLS with controls). The Chetty et al. (2014b)
findings also replicate the pattern of long-run earnings impacts coupled with fadeout of medium-run
test score effects. In an analysis of the Perry Preschool Project, Heckman et al. (2010b) estimate
larger ratios of earnings per standard deviation of test scores (24 to 29 percent). Sibling fixed
effects estimates from studies of Head Start by Currie and Thomas (1995) and Garces et al. (2002)
suggest much larger ratios, though the earnings estimates are also very statistically imprecise. To
be conservative, our baseline calibrations assume an earnings impact of 10 percent per standard
deviation of earnings, which is at the bottom of the range of estimates reported in Table A.IV.23
       Calculating percentage changes in earnings requires a prediction of average earnings in the HSIS
population. Chetty et al. (2011) calculate that the average present discounted value of earnings in
the United States is approximately $522,000 at age 12 in 2010 dollars. Using a 3-percent discount
rate, this yields a present discounted value of $438,000 at age 3.4 (the average age of applicants in
the HSIS). Children who participate in Head Start are disadvantaged and therefore likely to earn
less than the US average. The average household participating in Head Start earned 46 percent
of the US average in 2013 (US DHHS, 2013; Noss, 2014). Lee and Solon (2009) find an average
intergenerational income elasticity in the United States of roughly 0.4, implying that the average
child in Head Start is expected to earn 78 percent of the US average (1 − (1 − 0.46) · 0.4).24 These
calculations yield a present value of earnings ē equal to $343, 492 at age 3.4.
       Thus, our baseline estimate is that the marginal benefit of enrolling an additional child in Head
Start is 0.1 · $343, 492 · LAT Eh . Using the pooled first-year estimate of LAT Eh reported in Section
III, we project an earnings impact of 0.1 · $343, 492 · 0.247 = $8, 472. We set τ = 0.35 based upon
estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (2012, Figure 2) that account for federal and state
taxes along with food stamps participation. This generates a discounted after-tax lifetime earnings
gain of $5,513 for compliers.
  23
     The only estimates below 10 percent in Table A.IV are from Murnane et al. (1995) and Currie and Thomas
(1999). Murnane et al. use High School and Beyond data to construct an OLS estimate relating 12th grade scores to
log wages at age 24 for males (7.7 percent). The same approach produces a larger estimate for females (10.9 percent).
Currie and Thomas report partial effects from models that include both math and reading scores. Since these scores
are very highly correlated, the total effect for a single test score is likely to be larger.
  24
     Chetty et al. (2014c) find that the IGE is not constant across the parent income distribution. Appendix Figure
IA in their study shows that the elasticity of mean child income with respect to mean parent income is 0.414 for
families between the 10th and 90th percentile of parent income but lower for families below the 10th percentile. Since
Head Start families are drawn from these poorer populations, it is reasonable to expect that the relevant IGE for this
population is below 0.4, implying that our rate of return calculations are conservative.




                                                         59
Program costs
Equation (7) shows that the net marginal social cost of Head Start enrollment depends on the
costs to government of enrollment in Head Start and competing preschools along with the share
of compliers drawn from other preschools. Per-pupil expenditure in Head Start is approximately
$8, 000 (US DHHS, 2013). As reported in Column (7) of Table III, the estimated share of compliers
drawn from other preschools is 0.34.
   To get an idea of the costs of competing programs, Panel A of Appendix Table A.II reports
information on funding sources for Head Start and competing preschool centers. These data come
from a survey administered to the directors of Head Start centers and other centers attended by
children in the HSIS experiment. Column (2) shows that competing preschools receive financing
from a mix of sources, and many receive public subsidies. Thirty-nine percent of competing centers
did not complete the survey, but among respondents, only 25 percent (0.153/0.606) report parent
fees as their largest source of funding. The modal funding source is state preschool programs
(30 percent), and an additional 16 percent report that other childcare subsidies are their primary
funding source. Column (3) reports characteristics of competing preschools attended by c-compliers,
estimated using a generalization of the methods for characterizing compliers described by Abadie
(2002) (see Appendix B). In the absence of a Head Start offer, c-compliers attend preschools that
rely slightly more on parent fees, but most are financed by a mix of state preschool programs,
childcare subsidies, and other funding sources.
   Panel B of Table A.II compares key inputs and practices in Head Start and competing preschool
centers attended by children in the HSIS sample. On some dimensions, Head Start centers appear
to provide higher-quality services than competing programs. Columns (4) and (5) show that Head
Start centers are more likely to provide transportation to preschool and frequent home visiting
than competing centers. Average class size is also smaller in Head Start, and Head Start center
directors have more experience than their counterparts in competing preschools. As a result of
these differences, Head Start centers score higher on a composite measure of quality. On the other
hand, teachers at alternative programs are more likely to have bachelors degrees and certification,
and these programs are more likely to provide full-day service. Column (6) shows that compet-
ing preschools attended by Head Start compliers are very similar to the larger set of alternative
preschools in the HSIS sample.
   Table A.II suggests that roughly 75% of competing programs are financed primarily by public
subsidies. Of course, even centers that are financed primarily by fees are likely to receive subsidies
for enrolling the disadvantaged students in our sample (who are unlikely to be able to pay full price).
Based upon this, we use as our “preferred” estimate that φc = 0.75φh , which is a conservative
estimate if Head Start and competing preschools are equally costly and 75% of Head Start eligible
students had their tuition fully subsidized at competing preschools while others receive partial
subsidies. Our “pessimistic” scenario where φc = 0.5φh corresponds roughly to the case where all
of the non-responding centers in Table A.II relied on private fees for financing. Finally, the “naive”
assumption that φc = 0 is useful as a benchmark for assessing the importance of fiscal externalities.

Appendix E: Interacted Two-stage Least Squares
This Appendix investigates the use of the interacted two-stage least squares approach described
in Section VII to estimate models treating both Head Start and other preschools as endogenous
variables. We begin with a simple example that clarifies the parameters estimated by this strategy,
then apply the strategy to the HSIS data.

Interacted 2SLS estimand

Suppose there is a single binary covariate Xi ∈ {0, 1}. Under the assumptions described in Section
IV, covariate-specific instrumental variables coefficients give local average treatment effects:

                    E [Yi |Zi = 1, Xi = x] − E [Yi |Zi = 0, Xi = x]
                                                                           = LAT Eh (x).
           E [1 {Di = h} |Zi = 1, Xi = x] − E [1 {Di = h} |Zi = 0, Xi = x]

Furthermore, we have

                       LAT Eh (x) = Sc (x)LAT Ech (x) + (1 − Sc (x))LAT Enh (x),
                 P (Di (1)=h,Di (0)=c|Xi =x)
where Sc (x) =   P (Di (1)=h,Di (0)6=h|Xi =x)   is the covariate-specific share of compliers drawn from other
preschools. The Sc (x) are identified, but if we assume LAT Ech and LAT Enh vary with x in an
unrestricted way we have two equations in four unknowns and cannot use the available information
to recover subLATEs.
   Suppose instead we assume that the subLATEs don’t vary with x, so that LAT Edh (x) =
LAT Edh ∀x, d ∈ {c, n}. Our two equations are

                           LAT Eh (1) = Sc (1)LAT Ech + (1 − Sc (1))LAT Enh ,

                           LAT Eh (0) = Sc (0)LAT Ech + (1 − Sc (0))LAT Enh .

The solution to this system is
                                                Sc (0)LAT Eh (1) − Sc (1)LAT Eh (0)
                             LAT Enh =                                              ,
                                                          Sc (0) − Sc (1)
                                     (1 − Sc (0))LAT Eh (1) − (1 − Sc (1))LAT Eh (0)
                       LAT Ech =                                                     .
                                                 (1 − Sc (0)) − (1 − Sc (1))
The right-hand sides tell us the probability limits of 2SLS coefficients from a model instrumenting
1 {Di = h} and 1 {Di = c} with Zi and Zi · Xi and controlling for Xi . Specifically, the Head Start
coefficient from this interacted 2SLS strategy equals LAT Enh and the other preschool coefficient
equals LAT Enh − LAT Ech . To see this note that the 2SLS system is just-identified under constant
effects which implies constant subLATEs. There is therefore exactly one way to solve for the two
effects of interest using the available information; since the equations above yield these effects they
must give this solution.
   If the constant effects assumption is wrong, the interacted 2SLS strategy yields a Head Start
coefficient equal to

which can be written
                                  Sc (0)Sc (1)
                    LAT Enh =    Sc (0)−Sc (1)   · (LAT Ech (1) − LAT Ech (0))
                                                                                             (20)
                              + (wn (1)LAT Enh (1) + (1 − wn (1))LAT Enh (0)) ,

where
                                                   Sc (0)(1 − Sc (1))
                                      wn (1) =                        .
                                                    Sc (0) − Sc (1)

This expression shows that the interacted 2SLS strategy yields a Head Start coefficient equal to
a weighted average of the subLATEs LAT Enh (x), plus a term that depends on heterogeneity in
LAT Ech (x). If there is heterogeneity in this other subLATE, this strategy does not recover the
causal effect of h relative to n for any well-defined subpopulation. This result is a special case
of the results in Kirkboen et al. (2014) and Hull (2015), who show that 2SLS does not generally
recover causal effects in models with multiple endogenous variables.

F.2 Identification
We next consider identification of the selection model parameters and the subLATEs in a model
with one binary covariate, Xi ∈ {0, 1}. In this case the choice model is fully saturated and there
are four parameters for each value of Xi : ψh (x, 1), ψh (x, 0), ψc (x), and ρ(x). These parameters are
just-identified and perfectly fit the four independent conditional choice probabilities

                      πd (x, z) = P r [Di = d|Xi = x, Zi = z] , d ∈ {h, c}, z ∈ {0, 1}.

The parameters of the selection model are therefore implicit functions of the choice probabilities.
    Let ∆d (x) denote the difference in mean outcomes between offered and non-offered children,
conditional on Xi and Di :

                 ∆d (x) = E [Yi |Xi = x, Zi = 1, Di = d] − E [Yi |Xi = x, Zi = 0, Di = d].

Evaluating equation (16) for Xi = 1 and Xi = 0 gives

                  ∆d (1) = γdh (λh (1, 1, d) − λh (1, 0, d)) + γdc (λc (1, 1, d) − λc (1, 0, d)),

                  ∆d (0) = γdh (λh (0, 1, d) − λh (0, 0, d)) + γdc (λc (0, 1, d) − λc (0, 0, d)).

Solving these equations for the selection coefficients yields

                                                         γdh =
                     ∆d (1) (λc (0, 1, d) − λc (0, 0, d)) − ∆d (0) (λc (1, 1, d) − λc (1, 0, d))
                                                                                                                          ,
(λh (1, 1, d) − λh (1, 0, d)) (λc (0, 1, d) − λc (0, 0, d)) − (λh (0, 1, d) − λh (0, 0, d)) (λc (1, 1, d) − λc (1, 0, d))
                                                         γdc =
                     ∆d (1) (λh (0, 0, d) − λh (0, 1, d)) − ∆d (0) (λh (1, 0, d) − λh (1, 1, d))
                                                                                                                          .
(λh (1, 1, d) − λh (1, 0, d)) (λc (0, 1, d) − λc (0, 0, d)) − (λh (0, 1, d) − λh (0, 0, d)) (λc (1, 1, d) − λc (1, 0, d))

These expressions have the form of multivariate instrumental variables coefficients. Specifically,
they are coefficients from an infeasible IV model that uses Zi and Zi Xi as instruments for vih and
vic in the Di = d sample, controlling for a main effect of Xi . Though vih and vic are unobserved,


                                                          64
the λd (Xi , Zi , Di ) functions capture their conditional means and can therefore be used to construct
the first stage for the IV model.
   The expressions for γdh and γdc have the same denominator. A necessary and sufficient con-
dition for identification of the two selection coefficients is that this denominator is non-zero. To
interpret the requirements for identification, note that the λd (·) are functions of the selection model
parameters, so they are implicitly functions of the choice probabilities π(x, z). This implies that
if πd (x, 1) = πd (x, 0) ∀d, then λh (x, 1, d) = λh (x, 0, d) and λc (x, 1, d) = λc (x, 0, d), resulting in a
denominator equal to zero. A necessary condition for identification is therefore that the Head Start
offer shifts choice probabilities for both covariate groups. Similarly, if πd (1, z) = πd (0, z) ∀d for
either z = 0 or z = 1, the denominator equals zero. A second necessary condition is therefore that
choice probabilities differ across covariate groups conditional on the Head Start offer. This requires
differences in compliance group shares (always takers, c-never takers, n-never takers, c-compliers
and n-compliers). Finally, note that the denominator may be zero even if the offer shifts behavior
for both covariate groups and choice probabilities differ conditional on Zi . Identification requires
Head Start offers to shift the conditional means of both vih and vic in such a way that the mean
changes in the two unobservables are not proportional.

F.3 Estimating SubLATEs
After estimating the selection model we use it to predict mean potential outcomes for subpopula-
tions that respond differently to the Head Start offer. We then use these predictions to compute
treatment effects and assess the fit of the model. For example, we construct estimates of LAT Enh ,
the effect of Head Start relative to home care for children that switch from home care to Head
Start in response to an offer.
   N -compliers switch from n to h when offered, and are therefore described by

                       ψh (Xi , 1) + vih > 0 > ψh (Xi , 0) + vih , ψc (Xi ) + vic < 0.

We can rewrite these conditions

                            −ψh (Xi , 1) < vih < −ψh (Xi , 0), vic < −ψc (Xi ).

The selection errors vih and vic are truncated between (−ψh (Xi , 1), −ψh (Xi , 0)) and (−∞, −ψc (Xi ))
for n-compliers. Equation (14) therefore implies that mean potential outcomes for n-compliers are

             E [Yi (d)|Xi , −ψh (Xi , 1) < vih < −ψh (Xi , 0), vic < −ψc (Xi )] = θd0 + Xi0 θdx

a second-step least squares regression. To obtain unconditional estimates, we integrate over the

F.4 Specification tests
Testing for underidentification

The identification argument in Section F.2 shows that the selection coefficients for enrollment
alternative d are identified when there exist an x and x0 in the support of Xi such that

                                (λh (x, 1, d) − λh (x, 0, d)) (λc (x0 , 1, d) − λc (x0 , 0, d)) 6=
                                 (λh (x0 , 1, d) − λh (x0 , 0, d)) (λc (x, 1, d) − λc (x, 0, d)).

Equivalently, γdh and γdc are not identifed if

                                                                 66
                          λh (x, 1, d) − λh (x, 0, d) = qd1 × (λc (x, 1, d) − λc (x, 0, d)) ∀x

for some proportionality factor qd . We test the null hypothesis that the model is underidentified
by fitting the least squares regression

                                                         3
                                                         X                                         k
                   λ̂h (Xi , 1, d) − λ̂h (Xi , 0, d) =         qdk λ̂c (Xi , 1, d) − λ̂c (Xi , 0, d) + ηid                    (21)
                                                         k=0

in the sample with Di = d. The null hypothesis that qd0 = qd2 = qd3 = 0 is compatible with
underidentification of the outcome equation for alternative d; if this hypothesis is false, the control
function differences are not proportional and the selection parameters are identified.
    To account for estimation error in the first-step multinomial probit parameters we conduct
inference via the nonparametric bootstrap. Let q̂d = (q̂d0 , q̂d2 , q̂d3 )0 denote full-sample estimates
from equation (21) and let q̂db denote corresponding estimates in bootstrap sample b. We form the
test statistic
                                                                        −1

                                                       b=1

and q̄d is the mean of q̂db across bootstrap samples. We then compare F̂d to critical values of the
F (3, ∞) distribution. The results of this test are reported in Appendix Figure A.II.

Testing additive separability

The key restriction in equation (14) is additive separability: mean potential outcomes are additively
separable in Xi , vih and vic . As a result, the selection coefficients do not depend on Xi and
these coefficients can be identified via comparisons of gaps in selected outcomes by offer status
across covariate groups. The additive separability restriction cannot be tested with a single binary
covariate, but it is testable if Xi takes more than two values.
    To test the additive separability restriction for care alternative d we estimate regressions of the
form

ˆid = θ̃d0 + Xi0 θ̃dx + γ̃dh λ̂h (Xi , Zi , d) + γ̃dc λ̂c (Xi , Zi , d) + λ̂h (Xi , Zi , d)Xi0 ξdh + λ̂c (Xi , Zi , d)Xi0 ξdc + uid

for each care alternative, where ˆid is the residual from two-step estimation of (15). We then
construct an F -statistic for the joint null hypothesis that ξdh = ξdc = 0 for all three care alternatives.
Let F̂ denote the full-sample F -statistic for this test, and let ξˆdh and ξˆdc denote full-sample estimates
of ξdh and ξdc . In bootstrap sample b we form corresponding estimates ξˆdhb and ξˆb and test the
                                                                                     dc
hypothesis that ξˆdh
                   b = ξˆ
                         dh and ˆ
                                ξ b = ξˆ for all d, generating the test statistic F̂ b . A bootstrap

                                                                 67

Table VII reports p-values for this test.

Testing model fit

Our control function approach requires correct specification of both the choice model and the model
for outcomes. To assess the fit of the choice model we use the multinomial probit estimates to predict
probabilities of Head Start and substitute preschool participation, π̂h (Xi , Zi ) and π̂c (Xi , Zi ). We
then split the sample into 25 cells defined by interactions of quintiles of the two probabilities. Cells
with fewer than 50 observations are grouped into a single cell. Finally, we test that empirical
choice probabilities match mean predicted probabilities in each cell, treating the mean predictions
as fixed. Appendix Figure A.I plots empirical choice probabilities against cell means of the two
model predictions. The nonparametric means are very close to the model predictions and a joint
test of equality does not reject. This suggests that the choice model fits well.
   Two additional analyses assess the fit of the model for outcomes. The first splits the sample into
vingtiles of predicted LAT Eh , and compares model-predicted estimates to IV estimates within these
bins. As shown in Appendix Figure A.III, the model predictions tightly matches the IV estimates
while also capturing substantial effect heterogeneity. We cannot reject that the IV estimates and
model predictions are equal up to sampling error (p = 0.26).
   The second analysis compares instrumental variables estimates of mean potential outcomes that
are nonparametrically identified to corresponding estimates from the selection model. As shown in
Appendix B, for example, an estimate of mean Yi (n) for n-compliers can be obtained by estimating
the instrumental variables model

                               Yi 1 {Di = n} = κ0 + κn 1 {Di = c} + ui ,

                                    1 {Di = n} = m0 + m1 Zi + ei .

The IV estimate κ̂n is a consistent estimate of E [Yi (n)|Di (1) = h, Di (0) = n], which can be com-
pared to the two-step control function estimate µ̂nh
                                                  n .
   We use a bootstrap covariance matrix to test the fit of the outcome model. Let τ̂ denote
a vector of differences between nonparametrically estimated and model-predicted moments (for
example, κ̂n − µ̂nh
                 n ), and let τ̂b denote the corresponding estimate in bootstrap sample b. We form
the test statistic

                                               Ŵ = τ̂ 0 V̂τ−1 τ̂

where

Here τ̄ is the mean of τ̂b across bootstrap trials. We then compare Ŵ to critical values of the χ2t
distribution, where t is the number of elements in τ̂ . The results of this test are shown in Appendix
Table A.VII.

Appendix G: Site Group Fixed Effects
This appendix describes methods for incorporating experimental site group fixed effects into our
two-step control function estimation procedure. These methods allow us to leverage cross-site
variation while reducing the dimension of heterogeneity across sites, eliminating an incidental pa-
rameters problem that would arise with a full set of site fixed effects. Our approach is similar in
spirit to that of Bonhomme and Manresa (2015), who develop methods that account for grouped
patterns of heterogeneity in linear panel data models. In the translation from panel data to our
multi-site experimental setting, sites play the role of cross-sectional units and experimental subjects
play the role of time periods.

G.1 Model
Experimental sites are indexed by s ∈ {1, .., S}, and s(i) denotes the site for individual i ∈
{1, ..., N }. Each site belongs to one of G unobserved groups, with g(s) ∈ {1, ..., G} the group
for site s. The number of sites S may grow asymptotically with N , but the number of groups G is
assumed to be fixed. Utilities for Head Start, other preschools and home care are given by


                                                           g(s(i))
                                       Ui (h, Zi ) = ψh              (Zi ) + vih ,
                                           Ui (c) =      ψcg(s(i))   + vic ,
                                           Ui (n) = 0,

                                                                "                         #!
                                                                        1      ρg(s(i))
                           (vih , vic ) |Zi , s(i) ∼ N     0,                                  .
                                                                    ρg(s(i))         1
Here we have omitted other observed covariates for simplicity, though these can be easily incorpo-
rated. This model implies that preferences depend on the site s(i) through the site group g(s(i)).
This reduces the dimension of cross-site heterogeneity from S to G.

G.2 Estimation
                                                                                                   G

                                                                                                   g=1
                                                                                                         could
be straightforwardly estimated via a multinomial probit model saturated in group indicators. These
groupings are unknown a priori, however, so the group assignments must be estimated from the
data. Following Bonhomme and Manresa (2015), we use an estimation scheme that alternates be-
tween maximizing the likelihood function conditional on group assignments and reassigning groups
to maximize the likelihood function conditional on the group-specific parameters.
   Let g0 (s) be the initial type assignment for site s. The estimated group-specific parameters at
iteration k ∈ {0, 1, ...} are given by


                                                           70

are then
                                                                                                           

                                               i:s(i)=s

The algorithm proceeds until the change in the log likelihood from one iteration to the next falls
below a tolerance threshold.

G.3 Implementation
Before implementing the estimation procedure, we group together very small sites until the re-
maining sites have no fewer than 10 observations. Where possible, sites with the smallest numbers
of observations are first grouped together within Head Start program areas until the smallest site
within an area has at least 10 observations (see Puma et al., 2010 for a description of HSIS program
areas and experimental sites). For program areas with fewer than 10 total observations, we then
iteratively group the smallest program areas into sites until the smallest site has no fewer than 10.
This procedure results in 183 sites with average size 19.5.
    The group fixed effects estimator described above is then applied to the sites. The objective
function for the group fixed effects estimation procedure may not be globally concave. To aid in
finding the global maximum, we sequentially increase the complexity of the model by estimating
it for each G and using the final group assignments from the previous model to initialize the next
model. Specifically, to estimate a model with G groups, we start with the final assignments from a
model with G − 1 groups and split the group with the lowest final log likelihood at the median log
likelihood. This procedure performed well in Monte Carlo trials.
    To avoid overfitting the model, we select the final number of groups based on the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC). The BIC penalizes extra parameters in proportion to the log of the
                  ∗ (s) denote the final group assignment for site s when the total number of groups
sample size. Let gG
is G. The BIC is given by
               N
                                  g ∗ (s(i))        g ∗ (s(i))        g ∗ (s(i)) g ∗ (s(i))
              X                                                                            
   BIC(G) = −2   log L Di |Zi ; ψ̂hG         (1), ψ̂hG         (0), ψ̂c G       , ρ̂ G        + (S + 4G) log N .
                     i=1

Here the S in the second term captures parameters corresponding to group assignments for the S
sites, while the 4G captures the estimated group-specific parameters. The final number of groups
is chosen to minimize BIC(G). As shown in Appendix Table A.VI, the BIC selects 7 groups when
the model includes no other covariates and 6 groups when the model includes our full set of baseline

   Our two-step models with site group fixed effects include indicators for site groups in all second-
step regressions, fully interacted with preschool alternative. The site groups and group-specific pa-
rameters are reestimated in our bootstrap resampling procedure, with group assignments initialized
at their full-sample values in each bootstrap trial.

Notes: This figure plots empirical probabilities of participating in Head Start and competing preschools against corresponding model predictions. Estimates come from the
multinomial probit model in Table VI. Cells are defined by interactions of quintiles of the two predicted probabilities from the model. Cells with fewer than 50 observations are
combined into a single cell. Panel A compares empirical probabilities of Head Start participation against cell means of the corresponding model-predicted probability, and panel B
shows corresponding results for substitute preschools. Each panel shows the results of a test that the empirical and model-predicted probabilities are equal, treating the model
predictions as fixed. The joint p -value for a test that the model fits in both panels equals 0.76.

                             Figure A.II. Identification of the Selection Model

Notes: This figure plots differences in control functions that predict Head Start and other
preschool tastes conditional on preschool choices and covariates. Estimates come from the
multinomial probit model in Table VI. The horizontal axis shows the difference in predicted
Head Start tastes with the Head Start offer switched on and off, and the vertical axis shows the
difference in predicted other preschool tastes with the offer switched on and off. Identification of
the selection model requires that these values do not all lie on a line through the origin for each
preschool choice. Dashed lines show OLS fits through the origin, and points show means of
control function differences by percentile of the difference in predicted Head Start tastes. Tests
are based on regressions of the difference in 𝜆h on a constant and a third-order polynomial in the
difference in predicted 𝜆c for each preschool choice. F -statistics and p -values come from
bootstrapped Wald tests of the hypothesis that the constant, second- and third-order terms are
zero. See Appendix F for details. To preserve scale, the figure omits points in the bottom decile
of the predicted difference in tastes for Head Start.

Notes: This figure plots model-predicted local average treatment effects against IV
estimates. Estimates come from the two-step model in column (5) of Table VII. The
sample is divided into vingtiles on the basis of the model-predicted LATE. Points
show IV estimates by vingtile vs. average model-predicted LATE by vingtile. The
dashed line is the 45 degree line. Test statistic and p -value come from a Wald test of
the hypothesis that the 45 degree line fits all points up to sampling error.

Notes: This table reports two-stage least squares estimates of the effects of Head Start and other
preschool centers in Spring 2003. The model in the first row instruments Head Start attendance with
the Head Start offer. Models in the remaining rows instrument Head Start and other preschool
attendance with interactions of the offer and indicators for experimental sites. Sites with fewer than
10 observations are grouped together within program areas as described in Appendix D. All models
control for main effects of the interacting variables and baseline covariates. JIVE refers to the JIVE2
estimator defined in Angrist, Imbens and Krueger (1995), computed after first partialing out the
exogenous covariates as described by Ackerberg and Devereux (2009). Overidentification tests for
JIVE are based on Hansen's (1982) J -statistics for 2SLS and LIML. Overidentification tests for JIVE
are based on the many instrument and heteroskedasticity-robust statistic derived by Chao et al.
(2013). First stage F -statistics are Angrist/Pischke (2009) partial F 's. Standard errors are robust to
heteroskedasticity.
