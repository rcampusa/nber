                                           ABSTRACT

This paper presents an independent large-scale experimental evaluation of two online goal-setting
interventions. Both interventions are based on promising findings from the field of social
psychology. Approximately 1,400 first-year undergraduate students at a large Canadian
university were randomly assigned to complete one of two online goal-setting treatments or a
control task. Additionally, half of treated participants also were offered the opportunity to
receive follow-up goal-oriented reminders through e-mail or text messages in an attempt to test a
cost-effective method for increasing the saliency of treatment. Across all treatment groups, we
observe no evidence of an effect on GPA, course credits, or second year persistence. Our
estimates are precise enough to discern a seven percent standardized performance effect at a five
percent significance level. Our results hold by subsample, for various outcome variables, and
across a number of specifications.

   I.      Introduction

Having earned acceptance into college, most students intend to earn good grades
and keep options open for graduate school (Beattie, Laliberté, & Oreopoulos, 2016).
Despite these intentions, many attain low grades and drop out. In the province of
Ontario, for example, thirty percent of college students withdraw from their
program within the first year, with factors relating to grades and motivation playing
the largest roles (Finnie, Childs, & Qiu, 2010). Two-thirds of these students do not
switch into another program. Among all four-year colleges in the United States, only
fifty-six percent of college students graduate in six years or less (Symonds,
Schwartz, & Ferguson, 2011).


        Studies suggest that financial aid, structured coaching, tutoring, and group
activities help students complete college (Scrivener et al., 2015). Financial aid helps
relax credit constraints and allow students to focus more on studying instead of
working (Belley and Lochner, 2007), while structured coaching, tutoring, and group
activities teach effective study habits and, correspondingly, help students achieve
good grades (Cook, 2014; Oreopoulos, Lavecchia, & Brown, forthcoming). While
incorporating such services into college students’ curriculum and requiring students
to enroll full-time has been show to double completion rates (Scrivener et al. 2015),
such programs are costly to implement and therefore difficult to scale to large
student populations (Bloom, 1984).


        Promising research from social psychology suggests that brief one-time
interventions can produce effects comparable to traditional services (Yeager and
Walton, 2011; Cohen and Garcia, 2014; Walton, 2014). These interventions are
effective because they challenge unhelpful perspectives about school—for example,
Yeager et al. (2016) find that struggling students get better grades after completing
an online exercise aimed to promote a growth mindset: The belief that intellect can
be developed. Although the saliency of treatment fades over time, an effective
intervention affects recursive processes, altering a student’s long-term trajectory
(Yeager & Walton, 2011). Often, these brief one-time interventions are inexpensive
and can be scaled.


       Morisano et al. (2010) find that struggling college students earn higher
grades when they write about personal goals at the beginning of the school year:
Students randomly assigned to complete a brief online goal-setting intervention
experienced a large increase in Grade Point Average (GPA) relative to a control
group, and a higher likelihood of maintaining a full course load. It is believed that
salient goals affect action (Locke & Latham, 1990, 2002; Locke et al., 1981), and that
goal-setting affects performance by improving focus, effort, enthusiasm, and
persistence, while leading students to more efficient strategies for achieving desired
outcomes (Locke & Latham, 2002).             Online goal-setting interventions are
inexpensive and can be scaled, with the potential to help students earn better grades
and complete college.


       Most studies that evaluate the efficacy of goal-setting interventions either
have small sample sizes (e.g. Morisano et al., 2010) or use quasi-experimental
approaches with observational data (e.g. Schippers, Sheepers & Peterson, 2015),
making it difficult to credibly identify treatment effects. In contrast, this paper
presents an independent large-scale experimental evaluation of the effect of two
goal-setting exercises on grades and retention rates in college.


       We randomly assign approximately 1,400 undergraduate students from a
representative commuter campus in suburban Toronto to control or treatment.
Treated students completed an online goal-setting exercise similar to that of
Shippers, Sheepers & Peterson (2015) and related to Morisano et al. (2010), or a
condensed version of this goal-setting exercise and a short mindset exercise
designed to foster the belief that intellect can be developed.1 To test a cost-effective
way to increase the saliency of treatment, half of the treated students were offered
the opportunity to regularly receive e-mail or text message reminders, which made
explicit references to the goals each student described during the completion of
initial treatment. All experimental materials, documented in the appendices A
through C, were generously provided by Jordan Peterson (Morisano et al., 2010;
Peterson and Mar, 2013; Schippers, Scheepers, & Peterson, 2015), and are similar to
that of Schippers et al. (2015). Grades and registration status were monitored for
two years after treatment.




      II.      Theory and Evidence

Students who do not complete college often begin to struggle shortly after the start
of their first term (Adelman, 1999, 2006; Ishitani & DesJardins, 2002). In part, the
struggles stem from inadequate preparation (Kuh et al., 2007), which makes it
difficult to complete coursework and keep up in a fast-paced, competitive
environment (Pennebaker, Colder & Sharp, 1990). All else equal, students who
devote adequate time and effort to their studies perform well (Burks et al., 2015)
and complete college (Pascarella and Terezini, 2005). But many students do not
study enough to earn good grades (Beattie, Laliberté, & Oreopoulos, 2016). Non-
cognitive factors like attitude, procrastination, and persistence predict how much
schooling a student attains nearly as well as cognitive skill (Kautz et al., 2014).


            Studies suggest that non-academic services help students by fostering
motivation, effort, and good study habits (Robbins et al., 2003; Lotkowski, Robbins
& Noeth, 2004; Lazowski & Hulleman, 2015). First-year seminars (Schnell, Louis, &
Doetkott, 2003), cognitive behavioral therapy (Heller et al., 2013; Cook et al., 2014),
and coaching (Oreopoulos, Lavecchia & Brown, forthcoming) have all been shown to

1   We outline below how our intervention differs from that in Morisano et al. (2010).
improve a number of academic outcomes. An emerging recent literature suggests
that goal-setting interventions also help students earn better grades (Morisano,
2008).


         Goals represent conscious and meaningful objectives that people pursue
(Elliot et al., 2001), believed to affect both thought and action (Locke & Latham,
1990, 2002; Locke et al., 1981; Wiese & Freund, 2005). It is believed that people
regulate their lives through meaningful thought (Bandura, 1997; Locke & Latham,
2002).2 If students are present-biased, prompting them to think more carefully
about their future may help reduce the bias by increasing focus, effort, motivation,
and persistence (Locke & Latham, 2002; Locke et al., 1981; Smith, Locke, & Barry,
1990, Lavecchia, Liu, and Oreopoulos, 2016). This leads to the discovery of relevant
knowledge and the use of more efficient strategies for achieving desired outcomes.
Goal-setting is also believed to decrease stress (Elovainio & Kivimäki, 1996) and
increase working memory (see Morisano [2008] for an overview), making students
with clear goals more likely to complete college (Braxton et al., 2004; Kirby &
Sharpe, 2001).


         Simply making a list of goals is not sufficient for helping students reach
desired outcomes (Koestner et al., 2002).3 For goal setting to be effective, goals must
be meaningful, challenging, specific, and attainable. Individuals are more likely to
put in effort when a goal is meaningful and difficult (Koestner et al., 2002; Ryan et
al., 1996; Locke & Latham, 2002), and making goals specific tends to reduce
variation in performance (Locke et al., 1989).4 Moreover, people who believe that
they are making progress toward a goal perform better (Diener, 1984; Koestner et
al., 2002). As a result, performance is improved when a large or complex goal is

2 More than four hundred studies find a correlation between goal-setting and task performance
(Locke & Latham, 1990, 2002, 2007).
3 See Morisano and Shore (2010) for a detailed overview of conditions related to successful goal

setting (pp. 253).
4 As one might expect, the probability of goal attainment declines as goal difficulty progressively

exceeds individual ability (Bandura, 1977; Perrone et al., 2004; Schunk, 1991), as perceived obstacles
present too great a challenge to attainment (Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 2000).
split into smaller goals because regular feedback on progress is then readily
available (Latham & Seijts, 1999; Locke & Latham, 2002). For similar reasons, it is
important for people to set a timeline, create a detailed plan for attaining their goal,
list the consequences of their goal, and create alternative plans for when they reach
obstacles (Gollwitzer, 1999; Bandura, 1977; Schunk, 1991).                 Goal-setting
interventions guide students through this process in great detail.


       Morisano et al. (2010) construct a randomized experimental evaluation of
the effects of a one-time goal-setting intervention on the academic performance of
struggling undergraduate students at McGill University in Montreal.          Interested
participants were self-nominated academically struggling students with GPA’s
below 3.0. They were qualitatively screened for inclusion and assessed for feelings
of academic struggle, with a total of eighty-five students meeting the participation
criteria and being included in the study. Students were offered financial
remuneration for their time.


       Randomly selected treated students were then guided through a sequence of
eight online goal-setting exercises, adapted for young adult students from an
intervention by Peterson and Mar (2004).          Students were instructed that the
exercise would take 2 to 2.5 hours. At the outset, they were asked to think about
their values and futures and what they hoped to accomplish in a general sense. They
were then asked to define seven or eight specific goals and to examine each goal
carefully, explaining why each was important and vividly describing potential
obstacles and strategies for overcoming them.          The treatment group (n=45)
exhibited a large and statistically significant increase in mean GPA from 2.25 to 2.91,
(an increase of about 70 percent of a standard deviation) while the control group
(n=40) experienced no discernible change. No treated participant dropped below a
full course load, while eight of the students in the control group did—two students
from the control group withdrew from the university entirely. Subsequent goal-
setting interventions have found heterogeneous treatment effects (Schippers,
Scheepers, & Peterson, 2015), and effects on retention rates but not on GPA (Finnie
et al., 2017).


       Most goal-setting interventions have a small sample size (e.g. Morisano et al.,
2010), use observational data, or rely on pre-post quasi-experimental designs (e.g.
Schippers, Sheepers & Peterson, 2015). Given the dramatic estimated effects and
the scalability of these interventions, a primary purpose of this study is to test the
external validity of these studies with a similar intervention in an experimental
setting with a sufficiently large sample size.


       A brief goal-setting intervention can push students in the right direction, but
it is important for students to maintain confidence in their abilities to reach their
goals (Bandura, 1977, 1993).       Students with low confidence seek to maintain
positive judgments of their ability (Elliot & Dweck, 1988; Leondari & Gialamas,
2002; Robins & Pals, 2002) and often tend to perform poorly because they do not
embrace challenges as opportunities for learning more effective strategies for goal
attainment (Diener & Dweck, 1978, 1980). In contrast, students who believe that
ability is to be developed along a journey treat challenges and setbacks as learning
experiences, using them to form better strategies and, ultimately, performing better
(Dweck & Leggett, 1988).


       Many studies find a positive association between academic performance and
a growth mindset – the belief that intellectual abilities can be developed (Stipek &
Gralinski, 1996; Dweck, 2000; Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007; Romero et
al., 2014; Claro et al., 2016). A growth mindset is believed to foster the perception
that difficult tasks are a medium for growth (Blackwell et al., 2007), encouraging
challenging learning experiences (Mueller & Dweck, 1998; Romero et al., 2014).
Students who are taught the science behind the malleability of the brain and the
benefits associated with a growth mindset perform better than their peers (Aronson
Fried, and Good, 2002).
           Paunesku et al. (2015) conduct a randomized experimental evaluation of a
one-time, online growth mindset intervention on the academic performance of high
school students. A total of 1,594 students from 13 high schools in the United States
participated. The growth mindset treatment guided students through an article that
explained how the brain is able to grow through practice and hard work, citing
relevant findings from the field of neuroscience. Students were then asked to either
summarize the article in their own words, or to advise a hypothetical discouraged
student. The treatment module was designed to last 45 minutes. The authors find a
statistically significant interaction between treatment and an indicator for whether
the student was at risk prior to treatment. A follow up study by Yeager et al. (2016)
attempts to improve the efficacy of this intervention by making it more relevant for
high school students: The authors find that struggling high school students assigned
to complete the revised growth mindset intervention experienced a 0.13 unit
increase in GPA, on average.


           While these interventions are small in terms of resources and costs, a well-
designed intervention makes use of novel mechanisms and targets relevant
subjective beliefs to create an impactful experience from the perspective of the
student (Yeager & Walton, 2011). Moreover, Morisano et al. (2010) and Paunesku
et al. (2015) use the act of writing to encourage students to internalize treatment—
writing requires complex reasoning (Sugiyama, 2001) and has been shown to
increase working memory and improve grade point average (Klein & Boals, 2001).5
While the saliency of treatment fades over time, an effective intervention will affect
recursive processes (Yeager & Walton, 2011).


           This paper tests a new goal-setting treatment additionally intended to foster
a growth mindset, developed by Jordan Peterson (Morisano et al., 2010; Peterson
and Mar, 2013; and Schippers, Scheepers, and Peterson, 2015). Some treated
participants are also randomly assigned to regularly receive personalized goal-


5   See Smyth (1998) for an overview of the benefits associated with expressive writing.
oriented e-mails or text messages in attempt to increase the saliency of the
treatment in a cost-effective way. A number of studies have shown that periodically
reminding parents about their student's academic progress increases parental
engagement and student achievement (Kraft & Dougherty, 2013; Bergman, 2016;
Kraft & Rogers, 2014; Mayer et al., 2015). Other studies have used text messages to
increase the probability of students renewing financial aid (Castleman & Page,
2014), and improve academic outcomes (Castleman & Meyer, 2016).


       We hypothesize that goal-setting treatments will positively affect grades and
retention rates and that the effect will be larger for students experiencing academic
difficulty. We also hypothesize that this effect will fade over time and will fade
slower for students assigned to receive reminders.




   III. Methodology


Setting, Participants, and Experimental Procedures


We conducted our experiment at beginning of the 2014-2015 academic year at the
University of Toronto’s satellite campus in Mississauga (UTM). UTM is primarily a
commuter campus with approximately 12,500 undergraduate students. Roughly
eighty percent of students at UTM live at home with their parent(s), slightly less
than a quarter identify the campus as their first choice, and the majority plan to
work at least part-time while attending. Entry grades range from about 75 to 90
percent, with the median entry high school grade 82 percent. Many of the students
are immigrants or children of immigrants. Among those who entered in 2001, only
38 percent completed a degree in four years, while the six-year graduation rate was
about 70 percent. The rate for students from the lowest quantile of high school
grades is 55 percent (Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos, 2009).
       At the beginning of the 2014-2015 academic year, all undergraduate students
enrolled in an introductory economics course at UTM were asked to participate in
an online exercise for two percent of their final grade. Students completed the
exercise online during the first two weeks of the fall semester and 1,505 students
registered to take the exercise. Only 4 percent of students enrolled in first year
economics did not register (and did not receive participation grade) and only 13
students total did not provide consent for using their data for external research,
leaving 1,492 students for our baseline sample. Student-level administrative data
was collected for every consenting student through the University of Toronto's
centralized student information service. Academic outcomes were monitored for
two years after the intervention.


       All participating students were required to create an online account and
complete a preliminary survey eliciting background information, study habits, and
attitudes. Upon completion of the survey, forty percent of participating students
were randomly assigned to the control group, while the remaining sixty percent
were assigned to treatment.


       Among students assigned to treatment, fifty percent were allocated to
complete a goal-setting treatment similar to that of Schippers et al. (2015) and
related to Morisano et al. (2010). The other fifty percent of treated students were
given a condensed version of the goal-setting treatment, in addition to an exercise
designed to foster a growth mindset.      Ensuing completion of the designated
exercise, fifty percent of all treated participants were then assigned to regularly
receive personalized goal-oriented reminders through e-mail, and offered the
opportunity to receive reminders through text messages; roughly seventy-five
percent of students who were offered opportunity provided a phone number. (See
Figure 1 for a visual representation of the complete randomization procedure.) All
participants were e-mailed a copy of the answers that they had provided throughout
the exercise.
       In Table 1, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the realized proportions
of students assigned to control and treatment groups differ from the intended
proportions at any reasonable significance level. This result is expected, since we
maintain the full sample of participating students prior to randomization for our
analysis. Tables 2 and 3 illustrate that there does not exist a statistically significant
difference between the sample means of any baseline characteristics across control
and treatment groups, as expected with random assignment. In terms of the
descriptive characteristics of this sample, forty-nine percent of participants are
female, seventy-three percent are first-year students, fifty-seven percent are non-
native English speakers, fifty-seven percent are not Canadian citizens, and the
average age is nearly nineteen. Seventeen percent of participating students lived in
residence in the year of the initial treatment, and the mean high school average was
eighty-two percent.




Treatments


The goal-setting intervention was designed to help students imagine a roadmap for
achieving their goals. This intervention was developed using theory on goal-setting,
expressive writing (Smyth, 1998), and creativity models (Simonton, 1999).
Students were required to provide answers in writing. Minimum word counts and
time restrictions were imposed to encourage participants to give each answer an
appropriate amount of consideration — to encourage students to write freely, we
made clear we would delete their written thoughts after emailing their completed
exercise for reference.     Responses to part of a similar exercise reported in
Oreopoulos and Petronijevic (2017) suggest that virtually all students took the task
very seriously, writing in personal detail. The entire module was designed to take
two hours to complete.
         The goal-setting treatment encouraged students to set goals that are
meaningful, specific, challenging, and attainable. Students were asked to write
about one thing that they could do better, things that they would like to learn in the
near and distant future, and their current habits. Students were also asked to
envision their future social life, future family life, future career, and to write about
how to maintain a balanced life. They were required to list role models and create a
title and description for both an ideal future and a future that they would like to
avoid.


         Next, students were encouraged to identify specific goals and envision steps
that they could take in order to induce the realization of their preferred future.
Students were asked to describe their ideal future in detail, identify and prioritize
goals from their answers so far, and evaluate their motives for each of these goals.
This process was meant to help students identify specific goals that are meaningful
to them, and to help students avoid the natural tendency to set too many goals at
once or goals that conflict with each other (Baumeister & Heatherton, 1996;
Koestner et al., 2002). Students were then asked to consider consequences of their
goals, create detailed plans for attaining their goals, and to identify benchmarks for
monitoring their progress along the way.


         As a point of clarification, our treatment and that from Schippers et al. (2015)
differs from Morisano et al. (2010) in three main ways. First, regarding content,
Morisano et al. (2010) did not ask students to write about their future social life,
future family life, future leisure activities, or a future to avoid, and they did not ask
students to create a title for their ideal future; in addition, they asked students to
ascertain their levels of commitment to each of their chosen goals.              Second,
Morisano et al. (2010) did not impose minimum word counts or required writing
times, but instead hand-checked that the exercises were given sufficient
consideration. The authors also asked that students write for a minimum of 2 and a
maximum of 2.5 hours in one sitting and without taking breaks. Third, the exercises
were presented in a different order than in the current study. We discuss the
likelihood that these differences explain our contrasting findings in Section V below.
All experimental materials for this treatment group are provided in Appendix A.


       The goal-setting-plus-mindset treatment replaced the requirement for
students to define eight specific future goals with an introduction to growth mindset
theory – the belief that intellect can be developed. The growth mindset treatment
guided students through an article that explained how the brain is able to grow
through practice and hard work, citing relevant findings from the field of
neuroscience. Students were then asked to recall related experiences in which hard
work led to success, and to identify ways that they may apply a growth mindset to
deal with obstacles in the future. This treatment aimed to discourage the belief that
ability is innate, and to encourage students to recognize effort as an effective way to
achieve success and to take on challenging learning experiences. This treatment
was made with the intention of combining the cores of prior goal-setting and
mindset interventions, both of which have been shown to be effective at improving
student outcomes. All experimental materials for this treatment group are provided
in Appendix B.


       To increase the saliency of treatment, half of the treated students were
offered the opportunity to receive reminders. Reminders were sent through e-mail
and text messages. These reminder messages consisted mainly of academic tips and
motivational support. For students who competed the full goal-setting treatment,
some reminders were personalized with goal-oriented messages, making explicit
reference to the individual-specific goals each student provided during the
completion of the initial treatment. Appendix D documents all the messages we sent
throughout the experiment. Students were allowed to choose the frequency of
reminders, and were allowed to discontinue reminders at any time, although only
four chose to opt out. Text messages were brief, typically three lines in length; e-
mails were longer and more detailed. For the 75 percent of students who provided
a cell phone number to contact, each text message was sent together with an email
containing similar information but with more detail. Students could respond to
either email or text, though we did not prompt them and few actually did.


       The control group was given a personality test measuring the Big Five
personality traits. This exercise was intended to require an equivalent amount of
time and effort as the treatments but without affecting grades or retention rates,
thus making it an appropriate control group exercise and making our results
comparable to other goal-setting interventions. All experimental materials for the
control group are provided in Appendix C.




   IV.     Results

Empirical Strategy


We estimate treatment effects by comparing means in a regression framework.
Since randomization was successful (see Tables 1 to 3), the ordinary least squares
estimator for each coefficient is a consistent estimator of the average causal effect of
being offered the opportunity to complete the corresponding treatment on the
outcome of interest relative to the control group. Since 1,399 out of a total of 1,492
registered students completed the exercise, these estimates are likely close to the
unconditional average treatment effects.


       Our primary specification estimates the effect of any treatment. We also
estimate the effect of the goal-setting treatment, the effect of the goal-setting plus
mindset treatment, the effect of any treatment with reminders, the effect of any
treatment without reminders, and the effect of each treatment with and without
reminders. We also present results by subsamples more at risk of poor academic
performance, and results corresponding to alternative specifications that account
for student characteristics, and student characteristics and course fixed effects.
       Our main outcomes of interest are course grades and registration status.
Course grades are increasing in student performance on a scale ranging from zero to
one hundred, and recorded at the end of every semester. Registration status is a
binary outcome equal to one if and only if the participant is officially registered as a
student at the University of Toronto.          Registration status is recorded at the
beginning of every school year.       In part, course grades were chosen because
evidence suggests that grades proxy for knowledge retention and are the best
predictor of college completion (Pascarella & Terezini, 2005). While registration
status is a standard outcome variable within the existing literature on goal-setting
interventions, Morisano et al. (2010) focus on GPA instead of grades. But course
grades provide us with more power to estimate treatment effects and allow for us to
control for course difficulty with course fixed effects. To be sure that this does not
affect the results, we estimate treatment effects for an array of alternative
dependent variables, including GPA.


       When the dependent variable is course grades, reported course grades are
stacked for every student, the regression is run at the course-student level, and
standard errors are clustered by student identification numbers.             All other
specifications are run at the student level.


Main Results


Table 4 presents the estimated effect of each treatment on two years of course
grades by semester, and registration status in the year following treatment. Each
row is associated with a particular outcome variable. Each element of column (1)
reports the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding outcome variable for
the control group. Columns (2) through (10) present the estimated average causal
effect of each treatment relative to the control group, and the corresponding
standard error. We observe no evidence of an effect of treatment with estimates
precise enough to discern a one percentage point increase in course grades at a five
percent significance level—this is equivalent to a seven percent standardized
performance effect.


       Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the distributions of grades by treatment group.
There is no observable effect of treatment on the distribution of grades and a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test fails to reject the null hypothesis that control and
treatment group grade distributions are the same.


Heterogeneous Treatment Effects, Alternative Outcomes, and Alternative
Specifications


Tables 5 and 6 provide the estimated effect of each treatment on all grades in the
year of initial treatment by administrative subsample and survey subsample,
respectively. Table 7 reports treatment effects by quantiles of high school grades.
We explore treatment effects across various subsamples to be thorough with the
analysis, to explore whether the effects of personal goal setting are stronger for
native English speakers as found in Morisano et al. (2010), and to explore whether
the interventions are more effective in subsamples that are a better reflection of the
self-nominated, academically struggling sample of participants in Morisano et al.
(2010).


       The estimates presented in Tables 5 through 7 generally do not show a
positive effect associated with treatment—only 8 out of 306 estimated effects are
statistically different from zero at a five percent significance level, five of which are
negative. At the five percent significance level, we would expect that about 15 of the
306 estimated effects would be significant because of sampling error. Therefore,
while some treatment effects are positive for students whose mother tongue is
English, given the null findings overall, we are uncomfortable concluding that these
estimates reflect the treatment being more effective for native English speakers, as
in Morisano et al. (2010). It may be the case that they are simply an artifact of a
multiple hypothesis testing problem. We also find that the interventions are
ineffective for students in the bottom quantile of the incoming high school grades
distribution.6 Since high school grades are a strong predictor of college success, it is
therefore unlikely that the treatments are effective in a subsample of struggling
college students, as in Morisano et al. (2010).


         Overall, these results suggest that none of the treatments were able to
improve students’ academic outcomes, both in the full sample and across several
student subgroups. Table 8 reports the estimated effect of treatment on alternative
outcomes: We observe no discernible effect of treatment on first year GPA, quantiles
of GPA, the number of credits taken, the number of credits failed, or the number of
credits received.


         All results hold independent of the chosen specification. We continue to
observe no evidence of any effects when we control for a broad range of student
characteristics, or when we control for student characteristics and course fixed
effects. See the online appendix for all results under these secondary and tertiary
specifications.




    V.       Discussion

One-time online interventions may provide a cost-effective way to help students
perform better and complete college. But we find no effect associated with an
intervention designed to help college students set good goals and guide them
through the process of developing detailed plans for achieving their goals. We also
find no effect associated with a new intervention in which students set goals and
complete an exercise aimed to foster a growth mindset. Moreover, goal-oriented



6In addition, treatment effects for the top quantile of students are not statistically different from zero
at the five percent significance level. The bottom quantile of students had a high school average of 77
percent and the top quantile of students had an average of 88 percent.
reminders were not able to induce a positive effect.                   These results hold by
subsample, for various outcome variables, and across a number of specifications.


          Morisano et al. (2010) test a related intervention on a sample of McGill
students with GPAs less than 3.0, and report a treatment effect on GPA of more than
half a standard deviation. We find no effects. To be clear, our intervention does
differ from the intervention tested in Morisano et al. (2010). Designed by Jordan
Peterson, the goal setting intervention tested in this paper is similar to the
intervention in Schippers et al. (2015) and is closely related to the Self Authoring
modules of Peterson, Higgins, Pihl, and Schippers.7 While these modules overlap to
a large degree with the intervention in Morisano et al. (2010), they are different in
the ways described above and it is possible that these differences explain our null
findings. We believe, however, that the discrepancies between the two interventions
are very slight, and it therefore seems unlikely that they would generate such
strikingly different results.


          There are at least four other potential explanations for the contrast between
our results and the pilot study by Morisano et al. (2010). First, the students in our
study are mainly first-year students enrolled in an economics course and were not
self-nominated as struggling or screened for inclusion. While Morisano et al. (2010)
do not have any first-year students in their sample, Schippers et al. (2015) find
effects for first year students. We provide evidence that our results do not depend
on the fact that our sample mainly consists of first-year students (see Table 5). The
Morisano et al. study recruited volunteers with GPAs below 3.0 who acknowledged
they were experiencing academic difficulty. Although our estimated null effects
hold for the bottom quantile of students, it is possible that self-nomination is
important, or that UTM’s entrance criterion truncates the sample of students that
would have been affected by the treatment. This seems unlikely, however, because




7   The Self Authoring modules can be found at https://www.selfauthoring.com/.
UTM’s entrance criterion is significantly lower than McGill’s, where Morisano et al.
conduct their study.


       Second, despite effort to preserve the feel of the intervention in the pilot
study, and in addition to the differences already documented above, there may exist
further unknown, but crucial, differences in design. If so, this only accentuates the
difficulties associated with scaling interventions. Third, it may be the case that the
results of the pilot study are spurious. We have nearly eighty times the number of
observations and sufficient power to discern a seven percent standardized
performance effect at a five percent significance level. Fourth, it is possible that the
results of the pilot study stem from an error in data collection or estimation, or an
unintentional treatment effect associated with recruitment or design.


       The fact that our mindset treatment did not produce an effect does not
necessarily contrast the existing literature on growth mindset interventions. Our
mindset treatment was short and may not have been long enough to induce an
effect. Moreover, combining treatments does not always increase the magnitude of
the effect of a treatment (Good, Aronson, & Inzlicht, 2003; Yeager et al., 2014;
Paunesku et al., 2015). In general, a growth mindset is associated with better goals
(Elliot & Dweck, 1988; Leondari & Gialamas, 2002; Robins & Pals, 2002), but our
mindset treatment was placed at the end of the exercise, making it unable to affect
the goals that students set.     It is also possible that students were cognitively
exhausted by the time that they had reached the mindset exercise.


       The reminders aimed to increase the saliency of the initial treatment. But the
initial treatment had no effect on student performance.            As a result, it is
unreasonable to believe that reminders would induce a positive effect. Moreover,
messaging campaigns are not always effective at improving the types of academic
outcomes considered in this paper. For example, Oreopoulos and Petronijevic
(2017) show that a text messaging campaign is unable to replicate the effects of an
academic coaching program.
       Despite the contrast with some of the existing social-psychology literature,
our findings are not necessarily surprising. A meta-analysis of 100 publications in
psychology journals finds that when effects are replicated with well-powered
designs, the mean effect size is half that of the pilot study, on average (Open Science
Collaboration, 2015). Furthermore, while ninety-seven percent of pilot studies had
statistically significant results, only thirty-six percent of replications had significant
results. Social psychology interventions are no exception (Dee, 2015; Hanselman et
al., 2016).


       This paper represents a step toward identifying what works and what does
not in goal-setting interventions. These interventions are attractive for their low
cost and easy scalability but more research is required to evaluate the conditions by
which goal-setting interventions can be used to help college students perform well
and complete college.
