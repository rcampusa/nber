                                           ABSTRACT

Social and economic networks are ubiquitous, serving as contexts for job search, technology diffusion,
the accumulation of human capital and even the formulation of norms and values. The systematic
empirical study of network formation – the process by which agents form, maintain and dissolve links –
within economics is recent, is associated with extraordinarily challenging modeling and identification
issues, and is an area of exciting new developments, with many open questions. This article reviews
prominent research on the empirical analysis of network formation, with an emphasis on contributions
made by economists.

Job-seekers often receive help from family and acquaintances when conducting searches (e.g.,
Loury, 2006). Likewise individuals learn about new products and technologies from friends
and colleagues (e.g., Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo and Jackson, 2013). The actions and
attributes of an adolescent’s peer group predict her initiation of sexual activity, drug use and
academic performance among other behaviors (Case and Katz, 1991; Gaviria and Raphael,
2001). Even the exchange of goods and services may occur within a network. For example,
electronic producers may utilize different, but overlapping, sets of manufacturers to assemble
finished products, sharing valuable technology and know-how with each (e.g., Kranton and
Minehart, 2001).

The ubiquitousness of networks, along with their ability to predict many social and economic
behaviors, motivates their academic study. In particular, the correlation between the actions
of individuals (firms) and the attributes and actions of those with whom they are connected
raises at least two questions. First, how do networks form and evolve? Second, do the actions
and attributes of one’s peers – the set of agents to which one is connected – influence one’s
own actions? There is ample evidence that measurable features of an individual’s social
network predict important social and economic outcomes. Whether these associations are
causal is unclear.

The processes of network formation and network influence are interconnected. If one’s net-
work of friends and acquaintances facilitates job search, it may be that individual’s seek
out connections, at least in part, because of these benefits. In such situations unobserved
drivers of network structure may covary with those of the outcome of interest, rendering any
observed relationship between network structure and outcomes, at least partly, spurious.
Biases of these type are common in many areas of microeconometric research, addressing
them in the context of social network research is difficult.

The interconnected nature of network formation and their effects on outcomes of interest to
decision-makers has important policy implications. If, for example, an adolescent’s rate of
learning is meaningfully influenced by the characteristics and behaviors of her friends, then

                                               1
interventions acting on an existing network of friendships, as well as those designed to change
the structure of friendships, may both influence observed achievement (e.g., Goldsmith-
Pinkham and Imbens, 2013).

While social network analysis has a long history in several disciplines, especially sociology (cf.,
Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Bonacich and Lu, 2012), the study of networks in economics,
both theoretically and, even more so, empirically is considerably more recent.

Within economics empirical research on social networks generally concerns itself with one
of the two questions posed above (but rarely both). Manski (1993), in a seminal paper,
studied the second question: under what conditions can a researcher infer that the actions
and/or characteristics of one’s peers influence one’s own actions? Manski’s paper has been
extraordinarily influential; both sparking further methodological research (e.g., Brock and
Durlauf 2001a,b; Graham, 2008, 2011; Bramoulle, Djebbari and Fortin, 2009) as well as
deeply influencing empirical practice (e.g., Angrist and Lang, 2004; Card and Rothstein,
2007; Sacerdote, 2014).

Empirical research on the first question – how do networks form? – is comparatively more
recent. Jackson and Wolisky (1996) introduced the notion of a strategic model of network
formation, where pairs of agents form, maintain or sever links in a decentralized way in
order to maximize utility. Choices are interdependent, since the utility an agent attaches to
a particular link may vary with the presence or absence of other links in the network. This
approach to network formation, with agents maximizing utility in a decentralized way, is a
natural one for economists. Formulating an empirical model with these features is difficult.

Since McFadden (1973) and Manski (1975) economists have modeled single agent discrete
choice problems using random utility models (RUMs). These models provide a principled
way of inferring the distribution of preferences from the observed distribution of choice.
Unfortunately, as is familiar from the literature on games (e.g., Bresnahan and Reiss, 1991;
Tamer, 2003), when agents’ choices are interdependent, as is the case in network formation,
a number of econometric challenges arise. These challenges are compounded by the scale of

                                                2
                                                                                           N
                                                                                               
the network formation problem. In an undirected network with N agents, a total of 2        2


configurations of links are possible.

This review will primarily focus on empirical models of network formation (i.e, on the first
of the two questions posed above). The emphasis will further be on models of strategic
network formation (i.e., those with coherent random utility foundations). Other approaches
to network modeling, such as exponential random graph models (ERGMs), will only be
touched upon.

Research on the identification of peer groups effects (i.e, on the second of the two questions
posed above) is comparatively more mature than that on how networks (or peer groups)
form. Several high quality reviews of work in this area are currently available (e.g., Blume,
Brock, Durlauf and Ioannides, 2011). Work in this area will not feature prominently in this
review, except insofar as it connects to questions of network formation.

The partition of research on networks into (i) the study of agent behavior conditional on
friendship (i.e., network) structure and (ii) the study of how networks form is convenient but
not intellectually desirable. In single agent problems the analogs of these two questions are
generally considered jointly. For example, labor economist study the distribution of wages
jointly with schooling and/or labor force participation decisions (e.g., Heckman 1977, Card,
1995).

Brock and Durlauf (2001b) discuss the joint modeling of neighborhood choice and neighbor-
hood influences. Ioannides and Zabel (2008) provide an empirical illustration. Goldsmith-
Pinkham and Imbens (2013) jointly model peer selection and peer influences on academic
achievement. Their paper also includes a fully worked empirical application. Work of this
type, however, remains very much an exception. Some of the strongest empirical work on
peer group effects exploits research designs where group membership is (quasi-) randomly
determined (see Sacerdote (2014) for a review). While the study of social interactions in
settings where peer networks are plausibly exogenous is attractive, limiting research to such
settings substantially narrows the set of behaviors amenable to study.

                                              3
Clearly econometric models of strategic network formation are needed to successfully “control
for” network endogeneity when studying peer group effects. While their use in this way is
largely aspirational at the present time, this goal motivates their development. Of course
the study of network formation is scientifically interesting in its own right and, further,
policy-makers may legitimately have preferences over the structure of links in a network,
irrespective of any relationship between these links and other outcomes. For example, a
school administrator may wish to structure instruction in her school so as to encourage
cross-social-class and/or cross-race friendships, reduce the presence of cliques and/or isolated
students and so on. She may wish to do this irrespective of any relationship between students’
network structures and their academic performance.

Section 1, which follows next, describes methods for summarizing network data. Just as
analysis of the distribution of a single random variable typically begins with the calculation
of a sample mean, or one on the association between two random variables with that of
a correlation coefficient, the analysis of network data generally begins with a summary of
various features of a network’s architecture. This material also serves as a vehicle to establish
some basic notation and to review some ‘stylized facts’ on social networks.

Section 2 selectively reviews empirical models of network formation. Here I focus on strategic
models of network formation. I exclude from my discussion so called “network evolution
models” (NEMs) (Toivonen et al. , 2009). Examples of NEMs include the scale free model
of Barabási and Albert (1999) and the small world model of Watts and Strogatz (1998).
NEMs typically begin with a small randomly-generated seed network and then specify simple
stochastic rules for adding and deleting links. This literature focuses on replicating key
features of real world networks (e.g., degree distribution, average path length etc.). I also
exclude exponential random graph models (ERGMs) from my discussion. This approach
directly specifies a probability distribution for the entire graph/network. While EGRMs have
featured prominently in the empirical literature on networks, they are generally not consistent
under sampling (Shalizi and Rinaldo, 2013). Specifically the parameters associated with an


                                               4
ERGM fit to a sub-network do not coincide with those associated with the full network. This
makes structural interpretation of model parameters problematic (Christakis, Fowler, Imbens
and Kalyanaraman, 2010). Relatedly, estimation of EGRMs is also challenging (Snijders,
2002). In an interesting working paper, Chandrasekhar and Jackson (2014) propose an
alternative to ERGMs that addresses many of these limitations.

Section 3 discusses methods of network simulation. The inclusion of this material is mo-
tivated by the need to have interesting but tractable null models for network data. Such
models can serve a number of purposes. First, they can be used to assess whether a cer-
tain feature of a network is unusual among the set of all networks that share certain other
features in common. Second, some data collection protocols may only partially reveal net-
work structure. For example public health surveys may collect information on the number
of concurrent sexual partners, but not their identity (Morris, Kurth, Hamilton, Moody and
Wakefield, 2009). The General Social Survey (GSS) collects ego-centered network data (Burt,
1984; McPherson, Smith-Lovin and Brashears, 2006). Specifically information on each GSS
respondent’s direct links are collected, as well as information on any links among those links.
This sampling scheme reveals the network’s degree distribution (i.e., distribution number of
links across agents), as well as the frequency with which one’s friends are friends themselves.
Simulation methods can allow researchers to study the properties of the class of all networks
that are consistent with the sample information available (which may not be the complete
network). Finally, constructing a binary matrix which satisfies a set of side constraints is a
well-defined discrete math problem. In recent years computer scientists have studied these
types of problems (e.g., Blitzstein and Diaconis, 2011; Stanton and Pinar, 2012). Familiarity
with this work is valuable to researchers interested in networks.

Section 4 ends with some thoughts about future directions for research.

1     Describing networks

Figure 1 provides a visual representation of a set of risk-sharing links, measured in the year
2000, between 119 households residing in Nyakatoke, a small village in Tanzania. These
data are described and analyzed by de Weerdt (2004) and de Weerdt and Fafchamps (2011).
Individuals were asked for lists of people that they could “personally rely on for help”. A list
of undirected links between all households was constructed using responses to this question.

Each point in the figure represents a household, with the size of the point proportional to
the number of risk sharing links to which the household is party. Yellow, orange, green and
blue households correspond to categories of increasing land and livestock wealth (see the
notes to Figure 1).

Graphical representations of network data like Figure 1 have historically played an important
role in empirical analysis and continue to do so (Freeman, 2000). While certain features of a
network can often be intuited from a visual representation, it is also valuable to have a suite
of standard network summary statistics. This section describes methods for summarizing
network data. There are many basic references for the material surveyed here, including
Wasserman and Faust (1994), Newman (2003), Jackson (2008) and Kolaczyk (2009). A few
minor results presented below, mostly of pedagogical significance, are new.

The mathematical language of networks is that of discrete math and, specifically, graph
theory. Bollobas (2013) is a standard graph theory reference. Rosen (2006) is a more
introductory discrete math reference. An undirected graph G (N , E) consists of a set of nodes
N = {1, . . . , N } and a list of unordered pairs of nodes called edges E = {{i, j} , {k, l} , . . .}
for i, j, k, l ∈ N . A graph is conveniently represented by its adjacency matrix D = [Dij ]
where                                    
                                          1 if {i, j} ∈ E
                                         
                                   Dij =                   .                                     (1)
                                          0 otherwise
                                         

A node, depending on the context, may be called a vertex, agent or player. Likewise edges

Notes: Node size proportional to household degree. Yellow nodes represent households
with land and livestock wealth below 150,000 Tanzanian Shillings, orange those with wealth
between 150,000 and 300,000 Shillings, green those with wealth between 300,000 and 600,000
Shillings and blue those with wealth of 600,000 Shillings and above. Following Comola and
Fafchamps (forthcoming) land was valued at 300,000 shillings per acre. Network plotted

may be called links, friendships, connections or ties. Since self-ties are ruled-out, and the
nodes in edges are unordered, the adjacency matrix is a symmetric binary matrix with a
diagonal of so-called structural zeros (i.e., Dij = Dji and Dii = 0).

Networks may also be directed, such that each link has an ego (sender) and alter (receiver)
ordering. Indeed, the analysis of directed networks in sociology probably predominates. The
focus on undirected networks here is soley for pedagogical reasons.

A social network consists of a set of agents (nodes) and ties (edges) between them. A social
network can be conveniently represented by it node and edge list or by its adjacency matrix.
I will utilize the adjacency matrix representation in most of what follows. Two examples of
undirected network adjacency matrices are

                                                                       

                                                      1 1              .
                                                                  0 1 1 

                           1 0 0     0 0            0 0        1 0 1 
                                                                     
                                                                     

These two networks are graphically depicted in Figure 2. The first network, Dex1 , takes a so
called ‘star’ configuration, in which a central agent linked to all other agents. The second
network, Dex2 , consists of two triangles, which share a single agent in common.

In summarizing the structure of a social network it is convenient to define network statistics
at the level of individual agents, at the level of pairs of agents or dyads, and at the level of
triples of agents or triads.


Network statistics involving single agents and paths through the network

                                                                           P
The total number of links belonging to agent i, or her degree is Di+ =         j   Dij . The degree
frequency distribution of a network, or degree distribution for short, consists of the frequency


                                                8
                               Figure 2: Two simple networks




of each possible agent-level degree count {0, 1, . . . , N } in the network. A important com-
ponent of the literature on networks takes the degree distribution as its primitive object of
interest (e.g., Barabási and Albert (1999) and Albert and Barabási (2002)). This focus is
motivated by the fact that many other topological features of a network are fundamentally
constrained by its degree distribution (see Faust, 2007). I will have more to stay about the
connection between a network’s degree sequence and its other topological features below.

The density of a network equals the frequency with which any randomly drawn dyad is
linked:
                                        −1 XN X
                                        N
                                  PN =               Dij .                                (2)
                                        2    i=1 j<i

Note that (N − 1) PN coincides with average degree. The density of the Nyakatoke network
is 0.0698. The density of Dex1 is 0.4, that of Dex2 is 0.6.

The ith diagonal element of D2 equals the number of agent i’s links or her degree. The

{i, j}th element of D2 gives the number of links agent i has in common with agent j (i.e.,
the number of “friends in common”). In the language of graph theory the {i, j}th element of
D2 gives the number of paths of length two from agent i to agent j. For example, if i and
j share the common friend k, then a length two path from i to j is given by i → k → j.
The diagonal elements of D2 correspond to the number of length two paths from an agent
back to herself. For example if i is connected to k, then one such a path is i → k → i. The
number of such paths coincides with an agent’s degree.

whose {i, j}th element gives the number of paths of length 3 from i to j.

The diagonal elements of D3 are counts of the number of transitive triads or triangles in the
network. If both i and j are connected to k as well as to each other, then the {i, j, k} triad is
closed (i.e., “the friend of my friend is also my friend”). Note that if {i, j, k} is a closed triad
it is counted twice each in the ith , j th and k th diagonal elements of D3 . Therefore Tr (D3 ) /6
equals the number of unique triangles in the network.

Proceeding inductively it is easy to show that the {i, j}th element of DK gives the number
of paths of length K from agent i to agent j.


Measuring agent centrality

One preoccupation of network researchers has been the identification of “central” or “impor-
tant” agents. This is sometimes called the key player problem (Ballester, Calvó-Armengol
and Zenou, 2006; Ballester and Zenou, forthcoming). Consider, as just one example, a policy-


                                                10
maker who wishes to facilitate the spread of a new technology or idea. She is constrained to
introduce the technology to just one agent in the network. Which agent should she choose?
The answer to this question will depend, of course, on assumptions about how information
moves from one agent to another, as well as the precise objective of the policy-maker. Baner-
jee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo and Jackson (2013) use the above question to motivate a specific
measure of centrality.

Many measures of agent centrality have been proposed (see Wasserman and Faust (1994),
Jackson (2008) and Bonacich and Lu (2012) for textbook expositions of some key examples).
Centrality measures are often heuristically motivated, but have been, in some cases, micro-
founded ex post (e.g., Ballester, Calvó-Armengol and Zenou, 2006).

In turns out that one notion of agent centrality can be defined via an interesting connection
with the “social multiplier”. The concept of a social multiplier has been a key theme in
empirical work on social interactions in economics since the publication of Manski (1993). It
features in, for example, Brock and Durlauf, (2001b), Glaeser and Scheinkman (2001, 2003),
Graham (2008) and Angrist (forthcoming). In the presence of social multiplier effects, the
full impact of an intervention exceeds the initial impact due to feedback effects across agents.
When interactions occur on a non-trivial network, the magnitude of any multiplier effect will
also depend upon exactly which agent is initially acted upon by the policy-maker. This is
the intuition behind social multiplier centrality.

Let Yi be some continuously-valued action chosen by network member i = 1, . . . , N . Let Y be
N ×1 vector of all agents actions. Let ιN be an N ×1 vector of ones and G = diag (DιN )−1 D
be the row-normalized network adjacency matrix (i.e., the network adjacency matrix where
each element of the ith row is divided by Di+ , the ith agent’s degree). Note that all rows of
this matrix sum to 1 by construction. The matrix is row-stochastic.

Let
                                            X            def
                                   Gi y =          Gij yj ≡ ȳn(i)

equal the average action of player i’s peers under the (perhaps hypothetical) action profile
y. Here Gi denotes the ith row of G.

Following Blume, Brock, Durlauf and Jayaraman (2013), among others, assume that the
utility agent i receives from action profile y given network structure (D) is

                                                       1
                            ui (y; D) = (α0 + Ui ) yi − yi2 + β0 ȳn(i) yi
                                                       2
                                                       1
                                      = (α0 + Ui ) yi − yi2 + β0 Gi yyi                      (3)
                                                       2

with 0 < |β0 | < 1 and E [Ui ] = 0. Here Ui captures heterogeneity in agents’ preferences for
action.

The marginal utility associated with an increase in yi is increasing in the average action of
one’s peers, ȳn(i) . Specifically,
                                          ∂ 2 ui (y, D)
                                                        = β0 .
                                           ∂yi ∂ ȳn(i)

That is, own- and peer-effort are complements. In the terminology of Manski (1993), the
magnitude of β0 indexes the strength of any endogenous social interactions.

Assume that the observed action Y corresponds to a Nash equilibrium where no agent can
increase her utility by changing her action given the actions of all other agents in the network.
Agents observe D and U, the N × 1 vector of individual-level heterogeneity terms.

The first order condition for optimal behavior associated with (3) generates the following
best response function:
                                       Yi = α0 + β0 Ȳn(i) + Ui                              (4)

for i = 1, . . . , N . Equation (4) is a special case of what is called the linear-in-means model
of social interactions (e.g., Brock and Durlauf, 2001b). An agent’s best reply varies with
the average action of those to whom she is directly connected (Ȳn(i) ) and unobserved own
attributes (Ui ).

Equation (4) defines an N × 1 system of simultaneous equations. It is convenient, for what


                                                  12
follows, to write the system defined by (4) in matrix form:


                                 Y = α0 ιN + β0 GY + U.                                    (5)


For |β0 | < 1 the matrix IN − β0 G is strictly (row) diagonally dominant (IN is the N × N
identity matrix). By the Levy-Desplanques Theorem (cf., Horn and Johnson, 2013) it is
therefore non-singular. Non-singularity of (IN − β0 G) allows us to solve for the equilibrium
action vector as a function of D and U alone.

Solving (5) for Y yields the reduced form


                        Y = α0 (IN − β0 G)−1 ιN + (IN − β0 G)−1 U.                         (6)


It is helpful to simplify (6) in a number of ways. First, using the series expansion

                                                      ∞
                                                      X
                                             −1
                                 (IN − β0 G)      =         β0k Gk ,
                                                      k=0


as well as the fact that GιN = ιN (and hence that Gk ιN = ιN for k ≥ 1) we get the
simplification α0 (IN − β0 G)−1 ιN = α0 (1 − β0 )−1 ιN . Using this result and re-arranging (6)
yields
                                             "∞         #
                                   α0         X
                             Y =        ιN +      β0k Gk U.                                (7)
                                 1 − β0       k=0



Equation (7) provides some insight into what various researchers have called the social mul-
tiplier. Consider a policy which increases the ith agent’s value of Ui by ∆. We can concep-
tualize the full effect of this increase on the network’s distribution of outcomes as occurring
in “waves”. In the initial wave only agent i’s outcome increases. The change in the entire
action vector is therefore
                                             4ci ,


                                               13
where ci is an N -vector with a one in its ith element and zeros elsewhere.

In the second wave all of agent i’s friends experience outcome increases. This is because
their best reply actions change in response to the increase in agent i0 s action in the initial
wave. The action vector in wave two therefore changes by


                                           4β0 Gci .


In the third wave the outcomes of agent i’s friends’ friends change (this includes a direct
feedback effect back onto agent i). In wave three we get a further change in the action vector
of
                                          ∆β02 G2 ci .

In the k th wave we have a change in the action vector of


                                        4β0k−1 Gk−1 ci .


Observing the pattern of geometric decay we see that the “long-run” or full effect of a ∆
change in Ui on the entire distribution of outcomes is given by


                                     4 (IN − β0 G)−1 ci .                                  (8)


Equation (8) indicates the effect of perturbing Ui by 4 on the equilibrium action vector
coincides with the ith column of the matrix 4 (IN − β0 G)−1 . The total effect on aggregate
action is therefore given by the sum of the ith column of this matrix. Therefore


                                SMC (β0 ) = ι0N (IN − β0 G)−1


gives a row vector of aggregate effects associated with unit perturbations of Ui for each
agent in the network. If the cost of perturbing Ui does not vary with i, the planner can use

this vector to efficiently target interventions. Call the ith element of this vector agent i0 s
social multiplier centrality at parameter β0 . Specifically if the planner seeks to maximize the
average action, she will target her intervention toward an agent with high social multiplier
centrality.

Bonacich (1987) develops a closely related, and widely used measure of centrality, Katz-
Bonacich Centrality. Ballester, Calvó-Armengol and Zenou (2006) provide a game-theoretic
foundation for Katz-Bonacich Centrality. Blume, Brock, Durlauf and Jayaraman (2013)
discuss the relationship between the linear-in-means interaction game exposited above and
the one studied by Ballester, Calvó-Armengol and Zenou (2006). See also Jackson and Zenou
(forthcoming) and Ballester and Zenou (forthcoming).

risk-sharing network. Under linear-in-means interaction, an intervention initiated on many
households in the Nyakatoke Network would barely increase the aggregate action beyond the
direct effect on the intervened household. For the most central households, however, the full
effect on the aggregate outcome would exceed twice that of the “initial” (direct) effect on
the intervened agent. In the presence of linear-in-means interaction, knowledge of network
structure can lead to substantial improvements in policy-targeting.


Network statistics involving pairs of agents or dyads

The distance between agents i and j corresponds to the minimum length path connecting
them. If there is no path connecting i to j, then the distance between them is infinite. We
can use powers of the adjacency matrix to calculate these distances. Specifically,

                                                           n           o
                                                                 (k)
                                Mij =         min           k : Dij > 0
                                           k∈{1,2,3,...}


                                                                 (k)
equals the distance from i to j (if it is finite). Here Dij denotes the ij th element of Dk . For
modest sized networks Mij can be calculated by taking successive powers of the adjacency
matrix.

If the network consists of a single, giant, connected component, such that the minimum
length path between any two agents is finite, we can compute average path length as

                                        −1 XN X
                                        N
                                    M=               Mij .                                   (9)
                                        2    i=1 j<i


If the network consists of multiple connected components, standard practice is to compute
average path length within the largest one. Alternatively, following Newman (2003), we can
calculate average distance or path length in the network as

                                          "     N X

By taking the reciprocal of an average of reciprocal distances, we neatly handle the ‘problem’
of infinite paths.

The diameter of a network is the largest distance between two agents in it. It will be finite if
the network consists of a single connected component (in which case all agents are “reachable”
starting from any given agent) and infinite in networks consisting of multiple components
(in which case there are no paths connecting some pairs of agents).

Table 1 gives the frequency of minimum path lengths in the Nykatoke network. There are
490 direct ties in the network (paths of length one). Just under 7 percent of all pairs of
households are directly connected in Nykatoke. Another 2,666 dyads are only two degrees
apart. That is, although they are not connected directly, they share a tie in common. About
80 percent of dyads are separated by three or fewer degrees. The diameter of the Nyakatoke
network is 5. The juxtaposition of low density (i.e., only a small fraction of all possible ties
exists), with few degrees of separation (i.e., low average degree and/or diameter) is a feature
of many real world social networks.

The analysis of distances and diameter has a long history in social network analysis and
falls under the rubric of the “small-world problem”. Stanley Milgram (1967) popularized
this phrase and, through a series of postal experiments in the 1960s, showed that two ran-
dom individuals in the United States could be often be connected through a short chain of
acquaintances (“six degrees of separation”).

Network statistics involving triples of agents of triads

Triads, a set of three unique agents, come in four types: no connections, one connection,
two connections, or three connections between them. These triad types are called empties,
one-edges, two-stars and triangles respectively. There are N3 = N (N −1)(N −2)

                                                                      6

in a network of size N . A complete enumeration of them into their four possible types
constitutes a triad census.

Each agent can belong to as many as (N − 1) (N − 2) triangles. The counts of these triangles
are contained in the N diagonal elements of D3 . However each such triangle appears 6 times
in these counts: as {i, j, k}, {i, k, j}, {j, i, k}, {j, k, i}, {k, i, j} and {k, j, i}. Thus

                                                                  Tr (D3 )

Each pair of agents {i, j} can share of up to N − 2 links in common. If {i, j} are not linked
themselves, then they may belong to two stars with their links in common as star centers.
Since each dyad can create up to N −2 closed triangles by forming a link between themselves,
there may be up to N2 (N − 2) = N (N −1)(N −2)

triangles) in the network. These counts are contained in the lower (or upper) off-diagonal
elements of D2 . Each triad appears three times in these counts: as {i, j, k}, {i, k, j} and
{j, k, i}. If the triad is a two star, then only one of Dji Dki , Dij Dkj , or Dik Djk quantities
will equal one (i.e., contribute). If it is a triangle, then all three will equal one. Therefore
          0
vech (D2 ) ι gives the network count of three times the number triangles plus the number of
two-stars, with the count of the latter alone equal to

We can use a similar logic to calculate the number of one-edge triads. Each agent be-
longs to N − 2 triads. If all triads are empty or have only one edge, then there will be
(N − 2) vech (D) ι one edge triads. However if some triads are two-stars or triangles this
count will be incorrect. It turns out that subtracting twice the number of two stars and
three times the number of triangles gives the correct answer.

The triad census for the Nyakatoke network is given in Table 2. As a point of comparison
the proportion of each type of triad that we would expect to see in a random graph, where
the probability of a link between any two agents coincides with the observed density of the
Nyakatoke network (0.0698), is given in the last row of the table.

A measure of network transitivity is given by three times the number of transitive triads in
the network relative to three times the number of transitive triads plus those triads which
could become transitive with the addition of a single link (i.e., two stars). The Transitivity
Index, sometimes called the clustering coefficient, is

                                                           3TT
                            Transitivity Index       =

                                                     = RN .


In random graphs RN should be close to network density. For the Nyakatoke network the
transitivity index is 0.1884, which substantially exceeds the density of the network (0.0698).
We will explore how to assess the statistical significance of this difference in Section 3 below.

Transitivity has been hypothesized to facilitate risk sharing and other activities where moni-
toring may be helpful. If the (i, j, k) triad is transitive, then agent k may be able to monitor
actions involving i and j. See Jackson (2014) for additional discussion. Faust (2007) surveys
the extensive sociological literature on triad configurations.

Degree distributions and triad counts

A reoccurring theme in social network analysis concerns whether observed network structures
can be explained through a series of dyadic decisions, or whether interactions among larger
groups of agents, most often a triads, need to be considered (see Faust (2007) for a recent
statement and references to earlier work). Most economic models of network formation model
links as forming via pairwise interactions, albeit interdependent ones.

While network transitivity, and the triad census, has often been a focus of sociologists, other
network researchers have made a network’s degree distribution


                                   F (d+ ) = Pr (Di+ ≤ d+ )


their primary object of study (e.g., Barabási and Albert, 1999). Figure 5 plots the Nyakatoke
network’s degree distribution. A small number of households in the Nyakatoke network have
many links (over 20), while the vast majority have only a small number of links (less than
10).

Faust (2007) argues, via a collection of empirical examples, that the distribution of triad
configurations within networks are well-predicted by network statistics defined on lower
order sub-graphs (i.e., dyads). Some additional insight in this finding can be developed via
some basic algebra.

Some tedious manipulations give a variance of the degree distribution equal to


                    2     2
                   SN =     (TT S + 3TT ) − (N − 1) PN [1 − (N − 1) PN ] .                (15)
                          N

Consider the effect of inducing a mean preserving spread in a network’s degree distribution.
That is, we seek manipulations which keep network density fixed, while increasing the vari-
ance of the degree distribution. Jackson and Rogers (2007a), in the context of a technology
diffusion model, provide an interesting motivation for considering this thought experiment.

Inducing a mean-preserving spread requires triad manipulations that (i) increases the first
term in the expression above, while (ii) leaving the second term unchanged. Table 3 list
several mean-preserving triad manipulations. A triad is the smallest subgraph rearrangement
we can use to induce a mean-preserving spread in the degree distribution.
             2
To increase SN a two-star or triangle must be added to the network (accommodated by
changes in the number of empties and one edges). Alternatively we can convert a two-
star into a triangle (again accommodated by changes in the number of empties and one
edges). These correspond to manipulations 2 to 5 and manipulation 6 in Table 3. Note that
manipulations 2 and 4 and 3 and 5 are isomorphic, while manipulation 1 does not increase
 2
SN . This leaves 4, 5 and 6 as unique triad manipulations which induce mean preserving
spreads in a network’s degree distribution.

Each of manipulations 4 to 6 involve net increases in TT S + 3TT , accommodated by decreases
in the number of one edges and increases in the number of empties. This is an example of
how a network’s degree distribution fundamentally constrains other aspects of its topology.
In this case higher variance degree sequences imply networks with more “hubs” (nodes with
many links emanating outwards from them) as well as more isolated nodes. Jackson and
Rogers (2007a) show that the first effect tends to facilitate the spread of infections (ideas,
new technology, etc.) in a network, while the second acts as a break to diffusion.

Note that the effect of the triad manipulations listed in Table 3 on transitivity is not one-
directional. Manipulation 4 reduces transitivity, while manipulations 5 and 6 increase it.
Nevertheless, Barabási and Albert’s (1999) focus on degree distributions may not be mis-
placed. Evidently the form of a network’s degree distribution is strongly connected to the

distribution of other, high order, subgraph features.

Faust (2007) finds that, as a practical/empirical matter, the distribution of triad configu-
rations across a wide range of networks can be largely explained by lower order subgraph
features (e.g., moments of the degree distribution).



2    Modeling network formation

To characterize some of the issues that arise when empirically modeling network formation it
is helpful to initially consider a very simple model. Assume that directly-linked agents may
make transfers to one another. Therefore agents i and j will form a link if the net surplus
from doing so is positive, conditional on the link behavior of all other agents in the network.
This corresponds to a variant of the direct-transfer network formation game, under pairwise
                                                                     P             
                                                                        N
equilibrium, studied by Bloch and Jackson (2007). Let Fij (D) =         k=1 D   D
                                                                              ik jk   denote
the number of friends agents i and j share in common. Links form according to the rule


                                     Dij = 1 (α0 + γ0 Fij (D) − Uij ≥ 0)                                     (16)


for i = 1, . . . , N and j < i. Here Uij is an unobserved component of link surplus; indepen-
dently and identically distributed across dyads according to a known distribution:


                                           iid
                                Uij ∼ FU , i = 1, . . . , N, j < i Uij ∈ U.                                  (17)




                                                                   25
Rule (16) implies that agents form links if (i) they share many friends in common (Fij (D))
and/or (ii) the unobserved idiosyncratic utility from doing so is high (−Uij ). The magnitude
of γ0 > 0 captures the strength of agents’ preferences for triadic closure in links. The
dependence of the surplus generated by an i-to-j link on the presence or absence of links
across other pairs of agents constitutes a network externality. Network externalities generate
complex interdependencies across the choices of different agents, a modeling challenge not
present in textbook single agent models.

As noted earlier, in real world social networks linked agents often share additional links in
common, generating a clustering of ties. Rule (16) generates such clustering by positing a
structural taste for link transitivity – the returns to a relationship are higher if two individuals
share a friend in common. A preference for transitive links may be micro-founded in a variety
of ways. For example, actions between dyad partners can be monitored or refereed by a
shared friend; this may be valuable in the context of a risk-sharing network. Alternatively it
may be more enjoyable to socialize with two friends, if they are also friends with each other.

An alternative explanation for clustering is that agents assortatively match on some unob-
served attribute, a process called homophily. Homophily on observed attributes is a feature
of many real-world networks (McPherson, Smith-Lovin and Cook, 2001). Rule (16) and
assumption (17) rules out homophily a priori.

As an alternative to rule (16) Handcock, Raftery and Tantrum (2007), Krivitsky, Handcock,
Raftery and Hoff (2009) and Graham (2014), consider link formation rules like



                      Dij = 1 Zij0 η0 + νi + νj − g (ξi , ξj , δ0 ) − Uij ≥ 0 ,
                                                                             
                                                                                               (18)

where Zij is an observed K × 1 vector of dyad attributes, νi and ξi are unobserved agent-
level heterogeneity, and Uij is an idiosyncratic dyad level surplus component; g (ξi , ξj , δ0 )
is a known symmetric distance function which (i) takes a value of zero at ξi = ξj and (ii)
is increasing in |ξi − ξj | . The goal is to learn about η0 , δ0 and features of the conditional


                                                 26
distribution of (νi , ξi ) given Z.

Relative to rule (16), rule (18) introduces a much richer form of unobserved agent-level
heterogeneity. First, agents are heterogeneous in the amount of link surplus they generate.
Agents with high values νi generically generate more surplus. Such agents will have more
links, giving rise to degree heterogeneity; an important feature of real work networks (see
Figure 5). Second, the model allows for assortative matching on ξi . Agents which are similar
in terms of the unobserved characteristic ξi generate more surplus from linking. This feature
of the model induces clustering in links. Unlike rule (16), rule (18) does not include any
network externalities. The presence or absence of a link elsewhere in the network does not
change the returns to an i-to-j link.

In practice link rules with network externalities and those with rich forms of agent-level
heterogeneity can generate very similar networks. This makes discriminating between, for
example, structural transitivity and homophily on unobservables difficult. Nevertheless,
distinguishing between them is scientifically interesting and policy-relevant. Transitivity is
associated with an externality in link formation. In the presence of externalities a local
manipulation of network structure can influence link formation elsewhere in the network. If
clustering is due soley to homophily, local manipulations do not have effects that cascade
through the network.

Below I discuss how panel data may be used to model both a structural taste for transitivity
and assortative matching on unobserved attributes simultaneously. Initially, however, I focus
on cross-sectional models that include either network externalities or heterogeneity, but not
both.


A simple cross-sectional model with structural transitivity

Returning to link rule (16), assume that the econometrician bases her inferences on a ran-
dom sample of networks from some well-defined population (of networks). For example
networks of food sharing among households across a population of indigenous communities

                                             27
(e.g., Koster and Leckie, 2014). For each sampled network (community) the entire adja-
cency matrix is observed. This sampling process asymptotically reveals F (D| N = n) for
n ∈ N = {2, 3, 4, . . .}. Implicit in (6) is the assumption that the distribution of Uij is in-
dependent of network size. The notation Dij corresponds to the link status of the generic,
randomly drawn, (i, j) dyad, itself sampled from a randomly drawn network. To economize
on notation there is no explicit network subscript in what follows.

Equation (16) defines a system of N2 simultaneous discrete choices. Viewed in this way,
                                      

two questions naturally arise. First, for a given θ0 = (α0 , γ0 )0 does (16) have a solution for
all U ∈ UN ? This is a question of equilibrium existence or model coherence. Demonstrat-
ing existence can be non-trivial for some models of network formation (cf., Jackson, 2008;
Chapter 11; Hellmann, 2013). Second, if an equilibria does exist, is it unique (again for all
U ∈ UN )? This is a question about model completeness: given a particular draw of the
model’s underlying latent variable U, does it deliver a unique prediction for the observed
network, D? Multiplicity of equilibrium network configurations is a common feature of many
models with network externalities.

The study of models with qualitative features similar to those of (16) has a long history
in econometrics (e.g., Heckman, 1978a). Important recent contributions include those of
Bresnahan and Reiss (1991), Tamer (2003) and Ciliberto and Tamer (2009) among others.
                                                              N
                                                                
Unfortunately the combinatoric complexity of networks, with 2 2   link configurations pos-
sible in a network with N agents, makes the direct application of insights from prior work
difficult.

To keep the discussion simple assume that N = 3. In this case there are four possible
non-isomorphic network configurations corresponding to the four types of triads depicted in
                                                                                    0
Figure 4 above. The heterogeneity draw is given by the triple U = (U12 , U13 , U23 ) ∈ U3 . For
any given draw of U one of these four configurations will be observed.

Call draws of Uij below α, between α and α+γ, and above α+γ respectively low (L), medium
(M) and high (H) draws (see Figure 6). Let pLLL (θ, FU ) = FU (α)3 denote the probability of

                                              28
three ‘low’ draws; pLM H (θ, FU ) = FU (α) FU (α + γ) [1 − FU (α + γ)] the probability of one
low, one medium and one high draw and so on. Observe that low draws of Uij correspond
to higher link surplus.

If U12 falls in the ‘low’ region, then agents 1 and 2 will form a link regardless of whether
they share a friend in common (i.e., D13 D23 may equal zero or one). In contrast if U12 falls
in the ‘medium’ region, then agents 1 and 2 will form a link only if they share a friend in
common (i.e., if D13 D23 = 1). If U12 falls in the ‘high’ region, then they never form a link.

The contingent behavior associated with a ‘medium’ idiosyncratic surplus component is what
generates the possibility of multiple equilibria. Consider the case where all three elements of
U fall into the ‘medium’ range. In that case two network configurations are consistent with
(16): (i) the empty triad and (ii) a triangle. The model, as specified, is silent on which of
these two networks is chosen.

Let π T (θ, FU ) denote the minimum probability the model defined by (16) and (17) logically
attaches to observing a triangle for a particular θ and FU . This probability coincides with
the probability mass attached to the region of U3 where the model uniquely predicts a
triangle network. Let π̄T (θ, FU ) denote the maximal probability the model logical attaches
to observing a triangle. This probability coincides with the probability mass attached to the
region of U3 where a triangle network is either the unique network configuration, or among
the set of multiple configurations, consistent with (16).

Recalling the notation of ‘T’ for ‘triangle’, ‘TS’ for ‘two-star’, ‘OE’ for ‘one-edge’ and ‘E’ for
‘empty’, the above logic yields the following probability bounds on the four non-isomorphic




                                               29
network configurations:


       π T (θ, FU ) = pLLL (θ, FU ) + pLLM (θ, FU )

        π̄T (θ, FU ) = pLLL (θ, FU ) + pLLM (θ, FU ) + pLM M (θ, FU ) + pM M M (θ, FU )

      πT S (θ, FU ) = pLLH (θ, FU )

      π OE (θ, FU ) = pLM H (θ, FU ) + pLHH (θ, FU )

      π̄OE (θ, FU ) = pLM M (θ, FU ) + pLM H (θ, FU ) + pLHH (θ, FU )

       π E (θ, FU ) = pM M H (θ, FU ) + pM HH (θ, FU ) + pHHH (θ, FU )

       π̄E (θ, FU ) = pM M M (θ, FU ) + pM M H (θ, FU ) + pM HH (θ, FU ) + pHHH (θ, FU ) .


Let πT denote the population frequency of triangle networks, etc. Rule (16) therefore delivers
the following inequality restrictions


                                 π T (θ, FU ) ≤ πT ≤ π̄T (θ, FU )                             (19)

                                              πT S = πT S (θ, FU )

                              π OE (θ, FU ) ≤ πOE ≤ π̄OE (θ, FU )

                                 π E (θ, FU ) ≤ πE ≤ π̄E (θ, FU ) .


The model also generates the equalities


πT +πOE +πE = π̄T (θ, FU )+π OE (θ, FU )+π E (θ, FU ) = π T (θ, FU )+ π̄OE (θ, FU )+ π̄E (θ, FU ) .
                                                                                              (20)
The identified set, ΘI , is the set of all θ ∈ Θ such that (19) and (20) are satisfied. Ciliberto
and Tamer (2009), among others, discuss methods of estimating ΘI and conducting inference
on it and/or on θ0 .

The observation that link formation rule (16) is a system of simultaneous discrete choices
and, further, that this system generates a set of moment inequalities which may be used as a

                                                30
basis for inference on θ0 , appears promising. Unfortunately, as noted above, this observation
                                                                                   N
                                                                                     
may be of limited practical importance. In a network with N agents, there are 2 2 possible
configurations of links. For each U in UN and θ ∈ Θ, the consistency of a given network
with (16) must be checked. In practice this is not feasible in real time for all but very small
networks. Even showing that two networks are isomorphic is a non-trivial problem (e.g.,
Read and Corneil, 1977).

While fully exploiting the identifying power of (16) and (17) may be infeasible in even
modest-sized networks, exploiting some of its identifying content is straightforward. Assume
that networks vary in size with N ∈ N = {2, 3, 4, . . .} and recall that the distribution of Uij
is constant in N . Under (16) and (17) the probability that a randomly drawn dyad from a
network of size N is linked (i.e., density in networks of size N ) satisfies the inequalities


                      FU (α0 ) ≤ Pr (Dij = 1| N ) ≤ FU (α0 + γ0 (N − 2))


for all N ∈ N. The lower bound occurs when the randomly drawn dyad share no friends
in common, the upper bound when the dyad is linked to all other members of the network
(except possibly each other).

These upper and lower bounds coincide at N = 2 so that α0 pointed identified by the density
of links across networks consisting of a single dyad:


                                α0 = FU−1 (Pr (Dij = 1| N = 2)) .


A lower bound on γ0 is then given by

                                    FU−1 (Pr (Dij = 1| N )) − α0
                                                                    
                      γ = sup                                    N ∈N .
                                               N −2

Here an informative lower bound on γ0 is generated by observing a higher density of link
formation in networks with N > 2, than across networks consisting of single dyads. This


                                               31
does not strike me as an especially attractive approach to inferring the presence of a taste for
transitivity, but it is illustrative of how some identifying implications of a network formation
model can be easy to exploit (even if utilizing all implications is impractical).

Another, and more interesting, example of this type of approach is provided by Sheng (2012),
who explores the the identifying content of (non-trivial) subnetwork configurations. Assume
networks consist of N agents and consider the probability that, for a randomly drawn triad,
itself drawn from a randomly sampled network, we observe a particular triad configuration
(see Figure 4). This probability will depend on the degree to which members of the sampled
triad are connected to the rest of the network. Maximal connection occurs when all members
of the sampled triad are connected to all other agents in the network. Isolation occurs when
no member of the triad is linked to other agents in the network.

Now imagine repeating the thought experiment used to derive (19) above, but doing so
conditional on different assumptions about the triad’s connectivity to the rest of the network.
For example conditional on the three dyads forming the triad having, say, no, two and two
friends (outside the triad) in common, the model provides upper and lower bounds on the
probability of observing, say, a triangle configuration. An identification region for θ0 can be
computed using the union of these conditional bounds on each triad configuration (computed
for all possible degrees of triad connectivity).

Christakis, Fowler, Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2010) suggest an alternative approach to
dealing with the inferential challenges posed by multiplicity. They posit that the network
forms sequentially. Agents form, maintain or dissolve, links in a specific order and do so
myopically. Specifically they do not anticipate how the links they choose to form today
change the incentives for link formation faced by subsequent agents.

Returning to the N = 3 case, assume that U12 , U13 and U23 are respectively low, low and
medium draws (see Figure 6). Assume that agent 1 forms links first, followed by agents two
and three. Under this ordering, agent 1 will immediately form links with both agents 2 and
3. Agent 2 will then form a link with agent 3. Although the idiosyncratic utility from this

                                               32
link is only ‘medium’, the link forms to reap the benefits of triadic closure, since both agents
2 and 3 already share 1 as a friend. Finally, agent 3 maintains all links formed earlier. The
triangle configuration emerges from this ordering (and draw of U).

Now consider the alternative ordering where agent 3 forms links first, followed by agents 2
and 1. In this case agent 3 will form a link with agent 1, but not 2. The absence of the
utility gain associated with triadic closure means the 2-to-3 link does not form. Agent 2 then
forms a link with 1. Finally, agent 1 maintains her links with agents 2 and 3. A two-star
configuration emerges from this ordering.

As the above examples indicate, if the ordering of link formation opportunities were ob-
served, likelihood-based inference would be straightforward. Christakis, Fowler, Imbens and
Kalyanaraman (2010) address the unobservability of the posited sequential network forma-
tion process by assigning a probability distribution to agents’ ordering, and then working
with the resulting integrated likelihood. In the the simple example discussed here, there are
N ! = 3! = 6 possible orderings. If each ordering is a priori assumed equally likely the likeli-
hood is easily written down. Christakis, Fowler, Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2010) approach
to inference is Bayesian (and based on the observation of a single network). An important
contribution of their paper is to make the simple idea sketched above computationally op-
erational for realistically-sized networks. Specifically, they use Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods to take draws from a posterior distribution for the model parameters.

An unattractive feature of assuming the network is formed sequentially, is that the resulting
likelihood will, for certain values of U, place positive probability on network configurations
that do not correspond to an equilibrium of the simultaneous-move static game. This is
again illustrated by the example above. In the static game a low, low, medium draw of U
uniquely predicts a triangle network. For the same draw of U the sequential game places
a probability of two-thirds on the triangle network, and a probability of one-third on the
two-star network. If, in reality, agents have the opportunity to continually revise their links,
a two-star configuration would not emerge conditional on a low, low and medium draw of

                                              33
idiosyncratic link surpluses.

Mele (2013) develops a related approach to empirically modeling network formation. He
posits a process whereby in each ‘period’ a randomly drawn dyad is given the opportunity
to form, maintain or dissolve a link. For a specific specification of link surplus and meeting
probabilities, he shows that the sequence of networks generated by the model is a stationary
ergodic process. The long-run probabilities attached to specific network configurations are
used to formulate a likelihood. Like, Christakis, Fowler, Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2010),
Mele’s (2013) approach to inference is Bayesian. He develops an MCMC algorithm for
generating draws from a posterior distribution for the model parameters. His approach
also places positivity probability on network configurations that are not equilibria of the
corresponding simultaneous-move static game.

The Sheng (2012), Christakis, Fowler, Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2010) and Mele (2013)
papers all provide operational methods for inferring the distribution of link surplus from
observed network structure. Sheng’s (2012) approach provides a computationally feasible
(albeit difficult) way to harness the identifying content of pairwise stability. Her approach to
inference requires the observation of many independent networks (see also Miyaichi, 2013).
Christakis, Fowler, Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2010) and Mele (2013) show the identifying
power of moving from a simultaneous to sequential network formation process. All three
methods are computationally intensive.


A simple cross-sectional model with heterogeneity

Now return to the link formation rule (18). This model has a rich heterogeneity structure,
complicating its analysis relative to rule (16). However rule (18) also excludes externalities
in link formation a priori, side-stepping the coherence and completeness issues associated
with rule (16).

Graham (2014) studies (18) with g (ξi , ξj , δ0 ) empty; that is a model with unobserved degree
heterogeneity, but no homophily on unobservables. He derives the joint maximum likelihood

                                              34
estimator where both the common parameter η0 and the incidental parameters {νi }∞
                                                                                i=1 are

estimated simultaneously. He further assume Ui is a logistic random variable. Graham (2014)
derives the limiting distribution of the common parameter as the network grows large. This
limit distribution is normal, but includes a bias term.

Graham also proposes an estimator which conditions on a sufficient statistic for the degree
heterogeneity parameters. Charbonneau (2014), in independent work, develops a closely
related procedure in the context of studying gravity trade models. Random effects estimation
of (18) is pursued in Krivitsky, Handcock, Raftery and Hoff (2009) using MCMC methods.

One advantage of a fixed effects treatment of degree heterogeneity is that the resulting model
of tie formation will be able to perfectly match any observed degree sequence (cf., Chatter-
jee, Diaconis and Sly, 2011). As argued above algebraically, and shown by Faust (2007)
empirically, a network’s degree distribution often does a reasonably good job of explaining
(i.e., predicting) other “higher order” aspects of network architecture (e.g., the frequency of
different triad configurations). For this reason analyses based on (18) are likely to provide
good fits, even if the true link formation process includes network externalities.


Dynamic models of network formation

If the econometrician observes the structure of links within a network evolve over time, a
number of new modeling opportunities arise. In particular is becomes possible to meaningful
incorporate both network externalities and rich forms of agent level heterogeneity into a single
model of link formation. Let t = 0, 1, 2, 3 index the periods in which each network is observed
and assume that links form in period t according to the rule


                     Dijt = 1 (β0 Dijt−1 + γ0 Fijt−t (Dt−1 ) + Aij − Uij ≥ 0)              (21)


with, for example,
                                   Aij = νi + νj − g (ξi , ξj ) ,                          (22)


                                                35
where all notation is as previously defined. Model (21) combines features of the two static
models discussed above (rules (16) and (18)). It incorporates key network dependencies
emphasized in prior work (cf., Snijders, 2011). First, links are persistent. If agents i and
j are linked in period t, they are more likely to be linked in subsequent periods (β0 > 0).
Second, as in the first static model discussed above, there are returns to ‘triadic closure’
(γ0 > 0). The net surplus associated with an i-to-j link is increasing in the number of
friends i and j shared in common during the prior period. Third and fourth, as in the
second static model discussed above, both degree heterogeneity and assortative matching on
unobservables are incorporated.

As in Christakis, Fowler, Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2010) and Mele (2013), model (21)
implies that agents form links myopically. At the beginning of each period agents form,
maintain and dissolve thinks ‘as if’ all other features of the network will remain fixed. This
is analogous to a best-reply dynamic. Assuming a best-reply type dynamic eliminates the
contemporaneous feedback which generated multiple equilibria, and its associated inferential
challenges, in the static model discussed above. At the same time, by allowing link surplus
to vary with the structure of the network in the prior period, network dependencies, such as
a taste for triadic closure, are incorporated into (21).

Most theoretical models of network formation assume agents form links according to some
variant of naive best-reply dynamics (e.g., Jackson and Wolinsky, 1996; Jackson and Watts,
2002; Bala and Goyal, 2000; Watts, 2001; Jackson and Rogers, 2007b), although some
scholars have studied models with forward-looking agents (e.g., Dutta, Ghosal and Ray,
2005). The dynamics of link formation implied by (21) are closely aligned with the types
of dynamics assumed by theorists. Although the myopic nature of link formation may not
be of particular concern, a more mundane, but nevertheless important, concern may arise
in empirical work. It may be that the frequency at which the network is sampled, and the
structure of links recorded, does not correspond naturally with the timing at which agents
actually make link decisions. Similar concerns arise in single agent discrete choice analyses


                                               36
(cf., Chamberlain, 1985). When formulating a social network data collection protocol, the
timing of link decisions and the timing of data collection should be aligned.

In the first static model discussed above, the clustering of ties was explained soley by a taste
for triadic closure. In practice tie clustering might also arise because agents assortatively
match on attributes unobserved by the econometrician (homophily), as was assumed in the
second model. The dynamic model introduced here allows for both sources of clustering.

Goldsmith-Pinkham and Imbens (2013) take random-effects approach to model (21). If the
density of Uij is known (e.g., Standard Normal or Logistic), and the joint distribution of
(D0 , A) belongs to a parametric family, then inferences on θ0 = (β0 , γ0 )0 may be based
on an integrated or random effects likelihood. In principle this is very much analogous to
random effects approaches to single-agent dynamic panel data models (Heckman, 1981a-c;
Chamberlain, 1985). In reality both the specification and maximization of an integrated
likelihood in this setting is non-trivial.

Ideally the specified joint distribution for (D0 , A) should allow for dependence between D0
and A. Since the model implies that D1 varies with A, it seems ‘natural’ to allow the initial
network configuration, D0 , to also vary with A. This is a complicated version of the initial
conditions problem which arises in single-agent dynamic panel data models (Wooldridge,
2005).

To get a sense of the modeling issues involved, assume that Aij takes the form given in (22)
with (νi , ξi ) bivariate normal with an unknown location vector and scale matrix. Assume
that g (·, ·) is a known function, that Uijt is a standard normal random variable, and that
Dij0 = 1 (Aij − Uij0 ≥ 0) . These assumptions are sufficient to write down the integrated-
likelihood. Evaluating that likelihood, however, would be challenging. Doing so would
involve calculating a 2N -dimensional integral. This integral does not obviously factor into
a set of lower dimensional integrals (since Aij and Akl will share components in common
whenever i = k or j = l).

Motivated by these computational challenges Goldsmith-Pinkham and Imbens (2013) instead

|ξi − ξj |, and assume that ξi is binary-valued with Pr (ξi = αξ | D0 ) = Pr (ξi = 0| D0 ) = 21 .
Note that this last assumption assumes, unattractively, independence between D0 and A.
Under these assumptions Goldsmith-Pinkham and Imbens (2013) develop an algorithm for
taking draws from the posterior distribution for the model’s parameters.

Graham (2013) approaches model (21) from a fixed effects perspective, asking if it contains
implications that are invariant to A, but useful for identifying θ0 . This approach leaves
the distribution of (D0 , A) unspecified and unrestricted. Perhaps surprisingly, fixed effects
identification results can be derived.

Consider a dyad that is embedded in a stable neighborhood. A stable neighborhood has
two features. First, with the exception of possible link formation and dissolution between
themselves, the set of links maintained by agents i and j is the same across periods 1, 2 and
3. Agents i and j may add, maintain or delete links between periods 0 and 1. Second, the
links maintained by friends of players i and j do not change between periods 1 and 2. Dyads
in stable neighborhoods are embedded in local networks with link structures that are largely
fixed up to two degrees away across periods 1, 2, and 3.

Panel A of Figure 7 visually depicts two network sequences in a network consisting of three
agents. Number agents 1, 2 and 3 counter-clockwise from the top in each network. Observe
that Agents 1 and 3 are embedded in a stable neighborhood. Agent 1 is linked to agent 2,
and agent 3 to agent 2, in periods 1, 2 and 3 in both sequences depicted in Panel A.

The only difference between the two network sequences is that in the upper one agents 1 and
3 are linked in period 2, but not in period 1; while in the lower sequence they are linked in
period 1, but not in period 2. In the presence of a taste for triadic closure the net surplus
associated with a 1-to-3 link will be, in expectation, higher in period 2 than it is in period
1. Since agents 1 and 3 share a common friend in period 1, a 1-to-3 link in the next period
will generate additional utility from ensuring triadic closure. Agents 1 and 3 do not share a
common friend in period 0. Therefore forming a link in period 1 generates no extra utility

Notes: Number agents 1, 2 and 3 counter-clockwise from the top in each network. In panel
A d120 d230 = 0 but d121 d231 = 1 so that (1, 3) forming a link has a higher return in period
2 than in period 1. In period 2 the link generates utility from ensuring ‘triadic closure’, no
such utility gain is generated by a period 1 link. Consequently, the first network sequence
in panel A arises more frequently than the second in the presence of a structural taste
for transitivity in links. Observe that (1, 3) are embedded in a stable neighborhood since
d121 = d122 = d123 = 1 and d231 = d232 = d233 = 1. While the two panel A sequences are
uninformative about the presence of true state dependence in ties, this is not the case for the
two sequences in panel B. In panel B, the first sequence arises more frequently relative to the
second in the presence of true state dependence. Here the intuition is very much analogous
to that in Cox (1958).

from ensuring triadic closure. In the presence of a genuine taste for transitivity in links, as
embodied in link rule (21), the upper sequence should be observed more frequently than the
lower sequence.

Panel B of Figure 7 presents an example of how the relative frequency of different sequences
of dyad links, when embedded in a different stable neighborhood from the one depicted in
Panel A, provides information about β0 or state-dependence in links.

In single agent models, fixed effects identification of true state dependence in the presence of
unobserved heterogeneity is based on the frequency of observing certain sequences of choices
relative to other sequences (e.g., Cox, 1958; Heckman, 1978b; Chamberlain, 1985; Honoré
and Kyriazidou, 2000). For example, in the absence of state dependence the binary sequences
0101 and 0011 are equally likely. In the presence of state dependence, the relative frequency
of the latter sequence will be greater.

The identification of transitivity versus homophily involves a similar intuition. Conditional
on a dyad being embedded in a certain type of local network architecture, certain order-
ings of link histories should be more frequent than others. This approach involves making
comparisons ‘holding other features of the network fixed’. This is not straightforward to do.

The likelihood associated with a single network sequence includes 3 × 21 N (N − 1) distinct
components plus the initial condition (itself ‘high dimensional’). The challenge is that the
likelihood functions associated with the two network histories, even though they are identical
in all respects except that the (i, j) friendship history in one is a permutation of that in the
other, may be very different. This is because the presence or absence of a link in a given
period can affect the likelihood contribution of many other pairs in subsequent periods.
For example if (i, k) are linked in period t, then the addition of an (i, j) link increases the
probability of a (j, k) link in period t + 1. Local changes in the network can have widespread
effects on the structure of the network likelihood in subsequent periods.

If (i, j) are embedded in a stable neighborhood, the two likelihoods will be nominally quite
different, however many contributions in the first likelihood will be permutations of contri-

                                              40
butions which also appear in the second. As a result, the number of distinct terms in the two
likelihoods is small. Exploiting this simplification then allows for the application of identifi-
cation ideas used in prior work on binary choice (e.g., Manski, 1987; Honoré and Kyriazidou,
2000). Graham (2012), extending earlier work published in Graham (2013), show this type
of intuition can be made rigorous.

The relative strengths and weakness of fixed versus correlated random effects approaches to
dynamic network analysis, closely mirror those in single agent dynamic discrete choice anal-
ysis (cf., Chamberlain, 1984). The computational complexity of these approaches when ap-
plied to network models substantially exceeds their single-agent counterparts. The Goldsmith-
Pinkham and Imbens (2013) paper provides a valuable template for undertaking a correlated
random effects analysis. While some of their modeling assumptions are unattractive, it is
one the few coherent likelihood-based empirical models of dynamic network formation and
will no doubt be the building block for future research. The fixed-effects results in Graham
(2012, 2013) indicate that some features of the distribution of link surplus may be identified
without making assumptions about the initial network condition and/or the distribution
of unobserved dyad-level heterogeneity. A fixed effects analysis can provide evidence of a
structural taste for transitivity under weak assumptions and/or be used to validate specific
correlated random effects specifications.

Consider a network with adjacency matrix D = d and corresponding degree sequence D+ =
                                     def
(D1+ , . . . , DN + ) = (d1+ , . . . , dN + ) = d+ . Let DN,d+ denote the set of all undirected N × N
adjacency matrices with degree counts equal to d+ . This section describes an algorithm for
sampling uniformly from the set DN,d+ . Recently, Del Genio, Kim, Toroczkai and Bassler
(2010), Blitzstein and Diaconis (2011), Zhang and Chen (2012) and others have constructed
(reasonably) efficient procedures for sampling uniformly from the set DN,d+ . Here I outline


                                                 41
the importance sampling algorithm of Blitzstein and Diaconis (2011), whose exposition I
also follow closely.

Sampling uniformly from DN,d+ has a number of uses. First, it may be used to determine how
unusual a certain graph feature is among the set of all graphs with the same degree sequence.
In the Nyakatoke network the transitivity index is almost three times the magnitude of link
density. Among networks of the same size, with identical degree sequences, how unusual is
it to observe a network with transitivity this high? If there exist very few graphs in this set
with such high transitivity, then the researcher might conclude that modeling transitivity is
worthwhile.

To be specific Let f (D) be some function of the observed adjacency matrix, say its tran-
sitivity index. Among all undirected networks with degree sequences coinciding with D’s
what fraction have a transitivity index less than the one observed in the network in hand?
Let DN,d+ denote the size, or cardinality, of DN,d+ . We seek to evaluate

                                             P
                                               v∈DN,d+   1 (f (v) ≤ c)
                          Pr (f (D) ≤ c) =                               .                  (23)
                                                      DN,d+


A second motivation for studying DN,d+ , and specifically how to take random draws from it,
is that some sampling schemes do not fully reveal the network adjacency matrix. As noted
in the introduction many surveys collect information on an agent’s degree (e.g., number of
friends, co-workers, sexual partners etc.), but not information on the precise identity of link
partners. In such a situation the sampling process reveals that the true network belongs to
the set DN,d+ , but is agnostic about which network within this set is the actual one.

Consider a family of network formation models indexed by the parameter θ (in what follows
I ignore observed agent characteristics, but incorporating them would be straightforward).
Assume that θ could be consistently estimated if the entire adjacency matrix were observed.
Let Db denote a uniform random draw from the set DN,d+ and let θ̂b denote an estimate of
θ using Db . The identified set may be estimated by the convex hull of θ̂1 , . . . , θ̂B for some


                                               42
large value of B.

In some situations a researcher may wish to condition on other network features beyonds
the degree sequence. This may because it is more appropriate to study the “unusualness”
of a given network feature, conditional on additional aspects of network architecture. Al-
ternatively, if estimation of a network formation model is the goal, some sampling schemes
reveal more than an agent’s degree. For example the General Social Survey (GSS) collects
information of which friends are friends themselves (i.e., on triad configurations).

Stanton and Pinar (2012) develop a procedure for sampling from the set of networks with
given marginal and joint degree distributions. The joint degree distribution captures, for
example, the frequency with which an agent with three links is matched to an agent with five
links. In very recent work, Goyal, Blitzstein and de Gruttola (2014), show how to construct
networks which satisfy a variety of constraints. The focus on drawing from DN,d+ in this
section is pedagogical. This is the simplest interesting case, illustrates the difficulty of the
larger problem, and provides a stepping stone into a growing mathematics and computer
science literature on network simulation.


Determining whether a candidate degree sequence is graphical

Direction enumeration of all the elements of DN,d+ is generally not feasible. Even for networks
that includes as few as 10 agents, this set may have millions of elements. We therefore require
a method of sampling from DN,d+ uniformly and also estimating its size.

Two complications arise. First, it is not straightforward to construct a random draw from
DN,d+ . Second, we must draw uniformly from this set. Fortunately the first challenge is
solvable using ideas from the discrete math literature. To ensure our draws are uniform we
use importance sampling (e.g., Owen, 2013).

A sequential network construction algorithm begins with a matrix of zeros and sequentially
adds links to it until its rows and columns sum to the desired degree sequence. Unfortunately,
unless the links are added appropriately, it is easy to get “stuck” (in the sense that a certain

                                              43
point in the process it becomes impossible to reach a graph with the desired degree and the
researcher must restart the process (e.g., Snijders, 1991)).

Researchers in graph theory and discrete math have studied the construction of graphs with
fixed degrees and, in particular, provided conditions for checking whether a particular degree
sequence is graphical (e.g., Sierksma and Hoogeveen, 1991). We say that D+ is graphical if
there is feasible undirected network with degree sequence D+ . Not all integer sequences are
graphical. For example, there is no feasible undirected network of three agents with degree
sequence D+ = (3, 2, 1).

Blitzstein and Diaconis’ (2011) algorithm is guaranteed to produce a matrix from the set
Dd+ ,N . This is accomplished by cleverly using checks for whether an integer sequence is
graphic when adding links. To get a sense how this works in practice it is helpful to begin
with a check due to Erdos and Gallai (1961). Let D+ = (D1+ , . . . , DN + ) be a sequence of
candidate degrees for each of N agents in a network. Without loss of generality assume that
the elements of D+ are arranged in descending order so that D1+ ≥ D2+ ≥ · · · ≥ DN + .
Erdos and Gallai (1961) showed that D+ is graphical if and only if N
                                                                  P
                                                                   i=1 Di+ is even and


             k
             X                         N
                                       X
                   Di+ ≤ k (k − 1) +           min (k, Di+ ) for each k ∈ {1, . . . , N } .
             i=1                       i=k+1



To show necessity of the condition observe that for any set S of k agents in the network
there can be at most k2 = 21 k (k − 1) links between them. For the remaining N − k agents
                       

with i ∈
       / S there can be at most min (k, Di+ ) links from i to agents in S.

The study of graphic integer sequences has a long history in discrete math. Sierksma and
Hoogeveen (1991) summarize several criteria that can be used to check whether D+ is graph-
ical. Blitzstein and Diaconis (2011) base their sampling algorithm on a simple recursive test
for whether D+ is graphical due to Havel (1955) and Hakimi (1962). In what follows Di+
denotes the ith element of D+ .

Theorem 1. (Havel-Hakimi) Let Di+ > 0, if D+ does not have at least Di+ positive entries

                                                   44
other than i it is not graphical. Assume this condition holds. Let D̃+ be a degree sequence
of length N − 1 obtained by
[i]    deleting the ith entry of D+ and
[ii]    subtracting 1 from each of the Di+ highest elements in D+ (aside from the ith one).
D+ is graphical if and only if D̃+ is graphical. If D+ is graphical, then it has a realization
where agent i is connected to any of the Di+ highest degree agents (other than i).

Proof. See Blitzstein and Diaconis (2011).

Theorem 1 is suggestive of a sequential approach to building an undirected network with
degree sequence D+ . The procedure begins with a target degree sequence D+ . It starts by
choosing a link partner for the lowest degree agent (with at least one link). It chooses a
partner for this agent from among those with higher degree. A one is then subtracted from
the lowest degree agent and her chosen partner’s degrees. This procedure continues until the
residual degree sequence (the sequence of links that remain to be chosen for each agent) is
zero.

To describe the method proposed Blitzstein and Diaconis (2011) we require some additional
notation. Let (⊕i1 ,...,ik D+ ) be the vector obtained by adding a one to the i1 , . . . , ik elements
of D+ :                                              
                                                      Dj+ + 1 for j ∈ {i1 , . . . , ik }

                                                      Dj+
                                                              otherwise

Let (     i1 ,...,ik D+ )   be the vector obtained by subtracting one from the i1 , . . . , ik elements of
D+ :                                                       
                                                            Dj+ − 1 for j ∈ {i1 , . . . , ik }
                                                           
                                (   i1 ,...,ik D+ )j   =

Algorithm 1. (Blitzstein and Diaconis) A sequential algorithm for constructing a random
graph with degree sequence D+ = (D1+ , . . . , DN + )0 is

      1. Let G be an empty adjacency matrix.

                                                                   45
   2. If D+ = 0 terminate with output G

   3. Choose the agent i with minimal positive degree Di+ .

   4. Construct a list of candidate partners J = {j 6= i : Gij = Gji = 0 and                i,j   D+ graphical}.

   5. Pick a partner j ∈ J with probability proportional to its degree in D+ .

   6. Set Gij = Gji = 1 and update D+ to              i,j D+ .


   7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 until the degree of agent i is zero.

   8. Return to step 2.

The input for Algorithm 1 is the target degree sequence D+ and the output is an undirected
adjacency matrix G with G0 ι = D+ .

An example of how this algorithm might work, adapted from by Blitzstein and Diaconis
(2011), is:


  (3, 2, 2, 2, 1) → (3, 1, 2, 2, 0) → (2, 0, 2, 2, 0) → (1, 0, 2, 1, 0) → (0, 0, 1, 1, 0) → (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)


The goal is to construct a five agent network with degree sequence (3, 2, 2, 2, 1). The algo-
rithm begins by choosing the ‘last’ agent, who has only a single link. The second agent is
randomly chosen as her partner, generating the residual degree sequence (3, 1, 2, 2, 0). Now
the second agent has the lowest non-zero residual degree. She is selected and matched with
the first agent. This leads to a new residual degree sequence of (2, 0, 2, 2, 0). Now all three
remaining agents who need links have the same residual degree. The algorithm randomly
picks the first agent and matches her with the fourth agent. This leads to residual degree se-
quence (1, 0, 2, 1, 0) . The procedure concludes by matching agents one and three and finally
three and four.

Note the check for graphicality has real bite. Say that in step 2, agent two was matched
instead with agent three, leading to the residual degree sequence of (3, 0, 1, 2, 0) . This degree

                                                     46
sequence is not graphic. Indeed on the second step agent two is matched with agent one
with probability one.

Blitzstein and Diaconis (2011) discuss how the recursive formulation of Havel-Hakimi check
can be used to speed up the algorithm.


Importance sampling

Let YN,d+ denote the set of all possible sequences of links outputted by Algorithm 1 given
input D+ = d+ . Let G (Y ) be the adjacency matrix induced by link sequence Y . Let Y and
Y 0 be two different sequences produced by the algorithm. These sequences are equivalent
if their “end point” adjacency matrices coincide (i.e., if G (Y ) = G (Y 0 )). We can partition
YN,d+ into a set of equivalence classes, the number of such classes coincides with the number
of feasible networks with degree distribution D+ (i.e., with the cardinality of DN,d+ ). Let
c (Y ) denote the number of possible link sequences produced by Algorithm 1 that produce
Y ’s end point adjacency matrix (i.e., the number of different ways in which Algorithm 1 can
generate a given adjacency matrix).

Let i1 , i2 , . . . , iM be the sequence of agents chosen in step 3 of Algorithm 1 in which Y is the
output. Let a1 , . . . , am be the degree sequences of i1 , . . . , iM at the time when each agent
was first selected in step 3, then
                                                     M
                                                     Y
                                          c (Y ) =         ak !
                                                     k=1


Let σ (Y ) be the probability that Algorithm 1 produces link sequence Y . Note that σ (Y )
is easy to compute. Each time the algorithm choose a link in step 5 record the probability
with which it was chosen (i.e., the residual degree of the chosen agent divided by the sum
of the residual degrees of all agents in the choice set). The product of all these probabilities
equals σ (Y ).

Let f (G) be some function of the adjacency matrix and consider the expected value (using

The ratio π (G (Yt )) /c (Yt ) σ (Yt ) is called the likelihood ratio or the importance weight. If
we set f (G) to the constant function we see that the expected value of this weight is one.
This suggests the analog estimator

                              "T
                                                    #−1      T

                  µ̂f (G)   =                             ×                     f (G (Yt )) .
                              t=1
                                  c (Yt ) σ (Yt )           t=1
                                                                c (Yt ) σ (Yt )


Setting π (G) = 1 we get a procedure for estimating the expectation of f (G) when G is
drawn uniformly from DN,d+ .



4    Future research directions

The analysis of networks has always been a multi-disciplinary endeavor. Economists are
relative latecomers to this project. This survey has been deliberately eclectic and biased
toward recent work done by economists. This work has not been undertaken in a vac-
uum. Economists interested in studying networks would be well-advised to read widely.
Goldenberg, Zheng, Fienberg and Airoldi (2009) provide a monograph-length review of the
literature from the perspective of statistics and machine learning. Snijders (2011) surveys
the quantitative sociology literature.

                                                        48
At the same time there is tremendous latitude to approach network data from first principles
or so-called “fresh eyes”. In my view there is not one obvious “correct” way to formulate a
network formation model and much work remains to be done. At this stage it seems apparent
that a sizable component of empirical research on networks will be computationally complex.
Ideas from discrete math, computer science, and Bayesian MCMC estimation have all proved
to be very useful in work done thus far.

In thinking about identification, ideas from the recent literature on games, as well as the
more established literature on dynamic panel data, have led to valuable insights. In both
case the combinatoric complexity of networks precludes a direct application of methods from
these literatures in all but the very simplest of cases. At the same time clever exploitation of
various peculiarities and symmetries in the network formation problem can lead to tractable
procedures.

This survey has not emphasized special purpose models (e.g., Currarini, Jackson and Pin,
2010). In some settings, for example those often encountered in industrial organization,
substantial additional information may be available about the form of agents’ objective
functions, the timing of decisions and so on. Building empirical models that fully exploit
all this extra information can be fruitful, both for expanding subject area knowledge and
for methodological advancement. Indeed an important component of research by economists
should involve modeling real-world datasets coherently, even if realistic models are only
aspirational at the present time. Simple models are okay.
