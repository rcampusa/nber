This paper examines the effect of a change in U.S. trade policy on the domestic investment of
U.S. manufacturers. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that
industries more exposed to reductions in import tariff uncertainty exhibit relative declines in
investment after the change in trade policy. Within industries, we find that this relationship is
concentrated among establishments with low initial levels of labor productivity, capital intensity
and skill intensity. Plants with high initial levels of skill intensity, by contrast, exhibit relative
increases in investment with exposure. We also find evidence that establishments' investment
activity is smoother following the policy change.

1      Introduction

The U.S. manufacturing sector has undergone profound changes since the turn of the

century, when a shift in U.S. trade policy increased import competition from China.

While a range of studies link this trade liberalization to employment loss and establish-

ment exit, less is known about the extent to which survivors adapt by investing in new
                                                 1
production processes or product upgrades.             Greater understanding of such reactions is

particularly relevant in the current policy environment, where the 2016 U.S. Presiden-

tial election and the U.K.'s vote to exit the European Union have created considerable

uncertainty among producers in some of the world's largest markets.

    In this paper, we examine how the domestic investment and capital stocks of U.S.

manufacturing establishments respond to the October, 2000 U.S. granting of Perma-

nent Normal Trade Relations to China (PNTR), a trade liberalization that removed

the threat of substantial U.S. import tari increases on Chinese goods. By eliminating

this cost uncertainty, PNTR provided U.S. producers with greater incentives to invest

in nding Chinese suppliers, moving production from the United States to China, or

otherwise increasing their competitiveness in the face of rising Chinese import compe-

tition. We use industry- and establishment-level data on domestic investment by U.S.
                                                       2
manufacturers to examine the latter channel.

    Our empirical analysis takes place in three steps.                First, we examine the rela-

tionship between exposure to PNTR and both investment and capital stocks at the

industry-level.    Second, we use condential U.S. Census Bureau microdata to exam-

ine how individual establishments adjust investment in response to PNTR, with a

particular focus on heterogeneous responses along a broad range of establishment-level

attributes. The industry analysis serves as an important benchmark for our subsequent

analysis of establishments because the expected impact of trade liberalization at the

establishment-level is ambiguous: some plants may shrink or exit, lowering investment,
                                                                                                   3
while others may alter their production processes in ways that increase investment.

    1 Consider, for example, this anecdote from a recent article in the Wall Street Journal (Michaels
(2017)), quoted in Fort, Pierce, and Schott (2017):        When Drew Greenblatt bought Marlin Steel
Wire Products LLC, a small Baltimore maker of wire baskets for bagel shops, he knew nothing about
robotics. That was 1998, and workers made products manually using 1950s equipment....Pushed near
insolvency by Chinese competition in 2001, he started investing in automation. Since then, Marlin
has spent $5.5 million on modern equipment. Its revenue, sta and wages have surged and it now
exports to China and Mexico.
    2 In prior research (Pierce and Schott (2016)), we show that goods more exposed to PNTR exhibit
substantial relative increases in U.S. imports from China as well as the number of U.S. rms that
import from China, the number of Chinese rms that export to the United States, and the number
of U.S.-Chinese rm pairs engaged in a trading relationship. One interpretation of these outcomes
is that they reect investment in trading relationships that was unleashed by the elimination of cost
uncertainty.
    3 Pierce and Schott (2012) show that industries with greater exposure to PNTR exhibit relatively
higher job destruction due to plant and rm exit and relatively lower job creation due to suppressed
plant and rm entry.




                                                  1
Finally, motivated by models of investment under uncertainty, we investigate the tim-

ing, frequency, and lumpiness of establishments' investment before and after the change

in trade policy.

   We employ a generalized dierences-in-dierences (DID) identication strategy that

estimates how investment and capital stocks change after the granting of PNTR for in-

dustries and establishments with varying levels of exposure. The baseline specication

includes controls for other factors that may aect investment in manufacturing during

our sample period, including changes in Chinese trade policy that occur as part of

China's accession to the WTO (e.g. liberalization of export licensing), the phasing out

of the global Multi-Fiber Arrangement governing quotas on developing-country textile

and clothing exports, and changes in the relationship between investment and industry

characteristics  such as capital and skill intensity  that may be correlated spuriously

with the trade liberalization.

   At the industry-level, we nd that greater exposure to PNTR is associated with a

relative decline in investment, and that the timing of the decline corresponds closely

to PNTR's implementation. We nd little evidence of such a response with respect to

the capital stock, however, an outcome that may be due to the relatively slow response

of capital stocks to changes in investment ows.

   Our establishment-level analysis focuses on the investment activity of continuing

plants observed in the quinquennial U.S. Census of Manufactures (CM). We nd

that plant-level responses to PNTR vary according to their pre-PNTR characteris-

tics. Specically, while PNTR is associated with a relative decline in investment for

the average plant, establishments with higher initial levels of labor productivity and

capital intensity exhibit little to no relative decline, and plants with the highest levels

of initial skill intensity exhibit a   positive   relationship between exposure to the trade

liberalization and relative investment. The relatively high investment associated with

skill- and capital intensive plants is consistent with U.S. comparative advantage.

   To assess the potential eects of PNTR's reduction of uncertainty on the frequency

and smoothness of plants' investment, we use data from the Annual Survey of Man-

ufactures (ASM) to compute the average, standard deviation and share of years with

positive investment across years leading up to and after the change in policy. Here,

too, accounting for heterogeneity in establishment responses is important. In specica-

tions that control for plants' initial characteristics, we nd that, for the average plant,

larger reductions in tari rate uncertainty are associated with relative reductions in the

standard deviation of investment, though these reductions are not present for plants

with initially high levels of productivity.

   Our ndings make three contributions to the literature.            First, they provide a

broader view of the impact of trade liberalization on rms. While negative relation-

ships between import competition and employment are well-known, especially for the

period we are considering (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013); Pierce and Schott (2016)),

our nding that higher exposure to PNTR is associated with lower industry-level in-


                                                  2
vestment helps explain the reduction in overall manufacturing investment and the

attening of the capital stock that has been noted elsewhere (Kurz and Morin (2016)).

Furthermore, to the extent that depressed investment has dynamic eects on employ-

ment, our ndings provide insight into the potential persistence of weak employment

and earnings growth in the years following a liberalization.

   Second, our results highlight the potential heterogeneity of responses to trade lib-

eralization across plants within similarly exposed industries, and identies the charac-

teristics of establishments  including low labor productivity and high labor intensity 

that are associated with relatively greater declines in investment in the face of increased

import competition. These results relate to the large literature studying the impact of

competition on innovation and investment (e.g., Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Grith, and

Howitt (2005)). In this respect our research is most closely related to Gutierrez and

Philippon (2017)), which uses publicly available data from Compustat to show that

increased exposure to PNTR induces relative increases in investment among leader

rms, dened as rms with high market to book value.               Compared to that paper,

our contribution is twofold.    First, we consider the full population of manufacturing

establishments, as opposed to the publicly traded rms present in Compustat.                Sec-

ond, we examine a wider range of rm attributes  such as capital and skill intensity

and productivity  that capture other dimensions of leadership, i.e., consistency with

U.S. comparative advantage.       Furthermore, our ndings also add additional context

to recent research nding evidence in favor of trade-induced technical change (Bloom,

Draca, and Reenen (2016)) and a negative relationship between import competition

and innovation (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, Pisano, and Shu (2016)) among rms in the UK

and United States, respectively, facing import competition from China.

   Finally, we contribute to the relatively small number of empirical studies associated

with the large theoretical literature on investment under uncertainty (Pindyck (1993);

Rob and Vettas (2003)). Finding plausibly exogenous shocks to uncertainty is an im-

portant challenge in in these studies and several papers, including Guiso and Parigi

(1999), Schwartz and Zozaya-Gorostiza (2003), and Bloom, Bond, and Van Reenen

(2007), have estimated such shocks using surveys, cost data for specic information

technology investments, or detailed information from rms' annual reports.                 Here,

PNTR provides a large and plausibly exogenous shock to establishments' cost uncer-

tainty, and we identify eects on investment that are consistent with Bloom, Bond,
                          4
and Van Reenen (2007).

   The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the data, Section 3 describes

our empirical strategy and presents industry-level results.           Section 4 presents the

establishment-level analysis and and Section 5 concludes.

  4 For other studies on uncertainty in trade, see Handley (2014) and Handley and Limao (2017).

2      Data

2.1      Establishment- and Industry-Level Investment Data

Establishment-level investment and capital stock data are drawn from the U.S. Census

Bureau's condential Census of Manufactures (CM) and Annual Survey of Manufac-

tures (ASM). In both cases, the Census Bureau asks manufacturing establishments to

break down their capital expenditures into two categories  structures and equipment 

as well as to report their total capital expenditures. The CM collects this information,

as well as data on other establishment attributes, including employment, shipments

and value added, on every U.S. manufacturing establishment (i.e., plant) quinquenni-

ally in years ending in two and seven. In all of our analyses using the CM, we follow

standard practice in excluding all administrative records, i.e., observations for which

most of the key variables of interest are imputed.

    Table 1 summarizes real investment (i.e., real capital expenditures) among U.S.
                                                                                  5
manufacturing establishments appearing in our regression sample below.                Each row

of the table reports results for a dierent Census year, while each panel focuses on a

dierent measure of investment: average investment per plant, average investment as a

share of establishments' capital stock, and average share of establishments with positive

investment. In each case, we report gures for total investment and its components,

investment in structures and investment in equipment.




                     Table 1: PNTR and Industry-Level Capital Stock



    As indicated in the table, total investment averages 905 thousand dollars across

establishments in 1992, versus 954 thousand dollars in 2007. As a share of the capital

stock, these levels of investment range from 11 percent in 1992 to 16 percent in 2007.

Furthermore, the table reveals that investment in equipment accounts for roughly 85

percent of total capital expenditures, with the remaining 15 percent accounted for by

investment in structures. Finally, the table indicates that most plants invest in each

Census year, with 87 percent of establishments reporting positive capital expenditures

    5 We discuss the deators used in the computation of real investment below.



                                                  4
in 1992 and 90 percent reporting investment in 2007. Investments in equipment are

much more common than investment in structures, with the latter occurring at 44

percent of establishments in 1992 and 54 percent of establishments in 2007.

    For the portion of our analysis where we investigate attributes of investment that

must be estimated across time  e.g., the standard deviation of investment or average

investment per year  we require higher-frequency data than is available in the CM. We

therefore augment the CM data with annual data from the ASM. However, because the

ASM collects information from only a subset of plants, we must restrict our analysis

to the establishments that are surveyed in every year across our 1992 to 2007 sample
          6
period.       While this sample is restricted, these long-lived plants typically account for a

disproportionately large share of activity in the manufacturing sector.




                Figure 1: Manufacturing Employment versus Real Investment


    Our industry-level analysis makes use of the publicly available NBER-CES Manu-

facturing Industry Database assembled by Becker, Gray, and Marvakov (2013), which

can be downloaded from the NBER website.              This dataset tracks many of the same

outcomes contained in the CM and ASM across six-digit North American Industry

Classication (NAICS) categories, including employment, nominal investment and the

real capital stock, including separate data for real stocks of equipment and structures.

We deate the nominal investment in both these data and the CM and ASM using
                                                                          7
industry-specic investment deators contained in the database.               Because investment

   6 This restriction arises from changes in the sampling frame for the ASM that occur every ve
years, which prevent tracking some plants consistently over time. Furthermore, while some plants are
sampled with certainty in the ASM, the threshold used for selecting these certainty cases changed
several times over the period we consider.

is not broken out by equipment versus structures in the NBER-CES database, we

construct this breakdown ourselves using publicly available versions of the Census of

Manufactures (CM) and Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) available on the Cen-
                         8
sus Bureau's website.

    Figure 1 shows that total real investment by U.S. manufacturing rms in equipment

and structures rises faster than trend in the late 1990s before falling substantially in

the early 2000s. Indeed, the decline in manufacturing investment from 1999 to 2003

is roughly equal to the decline experienced during the much-deeper Great Recession.

As a result, the manufacturing real capital stock fell from 2003 to 2004, the rst time

it had registered a decline since the data have been tracked (Kurz and Morin (2016)).

This decline can be seen in Figure 2, which also reveals that most of the increase in

manufacturing capital stock since the 1970s is in equipment versus structures.




                             Figure 2: Manufacturing Capital Stock




2.2     Industry and Firm Exposure to PNTR

Our analysis makes use of a plausibly exogenous change in U.S. trade policy  the

U.S. granting of PNTR to China in October 2000  that eectively liberalized U.S.

for each industry collected in the CM and ASM into real expenditure data using investment deators
produced by the Federal Reserve Board. They then construct industry-level real capital stocks using a
perpetual inventory equation in conjunction with depreciation rates for each industry also developed
by the Federal Reserve Board.
   8 For instances in which data from the CM and ASM are available only at levels of aggregation
higher than the six-digit NAICS industries used in our analysis, we employ industry shares developed
by the Federal Reserve Board to allocate investment to six-digit NAICS industries. Further detail is
available from the authors upon request.



                                                 6
imports from China. This impact can be understood by considering the two sets of

tari rates that comprise the U.S. tari schedule.   The rst set of taris, known as

NTR taris, are generally low and are applied to goods imported from other members

of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The second, known as non-NTR taris,

were set by the Smoot-Hawley Tari Act of 1930 and are often substantially higher

than the corresponding NTR rates. Imports from non-market economies such as China

generally are subject to the higher non-NTR rates, but U.S. law allows the President to

grant these countries access to NTR rates on a year-by-year basis, with the President's

decision subject to potential overruling by Congress.

   U.S. Presidents granted China such a waiver every year starting in 1980, but Con-

gressional votes over annual renewal became politically contentious and less certain of

passage following the Chinese government's crackdown on Tiananmen Square protests

in 1989 and other ashpoints in U.S.-China relations during the 1990s such as China's

transfer of missile technology to Pakistan in 1993 and the Taiwan Straits Missile Crisis

in 1996.   Uncertainty over China's access to NTR tari rates ended with Congress

passing a bill granting PNTR status to China in October, 2000, which formally took

eect upon China's entry into the WTO in December 2001.




                 Figure 3: Distribution of Industry-Level NTR Gaps


   We follow Pierce and Schott (2016) in measuring the impact of PNTR as the rise in

U.S. taris on Chinese goods that would have occurred in the event of a failed annual

renewal of China's NTR status prior to PNTR,


                    N T R Gapj = N on N T R Ratej â N T R Ratej .                    (1)




                                           7
We refer to this dierence as the NTR gap, and compute it for each SIC industry

j   using   ad valorem equivalent   tari rates provided by Feenstra, Romalis, and Schott

(2002) for 1999, the year before passage of PNTR. As indicated in Figure 3, which

reports the distribution of NTR gaps across six-digit NAICS industries, NTR gaps

vary widely, with a mean and standard deviation of 30 and 14 percentage points, with

an interquartile range of 0.21 to 0.40. Analysis of the underlying NTR and non-NTR

rates in Pierce and Schott (2016) reveals that seventy-nine percent of the variation

in the NTR gap across industries is due to variation in non-NTR rates, set 70 years

prior to passage of PNTR. This feature of non-NTR rates eectively rules out reverse

causality that would arise if   non-NTR rates were set to protect industries with declining
employment or surging imports. Furthermore, to the extent that NTR rates were set

to protect industries with declining employment prior to PNTR, these higher NTR

rates would result in lower NTR gaps, biasing our results away from nding an eect

of PNTR.



2.3       Other Policy Variables

Our empirical analysis includes controls for a wide range of additional factors that

may aect U.S. manufacturing investment. First, we allow for the possibility that the

relationship between certain industry-level characteristics and investment may have

changed around the time of PNTR's passage. For example, a decline in the competi-

tiveness of labor intensive industries in the United States or the decline of unions may

have disproportionately aected certain industries. We control for these explanations

by including interactions of a post-PNTR indicator with initial values of industry capi-

tal and skill intensity and the industry-level share of union membership in 1990 (Hirsch

and Macpherson (2003)).

     We also control for changes in Chinese domestic and trade policies related to its

accession to the WTO. These changes include reductions in export licensing require-

ments, production subsidies and import tari rates. Our controls draw on data from

work on export licensing requirements by Bai, Krishna, and Ma (2015), on production

subsidies from Khandelwal, Schott, and Wei (2013), and on Chinese import tari rates

from Brandt, Van Biesebroeck, Wang, and Zhang (2017). To account for the fact that

reductions in barriers to foreign investment in China also declined at this time, we

control for the share of industry inputs requiring relationship-specicity from Nunn

(2007).

     Finally, we control for other policy and macroeconomic shifts occurring in the U.S.

around 2000. The rst of these changes is the bursting of the 1990s tech bubble, which

we control for with the interaction of the post-PNTR indicator with an indicator for

whether the industry is engaged in the production of advanced technology products, as

dened by the International Trade Commission. In addition, we control for the elimina-

tion of quotas associated with the phasing out of the global Multi-Fiber Arrangement



                                               8
(Khandelwal, Schott, and Wei (2013)).




3         PNTR and Industry-Level Investment

As indicated in the large literature on the impact of competition on innovation and

investment (e.g., Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Grith, and Howitt (2005)), the relation-

ship between PNTR and investment is theoretically ambiguous. Some establishments

might step up investment in their U.S. operations in an eort to increase competitive-

ness     vis a vis   rising imports, while others might choose to exit the market, or cease

domestic production in favor of production abroad.                    In this section we set the stage

for our establishment-level analysis below by examining the aggregate impact of these

decisions on investment at the industry level.

        Our baseline dierence-in-dierences (DID) specication examines whether indus-

tries with higher NTR gaps (rst dierence) experience dierential changes in invest-

ment after the change in U.S. trade policy (second dierence) versus before,




                                 yjt = Î¸P ost P N T Rt Ã N T R Gapj +                              (2)

                                             Î²Xjt + Î³P ost P N T Rt Ã Xj +
                                             Î´j + Î´t + Îµjt .



The sample period for the industry analysis is 1990 to 2007. The dependent variable,

yjt ,   represents an outcome in industry              j,   for example log investment. The rst term

on the right hand side is the DID term of interest, an interaction of the NTR gap

and an indicator for the post-PNTR period, i.e., years from 2001 forward. The second

term on the right-hand side of equation 2 captures the impact of time-varying industry

characteristics, such as exposure to MFA quota reductions and the NTR tari rate.

The third term on the right hand side is an interaction of the post-PNTR dummy

variable and time-invariant industry characteristics, such as initial industry capital

and skill intensity, the degree to which industries encompass high-technology products

and the extent of initial union membership in the industry. These interactions allow

for the possibility that the relationship between employment and these characteristics

changes in the post-PNTR period in ways that might spuriously be related to the trade

liberalization.      Î´j , Î´t   and   Î±   represent industry and year xed eects and the constant.

        An attractive feature of this DID identication strategy is its ability to isolate the

role of the change in U.S. trade policy.                    While industries with high and low NTR

gaps are not identical, comparing outcomes within industries over time isolates the

        The rst three columns of Table 2 report results for our main variable of interest,

total investment, with standard errors clustered at the industry level. The rst column

reports a specication with only the DID term, the second column adds interactions

of the post-PNTR indicator with industry capital intensity and skill intensity, and the

third column includes the full set of controls described in Section 2.3. As indicated in

the table, we nd negative and statistically signicant coecients on the DID term in

all three cases. We assess the economic signicance of the estimated DID coecients in

terms of the eect on the dependent variable of an interquartile shift in an industry's

NTR gap (from 0.214 to 0.402). These coecients indicate that an interquartile shift in

industry exposure to PNTR is associated with relative declines in investment of -0.131

to -0.168 log points (e.g., -0.696*0.188 to -1.017*0.188). The next six columns report

analogous results for investment in structures and equipment.      We nd a negative

and signicant relationship between exposure to PNTR and each of these types of

investment in all three specications.




                   Table 2: PNTR and Industry-Level Investment


   For the decline in investment to be attributable to PNTR, the NTR gap should

be correlated with investment after PNTR, but not before.       To determine whether



                                          10
there is a relationship between these variables in the years before 2001, we replace the

P ostP N T R   indicator used in equation 2 with interactions of the NTR Gap and the

full set of year dummies,

Here, we estimate equation 3 with the full set of controls noted above.                Results are

reported visually in Figure 4. The left panel of this gure traces out the impact on

investment of an interquartile shift in industry exposure to PNTR implied by the

estimated dierence-in-dierences coecients          Î¸y .   For comparison, a similar gure for

employment is provided in the right panel. As indicated in the left panel of the gure,

point estimates are statistically insignicant at conventional levels until after 2001, at

which time they generally become negative and statistically signicant. This pattern is

consistent with the parallel trends assumption inherent in our dierence-in-dierences
                                                                      9
analysis, lending further support for our empirical strategy.




                    Figure 4: Implied Industry-Level Impact of PNTR


   Next, we examine whether the decline in investment associated with PNTR in

Table 2 is also apparent in capital stocks. As indicated in Table 3, we nd that higher

   9 To further evaluate the role of the policy change versus other factors, Pierce and Schott (2016)
compares the relationship between the NTR gap and manufacturing employment in the U.S. with that
in the EU, which was not subject to a similar policy change. They nd that the negative relationship
between exposure to PNTR and manufacturing employment is only present in the United States.




                                                 11
exposure to PNTR is associated with positive but statistically insignicant changes in

the capital stock for total capital (column 1) and equipment capital (column 2) and

negative and statistically insignicant changes in structures capital (column 3). One

potential reason for the lack of a relationship between PNTR and the capital stock,

unlike for investment, is that the capital stock adjusts slowly to changes in investment

ows.




                     Table 3: PNTR and Industry-Level Capital Stock



   An interesting question for further study is whether the relative weakening in invest-

ment may help explain the persistence of the reduction in manufacturing employment

associated with PNTR (Pierce and Schott (2016)). That is, while increases in invest-

ment may lead to subsequent rebounds in employment, declines in investment driven
                                                                                            10
by establishment exit may have a long-run dampening eect on job creation.

   Finally, we examine the relationship between the change in U.S. trade policy and

investment deators using equation 3. To conserve space, we summarize the results of

  10 Fort, Pierce, and Schott (2017) show that more than eighty percent of the decline in manufacturing
employment between 1977 and 2012 is due to net establishment death.

this regression in Figure 5, which plots the 90 percent condence interval associated

with an interquartile shift in industry exposure to PNTR. As indicated in the gure,

we nd that industries with greater exposure to PNTR exhibit greater declines in

their investment deators.   One potential explanation for this relationship relates to

plant closures.   Pierce and Schott (2016), for example, nd that plants with greater

exposure to the change in policy are relatively more likely to shut down.      If these

closures increase the supply (on the secondary market) of the capital goods used to

produce in that industry, their price might fall.

4    PNTR and Establishment-Level Investment

In this section, we exploit the plant-level data available in the CM and ASM to de-

termine the extent to which dierent plants in the same industry might vary in their

response to PNTR. Plant-level analysis also permits examination of the extent to which

changes in investment are driven by adjustments in average investment per year versus

changes in the lumpiness of investment.       We nd that in both cases, larger, more

productive and more skill- and capital-intensive plants are less likely to adjust their

investment activity in response to the change in U.S. trade policy.




                                           13
4.1     Baseline Plant-level Estimates

We begin by examining the average investment responses of plants to PNTR without

including terms that might account for within-industry heterogeneity.                     We use data

from the CM, which covers the population of manufacturing establishments and is

available every ve years.        Our sample is composed of observations from the 1992,

1997, 2002 and 2007 CMs and this baseline specication is as follows,




                           ypt = Î¸P ost P N T Rt Ã N T R Gapj +                                     (4)

                                     Î³P ost P N T Rt Ã Xj + Î²Xjt +
                                     +Î´p + Î´t + Î± + Îµpt .

where   p   indexes establishments,    j   indexes industries and    t   indexes years. The depen-

dent variable is one of three real investment shares  total investment (i.e., total capital

expenditures), investment in equipment, or investment in structures, where each is di-

vided by the establishment's capital stock  or the log value of the capital stock. The

rst term on the right-hand side is the DID term representing the eect of PNTR,

and it consists of the interaction of a        P ost P N T Rt   indicator and the time-invariant

N T R Gapj .    The next two terms represent the additional control variables used in

Equation2.      The remaining terms represent plant and year xed eects.                   Note that

this specication yields within-plant estimates of the relationship between exposure to

PNTR and capital expenditures, but does not account for changes in investment driven

by establishment entry and exit.

    The rst two columns of Table 4 report the results of estimating equation 4, rst

with only the DID term of interest and the xed eects required for its identica-

tion (column 1), and then with the full set of covariates (column 2).                     We nd that

while the relationship between exposure to PNTR and total investment is negative,

as in the industry-level estimates discussed above, it is not statistically signicant at

conventional levels. The next six columns indicate similar negative but statistically in-

signicant relationships for the two broad categories of investment shares  equipment

and structures  as well as for the log real book value of capital. The overall message

of Table 4 is that the relationship between exposure to PNTR and investment within

continuing plants is negative but not precisely estimated.

    We note that establishment-level results in Table 4 dier from the industry-level
                                                                                     11
estimates in Table 2 for two reasons. First, the samples are dierent.                     Second, the

  11 The samples are dierent in three ways. First, inclusion of plant xed eects in the establishment-
level analysis means that identication is restricted to within-establishment variation, thereby exclud-
ing the impact of establishment exit, which is substantial during this period (Fort, Pierce, and Schott
(2017); Pierce and Schott (2012)). Second, these xed eects also exclude plants that are not present
in both the pre- and post-PNTR periods. Finally, the establishment-level regressions are restricted to
Census years  1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007  while the industry-level sample includes data for every




                                                  14

dependent variables are not the same: the industry-level analysis examines variation in

log investment, while the plant-level regressions investigate investment shares because
                                                                  12
establishment-level investment can be zero in some years.



4.2     Plant-level Results Allowing for Heterogeneous Responses

To assess the importance of plant heterogeneity within industries, we augment Equa-

tion 4 with an additional covariate that interacts the DID term with one of several

normalized initial plant attributes: plant size, as measured by employment or value

added; plant productivity, as measured by TFP, value added (VA) per worker or ship-

ments per worker; and plant capital and skill intensity,

year from 1990 to 2007.

             ypt = Î¸1 P ost P N T Rt Ã N T R Gapj +                                                   (5)

                Î´p + Î´t + Î± + Îµpt

These terms, which we refer to as plant heterogeneity terms and which we include

one-at-a-time in separate regressions, appear as the triple interaction in the second line

of equation 5. The normalization divides the 1992 plant attribute by the average of that

attribute across all plants in the same industry in 1992, therefore explicitly accounting
                                                                                                13
for heterogeneity within industries, rather than dierences across industries.                       The

third term in equation 5 represents the interaction of the plant heterogeneity term

with the     P ost P N T Rt   indicator required to identify the triple interaction. We do not

simultaneously include all plant heterogeneity terms in a single regression given their
                    14
high correlation.

    Estimates are reported in Table 5. To conserve space we restrict our reporting to

the equipment investment share, as that form of investment accounts for the majority

of total investment, and suppress the estimates for the non-DID terms. As indicated

in the table, a key dierence between these results and those reported in Table 4 is

the statistical signicance of the main PNTR DID term in all columns of the rst row

except the second (value added). The plant heterogeneity terms themselves, reported in

the remaining rows of the table, are positive in all columns and statistically signicant

in the nal four, i.e., for both measures of labor productivity and for capital and skill

intensity.    These positive coecients indicate that, for a given level of exposure to

PNTR, plants with higher values of these attributes exhibit relatively higher levels of

equipment investment after the change in trade policy, relative to those with lower

values of the attributes.

    As noted in the bottom panel of the table, an interquartile shift in industry exposure

to PNTR implies relative reductions in the equipment investment share of -0.004 (-

0.0229*0.188+0.0022*0.188*1.1176) in the rst column of the table (where employment

is the plant heterogeneity attribute), to -0.0014 in the last column (skill intensity). In

each case, these impacts are evaluated at the mean level of the noted attribute across

  13 Given the xed eects, plants are included in the regression only if they span 1997 and 2002. For
plants that are not present in 1992, we divide their 1997 attribute by the relevant industry attribute
in 1992.
  14 One potential concern with our regression specication is that plants with dierent values of initial
characteristics may have been on dierent trends prior to the PNTR, and that these trends may drive
the relationship between the policy change and the plant heterogeneity terms.         In unreported but
available results, we control for this possibility by augmenting equation 5 with interactions of year
dummies and the plant characteristic being examined. Results are virtually identical to those described
below.

plants in 1992. These changes represent -1.1 to -3.2 percent of the mean equipment

investment share in 1997, the prior year closest to the change in trade policy.




  Table 5: PNTR and Heterogeneity in Establishment-Level Equipment Investment


   The DID coecients from these and analogous regressions for total and structures

investment are summarized visually in Figures 6 and 7. The rst of these gures plots

the main DID coecient across specications, with each panel of the gure reporting

the ninety percent condence interval for the seven separate regressions that correspond

to the inclusion of the seven plant heterogeneity attributes we examine. The bottom

right panel of this gure corresponds to the rst row of Table 5. As noted in the gure,

the main DID terms are negative for log capital (upper left panel) and for the total

(upper right panel) and equipment investment (lower right panel) shares, but generally

statistically signicant only for the latter two. Results for the structures investment

share (lower left panel) are typically statistically insignicant, with the exception of the

skill intensity attribute regression, where the relationship is negative and signicant.

   Figures 7 provides a similar plot for the plant heterogeneity DID terms. In this case,

the bottom right panel reports the results from the second row of Table 5. As with the



                                            17
                 Figure 6: Main DID Coecients for CM Regressions



main DID terms, relationships between the change in trade policy and outcomes are

stronger for the equipment and total investment shares than they are for structures

investment and the capital stock.

   Finally, Figure 8 uses the coecients reported in Figures 6 and 7, as well as in-

formation about the distribution of plants' attributes in 1992, to quantify how the

economic impact of PNTR varies across establishments with dierent levels of a par-

ticular attribute. In the gure, each pair of bars is computed using coecient estimates

from the separate regressions described above (e.g., one of the columns of Table 5).

Each bar is an evaluation of the impact of an interquartile shift in exposure to PNTR

for a plant with a low versus high level of the noted attribute. We dene the low

level of an attribute as the mean less one standard deviation and the high level as the

mean plus one standard deviation. We report results for total, structures and equip-

ment investment shares. Economic impacts are expressed as the implied change in the

investment share as a percentage of the mean investment share across plants in 1997,

the prior year closest to the change in trade policy.

   As indicated in the gure, we nd that the impact of greater exposure on low- versus

high-attribute establishments varies by attribute but that it is similar across the three

types of investment. Our discussion here focuses on total and equipment investment

shares given the stronger relationship between exposure to PNTR and these outcomes

found above.



                                           18
         Figure 7: Plant Heterogeneity DID Coecients for CM Regressions



   Overall, we nd that plants with high values of the attributes we examine experience

smaller relative reductions in equipment investment following PNTR. This dierence is

most noticeable for labor productivity, capital intensity, and skill intensity. For plant

size and TFP, the dierences between low- and high-attribute plants are relatively

small. A second notable feature of Figure 8 is that plants with the highest skill intensity

actually experience a relative increase equipment investment after the change in trade

policy versus before.

   Combined, the results in this section suggest that the average continuing establish-

ment reduces equipment (and total) investment in response to PNTR relative to the

period before the change in trade policy. However, for the subset of plants with rela-

tively high skill intensity, greater exposure to the change in trade policy is associated

with relatively higher equipment (and total) investment.       This increased investment

could represent trade-induced technological change of the type discussed in Bloom,

Draca, and Reenen (2016). Alternatively, it could reect capital expenditures used to

upgrade product quality (Schott (2003, 2004)) or switch production (Bernard, Jensen,

and Schott (2006); Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2011); Khandelwal (2010))

towards goods more in line with U.S. comparative advantage.

   Our results in this section are consistent with those reported in Gutierrez and

Philippon (2017), who nd that while investment in property, plant and equipment is

relatively lower for publicly traded rms after PNTR versus before, the relative decline



                                            19

is less substantial for leader rms, dened as rms whose market-to-book value of

capital is above the median.



4.3     Responses in the Timing and Frequency of Investment

PNTR's elimination of the risk of potential tari increases oers a unique setting

for examining how uncertainty aects establishments' investment behavior in ways

beyond those explored above, in particular its timing and frequency.                  Bloom, Bond,

and Van Reenen (2007), for example, show theoretically that greater uncertainty lowers

the responsiveness of rms' investment to demand shocks, provided that investments

are at least partially irreversible.      In particular, because uncertainty drives a wedge

between the marginal products of capital required for investment and disinvestment, it

increases the zone of inaction, rendering it lumpier. In this section, we use the ASM
                                                                                          15
to examine how the timing and frequency of investment respond to PNTR.

    As noted above, the ASM has two drawbacks relative to the CM: it is a survey rather

than a census; and the survey sample is re-drawn every ve years, complicating one's

ability to track individual plants for a long period of time.             Given these limitations,

our analysis is limited to the balanced panel of plants present in every ASM from 1990

to 2007. This selected sample clearly diers from the general population, as the plants

included are larger, older and more likely to be exporters.

    We relate the patterns of establishments' investment to the change in trade policy

by collapsing the balanced panel into two periods: a pre-PNTR period encompassing

the years 1990 to 2000; and a post-PNTR period comprising 2001 to 2007. A virtue

of this sample interval, in addition to its spanning the passage of PNTR, is that each

  15 Empirically, Bloom, Bond, and Van Reenen (2007) show that publicly traded UK rms' investment
is negatively associated to the standard deviation of their stock returns, a potential manifestation of
demand uncertainty.

sub-period roughly coincides with a full business cycle, beginning around the time of

a recession peak and continuing through the start of the next recession.

   For each period, we calculate three plant-level measures of investment activity. The

rst measure is the average size of establishments' investments, dened as the sum of

plant   p's   investment for period   c,   divided by the number of years in the period. This

measure provides a useful comparison to our results above. The second measure is the

standard deviation of the level of investment, within plants, across the years in each

period. This measure captures changes in the lumpiness of plants' investment behavior.

The third measure is the share of years in each period with positive investment, a

measure that captures the frequency with which establishments invest. In practice, as

noted in Table 1, a high share of establishments invest each year, though the share

is lower for structures investment.          With these measures, we estimate the following

equation:




                          ln(ypc ) = Î¸P ost P N T Rc Ã N T R Gapj +                                  (6)

                                 Î²Xjc + Î³P ost P N T Rc Ã Xj +
                                 Î´p + Î´c + Î± + Îµpc ,

where    p    indexes establishments and      j   indexes industries, as before, and         c   indexes

the two time periods.      The dependent variable             ln(ypc )   is the log of one of the three

measures of investment behavior for plant               p   in period    c   noted above, and the DID

term and control variables are identical to those in Equation 2, with the exception that

in equation 6, time-varying control variables are averaged over each period.

   As in Section 4.1, Table 6 sets a baseline by reporting coecient estimates and

standard errors from estimating equation 6 without controls for plant heterogeneity.

The rst three columns of the table display results for total investment, the next three

columns for investment in structures, and the nal three columns for investment in

equipment.

   The results indicate that higher industry-level exposure to PNTR  and therefore

a larger reduction in tari rate uncertainty  is associated with smaller average in-

vestment sizes, a smaller standard deviation of investment across years, and a higher

share of years with positive investment. Though the signs for the latter two variables

generally are in line with the predictions from Bloom, Bond, and Van Reenen (2007),

in that larger reductions in uncertainty lead to investments that are less lumpy (stan-

dard deviation) and more frequent (share positive), only one of these relationships 

the standard deviation of equipment investment  is statistically signicant at conven-

tional levels. One potential explanation for the lack of signicance may be that our

data are at a relatively infrequent annual frequency, thereby masking variation in the

timing of investments within calendar years.

   As above, when we augment equation 6 with plant heterogeneity terms, these re-

lationships become clearer. Results from this augmented specication are displayed in

Figures 9 and 10, which take the same format as Figures 66 and 7. The gures display

results only for equipment investment, as this is the category of investment that dis-

plays the strongest relationship with PNTR, as in Section 4.1. Analogous gures for

total investment and investment in structures are unreported, but available.

   Figure 9 displays 90 percent condence intervals for the coecient estimates on the

main DID term. The left panel of this gure reveals that, for the average establish-

ment, higher exposure to PNTR is associated with a relative reduction in the standard

deviation of equipment investment, but that these relationships are statistically sig-

nicant at conventional levels only for the specications that examine heterogeneity

in productivity. A relative decline in lumpiness is also manifest in the share of years

with positive investment (right panel), but only for the specication that uses TFP to

capture heterogeneity. The main DID terms for average investment (middle panel) are

statistically insignicant at conventional levels. This dierence compared to the results

for the CM, above, may reect the select group of rms present in the balanced ASM

sample.

   Figure 10 displays 90 percent condence intervals for the plant heterogeneity DID

terms. As shown in the gure, plant heterogeneity DID terms are positive and statis-

tically signicant for the standard deviation of equipment investment (left panel) for

the three productivity terms. Likewise, among the plant heterogeneity DID terms for

the share of years with positive investment (right panel), the estimate is positive and

statistically signicant at conventional levels for TFP.

   As in the previous section, we combine the estimates plotted in in Figures 9 and 10

with information no the distribution of plants' initial attributes to compare the impact

of an interquartile shift in exposure to PNTR among plants with low and high values

of each attribute.   These results are reported in Figure 11.   As indicated in the left

panel of the gure, plants with low initial values of labor productivity exhibit a decline

in the standard deviation of equipment investment of approximately 2 percent relative

to their 1997 levels. Plants with high labor productivity, by contrast, exhibit hardly

any change relative to the period before the change in U.S. trade policy.

   One potential explanation of the results in this section can be found by considering



                                           23

the expectations of high-productivity establishments prior to passage of PNTR. If these

establishments viewed their productivity level as being suciently high to continue

operating even if taris increased substantially, their investment activity may not have

been suppressed by uncertainty in the pre-PNTR period. As a result, less of a response

to the timing of these establishments' investment following passage of PNTR might be

expected.




5     Conclusion

This paper estimates the investment responses of U.S. manufacturing industries and

establishments to the elimination of tari rate uncertainty associated with the U.S.

granting of PNTR to China in October 2000. We use a dierences-in-dierences ap-

proach to examine how variation in exposure to PNTR is associated with changes in

manufacturing investment and capital stock after the policy change, relative to before.

    At the industry-level, we nd that industries more exposed to PNTR experience

relative declines in manufacturing investment, both for equipment and structures, and

that more-exposed industries experience statistically insignicant declines in the capital

stock. Examining a exible specication that makes no assumptions about the timing

of the eects of PNTR, we nd that the decline in investment lines up closely with the

timing of the granting of PNTR.

    At the establishment-level, we nd that there is heterogeneity within industries in

terms of how establishments respond to PNTR's trade liberalization. While the average

eect of PNTR is to lower investment, for establishments with higher initial levels of

labor productivity and of capital and skilled labor intensity, higher exposure to PNTR's

trade liberalization is associated with increases in investment.     These within-plant

increases in investment are consistent with trade-induced technical change, product-




                                           24
upgrading, or other activities that dierentiate U.S. production from import-competing

products.

   Examining the timing, frequency, and lumpiness of establishments' investment be-

havior, we nd that larger reductions in uncertainty associated with PNTR are as-

sociated declines in the lumpiness of investment, though there is less of a change in

behavior for establishments with high initial productivity levels.

   In sum, the ndings in this paper provide new information on the eect of trade lib-

eralization on investment, while highlighting the heterogeneous responses of individual

plants.

A     Industry Results Through 2011

The regression sample in the main text extends through 2007 in order to avoid the Great

Recession. For comparison, Figure 12 reports results for industry-level investment and

for the industry-level investment deators using equation 3 for 1990 to 2011, the limit

of the NBER-CES Manufacturing Productivity Database.

B     Reconciling Industry and Plant Results




               Table 7: Aggregating Plant Results to Industry Results



Table 7 illustrates that the dierences between industry- and establishment-level results

largely disappear when they are aggregated to the same level and consider the same

same dependent variable. Specically, the rst column of the table reports results of

estimating equation 2 after starting with the establishment-level sample, aggregating

to the industry-level, and using the natural log of total investment as the dependent

variable. Comparing the coecient estimate for the DID term in column 1 of Table

7 to the analogous estimate in column 3 of Table 2 indicates that both are negative

and statistically signicant, and of similar magnitudes. The implied eect in Table 2

is somewhat larger than that in Table 7, as the latter excludes the eect of plant exit

that occurs between 1997 and 2002. Alternatively, when we estimate equation 2 with

the same sample as column one of Table 7, but use the dependent variable from the

establishment-level regressionsinvestment divided by capital stockwe again nd that

the magnitude of the DID coecient estimate is similar to the analogous establishment-



                                           30
level results from column 2 of Table 4. The coecient in this    industry -level   analysis

is statistically signicant, likely because it captures changes in investment associated

with net plant exit, which the establishment-level regressions do not.
