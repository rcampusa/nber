This paper examines how phased retirement plans in higher education create value for both the

institution and individual faculty, based upon evidence from the Survey of Changes in Faculty

Retirement Policies and an in-depth case study of the University of North Carolina system. Faculty

benefit by receiving improved opportunities for part-time work and by having the ability to make

a smoother transition to retirement. The policy is clearly of great value to the 25 to 35 percent of

UNC faculty who opt for phased over full retirement. The biggest payoff to the university is an

increase in the odds that low-performing faculty will start the retirement process earlier. Universities

also anticipate increased flexibility in managing faculty employment and compensation; phased

retirement is most likely to be observed on campuses where a high percentage of faculty has tenure.

       Higher education faces a unique challenge in the coming years as faculty

who are members of the baby boom generation near retirement. There will be

one set of problems if the most senior faculty stay on too long and there will be a

different set of problems if they all leave at once. With the elimination of

mandatory retirement in 1994, universities and colleges are concerned about the

possibility that many faculty will remain on the job past age 70. There are fears

that this will have adverse consequences for teaching and research productivity

and will lead to higher tuition to cover salaries and benefits. At the same time

there is concern on many campuses that the age distribution of faculty is so

heavily skewed toward the 50-and-over range that universities will face shortages

in many fields by the end of this decade.

       From a faculty perspective, there are serious challenges as well. Some

faculty work longer than they would prefer simply because they are not yet

eligible for full pension and Social Security benefits. The tenure system generally

does not permit part-time work, making it difficult for older faculty to cut back on

their work hours as they near retirement. In the private sector, many older

workers take bridge jobs as they transition from full-time work into retirement.

Although some faculty members have good options off campus, those in many

disciplines will have difficulty finding opportunities to apply the teaching and

research skills valued in academe to other types of work.

       Phased retirement has been introduced on many campuses to help deal

with these challenges. Under most phased retirement plans, faculty members

resign their full-time position (and often give up tenure) in return for the right to




                                                                                        1
work half-time at half-salary for a given number of years. This paper examines

how phased retirement creates value for both the university and the individual

faculty member. The analysis begins in Section I with a summary of the

theoretical arguments about how phased retirement should be able to help both

sides of the academic labor market. The paper then turns to empirical evidence

that sheds light on why universities and colleges offer phased retirement and why

certain faculty accept it (and why others do not). To obtain some insights into

the motivation for phased retirement, Section II analyzes the odds that a college

or university will have a phased retirement policy. Are research universities more

likely to offer phased retirement than four-year or two-year institutions? Are the

odds of offering phased retirement linked to the age distribution of faculty?

Section III is a detailed case study of the experience of the University of North

Carolina (UNC) system with phased retirement. The discussion shows how

many faculty opted for phased retirement, analyzes whether it accelerates or

postpones full retirement, and summarizes evidence on its overall effectiveness

from the perspectives of both faculty and management. Section IV concludes by

summarizing which of the theoretical sources of value have been most important

in practice.



I.     SOURCES OF VALUE

       Absent a phased retirement plan, tenured university professors have

relatively few options for reducing their contracted work hours in the years before

they retire. The tenure system at most universities does not allow for part-time




                                                                                     2
work on campus. Faculty can resign and contract to work for the university part-

time, but such contracts are usually for no more than one year and, in a world

where non-tenure track instructors provide teaching services at low cost, the

financial terms of such contracts are often unattractive. Faculty with the capacity

to consult or do research for the private sector or government could have

attractive part-time opportunities off campus, but such opportunities may be

extremely limited in some academic disciplines. Finally, even in today’s wired

labor market, jobs off-campus usually do not pop up after a few mouse clicks –

search and negotiation costs have to be factored into any decision about whether

seeking a part-time position is worth the effort.

       Given these constraints, consider a phased retirement contract that allows

a faculty member who has met certain age and years of service criteria to work

half-time at half-salary. The value of such a contract is readily apparent for

faculty who have greater earnings potential on campus than off. In purely

financial terms, the promise to pay half a salary for part-time work is equivalent to

an option to sell one’s labor back to the university at that price. In the absence of

phased retirement, faculty would have to either (1) negotiate on their own with

department heads and deans when they retire to secure a commitment for part-

time work or (2) look for work off-campus. To see the value of the phased

retirement option, compare the hourly rate under each of these two choices to

the hourly rate that faculty receive while working (which they also would receive

under phased retirement). The financial option created by phased retirement will

have no economic value for faculty who expect that they can negotiate a better




                                                                                    3
deal on their own with either the university or an off-campus organization.

However, if the hourly rate on campus dominates the other two alternatives, then

phased retirement provides greater earnings potential for individual faculty

members.

       In some situations, phased retirement will enable professors to earn more

income while working fewer hours. This happens whenever the sum of one-half

of the academic salary and all pension income exceeds the regular academic

salary (or equivalently, if pension income exceeds one-half the academic salary).

The ability to make more money and work less will be highly tempting to many,

but such a combination does not automatically predict movement into phased

retirement. When faculty near the age of eligibility for partial or full benefits under

Social Security or a defined benefit pension, there is a tremendous incentive to

work an extra year because annuity income increases considerably at those

ages. In such a situation, there is an economic logic behind working full-time one

more year, even if it means less income and more work than phased retirement.

       Faculty covered by defined contribution pensions face considerable

uncertainty about their pension income because the value of their pension hinges

on outcomes in financial markets. Someone who fears that the value of the

assets in his or her retirement account are likely to decline could choose to retire

in order to lock in an annuity on favorable terms. Eligibility to receive pension

income is generally tied to severance from the university. Phased retirement

allows faculty to start receiving pension income while continuing to work, thereby




                                                                                     4
allowing them to make their labor supply and annuity receipt decisions with a

greater degree of independence.

       This discussion has emphasized financial benefits from phased

retirement, but given the unique nature of academic labor markets, such a

narrow focus would lead one to underestimate the true value of phased

retirement for faculty. Most tenured faculty in their 50s and 60s have spent

virtually their entire life in school. Phased retirement gives them extra time to

collect information about retirement opportunities and potential bridge jobs

outside academe before they exit the university. The psychological benefits of

phased retirement will likely be substantial in many cases -- faculty receive

access to colleagues and academic resources, the opportunity to continue to

contribute in the classroom and in research, and the ability to still call themselves

members of the faculty.

       Even if phased retirement is a great deal for faculty, why should a

university consider offering such a benefit? Half pay for half work may sound like

a wash at first, but phased retirees will expect to continue to receive employee

benefits, especially health insurance, along with their half-salary. So unless

phased retirement can reduce labor costs along some other dimension or

improve professor performance, one must question whether it has any value to

universities.

       The first question university chancellors and presidents should ask is what

happens to faculty retirement rates? Phased retirement makes bridge jobs

outside the university less attractive, leading faculty members seeking to reduce




                                                                                    5
work hours to stay with the university longer than they might have otherwise.

However, it also creates an option for part-time work on campus where none

previously existed, which will lead some faculty to enter phased retirement well

before the time they would have fully retired. The one unambiguous effect of

phased retirement is that it accelerates the date at which faculty start to cut back

on their commitments to the university. It also is conceivable that under phased

retirement they will stay on campus more years than they would have otherwise.

For instance, a professor who might have fully retired at age 65 might choose to

enter phased retirement at age 62 and work until age 67. Economic theory

cannot predict whether the introduction of a phased retirement program will

accelerate or decelerate the rate at which faculty totally sever their ties to the

university. One would expect that faculty who have the option of phased

retirement would start the retirement process earlier than those who do not have

that option.

       The second big question university leaders should ask is how will a

phased retirement program affect the productivity mix of the faculty? The

nightmare scenario is where top researchers use phased retirement as an

opportunity to start a new business or an affiliation with another campus. The

preferred scenario is where phased retirement gives unproductive faculty who

have become jaded with academe but who are not yet eligible for full pension

benefits a chance to exit gracefully. Phased retirement is most attractive to (1)

faculty with the worst earnings opportunities off campus and (2) faculty who are

least likely to be able to negotiate for themselves a satisfactory part-time salary




                                                                                      6
on campus after regular retirement. Assuming a positive correlation between

productivity on campus and either a negotiated part-time wage on campus or the

best wage opportunity off campus, this would imply that unproductive faculty

would be more likely to enter phased retirement than highly productive faculty.

       Given the manpower planning challenges facing university leaders that

were noted in the introduction, phased retirement also will create value if it leads

to improved personnel planning and economizes on adjustment costs associated

with new hires and retirements. Under a formal phased retirement program,

professors announce their intention to leave typically between two to five years in

advance, a much longer time horizon than would be involved under regular

retirement. This should improve succession planning and thereby reduce the

odds of having unfilled positions or the likelihood of resorting to early retirement

buyouts or layoffs. If provosts and deans decide to use the half-salary saved by

phased retirement on non-tenure track instructors, there is the possibility of

simple cost reduction as well.1



II.    WHO OFFERS PHASED RETIREMENT AND WHY?

       The most comprehensive source of information about phased retirement

plans in higher education is the Survey of Changes in Faculty Retirement

Policies (SCFRP), conducted in 2000 by the American Association of University
1
 Leslie and Janson (2004) offer a different perspective for the motivation of
universities that offer phased retirement. Based on a series of interviews at
different campuses, they conclude that universities start phased retirement
because it “humanizes employee relations.” They conclude that most of the
benefits from phased retirement accrue to the individual faculty member,
whereas the benefits to the institution appear less certain.


                                                                                       7
Professors with financial support from the TIAA-CREF Institute. The survey

examined U.S. institutions of higher learning in all five Carnegie categories with

75 or more full-time faculty members. At the time of the survey, 27 percent of the

responding institutions had a phased retirement program in place.2 These

programs had the following characteristics:

    •   Faculty in most programs (64 percent) must obtain administrative approval

        to participate.

    •   Most programs require faculty to reach minimum levels of age (75

        percent) and years of service (73 percent) to be eligible for phased

        retirement. The modal age requirement is 55, but some programs are

        open to 50-year-olds whereas many others require participants to be at

        least 60. Programs typically require 10 or more years of service to be

        eligible.

    •   A minority of programs (21 percent) put a ceiling on age of eligibility, in

        most cases 62 or higher.

    •   Roughly two-thirds of the programs provide special financial benefits. In

        most cases the special benefit is full contribution to health insurance,

        although some institutions provide extra salary payments or extra

        retirement payments or credits.

    •   Most plans (60 percent) do not require professors to relinquish tenure

        before they enter phased retirement. Faculty members generally must

        lose their tenured status after three or five years in phased retirement.

2
 Ehrenberg (2003) summarizes the key features of the programs that were in
place at that time.


                                                                                      8
       One way to potentially better understand the motivation behind phased

retirement plans is to compare the characteristics of universities which offer such

plans to those which do not. It is reasonable to expect that the value of phased

retirement to the institution should be a function of its mission. Doctoral

institutions must be especially sensitive to the orderly replacement of aging

faculty to be competitive for graduate students and research contracts.

Presuming that phased retirement polices provide improved capacity to make

long run plans for staffing, one would expect doctoral universities to be more

likely to adopt such policies. In contrast, universities and colleges that focus on

teaching, especially baccalaureate and 2-year institutions, have more flexibility in

how they replace aging faculty members and thus may not value phased

retirement as much. These patterns are borne out in the SCFRP data, as shown

in Table 1. Phased retirement programs are most commonly observed among

doctoral universities (35 percent). The percentage of masters and baccalaureate

institutions with phased retirement plans is slightly lower (29 percent), whereas

the percentage of two-year institutions is considerably lower (16 percent).

       The age and tenure structure of the faculty also should have some bearing

on the value of phased retirement to the institution. Colleges and universities

with a high percentage of faculty who are near retirement have much more to

gain from successfully managing the transition to retirement than those with

relatively fewer faculty in their 50s and 60s. There is no systematic relationship

between the age structure of the faculty and the adoption of phased retirement

policies across the campuses in the SCFRP sample (Table 1). Phased




                                                                                      9
retirement policies are most prevalent among schools with 30 to 39 percent of

faculty in the 55-and-over age bracket and least prevalent among schools with

fewer than 30 percent of faculty in this age bracket, as expected. However,

phased retirement policies are least common among schools with 40 percent or

more of faculty in this age bracket, which runs contrary to expectations.

       Holding age structure constant, tenure has an obviously large impact on

the degrees of freedom the institution has available to manage an aging

workforce. Institutions with a high percentage of tenured faculty have much less

flexibility than those with relatively low percentages of tenured faculty. To the

extent that tenured faculties are also highly compensated faculties, phased

retirement plans also generate greater opportunities for cost savings.

Empirically, there appears to be a strong relationship between the percentage of

full-time faculty with tenure and the adoption of phased retirement policies. Table

1 shows that the percentage of schools with phased retirement steadily increases

with the percentage of full-time faculty with tenure. Phased retirement policies

are in place at only 16.5 percent of the schools where less than 40 percent of the

faculty have tenure. In contrast, phased retirement is available at 25.3 percent of

the schools where the tenure ratio is 40 to 49 percent, at 30.2 percent of the

schools where the tenure ratio is 50 to 69 percent, and 33.7 percent of the

schools where the tenure ratio is 70 percent or higher.

       The fit between a phased retirement plan and the pension plan must be

assessed carefully. Defined benefit plans are a poor fit with phased retirement

for two reasons. First, the pension payment under defined benefit plans is a




                                                                                    10
function of final average salary, which means that a move to a half-time job on

campus is also a move to as much as a 50 percent cut in one’s pension (unless

the retiree can start receiving the annuity upon entering phased retirement or a

special exemption for phased retirees can be created in the benefit formula).

Second, the formulas for most defined benefit plans are set up in such a way that

the present value of the pension annuity is maximized at the time the individual

becomes eligible for full retirement benefits. The pension-based incentives

facing these individuals for retirement are extremely powerful and are likely to

reduce the value of retirement-management policies to the university. Phased

retirement plans are likely to be a better fit on campuses with defined contribution

plans because they offer managers a mechanism to productively influence

retirement decisions. The data in Table 1 show a strong relationship between

type of pension plan and the adoption of phased retirement plans. Phased

retirement is available at 38 percent of schools which exclusively have a defined

contribution plan, versus 19 percent of schools which exclusively have a defined

benefit plan.

       Private colleges and universities are likely to have more degrees of

freedom to adopt phased retirement plans than their public counterparts. Public

colleges and universities tend to be less autonomous, facing some degree of

oversight from state government. In some states, public institutions are part of a

statewide system, which would have mixed effects on the odds of adopting a

phased retirement plan. On the one hand, there would be greater transactions

costs associated with adopting a new policy in a statewide system than a single




                                                                                   11
campus. On the other hand, a successful launch of a statewide plan would lead

to earlier adoption on campuses that left on their own would not have adopted a

plan. Further, private schools may have such an advantage in dealing one-on-

one with individual faculty about their compensation and workloads that they may

have little need for a phased retirement policy. In the SCFRP data in Table 1,

there is very little difference in the odds of having a phased retirement plan

between public and private institutions.3

       The adoption of phased retirement policies is also likely to reflect the

management style of the organization. Institutions that have decided to take

active steps to manage the age structure of their faculty are likely to consider a

variety of steps, rather than focus on a single policy. If true, one would expect

campuses that have phased retirement policies to also have taken other steps,

including seminars on retirement planning, financial incentives for early

retirement, and targeted buyouts. These patterns are born out in the SCFRP

data, as shown in Table 1. Phased retirement plans are available in 29.2 percent

of the schools that offer retirement planning seminars or programs, in contrast to

11.6 percent of schools that do not offer such programs. Phased retirement

policies are in place in 31.9 percent of the schools that offered financial

incentives for retirement since 1995, versus 22.7 percent of the schools that did

not offer such incentives. Phased retirement is available at 32 percent of the

schools that offered buyouts to faculty since 1995 (either on a college-by-college

private university (Syracuse) adopted its phased retirement plan.


                                                                                     12
or case-by-case basis), in contrast to 24 percent of the schools that did not offer

buyouts.

       The simple comparisons made in Table 1 could be misleading. For

instance, it is well known that the tenure ratio is much lower at baccalaureate and

two-year schools than at doctoral and masters level institutions. Probit analysis

is a tool that can be used to control for additional variables. It is very much like

much like multiple regression analysis, except that is designed for situations

where the dependent variable (odds of having a phased retirement program) is

measured in binary categories (either you have a phased retirement plan or you

do not have one). Table 2 reports the results of a probit analysis of the odds that

a campus will have a phased retirement plan, using the variables from Table 1

along with number of full-time faculty. The number of full-time faculty is included

in the analysis to determine whether there are economies of scale involved with

developing and implementing phased retirement plans. If the costs of developing

a phased retirement plan increase less rapidly with size than the benefits, one

would expect that small schools would be less willing than large schools to adopt

the plans.

       In the probit analysis, three variables stand out as significant predictors of

the odds that a campus will have a phased retirement plan. Institutions that

exclusively offer a defined contribution plan have a 23 to 24 percentage point

greater probability of offering phased retirement than schools that offer defined

benefit plans. This reflects both the poor fit between defined benefit plans and

phased retirement policies as well as the possible use of phased retirement for




                                                                                       13
strategic human resource management on campuses that only offer defined

contribution plans.4

       Schools with a large percentage of tenured faculty are much more likely to

have phased retirement plans than schools with a relatively small percentage of

tenured faculty. At the extreme, a school where all faculty have tenure would

have a 38 to 40 percent greater chance of having a phased retirement plan than

a school where none have tenure. Percentage of faculty with tenure is strongly

correlated with Carnegie categorization, so the analysis was repeated by

estimating separate probit models for each Carnegie class (these results are not

reported in Table 2; they are available from the author upon request). The

decrease in sample size makes these results more fragile, but percentage

tenured was still statistically significant at or near the p=0.10 threshold in all

levels of institutions except two-year institutions without faculty ranks. Note that

whereas there is a significant relationship between the odds of offering phased

retirement and percentage of faculty with tenure, there is no relationship between

the odds of offering phased retirement and Carnegie class once one controls for

percentage of faculty with tenure.5

       Phased retirement plans are much more likely to be in place on campuses

which followed a management strategy of actively managing faculty retirement.

4
  Pencavel (2004) finds the same thing. His model differs in that phased
retirement and other retirement policies are jointly determined, which leads him
to use a different set of control variables.
5
  This can be easily explained by the strong correlation between Carnegie class
and the tenure ratio. In Carnegie I institutions, if one takes simple unweighted
averages across schools, 64 percent of faculty have tenure in the average
school. This falls off to 54 percent in IIA, 46 percent in IIB, 45 percent in III, and
32 percent in IV.


                                                                                     14
Schools that have offered retirement planning seminars are 12 percent more

likely to have phased retirement plans than schools that have not offered such

seminars. Schools that have offered financial incentives for retirement before

age 70 are 10 percent more likely to have phased retirement plans than schools

that have not offered such incentives. There is no significant relationship

between buyouts by college or individual and the odds of having a phased

retirement plan. Public institutions have a 10 percentage point greater probability

of having a phased retirement plan than private institutions. This effect is

statistically significant at the 6 to 10 percent level, a bit below the standard

threshold used in social science.

       There was no evidence in the probit analysis of economies of scale in the

offering of phased retirement plans. There also was no relationship between the

age structure of the faculty and the odds of having a phased retirement plan.

This conclusion was robust across a number of other measures of age structure

(e.g., percentage above 60, percentage below 50).

       To sum up, this discussion shows that phased retirement plans have not

been cropping up on a random basis. There is clear evidence that campus

leaders have carefully considered preexisting conditions such as type of

retirement plan and the percentage of the faculty with tenure. The fact that

campuses with a high percentage of faculty members with tenure are most likely

to have phased retirement plans (as well as retirement planning seminars and

offers of financial incentives for retirement)6 implies that phased retirement is

 The percentage of faculty with tenure is 51.5 percent at schools with retirement
planning workshops, versus 43.5 percent at schools without such workshops.


                                                                                    15
being viewed as a tool to give management more flexibility to manage a difficult-

to-manage workforce.



III.      PHASED RETIREMENT IN THE UNC SYSTEM

          The percentage of faculty in the UNC system who are age 50 or higher

has increased considerably in the 1980s and 1990s, following national trends.7

In 1996 UNC President C.D. Spangler appointed a committee to study the

possible need for early retirement programs. Because the university system was

predicted to add 40,000 students in the first decade of the 2000s, the committee

concluded that there was no need for an early-retirement program designed to

reduce the number of faculty members above a given age threshold. Instead,

they recommended that the UNC system consider a phased retirement program

that would moderate the aging of the faculty without increasing costs.

          The Board of Governors of the UNC system approved a five-year trial

program in 1998 that permitted half-time work for half the final academic salary.

No special payments or subsidies were provided for selection into the program.

The purpose of the program was “to promote renewal of the professoriate in

order to ensure institutional vitality and to provide additional flexibility and support

for individual faculty members who are nearing retirement” (UNC Policy Manual,

300.7.2.1 [G]). The program had three major goals:

       1. Better personnel planning – institutions will be able to better anticipate

          position openings and make replacement plans

The tenure ratio is 52.6 percent on campuses that have offered financial
incentives, versus 48.2 percent on schools that have not offered such incentives.

    2. Enhanced recruitment and retention – an additional benefit to faculty

       should help in this regard

    3. Increased quality of faculty – institutions will be able to fill faculty positions

       while retaining the skills and knowledge of experienced faculty

       Each of the 15 campuses in the UNC system that grant tenure was

required to implement a phased retirement program.8 To be eligible for the

program, faculty must be tenured. When the program was launched, faculty also

had to be age 50 with 20 years of service or age 60 with 5 years of service at the

same institution. The criteria are now 50 years of age with 5 years of service at

the current institution. Each campus was allowed to select the length of the

contract for its faculty; however, the program required a minimum length of one

year and a maximum length of five years. Twelve of the 15 institutions chose a

three-year phased retirement contract, two institutions chose a two-year contract,

and one campus chose a five-year phased retirement contract. Although

launched as a five-year pilot, the program is now permanently in place.

       Individuals considering entering the program negotiate their half-time

duties with their department chairs prior to accepting phased retirement. Duties

could be performed evenly across both semesters or the individual could work

full-time one semester and have no specific assigned duties the next semester.

They may elect to start receiving pension benefits after entering phased

retirement. If they begin their retirement benefits, they are eligible for the same

health insurance as active employees. Since 1971, newly hired faculty in the

UNC system had the ability to choose between the defined benefit plan designed

for teachers and state employees or a variety of defined contribution plans.

Faculty hired in earlier years are covered by the defined benefit plan.

       Robert Clark, Linda Ghent and I have studied the phased retirement plan

of the UNC system using the annual faculty censuses that each campus submits

to the Office of the President. These are the employment records for all faculty

employed as of September of the specified year. Information on each person

includes age, hire date, rank, gender, race, tenure status, annual salary, and type

of pension plan. The annual records are linked across years so we are able to

determine whether an individual remains in his or her faculty position from one

year to the next. The census data for the years 1994 until 2003 are employed in

this study. The analysis is limited to faculty members who were eligible to enter

the phased retirement program. This paper briefly summarizes the key findings

of our earlier papers and then reports new evidence on the experience faculty

and department heads have had with phased retirement.

       In the three years prior to the introduction of phased retirement, the

retirement rate from UNC institutions among eligible faculty age 50 averaged 8.7

percent (see Table 3). After the introduction of the new retirement program, the

total retirement rate (full retirement plus phased retirement) increased to 10.4

percent in 1997-98, 11.3 percent in 1998-99, and 10.4 percent in 1999-20009.

The percentage of faculty selecting phased retirement was 3.2 in 1997-98, 2.3 in

1998-99, and 3.0 in 1999-2000. The full retirement rates were 7.2 percent in

                                                                                   18
1997-98, 9.0 percent in 1998-99, and 7.4 percent in 1999-2000. During these

years, phased retirees represented between 20 and 31 percent of all retirements

from the UNC system. In absolute numbers, about 70 faculty entered the phased

retirement program each year while around 225 fully retired.

       The percentage of faculty entering full and phased retirement began to

decline in 2000-01, which is the same time that the stock market began to drop.

From 1999-2000 to 2002-03 the full retirement rate had fallen by more than half

to 3.3 percent. Over the same period, the phased retirement rate had fallen by a

third to 2.0 percent. In the 2000s, phased retirement accounted for 35 percent of

total retirement. In absolute numbers, 71 faculty entered the phased retirement

each year in the 2000s while 130 fully retired.

       Table 4 shows how phased and full retirement rates vary by age in the

1990s. In most years, the full retirement rate increases steadily with age, a

pattern consistent with previous research. A similar pattern holds for phased

retirement in 1997-98, with more faculty age 70 and over selecting phased

retirement than full retirement. In 1998-99 and 1999-2000, the phased retirement

rate rises with age through the early to mid-60s, but then declines. In all

likelihood the very large response of the 70 and over group in 1997-98 reflects a

constrained demand for phased retirement at the time it was implemented.

       Ghent, Allen, and Clark (2001) and Allen, Clark, and Ghent (2003)

conducted an analysis of how those entering phased retirement differed from

those who continued working full-time and those who entered full retirement.




                                                                                19
The following are the key findings of those two studies regarding the

characteristics of those most likely to enter phased retirement:

      •   Those entering phased retirement were much more likely to be

          employed at masters and baccalaureate universities than at doctoral

          universities. This may reflect differences in teaching loads and a

          tendency to focus on teaching loads in negotiating duties under

          phased retirement. Faculty who teach eight courses a year can buy a

          lot more free time by going half-time than faculty who teach four

          courses a year. It is also possible that faculty on the doctoral

          campuses (NC State and UNC-Chapel Hill) have more opportunities

          for bridge jobs off campus.

      •   Faculty who are covered by the defined benefit plan are much more

          likely to enter phased retirement than those who selected defined

          contribution plans. This likely reflects the strong incentives to retire at

          the age of eligibility for full pension benefits, and may be influenced by

          Social Security as well. Reduced earnings during phased retirement

          do not adversely affect retirement benefits for faculty who elected the

          defined benefit plan.

      •   The odds of entering phased retirement by age map closely to the

          odds of entering full retirement by age; in both cases, there is are

          significant upswings in retirement odds at ages 62 and 65.




                                                                                    20
Faculty perspectives

       Why do faculty enter phased retirement? The Office of the President of

the UNC system conducted surveys of faculty in phased retirement in 1998 and

2003 to address this question. The reason given by most faculty (60 percent in

the 1998 survey and 69 percent in the 2003 survey) is that they wanted to

“gradually transition into retirement.” Very few planned to “pursue other

employment” (6 percent in 1998 and 1 percent in 2003), whereas a modest share

planned to “pursue other interests” (18 percent in 1998 and 9 percent in 2003).

The remainder cited other factors, including health, changing university policies

(including post-tenure review), and inability to afford full retirement.

       More insight can be obtained when one looks at how faculty entering

phased retirement changed their allocation of time to university and other

activities. Table 5 summarizes how faculty changed their on-campus workloads

after entering phased retirement. The average number of courses taught per

year dropped by 44 percent from 4.3 to 2.4. In most individual cases, faculty

loads dropped by exactly 50 percent, but a few faculty had equal or even greater

teaching loads, either because they were leaving administrative posts or because

they cut back on time for research and service. Most faculty (60 percent) worked

at the university both academic semesters.

       Going beyond teaching, the biggest change in time allocation on campus

involved a significant cutback on administrative activities. Among the 2003

phased retirees who responded to the survey, 32 percent had an administrative

appointment. Across the entire sample, time allocated to administration fell from




                                                                                    21
24 percent on a full-time basis before phased retirement to 10 percent on a part-

time basis after phased retirement. Faculty spent about the same percentage of

their time on public service and extension activities before and after entering

phased retirement. There was a slight increase in the percentage of time

allocated to research, but total time allocated to research dropped significantly

(28 percent of time on a full-time basis to 30 percent of time on a part-time

basis).

          With their on-campus workload reduced by 50 percent, how do faculty

reallocate their time? Roughly two-thirds of the sample (67.7 percent) report

spending more time in activities with friends, family, and community. A

substantial share (42.7 percent) report spending more time “engaged in research

or other creative or scholarly activities,” spending 16.9 hours per week on such

activities. Exactly one-third of the sample report spending more time on

volunteer activities and family assistance, spending 7 hours a week. Only 22

percent report spending more time working for pay away off-campus (including

self-employment) and these individuals spend 11.5 hours per week working.

Phased retirees also spent more time on civic activities, taking classes, travel,

and health care.

          Faculty almost always begin receiving pension benefits upon entering

phased retirement. In the 1998 survey, all faculty entering phased retirement

started receiving benefits, whereas in 2003, 90.5 percent started receiving

benefits. The decision to start receiving Social Security as well largely depends

on age. In the 2003 survey, 42 percent started receiving Social Security and




                                                                                    22
those individuals were considerably older (68.7 years) than those who postponed

Social Security or were ineligible (62.4 years).

       In the 2003 survey, faculty were asked to estimate what percentage of

their earnings in their last year of university employment was replaced by

pension benefits (excluding Social Security). There was no small amount of

noise in the responses, including a value of zero for a person who claimed to be

in the defined benefit pension plan with 30 or more years of service. The raw

mean response was a replacement rate of 39.2 percent. If one trims all cases

from the sample where the estimated percentage was below five (almost all of

which claim 25 years or more of service), the mean replacement rate becomes

46.0 percent.

       Faculty in phased retirement came fairly close to maintaining their total

level of income. For the average respondent in the 2003 survey, combined

income from pensions, Social Security, and phased retirement equaled 90

percent of university earnings before entering phased retirement. Almost half (42

of 86 respondents) reported that they had replaced 100 percent or more of their

income. The overwhelming majority (95 percent) said that their combined

income was about what they expected before entering phased retirement.

       With nearly the same income and a 50 percent reduction in work hours,

one would expect most faculty entering phased retirement to be very satisfied

with the arrangement. In 1998, 80 percent said they were pleased with phased

retirement, 17 percent said they were somewhat pleased, and 3 percent said

they were not pleased.




                                                                                   23
In 2003, 60 percent strongly agreed that they were “pleased with my participation

in the Phased Retirement Program and would make the same decision again,”

33 percent agreed, 6 percent disagreed, and 1 percent strongly disagreed. In

1998, 89.7 percent said they would recommend the phased retirement program

to their colleagues. In 2003, 59 percent strongly agreed that they “would

recommend the Phased Retirement Program to my colleagues,” 30 percent

agreed, 6 percent disagreed, and 5 percent strongly disagreed.

       Despite high overall levels of satisfaction, some areas of contention were

revealed in the 2003 survey. One set of comments focused on the loss of on-

campus amenities, including a private office, access to parking, and ability to

teach summer school. Others reflected a desire to continue in phased retirement

over a longer time period (usually five years instead of three). Issues concerning

health care coverage (including a plan that enabled employees to use pretax

income to pay for healthcare) were raised by about 10 percent of the sample.

Lastly, a few individuals seemed to have problems adjusting to a world in which

they were no longer full-time faculty, as reflected by comments such as “It's the

same thing as committing suicide” and “You will be taken advantage of

constantly and consistently.”

       Faculty currently working in the UNC system that are age 50 or above

have a strong interest in pursuing phased retirement in the future. In a separate

survey conducted in fall 2003, 36 percent of those responding said that they

planned to enter phased retirement. This matches almost exactly with the ratio




                                                                                    24
of retiring faculty who entered phased retirement (as opposed to full retirement)

so far in the 2000s.

Managerial perspective

       The most basic question for top management in academe is whether

phased retirement makes faculty leave earlier or stay longer. Table 3 showed

an increase in the rate at which faculty left full-time employment after the

introduction of phased retirement. With 2.8 percent of faculty entering phased

retirement and a decline in the full retirement rate of 0.8 percent in the 1990s,

one might reasonably infer that most of the people entering phased retirement

would have continued working if the option had not been available. Ghent, Allen,

and Clark (2001) examined this issue more rigorously using a probit analysis of

data for the two years before and after the introduction of phased retirement.

They rejected the hypothesis that there was a stable model that could explain

both forms of retirement over this four-year period. In other words, the

characteristics that predict entry into full retirement in 1995-97 do not predict

entry into full and phased retirement in 1997-99. Ghent et al could not reject the

hypothesis that there was a stable model of full retirement over the same period.

Equivalently, the characteristics that predict entry into full retirement in 1995-97

predict entry into full retirement equally well in 1997-99. These results imply that

phased retirees more closely resemble full-time workers than fully retired

individuals.

       With the 2003 survey of phased retirees, a more straightforward approach

can be employed – simply ask the phased retirees what they would have done if




                                                                                       25
the plan had not been available. When asked if they had not chosen to enter

phased retirement, the overwhelming majority (84 percent) said they would have

continued to work full-time. Phased retirees say they would have worked an

average of 3.6 more years if the program had not been available. On campuses

where the phased retirement contract lasts three years, phased retirees say they

would have worked full-time for 3.5 more years, versus 4.2 more years of full-

time work on campuses where phased retirement contracts are five years.

       One further consideration from a management standpoint is that not all

phased retirees work part-time for the maximum time allowed. In the 2003

survey, 11 percent say they intend to fully retire before the end of their contract.

Data on the actual duration of phased retirements are not available at this time.

       Looking across all the evidence assembled, it is quite clear that phased

retirement leads faculty to cut back on their workload well before the time they

would have fully retired. To determine whether this is beneficial to the university,

one must consider how this decreased contribution by senior faculty affects

productivity and cost.

       Allen, Clark, and Ghent (2003) explored the productivity issue by

examining how two different measures of productivity were related to the relative

odds of full retirement, phased retirement and continued full-time work. The first

measure is the average pay increase received in the three previous years. This

is the most logical proxy measure for performance in the late 1990s because

faculty pay raises were based entirely on merit during that period. The other

measure is academic rank. Among tenured faculty in a relatively senior age and




                                                                                    26
tenure bracket, full professors have been judged by their peers, department

heads, and deans as more productive than associate or assistant professors.

      The introduction of phased retirement increased the rate at which low

performing faculty separated from the university. Consider two otherwise

identical professors, one who received an average pay raise of eight percent and

one who received an average pay raise of zero (the mean pay raise was 4

percent with a standard deviation of 4 percent, so this is not an unreasonable

spread in the last half of the 1990s). Before phased retirement was introduced,

there was a 6.0 percent chance that a professor receiving eight percent raises

would retire. After the launch of phased retirement, the odds changed to a 5.9

percent chance of full retirement and a 1.7 percent chance of phased retirement,

for a combined increase in retirement odds of 1.6 percent. Compare this to the

case of a professor receiving no raises. Before phased retirement was available,

this professor had a 12.0 percent chance of full retirement. After phased

retirement the full retirement odds increased to 10.3 percent and the phased

retirement odds were 4.3 percent, an overall retirement rate of 14.6 percent, an

increase of 2.6 percent. Retirement probabilities went up for both, but they went

up more for the least productive professors. There was a similar pattern in the

change of retirement odds for full, associate and assistant professors.

      The response of faculty to the introduction of phased retirement varied

with the mission of the institution. Phased retirement generated a much greater

response on campuses where the main mission is teaching than where the

mission also included research. Allen, Clark, and Ghent (2003) found, controlling




                                                                                   27
for other factors, a phased retirement rate of 1.6 percent on the two Research I

campuses. This is much higher than the rates elsewhere: 4.0 percent on

doctoral campuses, 3.9 percent on masters campuses and 3.2 percent on

baccalaureate campuses. This likely reflects the fact that phased retirement

provides a greater increase in free time on campuses with heavy teaching loads.

Full retirement rates also are lower in research-oriented than teaching-oriented

campuses, possibly reflecting the greater concentration of PhDs who need to

work additional years to fully leverage their investment in human capital.

       What impact does phased retirement have on an academic department?

So far the analysis points to earlier exits of faculty who are past their prime. But

at the micro level of an academic school, college, or department, the full answer

depends upon how many faculty elect to enter phased retirement, how much of

their salary line gets returned to the unit, and how difficult these faculty are to

replace. With only two to three percent of eligible faculty electing to enter phased

retirement in any year, most units are likely to have no more than one or two

persons on phased retirement at any point in time. When only one person in the

unit enters phased retirement, the savings of half a salary generally is not

enough to fund a new position -- and of course there is no guarantee that the

salary savings will be returned to the unit. Looking across a school or college,

deans have the opportunity to fund new hires in some departments, creating the

opportunity for growth and renewal.

       Even when funds are returned to the department, close substitutes for the

services provided by tenured faculty are not always readily available. Some




                                                                                      28
campuses are located far away from metropolitan areas and have relatively few

options for adjunct or part-time faculty. Substitutes are more likely to be

available for faculty teaching courses taken by freshmen and sophomores than

for courses taken by upperclassmen and graduate students. Adjunct faculty can

help on the teaching dimension, but are unlikely to contribute to research and

departmental service. The faculty survey indicated that time allocated to

research declined by half. Time allocated to departmental service was not

directly addressed in the faculty survey, but it is difficult to imagine that faculty in

phased retirement would play as active a role as when they were working full-

time. Presuming the service workload stays the same for the department, this

means more work for everyone else.

       To address these issues, the Office of the President of the University of

North Carolina system conducted a survey of deans and department heads in the

1999-2000 academic year to learn about the impact of the phased retirement

plan on each campus. The number of responses relative to the number of

colleges and departments varied significantly across each campus, ranging from

two at UNC-Charlotte to 42 at East Carolina University. At the two largest

campuses (which have the most academic programs and departments), there

were only ten responses at UNC-Chapel Hill and 38 at NC State. Because of

this variation in responses across campuses, the survey results do a better job of

highlighting issues than of measuring impact.

       A total of 231 departments and colleges responded to the survey, of which

107 departments or colleges reported that faculty from their unit had entered




                                                                                      29
phased retirement. Across all campuses, 57 percent of the deans and

department heads who had phased retirees reported that some of the salary

savings were made available to their unit. This percentage varied widely across

campuses, ranging between 21 and 100 percent. In units which lost a faculty

member and failed to gain any resources, the department head or dean tended

to have an unfavorable view of phased retirement. The issue that came up most

frequently (mentioned on 26 responses) was the loss of resources for the

collective work of the department, especially service on committees and advising

graduate students. Changes in teaching assignments, larger classes, class

cancellations, and greater use of non-tenure track faculty were also cited in the

responses. The allocation of office space was another contentious issue (cited in

35 responses), as anyone in academic administration would expect.

      Improved personnel planning is a major goal of the UNC system’s phased

retirement plan. When the survey asked the department heads and deans if “you

believe PRP provides an additional management tool for planning,” 59 percent

responded affirmatively. Although this is quite close to the 57 percent who

received released salary funds, there was no direct relationship across

campuses between the answers to this question and to the odds of receiving

salary release funding. Some department heads gave open-ended explanations

for their response. Most of the comments were favorable and tended to note two

key benefits from phased retirement: (1) it provides the department with more

time to develop a hiring strategy (cited 41 times) and (2) released salary funds

give the department head more degrees of freedom to meet staffing needs (cited




                                                                                    30
19 times). In nine cases, the respondents said that phased retirement

encourages earlier retirement of less productive faculty. The unfavorable

comment that came up most frequently was that phased retirement made

planning more difficult by imposing constraints upon resources and creating

uncertainty about when the position will be fully replaced. Such comments were

most frequently made when the unit did not receive any released salary funding.



IV.    CONCLUSION

       This paper has examined the value created by phased retirement plans for

both faculty members and the university that employs them. From the point of

view of faculty, there are two payoffs from having access to a phased retirement

program: (1) greater opportunities for part-time work on campus, including in

many cases the capacity to earn more income while working fewer hours, and (2)

the ability to make the transition to a new stage of life more gradually than

permitted by the tenure system. Over the period of this study, phased retirees

accounted for between 25 and 35 percent of all retirements, indicating that many

faculty appreciate having more degrees of freedom in transitioning toward

retirement. In the UNC system, the take-up rates for phased retirement were

significantly higher on campuses with the heaviest teaching loads, reflecting the

fact that phased retirement buys more free time in those situations.

       From the perspective of the university, the biggest payoff from adopting a

phased retirement plan is the increased odds that low performing faculty will start

the retirement process earlier. The precise payoff depends on how these




                                                                                 31
individuals are replaced, but there is the opportunity for both cost savings and

intellectual renewal. Cost savings arise from either pocketing the salary release

or from replacing senior faculty with junior faculty or adjuncts. Given the

conditions of excess supply prevailing in most academic labor markets,

particularly among junior faculty, universities should expect to eventually fill these

positions with highly capable new faculty.

       According to a survey of deans and department heads, phased retirement

is a useful tool for planning and management. Universities that have introduced

phased retirement have carefully assessed the fit between this new policy and

their current situation. Schools are much more likely to launch a phased

retirement plan if they have a high percentage of tenured faculty, implying that

the value of an additional management tool is greater in such a situation.

Campuses with defined contribution plans are more likely to have phased

retirement plans than those with defined benefit plans, which is what one would

expect given the difficulties that come up with phased retirement under a defined

benefit plan. However, in the case study of the UNC system, employees who

had chosen to be covered by the defined benefit pension plan had much greater

odds of entering phased retirement than those who had selected a defined

benefit plan. Campuses with defined benefit plans would thus do well to develop

some way to overcome the built-in conflicts between benefit formulas and the

incentives for entering phased retirement, perhaps following the example of the

UNC system. The main challenges associated with the introduction of phased




                                                                                   32
retirement have been at the college or departmental level where administrators

must scramble to find substitutes until the phased retiree becomes fully retired.

       This study has shown that a phased retirement program encourages

faculty to start the transition to full retirement earlier than they would have in the

absence of such a program. More years of data from the UNC system will be

needed to assess whether phased retirees end up entering full retirement sooner

or later than they would have otherwise. The survey data of faculty in phased

retirement suggest that they enter full retirement earlier, but the answer to this

question can be more rigorously ascertained with data on employment patterns

before and after the introduction of phased retirement, including whether those

entering phased retirement stay for the maximum time permitted.

       It would be helpful to learn how phased retirement rates vary by academic

discipline. Accelerated exit rates from academe can be better tolerated in

disciplines with an excess supply of faculty than in those where new faculty are

relatively scarce. The organizational structure of the various universities in the

UNC system varied so much that it was impossible to explore this issue over all

15 campuses, but it would be feasible to conduct within-campus studies at some

of the largest universities.
