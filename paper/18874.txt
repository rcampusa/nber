                                            ABSTRACT

This paper considers the evidence on real commodity prices from 1900 to 2015 for 40 commodities,
representing 8.72 trillion US dollars of production in 2011. In so doing, it suggests and documents
a comprehensive typology of real commodity prices, comprising long-run trends, medium-run cycles,
and short-run boom/bust episodes. The main findings can be summarized as follows: (1) real commodity
prices have been on the rise—albeit modestly—from 1950; (2) there is a pattern—in both past and
present—of commodity price cycles, entailing large and long-lived deviations from underlying trends;
(3) these commodity price cycles are themselves punctuated by boom/bust episodes which are historically
pervasive.

1. Introduction

       Every few decades, the global economy witnesses a protracted and widespread

commodity boom. And in each boom, the common perception is that the world is quickly

running out of key raw materials. The necessary consequence of this demand-induced scarcity is

that economic growth must inexorably grind to a halt. On the other hand, economists are often

quick to counter that such thinking is contradicted by the long-run history of real commodity

prices. Building on an extensive academic and policy literature charting developments in the

price of commodities relative to other goods, this side of the debate holds that the price signals

generated in the wake of a global commodity boom have always been sufficiently strong to

induce a countervailing supply response (cf. Ehrlich, 1968; Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 1990; Moyo,

2012; Sabin, 2013; Simon, 1981, 1996).

       What is missing from this debate is a comprehensive body of evidence on real

commodity prices and a consistently-applied methodology for characterizing their long-run

evolution. To that end, this paper considers the evidence on real commodity prices from 1900 to

2015 for 40 commodities. Individually, these series span a wide range of economically important

commodities. Collectively, they represent a significant proportion of global economic activity.

       This paper also suggests and documents a complete typology of real commodity prices

over the past 115 years. In this framework, real commodity price series are comprised of long-

run trends, medium-run cycles, and short-run boom/bust episodes. As such, there a few key

findings of the paper. First, perceptions of the trajectory of real commodity prices over time are

vitally influenced by how long a period is being considered and by how particular commodities

are weighted when constructing commodity price indices. Applying weights drawn from the

value of production in 1975, real commodity prices are estimated to have increased by 34.20%



                                                                                                     2
from 1950 to 2015. This suggests that much of the conventional wisdom on long-run trends in

real commodity prices may be unduly swayed by events either in the very distant or very recent

past. It also suggests a potentially large, but somewhat underappreciated distinction in between

“commodities to be grown” which have experienced secular declines in real prices versus

“commodities in the ground”—in particular, energy products—which have experienced secular

increases in real prices over the long run.

         Second, there is a consistent pattern of commodity price cycles which entail long-lived

deviations from these underlying trends in both the past and present.1 In this paper as in others it

follows (cf. Cuddington and Jerrett, 2008; Erten and Ocampo, 2013; Jerrett and Cuddington,

2008), commodity price cycles are thought of as comprising medium-run swings in real

commodity prices. These are demand-driven episodes closely linked to historical episodes of

mass industrialization and urbanization which interact with acute capacity constraints in many

product categories—in particular, energy, metals, and minerals—in order to generate above-

trend real commodity prices for years, if not decades, on end. However, once such a demand

shock emerges, there is generally a countervailing supply response as formerly dormant

exploration and extraction activities take off and induced technological change takes hold. Thus,

as capacity constraints are eased, real commodity prices revert back to—and below—trend.2

Significantly, this paper finds that fully 20 of the 40 commodities under consideration are in the

midst of such cycles, demonstrating above-trend real prices starting from 1994 to 1999. The




1
  Here, it is very important to emphasize that the notion of cycles is not meant to evoke a sense of regularity—much
less, predictability—in commodity price dynamics but instead provides us with a convenient means of statistically
characterizing deviations from long-run trends.
2
  In related work, Jacks and Stuermer (2018) consider the dynamic effects of commodity demand shocks,
commodity supply shocks, and storage demand or other commodity-specific demand shocks on real commodity
prices in the long run. There, commodity demand shocks strongly dominate commodity supply shocks in driving
prices and are growing in importance over time.

                                                                                                                   3
common origin of these commodity price cycles in the late 1990s underlines an important theme

of this paper, namely that long-run patterns can be easy to miss if we confuse cycles for trends.

         Third, this paper offers a straightforward methodology for determining real commodity

price booms and busts which punctuate the aforementioned commodity price cycles. These

boom/bust episodes are found to be historically pervasive and, thus, potentially relevant for

commodity-exporting nations. This exercise also underlines one of the key outputs of this paper

in the form of long-run series on commodity-specific price booms and busts which will be of

interest to researchers looking for plausibly exogenous shocks to either domestic economies or

global markets.

         The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 sets out the underlying data while

Section 3 provides the methodology behind and the evidence on long-run trends, medium-run

cycles, and boom/bust episodes in real commodity prices. Section 4 concludes.



2. New Data on Old Prices

         The data used in this study comprise all consistently-defined, long-run annual spot prices

for commodities with at least 5 billion US dollars of production in 2011. Reliable data collection

begins for the majority of price series in 1850 while no price series enters the data set later than

1900. All told, this paper considers the evidence on 40 individual commodity price series which

are drawn from seven product categories—animal products, energy products, grains, metals,

minerals, precious metals, and soft commodities—and which are enumerated in Table 1. As

Table 1 also demonstrates, the series are not only large in number, but also economically

significant representing 8.72 trillion US dollars of production in 2011.3 Finally, the individual


3
  Neglecting energy products, these production values are still in excess of 4.54 trillion USD. Furthermore, there is
likely very little room for sample selection issues in driving the results presented below. In particular, there may be

                                                                                                                          4
price series are expressed in US dollars and deflated by the US CPI underlying Officer (2012),

supplemented by updates taken from the BLS. The choice of the CPI as deflator—although not

entirely uncontroversial—most closely relates to this paper’s theme of assessing the direction of

commodity prices in real terms over the long run.4 However, none of the results presented below

are materially altered by the consideration of alternative measures of economy-wide prices such

as the US GDP deflator, US manufacturing prices, or the US PPI. Finally, an appendix to this

paper details the sources for the individual series.

        Figure 1 abstracts from commodity-specific developments and instead applies three

different sets of weights in the construction of real commodity price indices: shares drawn from

the value of production in 1975, shares drawn from the value of production in 2011, and equal

shares. Relying on the series drawn from the value of production in 2011 is likely unsatisfactory,

in that it puts the most weight on precisely those commodities which ex-post have risen the most.

Likewise, relying on the series drawn from equal weights is somewhat unsatisfactory, in that it

assigns as much as importance to rye with 5.57 billion USD in production in 2011 as petroleum

with 3.16 trillion USD in production in 2011. In what follows, we focus our attention on the

series drawn from the value of production in 1975 which represents a rough compromise

between these two extremes.

        Using weights from the value of production prior to 1975 is problematic for a few facts.

First, reliable data on global production for all commodities is impossible to come by prior to the



concerns about the potential influence of once-important, but now-irrelevant commodities or once-irrelevant, but
now-important commodities which would be ruled out on the basis of the criteria laid out here. For example,
uranium had no wide commercial application until the atomic age and, thus, remains outside of the sample. At the
same time, production of uranium in 2011 was valued at 6.65 billion USD—that is, a mere 0.08% of the current
sample’s cumulative value of production in the same year.
4
  Naturally, to the extent that the quality of commodities has remain unchanged over time, any upward bias in the
US CPI induced by insufficient correction for changes in the quality of other goods over time will lead to a
downward bias in the calculation of increases in real commodity price documented below.

                                                                                                                    5
1960s. Second, and most importantly, the prices of certain key commodities were dictated by

government and industry as opposed to being determined by market forces. The case of gold and

the role of the US Treasury in maintaining its nominal value from 1934 to 1972 is very one well-

known example. A less well-known, but even more important example comes from the actions of

the Texas Railroad Commission in dictating global petroleum prices from the 1930s up to the

first oil shock in 1973 (Yergin, 1991).

         The picture emerging from this exercise is a pattern of potentially rising real commodity

prices from the 1950s.5 However, there is an implicit danger in simply “eyeballing” these series

or comparing the level of real commodity prices in the present with values drawn from the past.

Namely, we run the risk of conflating currently evolving cycles with long-run trends. The

following section lays out the methodology used to decompose real commodity prices into long-

run trend and medium-run cyclical components.



3. Trend-cycle decomposition

         Borrowing from the large body of work in empirical macroeconomics on trend-cycle

decomposition, a burgeoning literature in identifying medium-run commodity price cycles has

recently emerged (cf. Cuddington and Jerrett, 2008; Erten and Ocampo, 2013; Jerrett and

Cuddington, 2008). The common theme of this literature is that commodity price cycles can be



5
  The accompanying chartbook (available at http:www.sfu.ca/~djacks) documents the evolution of real prices on a
commodity-by-commodity basis from 1850 to 2015. Visual inspection of these series reveals the well-known “big
variability” of real commodity prices (Cashin and McDermott, 2002). With respect to long-run trends in the real
commodity price data, there are a few clear patterns across product categories. Notwithstanding some common
global shocks like the peaks in real prices surrounding World War I, the 1970s, and the 2000s as well as the troughs
in the 1930s and 1990s, there is a divergence in between those commodities exhibiting a secular downward trend—
notably, grains and soft commodities—and those exhibiting a secular upward trend—notably, energy and precious
metals.



                                                                                                                   6
detected by use of the Christiano-Fitzgerald band pass filter which decomposes the natural log of

the real price of commodity i in time t, ln(Pit), into three components: a long-run trend in excess

of 70 years in duration, LRTt; a medium-run cycle of 20 to 70 years duration, MRCt; and all other

shorter cyclical components, SRCt. This entails estimating three orthogonal components for the

log of the real commodity price series, or namely ln( Pit ) º LRTit + MRCit + SRCit .

         Broadly, the work of Christiano and Fitzgerald (2003) has as its basic insight that time-

series data—like the real commodity price series under consideration here—can be characterized

as the sum of periodic functions. Their work then establishes the ideal (infinite sample) band-

pass filter, allowing for slowly evolving trends and imposing no restrictions on the distribution of

the underlying data. Furthermore, they suggest a finite-sample asymmetric band pass filter which

allows for the extraction of filtered series over the entire sample, thus, ensuring that no data from

either the beginning or end of the sample is discarded.6 Conveniently for my purposes, this filter

does not require either symmetry or time-invariance. That is, it can be used in real time as

observations drawn from the beginning of a period can be filtered only using future values and

observations drawn from the end of a period can be filtered only using past values.

         The results presented below are not materially altered when different durations are used

for defining trends and cycles. In these cases, the magnitudes marginally differ from those


6
  To implement the band pass filter, Christiano and Fitzgerald assume that the underlying data generating process is
integrated of order one (that is, it is a random walk). Even though the simulations in their paper strongly suggest that
the filter remains unaffected by potential misspecification of the data generating process, it is very easy to check this
assumption. Testing for a unit root in the differenced commodity price index series yields the following set of results
under the following set of unit root tests:
(1) Levin-Lin-Chu adjusted t = -3.3139 [p-value = 0.0050]
(2) Breitung lambda = -6.8269 [p-value = 0.0000]
(3) Im-Pesaran-Shin Z-t-tilde-bar = -6.9422 [p-value = 0.0000]
(4) Fisher-Philips-Perron inverse chi-squared = 72.0873 [p-value = 0.0000]
Even though all of these tests embed different assumptions and entail different strengths and weaknesses, all of them
entail the use of the null hypothesis that the differenced commodity price index series contains a unit root. Critically,
this hypothesis is decisively rejected across all tests, and so, it seems justified to invoke the assumption that the
series is indeed integrated of order one.

                                                                                                                       7
reported below, but general tendencies for estimated trends and cycles do not. For example, a

trend comprising cyclical components in excess of 50 years and a cycle comprising cyclical

components with periods of 10 to 50 years in duration generates an estimated cumulative

increase in real commodity prices from 1900 to 2015 of 23.15% (versus 23.32% as reported

below) while the last trough and peak in real commodity prices are estimated to have occurred in

1998 and 2010, respectively (versus 1996 and 2010 as reported below).7



3.1 Long-Run Trends in Real Commodity Prices

         Figure 2a depicts the estimated long-run trend for the real commodity price index drawn

from 1975 value-of-production shares while Table 2 calculates on a commodity-by-commodity

basis the cumulative change in the long-run trend in 2015 versus benchmark dates. From Table

2, it is seen that natural gas and petroleum have uniformly registered increases in real prices

since 1900. Slightly more surprising is the presence of precious metals as well as chromium,

lamb, and manganese in the same category. This leaves six commodities with a positive, but

slightly more mixed performance over the past 115 years: copper and potash which have a

consistent upward trend from 1950 and beef, coal, and steel which demonstrate a long-run

upward trend, but which have eased off somewhat from their all-time highs in the 1970s.




7
  In what follows, there is also little material difference in estimated trends or cycles when alternate asymmetric
band pass filters are used. For example, using the Butterworth band pass filter, the results remain broadly unaffected
in that: (1) the Christiano-Fitzgerald filter estimates an index value of 160.99 in 2015 versus the Butterworth filter
which estimates an index value of 154.59 in the same year; and (2) the Christiano-Fitzgerald filter estimates
complete cycles for the years from 1903 to 1932 and from 1965 to 1996 versus the Butterworth filter which
estimates complete cycles for the years from 1900 to 1932 and from 1966 to 1997. In this instance, the use of the
Hodrick-Prescott filter has been avoided as: (1) it is well-known that it is slow in establishing turning points in long-
run trends, and, thus, the HP filter estimates that real commodity prices have continued to rise, even in the face of
the significant reversal in real commodity prices dating from 2011; (2) recent work by Hamilton (2017) strongly
advises against the use of the HP filter in that it “produces series with spurious dynamic relations that have no basis
in the underlying data-generating process” (p. 2).


                                                                                                                        8
       On the opposite end of the spectrum, soft commodities have been in collective and

constant decline since 1900. Indeed, a broader interpretation of soft commodities often includes

grains and hides which suffer from the same fate. The list of secular decliners is rounded out by

aluminum, bauxite, iron ore, lead, pork, sulfur, and zinc. Thus, energy products and precious

metals are clearly in the “gainer” camp; grains and soft commodities are clearly in the “loser”

camp; and metals and minerals are left as contested territory.

       However, Figure 2a suggests that if anything real commodity prices in the aggregate have

been modestly on the rise if evaluated on the basis of the value of production. Again, applying

weights drawn from 1975 suggests that real commodity prices have had annualized rates of

increase of 0.18% from 1900, of 0.45% from 1950, and of 0.13% from 1975 (or equivalently,

have increased by 23.32%, 34.20%, and 5.54% from 1900, 1950, and 1975, respectively).

       How then are these results reconciled with the conclusions of Cashin and McDermott

(2002), for instance, who find that real commodity prices have been declining by roughly one

percent per year since the mid-nineteenth century? First, Cashin and McDermott rely on a

commodity price index which applies weights equal to the value of world imports, rather than the

value of world production as here. Second, there is a fairly substantial difference in the

composition of commodities with only 11 of their 18 commodities matching the 40 under

consideration in this paper. Finally and most importantly, there is a massive difference in the

composition of product categories: their index only spans the metals and soft commodities

categories. Although metals are somewhat of a mixed bag, soft commodities—both broadly and

narrowly defined—have been the biggest of “losers” over the past 115 years.

       These two sets of findings then suggest a potentially very large, but somewhat

underappreciated distinction in between “commodities to be grown” versus “commodities in the



                                                                                                    9
ground”. 8 Figures 3a and 4a make this distinction clear by separating the two types of

commodities along the lines suggested above. We can also drill down further as in Figure 5a and

consider “commodities in the ground, ex-energy”. In this last case, the long-run trend would be

decidedly more muted as the peaks of the mid-1970s were eroded into the 2000s and have only

recently turned around. However, it seems that much of the conventional wisdom on long-run

trends in real commodity prices may have been unduly swayed by the experience of product

categories characterized by persistent downward trends dating from the 1960s.



3.2 Medium-Run Cycles in Real Commodity Prices

        In recent years, the investing community has run with the idea of commodity price cycles

(Heap, 2005; Rogers, 2004). In this view, commodity price cycles are medium-run events

corresponding to deviations from underlying trends in commodity prices of roughly 20 to 70

years in length. These are demand-driven episodes closely linked to historical episodes of mass

industrialization and urbanization which interact with acute capacity constraints in many product

categories—in particular, energy, metals, and minerals—in order to generate above-trend real

commodity prices for years, if not decades, on end. However, once such a demand shock

emerges, there is generally a countervailing supply response as formerly dormant exploration

and extraction activities take off and induced technological change takes hold. Thus, as capacity

constraints are eased, real commodity prices revert back to—and below—trend.

        Figure 2b displays the detrended real commodity price index and the cyclical component

evident in the medium-run for the former. The scaling on the left-hand-side of the figures is in

logs, so a value of 1.0 in Figure 2b represents a 174% deviation from the long-run trend. Thus,


8
 Thus, “commodities to be grown” would include all animal products, grains, and soft commodities and
“commodities in the ground” would include all energy products, metals, minerals, and precious metals.

                                                                                                        10
the cyclical fluctuations are sizeable. The complete cycles in real commodity prices which

deliver deviations from trend of at least 20% can be dated from 1903 to 1932 and from 1965 to

1996. The commodity price index is also estimated to be in the midst of a currently evolving

cycle which began in 1996 and which is estimated to have peaked in 2010.9 Collectively, this

suggests a large role for not only American industrialization/urbanization in the early 20th

century and European/Japanese re-industrialization/re-urbanization in the mid-20th century but

also Chinese industrialization/urbanization in the early 21st century in determining the timing of

past cycles.

         By replicating this exercise for the 40 commodities underlying the index, it is found that

fully 20 of our 40 commodities demonstrate above-trend real prices starting from 1994 to 1999

but again in the context of an as-of-yet incomplete cycle.10 Critically, 13 of these are in the

energy products, metals, minerals, and precious metals categories (that is, “commodities in the

ground” as depicted in Figure 4b). The common origin of these commodity price cycles in the

late 1990s underlines an important implicit theme of this paper, namely that long-run patterns

can be easy to miss if we confuse cycles for trends. That is, much of the recent appreciation of

real commodity prices simply represents a recovery from their multi-year—and in some

instances, multi-decade—nadir around the year 2000.11


9
  The accompanying chartbook also provides a complete set of figures for real commodity price cycles and
boom/bust episodes on a commodity-by-commodity basis.
10
   These commodities are comprised of chromium, cocoa, copper, corn, cottonseed, gold, iron ore, lead, nickel,
petroleum, phosphate, platinum, potash, rice, rubber, rye, silver, steel, tin, and wool.
11
   Given the dramatic decline in real commodity prices starting in 2014, it may also be instructive to have a sense of
how sensitive the estimation of long-run trends and medium-run cycles is to innovations at the end of the sample. To
that end, we can estimate two sets of long-run trends/medium-run cycles. The first set is the long-run trend and
medium-run cycle estimated from the full sample of data from 1900 to 2015 as depicted in Figures 2a and 2b. There,
the estimated (logged) value of the long-run trend in 2010 is 4.8636 while the last trough and peak in real
commodity prices are estimated to have occurred in 1996 and 2010, respectively. The second set is the long-run
trend and medium-run cycle estimated from a restricted sample of data from 1900 to 2010 only. In this case, the
estimated (logged) value of the long-run trend in 2010 is 5.0145 while the last trough in real commodity prices is
estimated to have occurred in 1996 but with an indeterminate peak. Thus, there is a perhaps unsurprising
dependence in between the estimated long-run trend and the terminal sample values of real commodity prices. At the

                                                                                                                   11
        Thus, we have been able to establish a consistent pattern of evidence supportive of:

(1) the contention that real commodity prices might best be characterized by modest upward

trends when evaluated on the basis of the value of production; and (2) the notion of commodity

price cycles being present in both the past and present as well as for a broader range of

commodities than has been previously considered. What is missing, however, is any sense of the

nature of short-run movements in real commodity prices to which the following section turns.



3.3 Short-run Boom/Bust Episodes in Real Commodity Prices

        In exploring the short-run dynamics of real commodity prices, one important question

looms large in this context: how exactly should real commodity price booms and busts be

characterized? Here, we follow the lead of Mendoza and Terrones (2012) and take as our basic

input the deviations from the combined long-run trend and medium-run cycle in logged real

prices for commodity i in time t, or SRCit = ln( Pit ) - LRTit - MRCit . Let zit represent the

standardized version of SRCit—that is, for any given observation, we simply subtract the sample

mean of all the deviations and divide by the sample standard deviation.12

        Commodity i is defined to have experienced a boom when we identify one or more

contiguous dates for which the condition zit > 1.282 holds as this value defines the 10% upper tail

of a standardized normal distribution. A boom peaks at tboom
                                                        *
                                                             when the maximum value of zit is


same time, there is a perhaps surprising independence in between the estimated medium-run cycle and the terminal
sample values of real commodity prices.
12
   This standardization was motivated by two elements: (1) for expositional purposes, it makes it much easier to
speak of thresholds as defined by the number of (unitary) standard deviations since the values of the standard
deviations will vary by commodity; and (2) while the SRC terms effectively act as white-noise residual terms, they
generally have near, but not exactly zero means. For instance, the SRC term for the real commodity price index
depicted in Figure 6c has a mean of 0.0101. Furthermore, using the raw series on SRC terms, we fail to reject the
null hypothesis that the sample came from a normally distributed population when using standard tests of normality
like Jarque-Bera and Kolmogorov-Smirnov.



                                                                                                                12
reached for the set of contiguous dates that satisfy the threshold condition. A boom starts at
 s
tboom        s
      where tboom < tboom
                     *
                          and zit > 1.00. A boom ends at tboom
                                                          e           e
                                                               where tboom > tboom
                                                                              *
                                                                                   and zit > 1.00.

Symmetric conditions define busts. Commodity i is defined to have experienced a bust when we

identify one or more contiguous dates for which the condition zit < -1.282 holds as this value

defines the 10% lower tail of a standardized normal distribution. A bust troughs at tbust
                                                                                     *
                                                                                          when the

minimum value of zit is reached for the set of contiguous dates that satisfy the threshold

condition. A bust starts at tbust
                             s           s
                                  where tbust < tbust
                                                 *
                                                      and zit < −1.00. A bust ends at

 e
tbust        e
      where tbust > tbust
                     *
                          and zit < −1.00.

        For illustration purposes, the reader is referred to Figures 6a through 6c which present the

evidence on real commodity price booms and busts. Figure 6a depicts the log of the real

commodity price index from 1900 to 2015 along with the summation of the estimated long-run

trend and medium-run cycle. Figure 6b depicts the (standardized) difference of logged real prices

from the summation of these two series. Thus, the vertical scale is in terms of standard

deviations. Finally, Figure 6c combines the real commodity price index along with the episodes

of boom and bust determined by the algorithm given above. It indicates the presence of nine

booms (in green) and nine busts (in red) for real commodity prices over the past 115 years.

Reassuringly, the timing of these episodes suggests that in this context real commodity price

booms do not mechanically generate real commodity price busts, nor vice versa. Furthermore,

while the threshold values of 1.282/1.00 and -1.282/-1.00 are admittedly arbitrary, a mechanical

approach as used in the paper removes discretion on the part of the researcher. One can then

judge its applicability in how it measures up to known shocks to global commodity markets such

as the Great Depression, the Oil Price Shocks of the 1970s, various financial crises, and the



                                                                                                     13
World Wars. Causal observation of Figure 6c suggests a very strong correspondence between

these events and the statistically identified real commodity booms and busts outlined above.

       Another notable feature of the series in Figure 6c is the distinct lack of both booms and

busts in the period from 1938 through 1969. Putting the war years aside, this period of relative

tranquility then almost exactly corresponds with the operation of the Bretton Woods system. It

might, therefore, be tempting to read into this correlation that periods of fixed nominal exchange

rates as under the Bretton Woods system are necessarily associated with fewer—and potentially

shorter and smaller—real commodity price booms and busts (on this point, see Jacks, 2013).

However, it is not clear a priori that the fettering of both gold and petroleum prices in this period

as mentioned in section 2 was not responsible for some of the turbulence in global commodity

markets in the 1970s and 1980s.

       Just as in the case of commodity price cycles, it is possible to replicate this exercise for

the 40 commodities underlying the index. Doing so yields 326 complete commodity price booms

and 276 complete commodity price busts across the 40 commodities. In related work, Jacks

(2013) considers the case of Australia and constructs country-specific indicators of boom/bust

episodes from 1900 to 2010, finding asymmetric linkages in between booms/busts and the

business cycle. This exercise points towards the need for more rigorous work relating commodity

price volatility and economic growth using the data on booms and busts from this paper (Jacks,

O’Rourke, and Williamson, 2011; Ploeg and Poelhekke, 2009).



4. Conclusion

       Drawing motivation from the current debate surrounding the likely trajectory of

commodity prices, this paper has sought to forward our understanding of real commodity prices



                                                                                                      14
in the long-run along two dimensions. First, the paper has provided a comprehensive body of

evidence on real commodity prices for 40 economically significant commodities from 1900.

Second, the paper has provided a consistently-applied methodology for thinking about their long-

run evolution. In so doing, it suggests and documents a complete typology of real commodity

prices, comprising long-run trends, medium-run cycles, and short-run boom/bust episodes. The

findings of the paper can be summarized as follows. First, real commodity prices have been

modestly on the rise from 1900. Second, there is a pattern—in both past and present—of

commodity price cycles which entail large and multi-year deviations from these long-run trends.

Third, these commodity price cycles are punctuated by booms and busts which are historically

pervasive and, thus, potentially relevant for commodity-exporting nations.
