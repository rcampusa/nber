                                             ABSTRACT

Washington (2008) finds that, controlling for total number of children, each additional daughter makes
a member of Congress more likely to vote liberally and attributes this finding to socialization. However,
daughters’ influence could manifest differently for elite politicians and the general citizenry, thanks
to the selection gradient particular to the political process. This study asks whether the proportion
of female biological offspring affects political party identification. Using nationally-representative
data from the General Social Survey, we find that female offspring induce more conservative political
identification. We hypothesize that this results from the change in reproductive fitness strategy that
daughters may evince.

The Effect of Daughters on Partisanship


Introduction

       Contact theory suggests that social exposure to individuals of a given group generally

makes us more sympathetic to the culture, tendencies, needs and so on of said group. Support

for this exposure effect on values and beliefs has been found in any number of contexts—such

as neighborhoods and dorm rooms—and across many demographic dimensions—ranging from

race to age (Deutsch and Collins 1951; Wilner et al. 1955; Caspi 1984; Herek and Capitanio

1996; Desforges et al. 1991; Werth and Lord 1992). The family is no exception to this rule: If

we have family members of different groups (race, gender, and so on), we should, ostensibly, be

more favorably disposed toward other individuals in those groups. Likewise, socialization

effects aside, we should expect that individuals’ incentives are at least somewhat aligned with

those in their family. Indeed, on a range of political and social attitudes, within family

correlations are high (Glass et al. 1986; Niemi et al. 1977).

       For both of these reasons, we might expect that men and women who spend much of

their lives cohabiting with women—sisters, daughters, and others—should have political views

that are more in line with those of national political women’s organizations as compared to

those who do not. Indeed, several studies before us have found that the more daughters or

sisters an individual has, the more “progressive” his/her views on women’s issues. For

example, some research finds that daughters increase parents’ feminist views (Warner 1991)

and preference for gender equalizing policies – including work, education, and childcare/leave

policies (Warner and Steel 1999). However, this research is limited by the use of a local sample

and a blunt measure of presence or absence of daughters as opposed to a finer scale indicating

the proportion of daughters.




                                                                                                  3
The Effect of Daughters on Partisanship


       More recent research by Oswald and Powdthavee (2006) based on the nationally

representative British Household Panel Survey (1991 to 2004) finds that, other things held

constant, each additional daughter increases a parent’s intention to vote liberally (for the Labor

or Liberal Democrat Parties as opposed to the Conservative Party) by about 2 percentage points.

They exclude those intending to vote for smaller parties, such as the Green or Scottish National

Party, and those who are undecided. They argue that daughters make parents subconsciously

more sympathetic to liberal policies. However, the data are limited to children who live at

home, do not include information on those who have left home, and include step-children. Non-

biological children could drive their results since they are not randomly “assigned” so to speak.

The same is true for adult children not covered by the household census since they may

selectively migrate out of the parental home in response to parental gender attitudes.

       Washington (2008) estimates the effect of number of daughters on Congressional voting,

controlling for total number of children. She finds that daughters promote liberal voting among

Senators and members of the House of Representatives and attributes this effect to socialization:

Daughters make their parents (mostly their fathers) more sensitive to women’s issues, she

claims. However, the effect of daughters on congressional voting could also result from

selection. Namely, liberal individuals who have daughters might be particularly motivated to

ascend the political ladder as compared to liberal individuals who only have sons. Or, it could

be the case that liberal voters tend to elect politicians who have daughters while conservative

voters are more likely to elect politicians who have sons. Given the extent to which politicians

use their families as “props” to send signals about their views and character, this seems

plausible. On the other hand, among the general citizenry there is no selection gradient to filter

out the less-motivated from the super-motivated in simply expressing their political preferences.




                                                                                                     4
The Effect of Daughters on Partisanship


Given stark differences between a highly-selected group of politicians and the general

population, the effect of daughters on political preferences may be very different between the

two groups. (At the very least, there may be heterogeneous treatment effects even if selection is

not at work.) Further, Washington (2008: 7) gleans her data on child gender from the

Congressional Directory or, in case of gender-ambiguous names, from on-line public

biographies or telephone conversations with the member’s office or a newspaper in their

district. She therefore examines the sex of children without distinguishing between adopted,

step, and biological offspring. (Washington [p. 5] explicitly notes that, of the 828 congressional

representatives for whom she has data, 75 experienced a change in number of children from

1997 to 2004 due to birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, or death.) Here selection is an even

more direct problem: While the sex of biological offspring may be random, the sex of adopted

(or even step) children is most certainly not.

         Despite existing evidence (and relevant theory) suggesting that additional daughters

should lead to more liberal attitudes, there is reason for pause.1 Conservative policies—anti-

abortion, pro-traditional family structure and so on—seem to constrain the freedom of women.

So why would parents of daughters want to hem in the life choices of their offspring? In fact,

the rise of women’s rights has been attributed elsewhere to the shift from men’s interests in

constraining their wives in favor of their interests in preventing their daughters from being

exploited as property (Fernandez 2009). However, if one takes an evolutionary perspective on

parental sexual conflict, the opposite predictions ensue. Namely, female and male offspring

1
  The evidence does not all go in the direction of additional daughters leading to more liberal views. For instance,
research using national survey data from the National Survey of Families and Households found that sons increase
the egalitarian views of married women with children ages 3 to 18 in the home (Katzev, Warner, and Acock 1994).
However, this study focuses on explaining mothers’ perception of marital instability, with traditional family roles
as a mediator, and it studies the effect of offspring sex on traditional gender roles in the family – such as the
appropriateness of mothers’ employment, marriage, divorce, and cohabitation – rather than opinions about broader
gender roles that are more relevant to political views and policy.


                                                                                                                   5

evince divergent reproductive strategies. Since sons can potentially generate high numbers of

grandchildren, they may induce preferences for more libertine social norms and policies—ones

where paternal investment is low and restraints on male fecundity are minimal. Meanwhile,

daughters may elicit grandparental preferences for a world in which male sexuality is

constrained and paternal investment in offspring is greater. In summary, in contrast to previous

research (and Washington [2008] in particular) we hypothesize that daughters may increase

conservatism among general citizens. Indeed, our findings support this hypothesis: controlling

for gender, religion, age, education, and marital status, the proportion of girls significantly

increases Republican Party identification in the United States.



Methods

         In a society where antenatal sex-selective abortion is rare, the sex of a particular

biological child is a random variable. This study uses nationally representative data from the

1994 General Social Survey to estimate the effect of the proportion of daughters on political

views. To increase internal validity, the sample excludes individuals without children and

limits analysis to biological children (although results are robust to including non-biological

children). Control variables include gender, religion, age, education, and marital status.2

Findings suggest individual interests, not socialization, explain the effect of girls on political

views. Results hold with no controls, controlling for total number of children, and whether

party identification is measured as a dummy variable or on a scale (called Republican Scale



2
  Marital status is a potential confounding factor. Early work by Morgan et al. (1988) found that sons decrease the
likelihood of divorce, conditional on total number of offspring. Research by Lundberg and Rose (2003) and Dahl
and Moretti (2004) also argues that sons reduce the risk of divorce and increase the likelihood that single parents
will marry. Lundberg and Rose (2002, 2004) attribute this to higher leisure time fathers spend with families when
they have a son, and the higher utility received from those marriages by fathers. Marital status is controlled in all
models below but, given endogeneity concerns, results are similar when excluding it.


                                                                                                                    6

below) from strong Democrat (-3) to strong Republican (3) with Independents in the middle (0).



Results

          The association between daughters and political identification is illustrated in Figure 1.

It shows the proportion identifying as Republican or Democrat by proportion of female children

for a two-child, three-child, and four-child family. Table 1 shows results for linear probability

models predicting party identification. Having a higher proportion of daughters consistently

and significantly increases the probability of Republican Party identification and reduces the

likelihood of Democratic identification. Compared to those with no daughters, parents with all

daughters are 14% less likely to identify as a Democrat. This holds with or without controls for

gender, religion, age, education, and marital status. Similarly, parents with all daughters are

10% more likely to identify as a Republican compared to those with no daughters (11% without

controls in the model).

          Specifying Republican identification as a continuous measure gives similar results.

Republican identification for those with all daughters is half a point higher than those with

none. This would push borderline independents to be Republicans. Daughters significantly

strengthen conservative identification. This relationship holds when controlling for total

number of children or using an alternative specification of no or all daughters. Meanwhile,

deploying Washington’s method – that is, estimating the effect of number of daughters while

controlling for total children – yields the same results, although the effects are smaller and total

number of children has a significant independent effect (in the opposite direction of number of

daughters). Results are also consistent when including non-biological children. In summary,

regardless of model specification, daughters consistently increase conservative party

identification in the United States.



Discussion

       Results contradict both Washington (2008) and Oswald and Powdthavee (2006). If

daughters affect political views by socializing parents, the effect of daughters should be similar

for both politicians and general citizens. On the other hand, if daughters affect parents’ political

views by changing their individual interests, daughters may increase conservatism among the

general population but serve as a selection gradient among successful liberal politicians (and

vice versa for conservative politicians). We find support for the latter interpretation and, by

extension, for evolutionary theories of inclusive fitness.

       If individuals seek to maximize their chances of passing on genes to future generations

(“inclusive fitness”), they may desire more conservative policies when they have more female

genetic kin. There is an inherent conflict between parents that is particularly acute in species

that invest heavily in offspring (so-called K-strategy organisms). Males’ optimal reproductive

strategy is to sire many offspring with a range of mates and push the parenting requirements

onto the mothers. Meanwhile, the mother seeks to maximize not only the genetic fitness of the

sire, but also to induce more post-conception investment in rearing the offspring from the father.

Seen in this light, more conservative policies that increase the cost of promiscuity—particularly

for males—will enhance the reproductive bargaining power of women. If individual interests

lie in genetic endurance, those with more daughters should hold more conservative political

views. The conservative emphasis on family, traditional values and gender roles, and pro-

life/anti-abortion sentiments all stress investment in children – for both men and women.

Conservative policies mirror the genetic interests of women, writ large. They attempt to




                                                                                                     8

promote paternal investment in offspring. Further, they stress investment in conceived

offspring – “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” In short, Conservative policies

support the genetic fitness of women by capitalizing on each pregnancy, reducing male

promiscuity, and increasing paternal investment in children. Such policies may impinge on the

freedom of parents’ immediate offspring, but they increase the expected number of

grandchildren via daughters.
