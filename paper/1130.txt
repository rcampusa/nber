             THE SUBSTITUTABILITy OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES



                                  Abstract



       This paper investigates empirically the degree of substitutability
between debt and equity securities in the United States during 1960—1980.
The analysis first applies fundanental relationships connecting portfolio
choices with expected asset returns to infer key asset substitutabilities
directly from the observed U.S. asset return experience. It then compares
these implied substitutabilitjes with the observed portfolio behavior of
U.S. households.

       The resulting evidence provides little ground for any conclusion
about even the sign, much less the magnitude, of the substitutability of
short-term debt and equity. Although the implied optimal behavior indicates
that these two assets are substitutes, the observed behavior indicates that
households have treated them as complements. By contrast, the evidence
consistently indicates that long—term debt and equity are substitutes.
Moreover, with a few exceptions the empirical estimates of the associated
substitution elasticity are quite closely clustered around the value —.035.

       The conclusion that long-term debt and equity are substitutes with
elasticity - .035 bears mixed implications for broader economic and
financial questions. At one level, the finding that the two assets are
indeed substitutes validates the standard assumption underlying a variety
of familiar models in monetary economics and finance. At the same time,
if the elasticity is only -.035, then many of these models' more important
substantive conclusions do not follow.

              THE SUBSTITUTABILITy OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES


                             Benjamin   M. Friedman*

        The substitutability of debt and equity securities in investors'

 portfolios is an old and important issue both in monetary economics and in

 the theory of finance. More than two decades ago, Tobin (1961) emphasized

 that the structure of macroeconomic models of the asset markets depends

 fundamentally upon investors' willingness to substitute debt and equity

claims, with consequent strong implications for such familiar questions as

the financing of capital formation, the economic impact of government

deficits, and the potential efficacy of monetary policy. At the same time,

following Modigliani and Miller (1958) the theory of corporate finance

has focused heavily on the distinctions between debt and equity claims,

and on the implications of the fact that corporations issuing these claims

confront a competitive market in which investors price these forms of

ownership according to their own, rather than the issuing corporations',

objectives.

       The basic reasons why debt and equity may be either close or distant

substitutes are well known. Perhaps the most obvious distinction is that

(non—indexed) debt is a claim on a fixed nominal payment stream, while

equity is not, so that the two assets' risk properties with respect to

changes in the economy's overall price level differ sharply) Similarly,

because of the residual nature of equity claims, the two assets also have

different risk properties with respect to changes in relative prices

or equivalently, in a world in which not all markets are perfectly

competitive, changes in supply-demand conditions in specific product and
                                        —2—




factor markets.2 In comparison with money and other short—term instruments,

however, debt and equity claims have much in common with one another.

To the extent that both debt and equity represent claims to long-lived

payment streams, their shared risk properties with respect to interest

rate changes hold them apart from money and other short—term claims.

Also, unlike money (and some money substitutes), conventional debt and

equity claims are not normally acceptable as a means of payment.3

       All of these factors affecting investors' willingness to substitute

debt and equity   securities   are familiar enough at the qualitative level,

but the actually prevailing debt-equity substitutability and its consequences

for important issues of economic behavior remain questions that can only

be resolved empirically. It is simply not possible, on the basis of

a priori considerations alone, to say which risks or other factors are

foremost in investors' minds, and hence how investors resolve the tug—of—

war that pits the distinctions between debt and equity claims against

their similarities. Moreover, because objective circumstances differ

from one time and place to another, there is no reason to assume that the

relative weights investors place on even the most important of these

considerations are universal constants. As changes in the nonfinancial

structure of an economy or in the posture of economic policy alter the charac-

ter of the risks investors face, or as financial market practices and institu—

tions evolve, debt and equity securities may become either closer or more

distant substitutes.

        The object of this paper is to investigate empirically the degree

 of substitutability between debt and equity securities in the United States,

 and to see whether the recent evidence indicates stability or change in

 this relationship. Section I applies fundamental relationships connecting
                                     —3—




portfolio choices to expected asset returns, based on the maximization of

expected utility, to infer key asset substitutabilities from the experience

of asset returns in the United States during 1960-1980. Section II compares

these inferred substitutabilities with the observed portfolio behavior of

U.S. households over this period. Section III performs analogous comparisons

for two further alternative systems for grouping financial assets into the

broad aggregates (debt, equity, etc.) that are necessary for formal analysis.

Section IV focuses on whether there is reason to believe that asset sübsti—

tutabilities have changed since 1960 —to anticipate, the answer is yes —

and examines an extended model in light of this finding. Section V briefly

summarizes the paper's principal conclusions and offers some concluding

comments.

I. Implications, of Asset Returns

       The substitutability or complementarity of one asset for another

is a way of describing how investors' portfolio choices respond to changes

in expected asset returns. Because the data available for empirical

applications necessarily indicate the composition of investor's portfolios

only at specific intervals, it is useful to derive a discrete—time model

of this aspect of portfolio behavior.

       Following the familiar theory of expected utility maximization,4 the

investor's single—period objective as of time t, given initial wealth W, is


       max
               E[U(W+i))                                                              (1)
          -t

subject   to

                   =   1                                                              (2)



where E() is the expectation operator, U(W) is utility as a function of

wealth, c is a vector expressing the portfolio allocations in proportional

form

               =
                       t•t
for vector A of asset holdings, and wealth W evolves according to

                   =        .        +                                                (4)

known, if U (W) is any power             (or logarithmic) function such that the coefficient
of relative risk aversion


                            U" (w)
          p =      —w

is constant, and if the investor perceives asset returns i to be distributed

as


                       N(r , 2)                                                                        (6)


then the resulting optimal asset demands exhibit the convenient properties

of homogeneity in total wealth and linearity in the expected asset returns..5

            If no asset in vector A bears a risk—free return, so that the variance-

covariance matrix 2 is of full rank, then solution of the first-order

condition for the maximization of (1) subject to (2) yields


            c =        B   (r +1) +ir                                                                  (7)

Alternatively, in the presence of a risk—free asset bearing return r, it

is necessary to partition the asset demand system. The resulting solution,
                                A
in   which             and Q refer to the subset of risky assets only, is


               =   B       (r -          r'l    +   1)                                                (10)

where
                       -U'[E(wt+l )]
        A
       B =                                               .                                            (11)
                   t
                   W • tJ"[E(w )]
                              t+l

and the optimum portfolio share for the risk-free asset is just (l_*'1).

In either case, if the time unit is sufficiently small to render                                  a good

approximation to E(t+1) for purposes of the underlying expansion, then the

scalar term within brackets in either (8) or (11) reduces to the reciprocal
                                        —6—




of the constant coefficient of relative risk aversion p.6

         Because this system of asset demands provides the basic vehicle for

the analysis that follows, it is useful at the outset to note explicitly

several of its properties. First, because of the assumptions of constant

relative risk aversion and normally distributed return assessments,

the respective asset demands are each proportional to the investor's

wealth, and they depend linearly on the associated expected returns.

Second, as Brainard and Tobin (1968) have emphasized, the effect of

the constraint (2) is to render the asset demands linearly dependent, so

that matrix B (or B) and vector ir satisfy the "adding up" constraints


                =       o , all   j                                           CI2

and

               =    1                                                         (13)


where vectors . are the columns of B. Third, because        is a variance-

covariance matrix and therefore symmetrical, B (or B) indicates symmetrical

asset substitutions associated with cross—yield effects.7 Fourth, B

(or )    is   strictly proportional to a straightforward transformation of

the variance—covariance matrix, with the factor of proportionality

equal to the reciprocal of the coefficient of relative risk aversion.

Each of these four properties figures importantly in the analysis presented

below.

         The primary focus of interest here is the specific off—

diagonal elements (or, depending on the asset aggregation scheme employed,

element)      of B that describe the substitutability or complementarity of

debt and equity securities — that is, the response of the demand for debt
                                          —7—




to changes in the expected return on equity, and vice versa. Following

Brainard and Tobin, the standard assumption (at least in the macroeconomic

literature) is that all assets are gross substitutes, so that the only

question left to be resolved empirically is the absolute magnitude of

the   presumably negative off-diagonal             elements measuring debt-equity
substitutability. The ii in (8) and (11) are marginal responses, so that
the associated elasticities of substitution, defined in the usual way as8
                   dA.    r
         s.. =                                                                      (14)

        In general, however, assets may or may not he gross substitutes.

From (8) and (11) it is clear that not just the magnitude but also the

sign of each asset demand response to variations in expected yields

depend on the variance—covariance structure describing perceived asset

returns. In the presence of a risk—free asset, Blanchard and Plantes

(1977) have shown that a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for

gross substitutability of all assets —that is, for all of the of f-

diagonal ..      in   (11) to be negative —   is   that the partial correlations

among   all   asset returns be nonnegative.        In the absence of a risk—free

asset, as is typically assumed here, no such straightforward

condition on Q to guarantee the negativity of all of the off-diagonal

.. is    apparent, and the most straightforward way to assess the question

of gross substitutability is simply to inspect the elements of B directly.

         In financial markets as well developed as those in the United States,

most investors confront a rich, and at times bewildering, variety of
                                         —8—




financial    instruments. Different securities represent claims structured

in sharply different ways, and therefore bear returns subject to different

risks. Government securities differ from private securities. Even among

private securities, claims against some obligors can differ importantly from

identically structured claims against others. For purposes of the questions

addressed here, however, it is important to focus on broadly defined asset

categories, thereby disregarding much of this variety and implicitly

treating as perfect substitutes many distinct claims among which investors

are presumably not entirely indifferent.

          Some aggregation among assets, therefore, is clearly necessary.

Table 1 indicates an aggregation of the many forms of financial claims

typically held by households in the United States into five broad categories:

money, time and saving deposits, short—term debt, long—term debt, and

equity.     The table also indicates the amount of   each asset category in

the   aggregate   portfolio of the U.S. household sector as of yearend 1980.11

The analysis here ignores entirely all nonfinancial assets, both because

the   available rate—of—return data are weak (nonexistent in   many cases)

and because a careful treatment of investment in nonfinancial assets lies

beyond the scope of this paper.

          The object of the aggregation shown in Table 1 is to preserve the

fundamental distinctions among assets while at the same time reducing

the number of separate categories to within manageable range for purposes

of empirical analysis?2 "Money," including currency and demand deposits,

distinguishes assets that bear zero nominal rates of return and that

provide means—of—payment services. "Time and saving deposits" distinguishes

assets that bear (nonzero) nominal rates of return subject to fixed legal

ceilings. "Short-term debt," including all other deposit instruments and

all open-market debt instruments maturing in less than one year, distinguishes

assets that bear market—determined nominal rates of return but that

are subject to little interest-rate risk. "Long—term debt," including

all other debt instruments, distinguishes assets that bear nominal rates

of return and that are subject to substantial interest-rate risk. "Equity"

distinguishes assets that bear residual ownership risk.

       The first column of Table 2 shows the annualized mean real returns

observed on these five aggregate assets on a quarterly basis during

1960—1980. The nominal returns associated with these real returns are

zero for money; a weighted—average yield for time and savings deposits;

the four-to—six month prime commercial paper yield for short-term debt;

the Moody's Baa corporate bond yield, plus annualized percentage capital

gains or losses inferred by applying the consol pricing formula to changes

in the Baa yield, for long-term debt; and the dividend-price yield, plus

annualized percentage capital gains or losses, on the Standard and Poor's

500 index for equity. In each case the real return is just the respective

nominal return minus the annualized percentage change in the consumer

       The second column of Table 2 shows the corresponding after-tax

returns on these five aggregate assets, computed by applying the marginal

tax rates shown in Table 3 to each quarter's before-tax returns before

subtracting the consumer price index change.14 The marginal tax rates

applied to interest and dividends are values estimated by Estrella and

Fuhrer (1983), on the basis of Internal Revenue Service data, to reflect

the marginal tax bracket of the average recipient of these two respective

kinds of income in each year. The marginal tax rate applied to capital

gains is an analogous estimate, including allowances for deferral and loss

offset features, due to Feldstein et al. (1983).

      As is clear in (7)-(1l), the substitutability or complementarity

among assets in investors' portfolios depends upon the variance-covariance

structure of the returns that investors associate with those assets.

Hence what matters in this context is not necessarily the actual experience

of returns but investors' perceptions and expectations, which may or may

not closely approximate the corresponding ultimate outcomes. Because

expectations are not directly observable, arriving at values to use in

their place for purposes of empirical analysis is always problematical.

One solution to this problem, which is applicable in some isolated cases

in which data are available, is to rely on survey information.15 The most

plausible alternative, which rests on the assumption of at least some form

of "rationality" in investors' perceptions, is to infer the distribution of

expected returns at least partly on the basis of the observed experience

of actual returns.

      Table 4 shows the variance -covariance   matrix   of the actual return
                                                                            16
experience corresponding to the mean after—tax real returns in Table 2.

As is familiar, these data show the large variation (even in real terms)

associated with equity and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with long-term

debt. As is also familiar, the variation associated with short-term debt

is the smallest among any   of   the five aggregate assets.

      What would these variance—covariance properties imply for the substitu-

tion properties among the five assets if they did accurately represent

investors' assessments? Table 5 shows the transformation of Q from the

right-hand side of (8) computed on the basis of the Q matrix in Table 4.

To recall, these values indicate, to within a (positive) constant indicating

the investor's relative risk aversion, the marginal responses of optimal

asset demands to changes in expected returns. For p =          1,   a plausible and

often assumed magnitude, these values are simply identical to the optimal
                      17
marginal responses.

      what immediately stands out in Table 5 is that the implied system

of optimal asset demands does not render all assets gross substitutes.

Money is a complement for all assets except time and saving deposits,

while short-term and long-term debt are complements for one another.

Debt and equity securities are clearly substitutes, however. On the

assumption that p =    1,   so that the values in Table 5 represent the elements

.. in    (8), the corresponding elasticities of substitution follow as in

(15). Table 6 shows the 1960—1980 mean asset shares which, together with

the mean after-tax asset real returns in Table 2, facilitate calculating

elasticities from the optimal marginal responses in Table 5. The results

of such calculations are likely to be misleading in many cases, however,

because fouz of the five      mean net   returns are negative. On the basis of the

mean values as shown, the marginal response of the demand for short—term

debt to the expected return on equity (which has a positive mean) implies an

elasticity of substitution CSE = —.025, while the corresponding elasticity

for equity and long-term debt is           =    _.037)8   Although both of these

elasticities are negative, both are quite small in absolute value.

        It is also useful to examine whether the assumption that no risk—

free asset exists, as is implicit in using the values in Table 5 to imply

whether assets are substitutes or complements, importantly affects these

conclusions. In brief, the answer is no. The signs of all elements in

(11) are identical to the corresponding signs shown in Table 5, except

for that relating money and short-term debt. The respective elasticities

of substitution   of short—term and long-term debt        for equity, calculated

as above   but   using (11) instead of (8), are ESE =   -.270   arid   = -.034.
Once again, even in the presence of a risk—free asset, not all of the five

risky assets would be gross substitutes. As Table 7 shows, the partial

correlations among the risky assets' after—tax real returns include a

negative value and hence fail to satisfy the Blanchard-plantes necessary

condition.

        Section II goes on to examine how the observed portfolio behavior

of U.S. households has corresponded with the optimal behavior indicated

in Table 5. Even before turning to the observed asset choices, however,

it is helpful to focus on one aspect of the historical asset return

experience that presents particular challenges for explaining investors'

behavior. The optimal portfolio shares of the five asset aggregates,

computed from (7) using the historical after—tax return means and variance—

covariance matrix, indicate positive holdings of only two assets —time

and   saving deposits, and equity)9 These two assets did have the largest

shares of households' actual portfolios during this period, as Table 6

indicates, but holdings of the other three assets were of course positive

as well. Hence the actual asset choices made by households clearly

differed from the optimal choices implied by the simple model developed

above from the basics of expected utility maximization. Either households'

perceptions of returns systematically differed from the actual experience

during this period, or else households were incorporating other factors

in their portfolio decisions. The analysis that follows attempts to

consider each of these possibilities.

II.   Household Sector Portfolio Behavior

         The model of portfolio behavior developed in Section I takes the

maximization of expected utility as the sole objective guiding investors'

asset choices. When one of the assets under consideration is money,

however, the need for means—of-payment services constitutes another

factor influencing asset selection. Following Tobin (1969), among other

writers, a convenient way to represent the demand for such services in

a model with asset demands homogenous in portfolio wealth is by the flow

of transactions relative to wealth. In the linear model (7), the implied

generalization is accordingly


            =    B(r   + 1) + (S(       )+                                            (16)


where Y is the investor's transactions, (S           is   a vector of coefficients,

and all other terms are as before.2° Because money provides means—of—

payment services, the usual presumption is that M >               0.   Moreover, (S

must satisfy an "adding up" constraint analogous to (17), so that this

presumption also implies (S.        < 0 for at least some asset i         M.

         Table 8 presents results for the estimation of (16) by ordinary

least squares, using quarterly U.S. data for 1960—1980. Data used for

ci. are seasonally adjusted shares of the U.S. household sector's aggregate

portfolio during 1960—1980. As Lintner (1969) has explicitly shown, the linearity

of asset demand relationships like (7)              or (16) readily admits of aggrega-

tion across investors with diverse preferences (p), endowments (w) and

assessments (re2)        The intended end result here of empirical analysis

based on aggregate data is therefore an estimate of the relevant parameters

describing the behavior of the collectivity of investors that together

play a   large   role in determining the overall substitutability of debt

and equity securities inthe United States. Data for the household

sector consist for the most part of the portfolio holdings of individual

investors, and the household sector is the dominant holder of securities —

and the ultimate holder of all wealth —                         in   the U.S. economy.21

          The data for c are respective shares, and for W the aggregate level,

value using the corresponding seasonally adjusted quarterly flows.

In addition, for equities (the only financial asset for which the asset

stock data are at market value), quarterly valuation changes are included

without seasonal adjustment. As the discussion in Section I explains,

the data used here omit holdings of nonfinancial assets, in part to avoid

data inadequacies and in part simply to limit the scope of the analysis.

The data also omit the household sector's outstanding liabilities, since

the great bulk of household borrowing is tied to the ownership of nonfinancial

assets.23 The data for re are actual real return data for money, time

values are predominantly smaller in absolute value than are the implied

optimal values, as would ordinarily be the case in the presence of errors

in measuring the unobservable expected returns. Nine of the estimated

values differ in sign from the implied optimal values, however, although

in only four cases are the differences statistically significant at the

.05 level. 1mong the ten pairs of off—diagonal coefficients that (13)

implies should be identical, four differ in sign; three of the four conflict-

ing pairs are in the row and columns corresponding to money and its expected

return.

          On the key issue of substitutability of debt and equity securities,

the estimated values indicate (without contradiction in signs of paired

values) that short—term debt and equity are complements and that long—term

debt and equity are substitutes — results that are, respectively,

inconsistent and consistent with the solution in Table 5. Once again,

it   is necessary to base the corresponding elasticities of substitution
on the short—term or long—term debt demand and the equity return in order
to   avoid sign changes due to negative mean net returns. Here, however,

there are two separate estimates of each marginal response fB.. (-

because the matrix of estimated coefficients is not symmetric. The

respective pairs of implied elasticity estimates are        = (.039, .116)

and       = (-.0004, -.006). Although both      values are negative, both

are small in absolute value in comparison with       =   -.037   implied by

the solution in Table 5.

          One immediately noticeable aspect of the summary statistics shown

in Table 8 is the uniformly low Durbin-Watson statistics, indicating

residuals in all five equations that unambiguously display significant

serial correlation at the .01 level. This result is hardly surprising in a

quarterly model, in light of the well known sluggishness of household

portfolio behavior in the presence of (broadly defined) transactions costs.

Especially in the context of occasional large moves in equity prices,

which suddenly shift the relative portfolio shares of all assets, it is

implausible to expect full re-alignment of asset holdings to expected

returns within a calendar quarter.26 Some model of portfolio adjustment

out of equilibrium is therefore appropriate.

         The most straightforward and familiar model of portfolio adjustment

under   transactions costs found in the asset demand literature is the
multivariate partial adjustment form

               =
                   ec -                                                     (17)


where A* is the vector of equilibrium asset holdings corresponding to
   in (16) and 0 is a matrix of adjustment coefficients with columns

satisfying an "adding up" constraint analogous to (12).27 applying (17)

to (16) yields

               =
                      +t+tt't_1                                             (18)


where

           =                                                                (19)
           =                                                                (20)

                0r                                                          (21)

so that the columns of matrix    and vector    all satisfy "adding up"

constraints analogous to (12) while that for vector i   is   analogous to

(13).

described above. Because each term in (18) takes the dimension of nominal

dollars, however —   unlike   the homogeneous form (16) —here care is

necessary to avoid spurious correlations due to coimnon time trends. Hence

for purposes of estimation all nominal magnitudes (AA, W, Y and A) are

rendered in real per capita values.28 In addition, both AAt and W exclude

the current period's capital gains or losses (although the vector of lagged

asset stocks Ati reflects previous periods' gains and losses), so that the

estimated form focuses strictly on the household sector's aggregate net

purchases or sales of each asset associated with the sector's net saving.

Defining the asset flows in this way is equivalent to assuming that inves-

tors do not respond within the quarter to that quarter's changes in their

holdings due to changing market valuations, but do respond to market

valuations as of the beginning of each quarter.

       The top panel of Table 9 reports summary statistics for each equation,

and estimated values and t—statistics for the matrix    of immediate marginal

responses of asset demands to expected returns. Not surprisingly, the

use of the partial adjustment form sharply improves the overall fit

properties of all five equations. Serial correlation remains significant

in only two equations, and the standard errors, after conversion from real

dollars per capita to portfolio shares as in Table 8, are uniformly smaller

— in some cases by almost an order of magnitude.29
       Although the immediate marginal portfolio responses        may be

useful for some purposes, what primarily matters in the context of the

questions raised at the outset of this paper is the matrix of equilibrium

marginal responses B, solved following (19) as B ®.          The lower panel

of Table 9 shows the implied matrix B, together with associated t—statistics

found by using the full-information maximum likelihood method to re-estimate
                                                -18—




  (18) in a nonlinear form representing the elements of matrix in the form

  (19) so as to derive direct estimates of the underlying 13.                values.30
 In addition, so as to derive t-statistjcs comparable to those shown in

 Table 8, in which the equivalent of an identity matrix is imposed a priori

 in place of the adjustment matrix 0, for purposes of the maximum likelihood

 estimation the estimated 0. values were taken as given.3'
                           13
          These estimated equilibrium asset demand            responses   again bear little
 resemblance overall to the implied optimal responses in Table 5. of                 the
 twenty-five estimated 13..,         eleven differ in sign from the corresponding

 B elennts in Table 5, including three negative values among the five

on—diagonal      13..   indicating   the "own" response of the demand for an asset

to the expected return on that asset. among the ten pairs of off-diagonal

        all four pairs in the row and column corresponding to money and its

expected      return uniformly disagree in sign, while the remaining six pairs
uniformly agree in sign. In light of the ample (but troubled) literature
on the demand for money, it          is   hardly surprising that the "pure portfolio"
approach followed here should meet only limited success in explaining
money demand and/or the        response of other asset demands to the expected
return on money. 32
         These estimates for the partial adjustment model correspond to those
shown   in Table 8      for the equilibrium model in indicating that long-term debt

and equity     are substitutes, as in Table 5,         but   (unlike in Table 5)   short—
term debt and     equity    are complements. The associated pairs of implied
elasticities (calculated, as usual, from the             mean return on equity)

                                                                        is

that one of the           values is almost identical to the corresponding
optimal elasticity implied by the           solution in Table 5.

      Because the five equations comprising (18) have identical sets of

regressors, either ordinary least—squares or (unconstrained) maximum—

likelihood methods necessarily yield estimates satisfying the "adding up"

constraints emphasized by Brainard and Tobin. By contrast, such estimates

in general do not satisfy other cross-equation restrictions implied by the

theory of portfolio choice outlined in Section I. in        this   context a further

potential   advantage of the nonlinear maximum-likelihood method underlying
the      estimates in Table 9   is   the facility it provides   for imposing such
restrictions.
        Table 10 presents an alternative set of maximum likelihood estimates

for (18), subject to the restriction that the matrix of equilibrium marginal

responses B be symmetric. (Familiar practice notwithstanding, there is no

reason to assume symmetry of the matrix of immediate marginal responses

.)    The table shows the usual summary statistics for each equation, and

estimated values and t-statistics for the symmetric matrix of equilibrium

portfolio responses.33 Here two of the five on—diagonal .. elements                —
those   indicating the respective "own"    responses of   long-term debt and       equity

—have negative     estimated values, although neither differs significantly

from zero. among the ten off—diagonal .. elements, seven agree in sign

with the implied optimal responses shown in Table 5 while three —            all    in

the row and column    corresponding   to equity and its   expected return
disagree.
        As is the case for the unconstrained estimates shown in Tables 8 and
9, the constrained estimates indicate that short—term debt and equity are
complements,    while long-term debt and equity are substitutes.       The

associated   implied elasticities (calculated in the usual way) are

6SE = .192 and          = —0.024.    Once   again,   it is interesting that the

implied         value not only agrees in sign but also cones close in magnitude

to the corresponding optimal elasticity implied by the solution in Table 5,

although in this case the underlying estimated ..             is   not significantly

different from zero. As is to be expected, imposition of the symmetry

constraint enlarges the standard error of each equation, and the appropriate

test of the symmetry constraint itself yields x2(]0) =             43.8,   warranting

rejection     of the implie.d restrictions at any plausible significance level.
            In addition to symmetry, the theory summarized in Section I implies
that the matrix of equilibrium portfolio responses also be proportional
to the transformation of the asset return variance—covariance matrix shown
in   (8),    with the constant of proportionality (approximately) equal to the
reciprocal      of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Nevertheless,

estimating (18) by the same nonlinear maximum-likelihood method, subject to

the further constraint that matrix B be proportional to the implied optimal
                                            2
response matrix in Table 5, yields X (9) =           19.2,   warranting rejection

at the .05 level (but not the .01 level) of the further restrictions

imposed in addition to the symmetry restrictions.35

            In sum, estimates for neither equilibrium model (16) nor partial

adjustment model (17) yield a representation of the U.S. household sector's

observed 1960—1980 portfolio behavior that is fully satisfactory in terms

of the theory summarized in Section I. Moreover, these models do allow

(albeit in a simple, though standard, way) for two potentially important

influences on portfolio choice that the straightforward theory of expected

utility maximization omits — the demand for means-of—payment services, and

the transactions costs associated with portfolio adjustments. Sections

III and IV therefore turn      to   examine whether it is plausible to assume that
                                   —21—




the stochastic structure of asset returns represented in Tables 2 and 4

accurately reflects the perceptions that guided investors' asset selection

during this period.

III. Two Alternative Asset Aggregation Systems

       As the discussion in Section I emphasizes, any scheme for reducing

to analytically manageable terms the number of assets from which investors

choose their portfolios is bound to be highly arbitrary. A possible

explanation for the unsatisfactory estimates summarized in Tables 9 and

10, therefore, is that the five—asset aggregation system introduced in

Table 1 either over- or under-states the important distinctions on which

investors actually focus in making asset choices.

       Tables 11 and 12 show the basic properties of realized asset returns,

and the corresponding estimation results for asset demand system (18),

under an alternative aggregation system that distinguishes only three

separate asset categories: money plus time deposits, including all

instruments bearing nominal returns subject to (zero or nonzero) fixed legal

ceilings; short-term plus long—term debt, including all instruments bearing

market—determined   nominal rates of return; and equity,   as before. The idea

underlying   this alternative is simply to group together assets bearing
non-market nominal returns without   distinguishing those that provide means

of payment   services, and to group together assets bearing market—determined

nominal returns without distinguishing those subject to substantial interest

rate risk. The returns associated with each composite asset category are

just those of its two components, as described in Section I, weighted by

their respective dollar magnitudes in each quarter.

       According to the implied optimal portfolio responses shown in Table 11,

the composite debt asset and equity are clearly substitutes, with elasticity

of substitution ESLE =    -.044.   If anything, however, the estimated portfolio

responses shown in Table 12 are less satisfactory than those shown in Tables

9 and 10 for the five—asset classification. In the absence of the symmetry

constraint,       the two estimated values corresponding to the substitutability

of debt and equity differ in sign. With the symmetry constraint imposed,

debt and equity are complements with elasticity SL,E 3.62, but the loss

of fit associated with the restriction is clearly large, and the test

statistic value x2(3) =         46.3 warrants rejecting it at any plausible
significance level.

          Tables 13 and 14 present analogous asset return properties and

estimation results for a second alternative aggregation scheme, again

distinguishing only three asset categories: money plus time deposits plus

short—term    debt; long-term debt; and equity. The idea underlying this
alternative is to group together all assets bearing nominal returns that
are   essentially    fixed (and known in advance, at least on a quarterly basis)
and   hence   subject to inflation risk only.36 In effect,      the application of

the   "pure portfolio" model to this set of aggregates is equivalent to
assuming    that investors first decide, on the basis of mean—variance utility

maximization, how large a portfolio of liquid assets to hold, and secondarily

divide their liquid assets among money, time deposits and short-term debt

instruments on the basis of other considerations.37 The return associated

with the composite liquid asset category is a weighted average of the

returns associated with its three components.38

          The implied optimal portfolio responses shown in Table 13 for this

aggregation scheme indicate that all three assets are gross substitutes,

      =   -.036   between long-term debt and equity. The unconstrained estimates

shown   in Table 14, however, bear       little apparent relation to these optimal

responses.     All three estimated on—diagonal "own" responses are negative,

contradictions) that liquid assets are a complement for both long—term debt
and   equity.    With the symmetry constraint imposed, the implied elasticities
are             = .079 and    = -.058.   Here the implied CMTSE value again
indicates   comp].ementarity rather than substitutability, but the implied

      value agrees in sign and approaches in magnitude the corresponding

optimal          implied by the solution in Table 13. The test statistic value

for the symmetry restriction is x2() =          8.0,   which warrants rejecting the

restriction at the .05 level but not at the .01 level.

       Comparison of these results with those presented in Sections I and

II on the basis of a five-asset scheme hardly settles the question of which

arbitrary asset aggregation system provides the best representation of how

investors perceive the menu of assets confronting them. Nevertheless, it

is instructive that the estimate of               in the first three—asset

alternative and          in the second are not all that different from the

      estimates — or the implied optimal c — reported in Sections I and

II. More broadly, however, on the basis of these results there is little

ground for attributing the unsatisfactory properties of these models'

empirical estimates in other respects to the asset aggregation system per se.

IV. Changes Over Time in the Structure of Asset Returns

       The variance-covariance matrix exhibited in Table 4 reflects the

stochastic structure of the after—tax asset returns actually realized

during 1960-1980. Hence the portfolio responses to expected return

variations exhibited in Table 5, which are implied from that variance-

covariance matrix using (8) and p =   1,   adequately describe investorst

optimal behavior Only to the extent that investors actually knew that

the stochastic structure of asset returns was as it turned out to be.

The question that immediately arises is how investors would have acquired

this information.

       The rationale for asserting that economic agents (on average)

accurately know the relevant properties of the world in which they live

usually rests on some presumption of stationarity: If the properties in

question are economically relevant, agents will have an incentive to discover

them; if the properties persist, agents will in fact do so. By contrast,

if the relevant properties are changing over time, so that an appeal to

economic incentives and (even sometimes quite astonishing) powers of

observation is insufficient, how the representative agent comes to know

these properties is highly problematical.39

       The relevant question here, therefore, is how stable were the 1960—

1980 sample properties of asset returns summarized in Section I. Tables

15 and 16 report mean returns arid variance—covariance structures for the

two sub—samples 1960:1—1979:11 and l970:III—l980:IV.40 As is well known,

investors confronted not only lower mean real returns but also more volatile

real returns on all five categories of assets during the 1970s, and

the data shown here clearly reflect these differences.

       More inportantly, Table 17 shows that the changes in the variance—

covariance structure of asset returns that took place between the 19.60s

and the 1970s bore strong implications for optimal portfolio behavior,

including implications for the substitutability of debt and equity

securities. The table shows the implied optimal asset responses correspond-

ing to the respective sub—sample variance—covariance matrices in Table 16,

based   again on (8) and    p   =   1.   Many of the own— and cross—return   responses
changed by relatively large magnitudes, and           the   response indicating
the substitutability of short-term debt and           equity even changed sign,

between the two sub-samples. For the 1960s the prevailing stochastic

return    structure implies that short-term debt and equity were complements,
with       =   1.28. The analogous stochastic        return structure for the

1970s   implies that short-term debt and equity were substitutes, with
    = —.043.      By contrast, the stochastic return structure in both
sub—samples implies that long-term debt and equity were substitutes,
with       = -.087 and          = -.019    respectively.41
        In light of these changes        in the stochastic structure,   and hence
in the implied optimal portfolio responses, it is hardly surprising that
straightforward estimation of either equilibrium model (16) or partial

adjustment             should yield unsatisfactory results, nor that
               model (18)                                                         the

elasticity of substitution between short-term debt and equity be a

particularly unsatisfactory aspect of these results. At a minimum,
some allowance for these within—sample changes              is necessary. Nevertheless,

simply including fifteen moving—average variances and covariances in

each equation is hardly likely to be an efficient approach.42

        Some more compact way of summarizing the information contained in

the evolving variance—covariance structure of asset returns is therefore

necessary. Following Sharpe (1964) and Linther (1965), a plausible

summary measure for this purpose is the ratio of the covariance of each

asset's return     with   that on the "market" portfolio to the variance of the

"market" return itself—that is, each asset's "beta." Figure 1 shows the

1960—1980 quarterly values of these "betas" computed on a trailing

eight-quarter basis for the five aggregate assets defined in Table 1,

with the "market" portfolio defined in each quarter simply as the total

of the five aggregate assets.43

values over time results in

improve the fit (after correction for degrees of freedom) of the estimated

asset demand equations. Pmong the individual "betas," those for long—term

debt and    equity   are each significant at the .05 level   in   two esimated

equations, although in neither case is one of the two the "own" equation.

The other three "betas" are rarely if ever significant. These values are

at best difficult to interpret, however, because they represent the matrix

of impact effects Z associated with the "betas," rather than the

corresponding matrix of equilibrium effects F.44 The usual ..           coefficients
on the expected      returns appear to indicate that short-term debt and equity
are    substitutes   while long-term debt and equity are complements, but in

the presence of the "betas" these coefficients no longer bear the same

structural interpretation as in (7) and (8).      Moreover, the relevant
test    statistic value, X2(l0) = 81.1, once again warrants rejection       of

the    symmetry restriction at any plausible significance level.

        In sum, the incluion in the analysis of summary information

describing the changing stochastic structure of asset        returns does
apparently   affect the estimated substitution properties of the asset

demand system,   but the properties of the expanded   system do     not necessarily
represent   an improvement and hence the associated estimates do not give
grounds for much confidence.

V. Concluding Comments

      Table 19 brings together the respective estimates of the elasticity

of substitution between debt and equity securities developed throughout

this paper, including values implied on the basis of optimal asset demand

behavior in relation to actual asset return properties during 1960-1980,

as well as values estimated on the basis of the observed portfolio behavior

of the U.S. household sector over this period. As is clear from this set

of comparisons, there is little ground here for drawing any conclusion at

all about even the sign, much less the magnitude, of the substitutability

of short-term debt and equity. Although the implied optimal behavior

indicates that these two assets are substitutes, the observed behavior

indicates that households have treated them as complements. By contrast,

the values assembled here consistently indicate that long-term debt

and equity are indeed substitutes. Moreover, with a few exceptions

the various quantitative estimates of the associated substitution

elasticity are quite closely clustered around the value •Ø35•45

      For several reasons, it is difficult to know what (if any) broader

economic and financial conclusions to draw from these results. Even for

the one fairly consistent result that runs throughout the paper, the

substitutability of long-term debt and equity, focusing on the sign

leads to different implications than does focusing on the magnitude.

At   one level, the finding that (long-term) debt and equity are substitutes
validates   the standard assumption underlying a variety of familiar models

in monetary economics and finance. At the same time, if the elasticity is

really only —.035, then many of these models' more important substantive

conclusions do not follow.

       In addition, the analysis undertaken here indicates several conclusions

at   a more detailed level that also warrant caution: First, while the

observed variance—covariance structure of real asset returns in the

United States during 1960—1980 implies that debt and equity securities

are substitutes, the variance-covariance structure changed between the

1960s and the 1970s, and the resulting differences imply sharply changed

optimal substitution responses of the demand for debt and equity to their

respective expected returns. For the relationship between short-term

debt and equity, even the implied sign of the relevant optimal response

differs between the two sub—samples.

         Second, the estimated substitution properties of assets other than

long—term   debt and equity do not bear much systematic resemblance to
the   optimal responses implied by the observed variance—covariance

structure. The system of asset aggregation employed does not appear

to affect this conclusion in an important way, nor does taking explicit

account of the nonstationary stochastic return structure appear to

improve the relevant estimates.

         Third, the data consistently warrant rejecting the hypothesis

of symmetrical asset demand responses to variations in expected yields

on alternative assets. This result does not contradict the theory of

portfolio behavior based on expected utility maximization in general, but

it does contradict the familiar specific form of that theory relying on

joint normal (or lognormal) assessments of asset returns and on constant

relative (or absolute) risk aversion.

         To be sure, the empirical analysis presented here does not lack

limitations to provide potential explanations for the more perplexing

aspects   of these results. The treatment of the aggregate household
sector as if it were one individual's portfolio, the exclusion of
                                      —31—




nonfinancial assets (and hence of liabilities), the use of actual instead
of instrumented   returns except for capital gain and loss components, and

the simplicity of the approaches taken to allow for means-of-payment

services and transactions costs all constitute potential reasons for

believing that there may well be substantial discrepancies between the

behavioral parameters estimated here and the corresponding actual

properties of household portfolio behavior.

       Even so, the troubling possibility remains that the most important

explanation for the problematical aspects of the results found here is

instead that the expected asset returns and the associated variance—

covariance structure inferred here do not closely correspond to the

perceptions that investors actually held. One potential reason for

suspecting descrepancies, of course, is the ever—present need for arbitrary

assumptions in order to proxy unobservable expectations.46 Even more

troubling, however, is the possibility that investors systematically

misperceived the real asset returns they confronted — in other words,

that investors not only lacked perfect foresight about each quarter's

capital gains and losses but, even over a substantial period of time,

failed to understand the basic properties of the distributions generating

real returns. With four of five assets exhibiting negative mean real

returns over the entire two decades, and the implied optimal holdings

consistent with those mean returns positive for only two of the five assets,

it is difficult to reject out of hand the possibility that investors went

through much of this period consistently anticipating more favorable returns

than in fact materialized. That such behavior presents formidable

obstacles to formal analysis, or even that it contradicts fashionable

ideas about the formation of expectations, cannot rule it out.

 of   the Cianging Roles of Debt arid Equity     in   Financing   U.S. Capital

 Formation,    sponsored by the American Council of Life Insurance. I

 tance and   many helpful discussions; to Zvi Bodie, Stephen Goldfeld,

1. Tobin (1961) relied on this distinction in arguing that, if it were

   necessary to aggregate debt with either money or equity in a macro-

   economic model, the former choice would be superior. Subsequent

   empirical work emphasizing the same distinction has included Fama

   and Schwert (1977) and Bodie (1982).

2. This line of reasoning also leads to a distinction, which lies beyond

   the scope of this paper, between default-free government debt and

   defaultable private debt.

3. Exceptions arise, however, as in corporate merger or acquisition

   transactions settled by direct exchanges of securities.

4. See, for example, Arrow (1965) or Cass and Stiglitz (1970).

5. For evidence supporting the assumption of constant relative risk

   aversion, see Friend and Blume (1975). Although Fama (1965) and

   others have shown that individual securities returns are not strictly

   normally (or lognornially) distributed, Linther (1975) has shown that
    the approximation involved here is close enough for most purposes,

    and more recently Fama and MacBeth (1973) have also relied on the

    normality assumption. See Friedman and Roley (1979b) for the explicit

    derivation of expressions (7)—Cu)   below under   the assumptions of

    constant relative risk aversion and joint normally distributed return

    assessments. (These two assumptions are not strictly compatible,

    because normality in principle admits negative gross returns for

    which constant-relative-risk-aversion utility is not defined; but

    the approximation involved here is hardly troubling.)

6. The rationale for mean—variance analysis provided by Samuelson (1970)

    and Tsiang (1972), for example, suggests that mean—variance analysis

    per se is only an approximation that depends on (among other factors)

    a small time unit. The time unit used in the empirical work presented

    in this paper is a calendar quarter. Although the observed variation

    of some asset prices is large over this time unit, it is the expected

    variation that matters here.

7. More precisely, under constant relative risk aversion symmetry holds

   only as an approximation that is acceptable as the time unit is small;

   see again foothote 6. Symmetry would hold exactly in this model only

   under the alternative assumption of constant absolute risk aversion.

   See Roley (1983) for a thorough analysis of the conditions determining

   symmetry in asset demand systems.

8. Here and throughout this paper, elasticities of substitution C

   are defined in terms of net returns r as is more typiOal in the

   portfolio demand literature, rather than gross returns (1 +    r)
   as would be analogous to the consumer demand literature because of

   the reciprocal relationship between expected gross returns and asset
     prices. Because the marginal responses       are invariant to this

     distinction, the corresponding gross—return elasticities just equal

     the net-return elasticities as shown in (15) but with (1 +   r) in
     place of r.

 9. Uniformly nonnegative partial correlations imply uniformly nonnegative

     simple correlations, of course, so that the latter is also a necessary

     (though weaker) condition for gross substitutability of all assets

     when a risk—free asset exists.

10. Even in the presence of a risk—free asset, it is just as easy to

     inspect the     directly   as to compute the partial correlations on

     which Blanchard and Plantes focus.

11. These data, from the Federal Reserve Board's flow-of—funds accounts,

     give market values for equity and par values for all other assets.

     Because interest rates exhibited an upward secular trend during

     1960—1980, the period analyzed here, par-value data presumably overstate

     holdings of long-term debt. This problem does not arise for money or

     for time and saving deposits, and it is too small to be of consequence

     for short—term debt.

12. See Jones (1979) for a careful treatment of the conditions required

     for asset aggregation. Section III below briefly considers two further

     alternative asset aggregation schemes.

13. Some preliminary experimentation using the respective price deflators

     for gross national product and for personal consumption expenditures

     indicated that the results presented in this paper are not sensitive

     to the choice of specific inflation measure.

14. Because the Internal Revenue service data needed to estimate these

     marginal tax rates for 1980 were unavailable as of the time of writing,
       the 1979 rates were used to calculate 1980 after-tax returns. No

       major tax changes occurred in 1980.

15.    For examples of work based on interest rate surveys, see Friedman

       (1979b) and Kane (1983).

16. As Smith points out (see his comments below), Table 4 shows

       the   i,incondjtional variance—covariance structure of returns. Hence
       it both overstates and understates investors' knowledge. The overstate-
      ment comes from implicitly giving investors, within the sample,

      knowledge of the full-sample return distribution parameters. The

      understatement comes from ignoring investors' use of the serial

      correlation properties of returns. Smith's suggestion of using

      regressions (perhaps with rolling samples) to derive conditional

      estimates is sensible, and I plan to implement it in further work

      along these lines. The use of the "beta" values derived in Section

      IV below is analogous.

17. The results found by Friend and Blume (1975) suggest a value of p

      between I and 2.      More recent work by Grossman and Shilier (1981),

      using altogether different evidence, suggest a greater value. Bodie

      et al., in this volume, assume p = 4.

18. The corresponding gross—return elasticities are ESE = —.836         and
             = —1.23.   Because the gross—return means are positive,

      it is also possible to calculate the analogous gross—return elasticities

      of   substitution referring to the response of the demand for equity
      to the expected return on either short-term or long—term debt.
      These elasticities are EBS =     —.124   and   = —.334,   respectively.
19. The finding that investors would      not have held positive amounts of

      long-term debt under these assumptions is familiar; see Bodie (1982)
     and Bodie et al. in this volume. What is surprising here is that,

     in the presence of money and time and saving deposits, as well as

     short—term debt, under these assumptions investors would not have

     held positive amounts of short-term debt either.

20. Deriving 6   directly   from the underlying expected utility maximization

     would require an explicit representation of the transactions process

     and the associated role of means—of—payment services.

21. The analysis here includes only the assets that households own directly

     and via personal trusts. Pn alternative approach would be to include

     as well assets in which households have an interest via pension and

     insurance arrangements. Inferring the risk properties of pension and

     insurance assets would be highly problematical, however (unless, of

     course, the pension or insurance intermediary form were treated simply

     as a shell performing no risk—transformation services at all). In

     the limit, if all assets in the economy were aggregated together and

     imputed to the household sector as ultimate owner, there would be

    no basis for distinguishing the resulting "asset demand" equations

     from the corresponding "asset supply" equations.

22. The purpose of this procedure is to generate series of seasonally

     adjusted end—of-quarter asset stocks without any gaps or inconsistencies

     due to splicing of data series. (The Federal Reserve System does not

     construct such series.)

23. Out of $1,494 billion of household sector liabilities outstanding

     as of yearend 1980, $971 billion consisted of mortgage debt and

     $385 billion of installment and other consumer credit.

      where the standard errors are in per cent per annum.                            In light   of

      the familiar random-walk rendering of the efficient market hypothesis,

      it is interesting to note how much of the variance of observed capital

      gains (which are just transformations of observed price changes) even

      relatively simple autoregressive processes achieve — ex                           post.
      Multivariate analogs to these equations, including also lagged values

      of    the associated coupon or dividend/price yields as well as short—term
      yields, produce 2 = .47 and            SE = 9.66      for long-term debt capital
      gains, and 2 = .36 and SE =            19.77      for equity capital            gains. These
      returns    are based on month-average data for the last month in each
      quarter, so that       Working's (1960)          point about spurious autocorrelation
      applies.    Even so,     the fit of these (ex post) equations is striking.
25.   The table excludes the estimated values of                    and ii, so as to         avoid

      diverting   attention (and allocating space) to results not central to
      the   paper's objectives. Subsequent tables of empirical results

      presented   below     reflect the same selectivity.

26.   The expected returns evolve not independently, of course, but by
      the market—clearing behavior of asset demanders and           asset   suppliers

       (including, to a limited      extent,   households). To the extent that

      households' behavior is a major element determining market—clearing

      returns, these returns       are   not really predetermined in (16), and      an
      instrumental variables procedure is appropriate. Here only             the   capital

      gain component of the returns on long-term debt and           equity are
      instrumented.

27. In previous work I have criticized this partial adjustment model for

      not adequately reflecting the greater. sensitivity to expected returns

      of   the allocation of new cash flows in comparison to the re—allocation
      of existing asset holdings under most transactions cost technologies,
      and have suggested an "optimal marginal adjustment" model as an
      alternative; see, for example, Friedman (1977). Applying the optimal
      marginal adjustment model in the context of the analysis presented
      below   is an object left here for future work.

28.   The price and population variables used to deflate the nominal
      magnitudes     are the consumer price index (1967 =       1.00) and the total
      U.S. population (in millions). For purposes of comparison with the

      magnitudes shown in Tables 1 and         6,   their respective 1980:IV and

      1960-80   mean values are 2.658 and 1.322 for the price index, and

      228.6   and   204.9   for population. Using the current period's price

      (and population) to deflate the vector of lagged asset stocks in (18)

      represents a multivariate generalization of the "nominal—adjustment"

      model suggested by Goldfeld (1976).

29. In terms of shares of the 1960—1980 mean portfolio, the five standard

      errors (in the order used in the tables.) are .00136, .00377, .00482,
      .00187, and    .00061.

30.   Because the five equations being estimated all share identical sets
      of regressors, full-inform&tion maximum likelihood is equivalent to

      ordinary least squares. As a check, the equations were actually

      estimated twice, once using each method. The corresponding sets of

      results were identical.

31. More precisely, each equation was. estimated three times: twice as

      explained   in footnote 28 (without any   constrained values) and then

      a   third time,   by maximum likelihood, with the       held fixed at the

      values estimated (identically) the first two times. Fixing the

      0.. in this way does not affect the estimated values of the other

      coefficients, but does affect the associated t—statistics.

32. The literature associating an implicit nonpecuniary return to holding

      money balances is potentially instructive here; see, for example,

      Barro and Santomero (1972) and Klein (1974).

33. As is the case for the .       . coefficients   shown in Table 9, the
                                 1]
      t—statistics   reported in Table 10 are derived by taking the

      values as given. Here the system of equations was first estimated

      by the nonlinear maximum-likelihood method, subject to the symmetry

      restriction on B but no restriction on 0. The resulting 0.. values

      were those imposed on the final estimation. Once again, this

      procedure does not affect the estimated values of the coefficients,

      but it does affect the associated t-statistics. The summary statistics

      shown in Table 10 are comparable to those in Table 9, in that they

      refer to the initial joint estimation of the 0 along with the

      other coefficients.
34. Roley (1983) also rejected the symmetry restriction. From an inspec-

     tion of the pattern of signs among the off-diagonal          values shown

     in Table 9, it appears as if only the coefficients in the ow and

     column corresponding to money and     its   expected retuxn are inconsistent
     with   symmetry of matrix B. Nevertheless, an     attempt to estimate (18)
     subject   to a symmetry constraint applied only to the remaining four

     rows and columns   of   B yielded unsatisfactory results.

35. The implied coefficient of relative risk aversion is —1.68, with

     t—statistic —4.3.

36. This alternative aggregation scheme is the one proposed by

     Smith; see his comments in this volume.

37. See 1ndo and Shell (1975) for a theoretical justification for this

     two—part strategy. Several authors have investigated empirically

     the allocation of the household sector's liquid asset portfolio;

     see, for example, Fortune (1972).

38. Using simply the short-term debt return, as suggested by Smith,

     yleids essentiaiiy iaenticai. resuits.

39. See Friedman (l979a) for a discussion of the information acquisition

    process in a parallel context in the macroeconomics literature.

40. A break at mid 1970 not only represents the sample midpoint but also

    roughly corresponds to several familiar changes in the objective

    circumstances determining real asset returns, including the Federal

    Reserve System's adoption of a monetary aggregate target in February

    1970 and its suspension of Regulation Q interest ceilings on large

    time deposits in June 1970. More broadly, but also a qood deal more

    roughly, the l970s were a decade of slower real growth, more frequent
      business recessions, faster price inflation, less capital formation,

      and larger federal government deficits than in the 1960s. There is also

       substantial evidence of a further break associated with the Federal

      Reserve's further change in operating procedures in October 1979 —

      see, for example, Friedman (1982) —but splitting the 1960—1980
      sample    at that point would serve little purpose here.
41. All implied substitution elasticities shown in Table 17 have unchanging
      sign across the two sub—samples except that between short—term
      debt and    equity,   but the elasticities of substitution between long-term
      debt   and money   and   between   long-term debt and   time   deposits differ
      in    sign from the corresponding implied elasticities for the full

      sample shown in Table 5

42. Friedman (1980) and Friedman and Roley (1979a) dealt with this problem

      by selectively including moving-average variances (but not covariances)

      in estimated asset demand equations.

43. Hence the "market" portfolio excludes nonfinancial as3ets; see again

      th M iiitn in SI-ion T
44.   Programming the nonlinear estimation package to solve directly for

      the y.., analogously to      the s..,   would make proper convergence of
      the   nonlinear   maximum likelihood estimation problematical.

45. On the basis of the mean equity return of 3.13%, used in calculating

      all of the full—sample elasticities shown in Tabl 19, a mean—return

      elasticity of - .035 corresponds to a gross—return elasticity of

      —1.15.
