                                                ABSTRACT

There is limited existing evidence justifying the economic case for state education policy. Using newly-developed
measures of the human capital of each state that allow for internal migration and foreign immigration,
we estimate growth regressions that incorporate worker skills. We find that educational achievement
strongly predicts economic growth across U.S. states over the past four decades. Based on projections
from our growth models, we show the enormous scope for state economic development through improving
the quality of schools. While we consider the impact for each state of a range of educational reforms,
an improvement that moves each state to the best-performing state would in the aggregate yield a present
value of long-run economic gains of over four times current GDP.

1. Introduction
     Education policy is largely the province of individual U.S. states. And to this end, it is
common for people campaigning to be governor to proclaim a dedication to being the “education
governor.” Yet from the standpoint of state economic development, it is not entirely clear what
improving a state’s schools might mean. Most discussions, particularly in the post-NCLB era of
U.S. schools, focus policy attention on student achievement, but most of the evidence on
economic outcomes of schooling does not do so. This paper evaluates the economic implications
of improved educational achievement and provides projections for individual states of how
economic development would be altered by school improvement.
     A variety of existing studies provide suggestive implications of educational improvement,
but on closer inspection few are directly related to the policy discussions going on across U.S.
states. Extensive analysis addresses the role of human capital in determining individual incomes.
Other studies delve into how human capital affects growth and development from an
international macroeconomic perspective. Yet a vast majority of this work takes the expedient of
measuring human capital simply by school attainment – the amount of time spent in school.
Notwithstanding some discussion of high school and college completion, the vast majority of
policy discussions are about achievement and the quality of schooling. These discussions
implicitly underscore the fact that what students know and can do at any point in the schooling
process varies dramatically and in important ways.
     Two conclusions follow from recognizing that human capital is measured imperfectly and
incompletely by school attainment. First, the existing justifications for many policy actions,
while widely accepted, are not entirely appropriate and may even point policy in the wrong
directions. For example, an over-emphasis on high school completion, such as through
promotion of GED diplomas, could lead to ignoring more fundamental learning objectives.
Second, the standard evidence on the economic returns to human capital does not provide a
viable way of calculating the economic benefits related to the relevant school improvement
programs found in the current policy debates. Economic analyses based just on whether a
program affects school completion can distort both costs and benefits of programs, leading to
incorrect decisions. 1

     1
       For example, various analyses in Belfield and Levin (2007) evaluate programs in terms of their impact on
high school graduation rates without regard to quality considerations.


                                                           1
    This paper makes two contributions to the literature on economic benefits of education.
First, we develop and analyze more refined measures of educational achievement for workers
across U.S. states. These measures allow us to estimate how state growth and development is
related to the quality of schools and of workers. Second, using these estimates, we project state-
by-state estimates of the future benefits of various educational reforms.
    Estimation of the impact of achievement differences across states is complicated. The
common reliance on school attainment measures reflects in many ways the availability of data –
across individuals, across states, and across countries. Going beyond school attainment generally
requires using specialized data sets that often do not suit the purposes of the analysis. Moreover,
when focused on U.S. states, it is important to understand the high degree of mobility of the U.S.
population, implying that policies of one state may have significant implications for others as
workers move and take their human capital with them. A portion of this analysis must therefore
address construction of appropriate workforce measures of human capital that are relevant to
consideration of state human capital policies.
    Our analysis of state economic development allows us to estimate the economic gain from
improving the quality of K-12 schools in each state. Consistent with analysis of country
differences in growth rates, we estimate growth regressions across U.S. states. We find that there
is a strong relationship between a state’s growth and the quality of its workforce. Our measures
of the human capital in each state directly link the productive skills of the workforce to the
quality of schools in the state.
    Using our state growth results, we project out the economic value of improving schools in
each state. While we consider a range of reform scenarios for education policy, our results
suggest that feasible quality improvements are associated with very large economic returns that
could exceed the total spending on K-12 education. For example, the value of a reform that
would lift each state to the currently top-performing state would amount to an aggregate $76
trillion for the United States. Our analysis shows that, because of the large differences in states’
current achievement levels, the economic value of such a reform differs widely across states.
    Our analysis also offers a cautionary message about state educational reform. Because of the
close interrelationships among states brought about by the mobility of the population, it is very
much in the interest of all states jointly to improve on the quality of schools. The incentives to
educate youth and the gains from doing so are greatest when all states simultaneously improve



                                                    2
their schools. Our results show the extent to which the incentives for individual state action are
reduced by outmigration of its former students.
     Section 2 reviews the existing research on the impact of human capital on economic growth
that forms the foundation for this study. Section 3 describes how we develop cognitive skills
measures for each U.S. state. Section 4 presents results of growth regressions across U.S. states.
Section 5 introduces the projection model. Section 6 presents results on the projected economic
gains from a number of educational reforms for each U.S. state. Section 7 concludes.


2. Some Foundational Research
     For state policy, two kinds of economic impacts of education are relevant. The first is simply
the impact on individual citizens: How different are economic outcomes if an individual has
more human capital? The second involves the macroeconomic outcomes for the state: How is
state economic development altered by changing the human capital of the state? This analysis
focuses on the second topic of the aggregate effects of schooling on state economic development,
a topic that has received relatively little analysis. The impact of education on individuals has
been extensively studied and is largely subsumed in the consideration of aggregate outcomes. 2
     While policy discussions of state economic development often range over a variety of
topics, a primary policy instrument is invariably the nature and performance of the public
schools. Unfortunately, the existing analysis frequently suffers from poor and indirect measures
of schooling outcomes. Instead of actually measuring the skills of individuals, these studies rely
on a simple proxy – school attainment, or the average years of schooling of the population. This
measure has prima facie support, because a primary purpose of schooling is increasing the skills
of citizens. It also proves convenient, because of its ready availability in individual data and in
aggregate state and national data.
     Nonetheless, measurement issues are severe and compromise investigations of the growth
implications of educational improvements. 3 The inappropriate measurement of skills introduces
significant analytical problems. More importantly, it also removes the analysis from the key
policy issues surrounding school quality.

     The most relevant prior research comes from cross-country analyses that focus on the impact
of knowledge capital, or the aggregate skills of countries, on international growth. This cross-
country analysis is far more extensive than analysis of within-country growth, and it is relevant
to development across regions of the U.S. 4 This research not only provides the motivation for our
subsequent state analysis but also indicates how to interpret our state estimates found in this
analysis.

2.1 Human Capital and Economic Growth

     Prior theoretical and empirical work – largely developed in an international context – has
pursued a variety of specifications of the underlying growth process. 5 A simple characterization
of this, however, is that growth rates can be considered as a function of workers’ skills along
with other systematic factors. Skills are frequently referred to simply as the workers’ human
capital stock.

                             growth = α1 human capital + α2 other factors + ε                                      (1)

This formulation suggests that nations or states with more human capital tend to continue to
make greater productivity gains than nations or states with less human capital, although it is
possible that any induced growth in productivity disappears over time. 6
     The empirical macroeconomic literature focusing on cross-country differences in economic
growth has overwhelmingly employed measures related to school attainment, or years of
schooling, to test the human capital aspects of growth models. This approach has been emulated
in cross-state analyses. Empirical applications have tended to find a significant positive
association between quantitative measures of schooling and economic growth.
     Nevertheless, these formulations introduce substantial bias into the picture of economic
growth. Average years of schooling is a particularly incomplete and potentially misleading
measure of education for comparing the impacts of human capital on the economies of different

     4
       Note that historically, empirical growth analysis focused on the time-series patterns for the U.S. as a whole;
see Denison (1985) and Jorgenson and Griliches (1967).
     5
       See the reviews in Hanushek and Woessmann (2008, 2015a).
     6
       A major difference of perspective in modeling economic growth rests on whether education should be
thought of as an input to overall production, affecting the level of income but not the growth rate in the long run
(augmented neoclassical models, as in Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992)) or whether education directly affects the
long-run growth rate (endogenous growth models as in Lucas (1988), Romer (1990), and Aghion and Howitt
(1998)). See Aghion and Howitt (2009) for a textbook introduction.


                                                             4
countries or states. It implicitly assumes that a year of schooling delivers the same increase in
knowledge and skills regardless of the education system. For example, a year of schooling in
Brazil is assumed to create the same increase in productive human capital as a year of schooling
in Korea or that a year of schooling in Mississippi is the same as a year in Massachusetts.
Formulations relying on this measure of human capital also assume that formal schooling is the
only source of education and that variations in non-school factors have negligible effects on
education outcomes and skills. This neglect of differences in the quality of schools and in the
strength of family, health, and other influences is probably the major drawback of such a
quantitative measure of schooling.
     The role of other influences is in fact acknowledged in a standard version of an education
production function as employed in a very extensive literature (see Hanushek (1986, 2002) for
reviews). This formula expresses skills as a function of a range of factors (expressed linearly for
expositional purposes):

      human capital = β1 schools + β2 families + β3 ability + β4 health + β5 other factors + υ       (2)

In general, human capital combines both school attainment and its quality with the other relevant
factors, including education in the family, health, labor-market experience, and so forth.
     Thus, while school attainment has been a convenient measure to use in empirical work
because the data are readily available across individuals, across time, and across countries, its
use ignores differences in school quality in addition to other important determinants of people’s
skills.
     A more satisfying alternative is to consider variations in cognitive skills as a direct measure
of the human capital input into empirical analyses of economic growth. Focus on cognitive skills
has a number of potential advantages. First, it captures variations in the knowledge and ability
that schools strive to produce and thus relates the putative outputs of schooling to subsequent
economic success. Second, by emphasizing total outcomes of education, it incorporates skills
from any source – including families and innate ability as well as schools. Third, by allowing for
differences in performance among students whose schooling differs in quality (but possibly not
in quantity), it acknowledges – and invites investigation of – the effect of different policies on
school quality.

2.2 International Growth

     The analysis of state growth in this paper has its foundation in cross-country growth
analysis, and the interpretation of results for state growth builds on basic international models.
To set the stage, we present an overview of basic results on long-term international growth. 7
     Table 1 presents the basic results for the association between educational outcomes and
economic growth in 1960-2000 for the sample of 50 countries for which both economic growth
data and measures of cognitive skills, or knowledge capital, are available from international
assessments of math and science. 8 The inclusion of (log) initial GDP per capita in all
specifications simply reflects the fact that it is easier to grow more rapidly when farther from the
technology frontier, because it is only necessary to imitate others rather than invent new things. 9
     When knowledge capital is ignored (column 1 of Table 1), years of schooling is significantly
associated with average annual growth rates in real GDP per capita in 1960-2000. However, once
the test measure of human capital is included (column 2), cognitive skills are highly significant
and years of schooling becomes statistically insignificant, as the estimated coefficient drops to
close to zero. Furthermore, the variation in cross-country growth explained by the model
increases from 21 percent to 67 percent when human capital is measured by cognitive skills
rather than years of schooling.
     The estimated coefficient on cognitive skills implies that an increase of one standard
deviation in educational achievement yields an average annual growth rate over the 40 years of
observation that is two percentage points higher. This historical experience suggests a very
powerful response to improvements in educational outcomes, particularly when compared to the
average 2.3 percent annual growth within the sampled countries over the past two decades.
     The final column of Table 1 includes two measures of the economic institutional structure of
countries. There is an extensive literature indicating that good economic institutions foster faster


     7
        See Hanushek and Woessmann (2012, 2015a) for a more complete description of the data, the estimation, and
the interpretation of the international growth models.
      8
        The specific cognitive skill measure used here averages the standardized country scores on all international
student achievement tests that have been performed between 1964 and 2003 in math and science at the primary
through end of secondary level. During this period, twelve separate international tests were administered that
produce 36 different scores for subject-year-age combinations. The scores from the different tests were combined on
a common metric through empirical calibration (Hanushek and Woessmann (2015a)).
      9
        As discussed further in terms of state growth in section 6.6 below, putting initial GDP per capita in
logarithmic form permits assessment of alternative forms of the growth model that have been suggested in the prior
literature; see Hanushek and Woessmann (2015a).


                                                            6
growth and may also affect the returns to cognitive skills.10 To deal with the effect of
institutions, in column 3 we simply add two common (and powerful) institutional measures
related to the quality of the underlying economic environment: openness of the economy and
security of property rights. The results show that cognitive skills continue to exert a positive and
highly significant effect on economic growth independent of the measures related to the quality
of institutions, although the estimated impact of cognitive skills is reduced from 2 to around 1.4
on average.
    These last estimates are particularly relevant to the growth experience of U.S. states. The
U.S. as a nation is generally regarded to have among the best economic institutions in the world,
on these and other dimensions. Looking into the future for the U.S., given its well-established
institutions, the impact of cognitive skills found in column 3 seems most appropriate, and we can
judge our state estimates below in relation to this international benchmark.

2.3 A Brief Discussion of Causality

    The fundamental question such analysis raises is whether the tight relationship between
cognitive skills and economic growth can be interpreted as a causal one that supports direct
policy actions. In other words, if achievement were raised, would growth rates be expected to go
up by a commensurate amount? Work on differences in growth among countries, while extensive
over the past two decades, has been plagued by legitimate questions about whether any truly
causal effects have been identified, or whether the estimated statistical analyses simply pick up a
correlation that emerges for other reasons.
    Knowing that the relationship is causal, and not simply a byproduct of some other factors, is
clearly very important from a policy standpoint. Policymaking requires confidence that by
improving academic achievement, countries and states will bring about a corresponding
improvement in the long-run growth rate. If the relationship between test scores and growth rates
simply reflects other factors that are correlated with both test scores and growth rates, policies
designed to raise test scores may have little or no impact on the economy.
    We present a summary of the investigation of causality in the international results, because
we largely rely upon these results in interpreting our subsequent state growth models. 11 While it


    10
         See North (1990), Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1991), and Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005).
    11
         This section summarizes the detailed analysis found in Hanushek and Woessmann (2015a), chapter 4.


                                                          7
is difficult to address the key identification issues conclusively, the combined evidence from a
variety of complementary analyses strongly supports a causal interpretation of the effect of
cognitive skills on economic growth.
     The early studies that found positive effects of years of schooling on economic growth may
well have been suffering from reverse causality. They correctly identified a relationship between
improved growth and more schooling, but incorrectly saw the latter as the cause and not the
effect (e.g., Bils and Klenow (2000)). As nations become richer, they buy more of all goods,
including schooling.
     There is a priori less reason to think that higher student achievement is caused by economic
growth. For one thing, scholars have found little impact of additional education spending on
achievement outcomes, in particular in the cross-country setting, so it is unlikely that the
relationship comes from growth-induced resources lifting student achievement. 12 But this
observation can be extended to investigate further the primary issues of identification that have
been previously discussed.
     First, specification tests show that the models in Table 1 are quite insensitive to different
measures of cognitive skills, various groupings of countries (including some that eliminate
regional differences), specific sub-periods of economic growth, and the inclusion of other
proposed factors including measures of geographical location, political stability, capital stock,
and population growth. These specification tests rule out some basic problems attributable to
hypothesized omitted causal factors that have been noted in prior growth work.
     Second, the most obvious reverse-causality issues arise because the analysis relates growth
rates over the period 1960 to 2000 to test scores for roughly the same period. But for a sample of
25 countries where test performance until 1984 can be related to economic growth in the period
1985-2009, the estimation shows a positive effect of early test scores on subsequent growth rates
that is almost twice as large as that displayed above. Indeed, this fact itself may be significant,
because it is consistent with the possibility that skills have become even more important for the
economy in recent periods.
     Third, the important international differences in test scores may not reflect school policies
but instead might arise because of health and nutrition differences in the population or simply


     12
          See the review of international evidence in Hanushek and Woessmann (2011a). For the U.S., see Hanushek
(2003).


                                                            8
because of cultural differences regarding learning and testing. However, instrumental variable
estimates based on institutional characteristics of each country’s school system (exit
examinations, autonomy, relative teacher salaries, and private schooling) yield essentially the
same results as presented in Table 1. This finding supports a causal interpretation of the effect of
cognitive skills as well as the conclusion that schooling policies can have direct economic
returns.
     Fourth, it is possible that countries with good economic institutions also have good school
systems but that schools themselves have no direct effect on growth. To circumvent this
problem, we consider the implications of differences in measured skills within a single economy
(the U.S.) by comparing immigrants to the U.S. who have been educated in their home countries
with immigrants from the same countries but educated just in the U.S. This comparison finds that
the cognitive skills of the immigrant’s home country lead to higher incomes, but only if the
immigrant was in fact educated in the home country. These results, which also hold when
Mexicans (the largest U.S. immigrant group) are excluded and when only immigrants from
English-speaking countries are included, rule out the possibility that test scores simply reflect
cultural factors or economic institutions of the home country.
     Finally, perhaps the toughest test of causality is relating changes in test scores over time to
changes in growth rates, essentially introducing country fixed effects. For 12 OECD countries,
the magnitude of trends in educational performance can be related to the magnitude of trends in
growth rates over time. Indeed, the gains in test scores are very closely related to the gains in
growth rates over time, a result consistent with a causal interpretation of the impact of test
scores. 13
     Each approach to determining causation is subject to its own uncertainty, but the combined
evidence consistently points to the conclusion that differences in cognitive skills lead to
significant differences in economic growth. Establishing the case of the international evidence on
causality provides considerable support for a causal interpretation of our subsequent state growth
models, where comparable investigations to address causality directly are more difficult.




     13
       It is very unlikely that the changes in growth rates suffer the same reverse causality concerns suggested
previously, because a change in growth rate can occur at varying income levels and varying rates of growth.


                                                             9
3. Stocks of Cognitive Skills of U.S. States
     The approach that we pursue in this paper is to duplicate the cross-country growth
regressions for U.S. states. We view this estimation as a natural extension of the international
estimation, but one that amplifies the international work. Specifically, given the commonly held
view that the operations of U.S. labor and capital markets are superior to those found in most
other countries, the U.S. growth results tend to show what the growth frontier looks like.
     Duplicating the international models, however, requires developing measures of the state
human capital stock – something that has not previously been available. 14 The fundamental
difficulty is that no direct measures of cognitive skills for the labor force in each state exist. We
have measures of skills of the student body by state from the National Assessment of
Educational Progress (NAEP), but the students are not the same as the adults in the workforce.
     Our analysis of deriving state human capital measures proceeds in three steps. First, we
construct mean test scores of the students of each state in order to estimate the cognitive skills of
those students who remain in the state and become part of the relevant labor force (section 3.1).
Second, we adjust state test scores for migration between states, assuming that migration is not
selective (section 3.2). Third, we adjust these scores for selectivity of the interstate migration
flows as well as for selective international migration (section 3.3). This discussion provides an
overall summary. The details of the data development can be found in a companion paper
(Hanushek, Ruhose, and Woessmann (2015), Appendix B). In our analysis of state growth
models below, we show the impact of each of these adjustments.

3.1 Construction of Average State Test Scores

     The NAEP provides reliable U.S. state-level test score data (see National Center for
Education Statistics (2014)), and we start by combining all available state test score information
into one average score for each state. 15 We focus on the NAEP mathematics test scores in grade




     14
        Some prior analysis has considered growth and income differences across states, but the measures of human
capital have focused on school attainment. See, for example, Tamura (2006) and Turner, Tamura, and Mulholland
(2013).
     15
        Throughout our analysis, our state sample for the growth analysis refers to 47 states. Alaska, Delaware, and
Wyoming are excluded from the analysis because of their GDP’s dependence on natural resources or finance; see
Hanushek, Ruhose, and Woessmann (2015) for details. In the later projections, we include all states.


                                                           10
eight. 16 For most states, NAEP started to collect eighth-grade math test scores on a representative
sample at the state level in 1990 and repeated testing every two to four years. From 2003
forward, these test scores are consistently available for all states. We use all available state
NAEP data through 2011. Note that an eighth-grader in 1990 would be age 35 in 2011, implying
that the majority of workers in the labor force would never have participated in the testing
program.
     The NAEP state-level test results, however, prove to be quite stable over time. An analysis
of the variance of grade eight math tests shows that 88 percent of test variation lies between
states and just 12 percent represents variation in state-average scores over the two decades of
observations due to changed performance or to test measurement error. Thus, we begin by
calculating an average state score using all available NAEP observations for each state. These
are estimated as state fixed effects in a regression with year fixed effects on scores that were
normalized to a common scale that has a U.S. mean of 500 and a U.S. standard deviation of 100
in the year 2011.
     Our primary analysis relies on these estimates of skills for students educated in each of the
states. Ranking states by their average test score, Minnesota, North Dakota, Massachusetts,
Montana, and Vermont make up the top five states, whereas Hawaii, New Mexico, Louisiana,
Alabama, and Mississippi constitute the bottom five states. The top-performing state over the
two decades (Minnesota) surpasses the bottom-performing state (Mississippi) by 0.87 standard
deviations. Various analyses suggest that the average learning gain from one grade to the next is
roughly equivalent to one-quarter to one-third of a standard deviation in test scores. That is, in
eighth-grade math, the average achievement difference between the top- and the bottom-
performing state amounts to some three grade-level equivalents, underscoring the importance of
attention to the skill differences of workers.




     16
        If we use reading test scores in grade eight, which are available only from 1998 onwards, the results are very
similar. NAEP also tests students in grade four but these are not available by parental education, which is vital
information for our adjustment for selective migration. We did construct mean state test scores for the different
grades and subjects, however, and they turn out to be very highly correlated. The correlations range from 0.87
between eighth-grade math and fourth-grade reading to 0.96 between eighth-grade reading and fourth-grade reading,
indicating that each of the test scores provides similar information about the position of the state in terms of student
achievement.


                                                             11
3.2 Adjustment for Non-Selective Interstate Migration

     The second step of our derivation involves adjusting for migration between U.S. states. We
start by assuming that migration is not selective and turn to a consideration of selectivity in the
migration process in the next section.
     Obviously, not all current workers in a state were educated in that state. From the Census
data, we know the state of birth of all workers in each state who were born in the United States.
On average, just 54 percent of the working-age population in 2010 is living in their state of birth
(see Figure 1), indicating that many were unlikely to have been educated in their current state of
residence. But there is also substantial variation across states. For example, in Nevada, only 17
percent of the state’s residents in 2010 report having been born there. At the other extreme, 77
percent of the population in Louisiana was born there. These numbers indicate that interstate
migration is a major issue when assessing the cognitive skills of a state workforce.
     To adjust for interstate migration, we start by computing the birthplace composition of each
state from the Census data. For each state, we break the state working-age population into state
locals (those born in their current state of residence), interstate migrants from other states (those
born in the U.S. but outside current state of residence), and international immigrants (those born
outside the U.S.). For the U.S.-born population, we construct a state-by-state matrix of the share
of each state’s working-age population born in each of the other states. For the purposes of the
growth models, the adjustments are based on state population shares for the year 1970, which is
the starting period of our growth analysis below.
     Assuming that interstate migrants have not left their state of birth before finishing grade
eight, we can then combine test scores for all U.S.-born workers of a state according to the
separate birth-state scores. 17 This adjusted skill measure thus assigns all state locals and all
interstate migrants the mean test score of their state of birth – which only for the state locals will
be equivalent to the mean test score of their state of residence.




     17
         This approach parallels that of Card and Krueger (1992), except our focus is on achievement in birth states
as opposed to resources. Across the United States as a whole, 86 percent of children aged 0-14 years still live in their
state of birth, so that any measurement error introduced by this assumption should be limited. With the exception of
Washington, DC (34 percent) and Alaska (53 percent) – neither of which is used in our analysis – the share is well
beyond 70 percent in each individual state (own calculations based on the 2010 U.S. Census data (Ruggles et al.
(2010)).


                                                             12
3.3 Adjustment for Selective Interstate and International Migration

     The next step in our analysis is to take into consideration that migration is, in fact, selective
and to also adjust for international migration.

Adjustment for Selective Interstate Migration

     The previously derived skill measure implicitly assumes that the internal migrants from one
state to another are a random sample of the residents of their state of origin. This obviously need
not be the case, as the interstate migration pattern may be very selective. For example, Ohio
university graduates might migrate to a very different set of states than Ohioans with less
education might migrate to – and it would be inappropriate to treat both flows the same. 18
     The NAEP scores of population subgroups by educational background provide an overall
suggestion of the potential importance of selective migration. Comparing the NAEP scores of
students from families where at least one parent has some kind of university education with
students from families where the parents do not have any university education, we find an
average difference of over 0.6 standard deviations for the U.S. as a whole.
     Against this background, to account for selective interstate migration we allow for different
migration patterns across states by education levels. In particular, we make the assumption that
we can assign to the working-age population with a university education the test score of
children with parents who have a university degree in each state of birth, and equivalently for
those without any university education. That is, from the Census data we first compute separate
population shares of university graduates and non-university graduates by state of birth for the
working-age population of each state. With these population shares, we then assign separate test
scores by educational category. This adjustment is done for interstate migrants to deal with
selectivity of in-migration, but also for state locals because of selective outmigration and
differential fertility which generate differences in the cohort composition between those in the
workforce and those taking the NAEP tests.




     18
        This selective migration was one of the fundamental critiques of Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996)
about the analysis of Card and Krueger (1992).


                                                         13
Adjustment for Selective International Migration

     A remaining topic is how to treat immigrants – those educated in a foreign country. On
average, international migration is less frequent than interstate migration, with more than 90
percent of U.S. workers born in the United States. However, recent years show large state
variation in this percentage: in 2010, 99 percent of the working-age population in West Virginia
was born in the United States, but only 70 percent of the working-age population in California
(see Hanushek, Ruhose, and Woessmann (2015), Figure 5).
     The simplest approach for treating immigrants (implicit in the prior adjustments that
effectively ignore foreign immigrants) is to assume that international migrants seek out places
where their skills fit into the local economy. Accordingly, immigrants can be assigned the mean
score of the locals in their current state of residence.
     But we also have more information for immigrants. From the Census data, we know the
country of origin of each immigrant. So for each country of origin, we can combine information
from the major international tests – PISA, TIMSS, and PIRLS 19 – and rescale these test scores to
the NAEP scale (Hanushek, Peterson, and Woessmann (2013)). 20 We determine whether a
person was educated in his or her home country by information on age of immigration into the
United States. These data allow us to add in scores for the foreign-born and foreign-educated
working-age population of each state.
     Presumably, selectivity is an even greater concern for international immigrants than for
interstate migration. We know that international migration in particular is a highly selective
process (Borjas (1987); Grogger and Hanson (2011)), implying that the mean test score of the
country of birth is unlikely to represent accurately the cognitive skills of the migrant group. The
United States has rather strict immigration laws, and skill-selective immigration policies
represent a substantial hurdle for potential immigrants (Bertoli and Fernández-Huertas Moraga
(2015); Ortega and Peri (2013)). In addition, individuals self-select into migration (McKenzie,
Gibson, and Stillman (2010)). Thus, for example, only the most skilled and motivated are able to
gather information on possible destination countries, and only they possess skills that are
rewarded in a foreign country. While generally framed only in terms of school attainment, the

     19
        PISA stands for Programme for International Student Assessment, TIMSS for Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study, and PIRLS for Progress in International Reading Literacy Study.
     20
        For countries of origin that did not participate in the international achievement tests, we imputed values by
regional averages; see Hanushek, Ruhose, and Woessmann (2015).


                                                             14
existing research on international migration mostly indicates that historically migrants who go to
developed countries are better educated, on average, than those they leave behind (Borjas (1987);
Chiswick (1999); Grogger and Hanson (2011)).
     While we do not have detailed information on the selectivity of migration from each
country, a first variant to adjust for selective immigration – parallel to the treatment of locals and
interstate migrants – would be to adjust international scores by the educational distribution of the
immigrant workforce in each state of current residence. 21 The past research on selective
immigration, however, has mostly included school attainment measures of skills. It is reasonable
to expect that immigrants are further self-selected within schooling attainment categories. If this
is true, then average test scores of the source country – either simple averages or averages by
parental background – may not describe actual migrant skill levels very well. Their true skill
level may exceed the home country mean test score, and even the mean test score within each
educational category.
     To account for this selection, we use the 90th percentile of the source-country skill
distribution. In this adjustment, we thus assume that the migrants are positively selected from the
source-country population – i.e., that they are much more skilled than those left behind. Note that
under this assumption, immigrants from a low-performing country would still be assumed to
score below immigrants from a high-performing country on average, as well as below better-
educated U.S. workers.
     The assumption of a positive selection may not hold for all source countries. In particular,
given the close geographic proximity and the substantial income differences, Mexicans – the
largest immigrant group into the U.S. at roughly one quarter of all immigrants – may constitute a
special group of immigrants that shows different selection patterns than the migrant population
from most other countries. 22 We therefore also consider an alternative adjustment for the
possibility that the character of immigrants from Mexico differs from that of immigrants from
other countries. Specifically, based on evidence in Kaestner and Malamud (2014) that Mexican
migrants to the U.S. are not a selected subgroup of their home country population, the alternative


     21
          While not reported here, results based on such an adjusted measure are very similar to the results reported
below.
     22
       Existing research on the selectivity of Mexican migrants comes to very different conclusions about the extent
to which they are selected from their home-country population (e.g., Chiquiar and Hanson (2005); Fernández-
Huertas Moraga (2011); Kaestner and Malamud (2014)).


                                                              15
measure assesses the skills of Mexican immigrants at the national Mexican mean (while
continuing to assess other immigrants at the 90th percentile). 23


4. Growth Models across U.S. States
     The basis for our subsequent projection analysis is estimation of growth models that
duplicate the international growth models for U.S. states. Further, we show the importance of
more accurate estimates of the human capital stock of each state.
     Looking across states is obviously different from the international comparisons earlier.
Looking across countries introduces assumptions that all countries are operating on the same
production function – even though GDP per capita in Uganda is only one-thirtieth that in the
U.S. Because the U.S. states can be more readily presumed to be operating on the same
production function, it is more natural to look at how human capital and other input differences
affect state incomes. At the same time, one might expect interstate movement of people and of
capital to erode differences in economic advantages.
     In this analysis, we focus on the average annual growth rate in real per capita state GDP for
the period 1970-2010. 24 This is related to (the log of) the initial level of GDP per capita in 1970,
(the log of) physical capital per worker, 25 school attainment, 26 and our cognitive skills measures.
Appendix Table A1 provides descriptive statistics.
     Table 2 duplicates the growth models in Table 1 except it now applies to U.S. states. The
overall results are remarkably similar. The first column provides the simple growth model based
just on school attainment as the measure of human capital. Without regard for quality, attainment
is significantly related to state growth rates. Nonetheless, as with the international models, these
estimates are quite misleading: any trace of the impact of pure school attainment disappears
when the measure of quality is included.
     23
         There may be other heterogeneity in the migrants from individual countries, but we have no way to
incorporate this into our estimates.
      24
         Real state GDP per capita of each state is constructed following the approach of Peri (2012), using nominal
GDP data at the state level from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (2013b). Nominal GDP are deflated to the base
year 2005 by the nation-wide implicit GDP price deflator (Bureau of Economic Analysis (2013c)). For real GDP per
capita, we divide total real GDP by total population from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (2013a).
      25
         Data on physical capital per worker in 1970 are provided in Turner, Tamura, and Mulholland (2013).
      26
         The U.S. Census micro data permit a calculation of school attainment for the working-age population of each
state (Ruggles et al. (2010)). We focus on the population aged 20 to 65 not currently in school. The transformation
of educational degrees into years of schooling follows Jaeger (1997). Due to their relatively weak labor-market
performance (Heckman, Humphries, and Mader (2011)), GED holders are assigned 10 years of schooling.


                                                           16
     The remaining columns investigate the alternative test measures of human capital. Column 2
takes average test scores with no adjustment for interstate migration or immigration, a measure
that we believe is quite imperfect. We then adjust for the scores of interstate migrants between
U.S. states (column 3). This adjustment brings us closer to our preferred adjustment, but it
ignores the selectivity on internal migration along with the character of international immigration
to each state.
     Our preferred measure of a state’s cognitive skills adjusts the internal U.S. migrants for
selectivity based on education levels and introduces the quality of the immigrants into each state.
The measure is based on the assumption that immigrants fall in the 90th percentile of the
cognitive skill distribution for their home country.
     The results of the preferred specification (column 4) reinforce our view that state growth is
very consistent with international growth. The estimate of the growth parameter of 1.42 is
essentially identical to the relevant international coefficient of 1.43 (column 3, Table 1), allowing
us to rely on the extensive robustness analysis, sensitivity testing, and causality analysis of the
international work. 27
     The final column (column 5) reports results of the alternative measure that assesses the skills
of Mexican immigrants at the national Mexican mean (while continuing to assess other
immigrants at the 90th percentile). Even given the relative importance of Mexican immigrants,
particularly for some states, the estimated growth coefficient is virtually unchanged.
     The marginal impact of cognitive skills on growth rates across states (using the estimates in
column 4 of Table 2) are shown in Figure 2. The remarkable consistency of the state growth
model with the international growth model lends confidence to basing projections of future state
growth on these results.


5. A Basic Framework for Growth Projections
     The focus of this paper is understanding what school improvement would mean for state
incomes. For this, we assume that our baseline model of growth (column 4, Table 2) holds into
the future. By this, a one standard deviation improvement in skills would imply a 1.4 percentage
point faster growth in state income in the long run. Of course, a one standard deviation

     27
        The preferred comparison of coefficients relies on the estimates adjusted for economic institutions, since the
U.S. already has high-quality institutions and the institutions are mostly constant across states.


                                                            17
improvement in state average scores is a huge change – more than the range of scores across
states today. Therefore, we consider a range of alternative achievement goals that appear quite
feasible.
     An important aspect of education policy is how it affects dynamic changes over time.
Education policy is not instantaneous, and it takes some time before the effects of any education
policy are fully felt. We consider a series of state changes that occur over ten years; i.e., current
students only move fully to higher achievement after ten years of reform. We assume that the
pace of student improvement is linear so that ten percent of the ultimate gain accrues each year.
     Of course, improvement of students is also not the same as improvement in the labor force.
The labor force improves only as new, more skilled students replace retiring less skilled workers.
We calculate how the average quality of the labor force changes by assuming that 2.5 percent of
the labor force retires each year and is replaced by better educated workers. This implies that the
labor force does not fully reach its ultimate quality for 50 years (10 years of reform followed by
40 years of retirements).
     We project the annual growth of each state in each year based on the average quality of the
labor force in each given year. 28 The projections assume that the mobility patterns across states
will hold in the future but that the size of the state populations will remain constant. In other
words, the mix of the workforce by state of education remains constant into the future. We look
at the implications for state GDP growth over an 80 year period, reflecting the expected lifetime
of somebody born today. Given the extended period of labor force reform, the largest impacts
clearly appear in the more distant future. In recognition of this, we weight early gains more
heavily than later gains. Specifically, we calculate present values by discounting future years at
three percent per year (implying that gains in 2095, after 80 years, are weighted only 9 percent as
heavily as initial year gains). 29


     28
        As indicated above, economists have used different models to characterize long-run growth. In section 6.6
below, instead of having growth rates directly dependent on the level of cognitive skills, we also consider the
possibility that growth rates depend just on the amount of change in cognitive skills.
     29
        A standard value of the social discount rate used in long-term projections on the sustainability of pension
systems and public finance is 3 percent (e.g., Börsch-Supan (2000)), a precedent that is followed here. As a practical
value for the social discount rate in cost-benefit analysis (derived from an optimal growth rate model), Moore et al.
(2004) suggest using a time-declining scale of discount rates for intergenerational projects that do not crowd out
private investment, starting with 3.5 percent for years 0-50, 2.5 percent for years 50-100. By contrast, the influential
Stern Review report that estimates the cost of climate change uses a discount rate of only 1.4 percent, thereby giving
a much higher value to future costs and benefits (Stern (2007)).


                                                             18
     With these parameter choices, we project out how the GDP of each state would develop with
and without the modeled reform. 30 The economic gain of each reform is then calculated as the
difference in discounted future GDP between a situation with and without reform. Appendix A
describes the different steps of this projection model in detail.


6. Economic Gains of Alternative School Improvement Programs
     We provide economic calculations for various plausible state improvement scenarios. The
scenarios differ in the magnitude of the improvement from reform and in the actions that other
states take toward reform. In particular, the interrelationships among states through migration
imply that individual state actions have a muted impact on economic growth when not
accompanied by complementary actions by other states.
     In order to put these improvements into perspective, Figure 3 displays the average annual
increases in NAEP scores between 1992 and 2011 by state. 31 These gains show that Maryland,
Florida, Delaware, and Massachusetts each were able to gain over 60 percent of a standard
deviation over the past two decades. Our baseline reform scenario below considers an
improvement of one-quarter standard deviation over a ten year period. All of the fourteen states
from Georgia through Maryland were able to obtain average gains at a rate sufficient to bring
scores up by this amount.

6.1 Scenario I: Improvement by a Quarter of a Standard Deviation

     Our baseline economic projections consider the impact on each state of having its workers
improve by one-quarter standard deviation. This is consistent with a variety of underlying
changes: a state improves its own students by ¼ standard deviation and keeps all of them in the
state; or a state improves its own students sufficiently more to make up for the fact that some will
leave; or the workers migrating into the state show the same improvement. In all three cases, the
aggregate effect is simply a ¼ standard deviation improved score of future workers in the state.



     30
         The growth of the economy with the current level of skills is projected to be 1.5 percent, consistent with the
projected growth in labor productivity from the Congressional Budget Office or the rough average of OECD growth
over the past two decades.
      31
         For a discussion of these calculations, see Hanushek, Peterson, and Woessmann (2013). Note that data are
available for only 41 states because not all states participated in the state-representative samples before 2003.


                                                             19
(Subsequently, we also consider the isolated improvement by each state that is not compensated
by improved immigrants).
    One-quarter standard deviation does not have much natural appeal, but it can be interpreted
readily from the current state distribution of NAEP scores (eighth-grade math in 2015). A gain of
¼ standard deviation implies that the lowest ranked state (Alabama) would move up to being 41st
in the ranking (currently California). Or alternatively, ¼ standard deviations would move the 8th-
ranked state (Virginia) to the top.
    In this scenario, the improvement is uniform across states in percentage terms. The gain
would translate into a 0.35 percentage point increase in the growth rate in the long run (Table 3).
This improvement, while seemingly modest, yields future increases in state GDP that have a
present value of 2.6 times current state GDP. There are a variety of ways to understand this, but
it effectively amounts to a level increase of (discounted) GDP of 5.6 percent on average –
considerably above the current total spending on education across the states. By the end of our
projection period (2095), state GDP would be more than 20 percent above that expected with the
current level of achievement in each state.
    The absolute magnitude of the increase of course depends on the size of the state. Because
California’s economy is the largest, it would see a present value of reform of more than $6
trillion. New York would see gains of more than $3.5 trillion.

6.2 Scenario II: Improvement to Top-Performing State

    An alternative reform would be bringing each state up to the best state over the past two
decades: Minnesota. This improvement clearly has varying impacts, depending on how far each
state is from Minnesota. Minnesota, by this scenario, stays the same, and another 20 states have
gains of less than the baseline scenario of 0.25 standard deviations (Table 4). Nonetheless, the
overall improvement for the nation is larger than the baseline scenario by fifty percent.
    Again, this scenario is meant to match a feasible scenario where the schools across the
nation are sufficient to bring up all students to high standards. Of course, since the schools are
not the only factor in achievement, this requires the schools in states with more disadvantaged
populations to improve even more than those with less disadvantaged populations.
    The average growth improvement in the long run for the U.S. would be one-half percentage
point higher with this improvement than with current skill levels. The overall present value of



                                                   20
gain is more than four times current U.S. GDP – or the equivalent of an average increase of 9
percent over the next 80 years.
     But there is considerable heterogeneity of the effects of such a reform across U.S. states.
States that perform close to the level of Minnesota such as North Dakota, Massachusetts, and
Montana would see relatively modest economic gains of less than 2 percent of discounted future
GDP on average. By contrast, states whose performance is rather distant from the top-performing
state such as Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, New Mexico, Hawaii, and California (as well as
the District of Columbia) would all see gains that exceed 15 percent of discounted future GDP on
average – or more than seven times their current GDP. Obviously, however, having the lowest
performing states move to equal those at the top within ten years is a very ambitious, and perhaps
unrealistic, scenario.

6.3 Scenario III: Improvement to Best State in the Region

     The ambition of the prior scenario is documented by the fact that the seven enumerated
states would have to improve by more than 0.6 standard deviations. This is the rate of
improvement seen by Maryland, the fastest improving state over the past two decades – feasible
but difficult in twenty years and likely unattainable in ten years.
     Therefore, we next consider a more modest scenario where each state improves to the best
state in its division.32 The largest required improvements (except for Washington, DC) are now
New Mexico (0.6 standard deviations) and Nevada (0.5 standard deviations) which are rising to
the level of the State of Washington. The overall average improvement in worker skills is now
0.18 standard deviations for the nation.
     This more modest improvement in worker skills still implies a present value of improved
GDP that averages twice current GDP (Table 5). This gain is worth 4 percent of discounted
future GDP.
     Again, the projected reform gains vary greatly across states. States such as New Mexico,
Nevada, Hawaii, California, Rhode Island, Arizona, Louisiana, and Mississippi (and
Washington, DC) would gain more than four times their current GDP, whereas by construction
all nine division leaders would see no improvement in achievement and thus no economic gain.

     32
       The division leaders in achievement are Wisconsin (East North Central), Kentucky (East South Central),
New Jersey (Mid-Atlantic), Montana (Mountain), Massachusetts (New England), Washington (Pacific), Virginia
(South Atlantic), Minnesota (West North Central), and Texas (West South Central).


                                                         21
6.4 Scenario IV: Getting Every Student at least to the Basic Level

     The prior scenarios imagine improvements across the full range of schooling. An alternative,
which is essentially a more limited variant of No Child Left Behind, is to bring all students (and
subsequent workers) at least up to the “basic skill level” as defined by NAEP (for calculations,
see Appendix B). According to NAEP, the basic level implies “partial mastery of prerequisite
knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade.” 33 In 2011, 27
percent of students in the U.S. fell below the basic level. Implemented across the United States,
this reform would raise average achievement by 17 percent of a standard deviation.
     Note, however, that this projection is a rather artificial policy change, because it assumes no
spillovers in quality to anybody starting with basic or above achievement. Not only is it difficult
to understand what kind of policies might produce such a pattern of gains but also it does not
match historical evidence across the NCLB era (Hanushek, Peterson, and Woessmann (2013)).
     One thing that this policy does promise is more inclusive growth. Specifically, it is designed
to bring up those with the lowest skill levels – just the group that has found it increasingly
difficult to participate effectively in the labor market. Given the strong relationship between
skills and individual earnings in the U.S. economy (Hanushek et al. (2015)), enhancing the skills
at the bottom would have a noticeable impact on the distribution of earnings, and ultimately
income, in the U.S.
     In terms of aggregate income, this reform would raise the level of future GDP by 3.8 percent
on average (Table 6). In 2095, GDP would be 15 percent higher than without the reform. Some
states with few current students falling below the basic level such as North Dakota,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, South Dakota, Montana, Texas, and New Hampshire would see
reform gains that are somewhat less than their current GDP (Figure 4). But some other states
with large numbers of students below the basic level such as California, Alabama, and
Mississippi (as well as the District of Columbia) would see gains exceeding three times their

       See https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/achievement.aspx, accessed April 18, 2015. Note that there is
confusion about various achievement levels. NAEP basic level corresponds roughly to the achievement level that the
average state chose to define as proficient under the federal NCLB (Hanushek and Lindseth (2009)). The
achievement level of PISA level 1 used in international projections is quite close to NAEP basic (Hanushek and
Woessmann (2015b)).

6.5 Scenario with Single-State Improvement and Outmigration

     The prior estimates provided a picture of the results of simultaneous improvement of schools
across the states. As a result, any locally educated student who subsequently moves to another
state is replaced by a student who has been on a similar path of skill improvement. What would it
mean for each state to be the only improving state?
     The implications of this alternative scenario are easiest to see in terms of the baseline
projections of Scenario II – all states improve up to the best state. But now on a state-by-state
basis, we assume that educational improvement applies just to the students who are both
educated in the state and remain in the state. In other words, the quality of education for in-
migrants does not improve. We also assume that the historical proportion of students educated
within each state that migrated out continues to be the same in the future. At the extremes, only
23.1 percent of the people born in Texas migrated out and are no longer living in the state, but as
many as 64.5 percent of the people born in Alaska migrated out (Figure 5). 34 Other states where
more than half of the people born in the state migrated out are Wyoming, North and South
Dakota, Montana, and Nevada.
     Given these historical rates of interstate mobility, the skill increase of the workforce that is
ultimately seen in each state is 0.24 standard deviations on average, instead of 0.38 standard
deviations when all states are moving to the best state. As a result, the gains for each state fall, on
average, from four times current GDP to on average 2.6 times.
     But the specific difference for each individual state is very important, because it shows how
the incentives change when states operate in their own local interest. This difference varies
greatly across states (Figure 6). 35 In states such as Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, South Carolina, and Tennessee with relatively little outmigration, results are not
much affected. By contrast, in states with substantial outmigration such as Alaska and Wyoming,
results decline dramatically.
     To be sure, the more skilled workers that migrate out of state will help the economy in other
states to which they move. It is just that the state making the investment sees a noticeably smaller
     34
           Note that because of changes in the size of the state population, the share of the state-born population that
still lives in the state can differ markedly from the share of the current state population that was born in the state (as
depicted in Figure 1). For example, Texas has the lowest rate of outmigration as a share of the state-born population,
but is a middling state in terms of the share of the current population born in the state. By contrast, Nevada has the
lowest fraction of the current population born in the state, but not the highest share of outmigration.
        35
           Detailed results are shown in Appendix Table A2.


                                                              23
improvement if the state is the only reformer. And this presumably lessens the interest in school
investment for each state.

6.6 Results for the Neoclassical Growth Model

     As noted above, in the economics literature on growth there have been differences of
opinion on the best way to categorize the long-run growth pattern. A fundamental distinction is
whether improved skills of the labor force lead to improved long-run growth rates or whether the
improved skills lead to some increased growth in the short to medium run while economies move
to a new steady state level, but no change in long-run growth rates. In the former (endogenous
growth), the more skilled labor force is instrumental in continuing productivity improvements.
This is the model underlying our growth projections reported so far. In the later (augmented
neoclassical growth), there is an immediate gain since skills are one of the inputs determining
GDP, but then growth converges back to the steady state rate.
     We can use our estimated growth models to project what would happen to future GDP in
each state under the neoclassical growth path. In particular, we take the growth of the production
frontier as 1.5 percent per year. The frontier is assumed to be what happens in the three states
with the highest rate of U.S. patents – California, New York, and Texas. 36 Other states will grow
faster in the short run as they converge to the frontier states, but then will settle into the 1.5
percent long-run growth.
     For this alternative projection, we again consider the baseline model of Scenario I of a 0.25
standard deviation improvement. With the 80 year projection, the gains are only slightly smaller
at 2.3 times current GDP as opposed to 2.6 times under the endogenous growth projections
(Table 7). 37 The impact of this alternative clearly happens near the end of our projection period,
so that GDP for the country in 2095 is 15.5 percent higher than the no-reform GDP, as opposed
to 21.6 percent greater with endogenous growth.
     In sum, the neoclassical projections are somewhat smaller, but they do not change the
overall conclusion of huge gains from skill improvement. This conclusion holds similarly across
all of the scenarios.

     36
         From 1963 to 2013, California (18.7 percent), New York (8.2 percent), and Texas (6 percent) account for
one third of all patents in the U.S. Source: TAF database maintained by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office

6.7 Alternative Parameter Choices

    The projections obviously depend upon the specific parameters used. The remaining rows of
Table 7 present summaries of how varying parameter choices affect the estimates of the
aggregate economic gains. Shortening the time horizon from 2095 to 2075 reduces the overall
gain by nearly half, indicating that the strongest gains accrue once the reform has reached the
whole labor force. Assuming that the educational reform takes 20 years rather than 10 years
reduces the overall gains by 18 percent.
    Given that the growth coefficient is estimated with some statistical uncertainty, the next two
rows report results when using a growth coefficient that is greater or smaller by one standard
error of the coefficient estimated in the underlying growth model in Table 2. That is, the growth
coefficient is taken at 1.96 and 0.88, respectively, as opposed to the best estimate of 1.42. The
final two rows use a discount rate of 2 and 4 percent, respectively, rather than the 3 percent of
the baseline model.
    Both parameter variations obviously have a substantial effect on the projected economic
value of improvement. But, the key element of the different parameter variations is that the gains
are uniformly very large.

6.8 Overall Summary

    We have presented a wide range of improvement scenarios. Table 8 provides an overall
summary of the aggregate effects. The overall effects of the various scenarios for the United
States as a whole range from $32 trillion for bringing just the lowest performing students up to a
basic level to $76 trillion from bringing all states up to the best performing state.
    But it is also clear that the different results vary greatly across the different U.S. states. As
indicated by the large standard deviations of the reform results across the U.S. states (reported in
parentheses), some states stand to gain even more from the specific reforms, whereas other states
(that are already at a higher achievement level) gain less than the modal state.
    Our projections so far have stayed within the limits of feasible reform scenarios based on
achievement levels and growth that have been observed inside the United States. In a final set of
projections, we can recognize the possibilities for improvement that can be seen in international
data (Hanushek and Woessmann (2015b)). Two straightforward comparison groups of students
are Canadian and Finnish students. Canada is an obvious comparison because of its proximity to



                                                    25
the U.S., both geographically and economically. Finland is included because of its demonstrated
improvement in international tests, making it a top performing country and one that the U.S.
might try to emulate. 38
     As indicated by the bottom two entries in Table 8, projections of economic growth for
reaching the Canadian level are very similar to those in Scenario II, because the top-performing
U.S. state over the last 20 years (Minnesota) is roughly at the level of the average Canadian
student. Finnish students, however, on average achieve 6 percent of a standard deviation above
Minnesota, or 44 percent of a standard deviation above the U.S. average. The aggregate
economic impact of bringing all students up to Finnish levels would be $89 trillion in present
value or 10.5 percent of the discounted future GDP, again with substantial variation across the
U.S. states.


7. Conclusions
     We have shown feasible ways to estimate the human capital stock for each U.S. state in a
way that is consistent with current policy discussions. In particular, we have assessed the
cognitive skills of the workforce in each state, reflecting the historically high rates of labor
mobility across states. Once done, we then are able to estimate state growth models which
interestingly align perfectly with the more extensive existing work on cross-country growth
models.
     These growth models permit explicit consideration of how policies to improve school
quality can be expected to affect the future income of each state. This consideration is
importantly based on the dynamics of improving the labor force including the time to improve
the schools and the deferred impact of school improvement on the quality of the future labor
force.
     The growth projections have a simple interpretation. According to past patterns of growth in
state GDP, there is a huge economic incentive for each state to improve its schools. Improved
schools lead naturally to higher skilled workforces, and the impact of skills of the workforce is
clear and strong.



     38
      The Canadian and Finnish achievement levels are taken from the available international tests, rescaled to the
NAEP scale in the same way as used to adjust the immigrants in our analysis in section 3.3 above.


                                                           26
     Past performance also shows that improving performance is possible. For example, our
baseline scenario of improving student performance by one-quarter standard deviation within ten
years is consistent with the historical gains in 14 states.
     The gains of such an improvement scenario over the lifetime of somebody born today are
enormous. An improvement of 0.25 standard deviations would yield gains (in present value
terms) that are 2.6 times current GDP, or 5.6 percent of discounted future GDP. To put this into
perspective, education spending on K-12 education by states and localities accounts for roughly
four percent of GDP in 2010. 39 Thus, our estimated gains would on average pay for all of the K-
12 education in the states and yield extra returns that could both deal with any current fiscal
problems of the states and make the citizens better off.
     The baseline gains assume that all states are moving simultaneously toward improvement. If
instead we considered only individual state improvements, the gains would fall by about 39
percent on average. The U.S. states are very interconnected through migration, and this has
immediate implications for the future of each state.
     The impacts of educational improvements clearly take a considerable time to be realized.
Improving the performance of today’s students does not lead to an improved labor force until
these students have left school and entered into employment and until more skilled workers
become a significant portion of the labor force. As a result, the economic gains come in the
future – beyond the normal election cycles for current politicians. To some, this discrepancy
between terms in office and the economic returns to improved schools implies that politicians
will not take optimal actions but instead will underinvest in improved schools. But, there are
clear other examples where politicians take long-run actions that far exceed election cycles:
actions of climate change or actions on procurement of new weapon systems for defense, for
example. The future economic well-being of the U.S. depends on improvement of the American
schools, and it seems overly cynical to presume that the elected leadership is incapable or
unlikely to take actions that are distinctly in the long-run interest of their country.




     39
      Education spending at all levels by states and localities accounts for 5.9 percent of GDP in 2010 (U.S.
Department of Education (2013), Tables 30-33). Two-thirds of that total goes to K-12 education.

Appendix A. Projection Model
       This appendix presents an overview of the projection model that is used to calculate the
gains from a reformed education system. See Hanushek and Woessmann (2011b, 2015a) for a
detailed description of projection models of educational reforms.

Reform Phases

       The projection model follows four phases:

Phase 1 (2015-2025): Introducing the reform

       In the first 10 years of the reform, the additional growth in GDP per capita is given by:

                𝑡𝑡                                                           1                𝑡𝑡 − 2015    𝑡𝑡−1
             Δ = 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔ℎ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ∗ Δ𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 ∗                           ∗           +Δ
                                                                    𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑔𝑔 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙       10

The growth coefficient is obtained from the growth regressions in section 4 and is set to 0.0142
for the main results. Δ𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 represents the growth in test score that is due to the reform. Each
year, only a fraction of the workforce is replaced by younger workers who have obtained a better
education. This is indicated by 1/working life, with the working life set to 40 years. The term
𝑡𝑡−2015
  10
          indicates that it takes 10 years for the reform to be completely enrolled and fully effective.


Phase 2 (2026-2055): Replacing older workers by workers of the reform

       After the first 10 years, the reform is fully effective and workers that join the workforce now
bring with them the total benefit from the reformed education system. However, for the period of
a working life, there will be still workers that have received their education under the old
educational system. They will be replaced by the new workers. During the next 30 years, the
additional growth can be described as follows:

                        𝑡𝑡                                                           1                 𝑡𝑡−1
                     Δ = 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔ℎ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ∗ Δ𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 ∗                           +Δ
                                                                            𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙

Phase 3 (2056-2065): Replacing workers who only partially obtained better education

       After 40 years (the time span of a working life), all workers that have not gone through the
reformed system are replaced by new workers. However, workers that obtained their education
during the phase-in of the reform only partially profited from the new education system. They

Cumulative Effect of the Reform

     The total value of the reform is given by the discounted differences between GDP with and
without reform. We calculate the gains from the improved system over 80 years, about the
expected life span of a child that is born today. The discount rate in the baseline scenario is set to
3 percent.

Appendix B. Computation of Test Score Gains for Scenario IV
      From NAEP, we know the percentage of students who perform below basic level for each
state. Knowing that the Basic Level for eight grade math requires at least 262 points (on the
original NAEP scale) 41 and assuming that test scores are distributed normally (with 𝜇𝜇 =
283.85, 𝜎𝜎 2 = 36.20), we can calculate the average test score for students performing below
basic level. The first step is to rescale the cutoff, so that it can be used with the adjusted NAEP
scores, which have a standard deviation of 100 and a mean of 500 in 2011:

                                                         262 − 283.85
                        𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 =                ∗ 100 + 500 = 439.64 ≈ 440
                                                            36.20

      Using this cutoff, the average test score for students below basic level is computed by
∑440
 𝑥𝑥=0 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥)∗𝑥𝑥
 ∑440
                  , with f(x) as the normal density function, which is parameterized with the state-
  𝑥𝑥=0 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥)

specific mean test score and the state-specific standard deviation. The gain for bringing each
student up to the basic level is then computed by s*(B–A), where s is the share of students who
perform below basic level, B is the threshold level for the basic level (B = 440), and A is the
average test score for those below B.

in 1970-2010 on the initial level of (log) real GDP per capita in 1970, average test scores adjusted for interstate
migrants by education and for international migrants by the 90th percentile in country of birth in 1970, average years
of schooling in 1970, and (log) real physical capital per worker in 1970 (mean of the unconditional variables added
to each axis). See column 4, Table 2.

Notes: The figure shows the present value of the reform in percent of current GDP when all states improve to the top-performing state (Minnesota) and when
each state improves individually (light parts of the bars). Washington, DC (181 percent for single-state improvement, 1,701 percent for all states improvement) is
missing for expositional purposes.

Notes: Present value of future increases in GDP until 2095 due to reform, expressed in billion 2015 dollars, as a
percentage of current GDP, and as a percentage of discounted future GDP. ‘GDP increase in year 2095’ indicates by
how much GDP in 2095 is higher due to the reform (in percent). ‘Long-run growth increase’ refers to increase in
annual growth rate (in percentage points) once the whole labor force has reached higher level of educational
achievement. ‘Increase in NAEP score’ refers to the ultimate increase in educational achievement due to the reform.
See text for parameters of the projection model.
