                                             ABSTRACT

There is a rich scholarly literature on sovereign default on external debt. Comparatively little is known
about sovereign defaults on domestic debt. Even today, cross-country data on domestic public debt
remains curiously exotic, particularly prior to the 1980s. We have filled this gap in the literature by
compiling a database on central government public debt (external and domestic). The data span 1914
to 2007 for most countries, reaching back into the nineteenth century for many. Our findings on debt
sustainability, sovereign defaults, the temptation to inflate, and the hierarchy of creditors only scratch
the surface of what the domestic public debt data can reveal. First, domestic debt is big -- for the 64
countries for which we have long time series, domestic debt accounts for almost two-thirds of total
public debt. For most of the sample, this debt carries a market interest rate (except for the financial
repression era between WWII and financial liberalization). Second, the data go a long ways toward
explaining the puzzle of why countries so often default on their external debts at seemingly low debt
thresholds. Third, domestic debt has largely been ignored in the vast empirical work on inflation. In
fact, domestic debt (a significant portion of which is long term and non-indexed) is often much larger
than the monetary base in the run-up to high inflation episodes. Last, the widely-held view that domestic
residents are strictly junior to external creditors does not find broad support.

                                            I. Introduction

        This paper is as much an exercise in archeology as in economics. We have

unearthed a vast trove of historical time-series data on domestic public debt for 64

countries ranging back to 1914. Our key sources are publications of the now-defunct

League of Nations, including updates until the early 1980s by its successor, the United

Nations. We also make use of national sources and work by scholars to supplement,

cross-check and extend the data, both back before 1914 for some countries plus forward

to the present for most. Although it may come as quite a surprise to most readers that

historical time series on domestic debt should be exotic for so many countries, it is. This

is in contrast to external sovereign debt, on which there is a vast literature.1 We are not

aware of any academic or policy study that uses similar data, certainly not one

encompassing such a long time period and so many countries.

        Indeed, historical data on domestic (internal) government debt has been ignored

for so long that many observers have come to believe that the issuance boom of the early

2000s is something entirely new and different.2 This perspective is based on the belief

that, historically, domestic government debt played only a minor role in the public

finances of most developing and post-conflict countries.3 The new data set thoroughly

dispels this notion. Our key findings can be summarized as follow:



1
  Domestic public debt is issued under home legal jurisdiction. In most countries, over most of their
history, it has been denominated in the local currency and held mainly by residents. By the same token, the
overwhelming majority of external public debt—debt under the legal jurisdiction of foreign governments—
has been denominated in foreign currency and held by foreign residents. Theoretical models that try to
explain default include Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) and Bulow and Rogoff (1989). Empirical studies of
external debt that range from in-depth case studies (such as the classics by Winkler, 1928, or Wynne, 1951)
to systematic cross-country analysis (Bordo and Eichengreen, 1999, Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer, 2006
and Tomz, 2007). Eichengreen (1991) provides an authoritative summary of the early literature.

  See for example, the IADB 2006 annual report, or the April 2007 IMF Global Financial Stability Report.

  See for example, Eichengreen and Hausman (1999), who mainly focus on the post 1980 period.


                                                                                                         1
         First, domestic debt is large—for the 64 countries for which we have long time

series, domestic debt averages almost two-thirds of total public debt; for most of the

sample these debts typically carried a market interest rate, except for the era of financial

repression after World War II. Second, recognizing the significance of domestic debt

goes a long way toward explaining the puzzle of why many countries default on (or

restructure) their external debts at seemingly low debt thresholds. In fact, when

heretofore ignored domestic debt obligations are taken into account, fiscal duress at the

time of default is often revealed to be quite severe.4 A third and related point is that

domestic debt may also explain the paradox of why some governments seem to choose

inflation rates far above any level that might be rationalized by seignorage revenues

leveraged off the monetary base (e.g., as in Cagan’s classic, 1956, article on postwar

hyperinflations). Although domestic debt is largely ignored in the vast empirical

literature on high and hyperinflation, we find that there are many cases where the hidden

overhang of domestic public debt was at least the same order of magnitude as base

money, and sometimes a large multiple.5

         Last, our paper offers a first attempt to catalogue episodes of overt default on and

rescheduling of domestic public debt across more than a century. This phenomenon

appears to be somewhat rarer than external default, but far too common to justify the

extreme assumption that governments always honor the nominal face value of domestic

debt. When overt default on domestic debt does occur, it appears to occur under



4
  This puzzling “debt intolerance” is examined by Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003).
5
  See Fischer, Sahay, and Vegh (2002) for an excellent treatise on this subject (and the classic papers that
are cited therein). A few theoretical treatments (for example Calvo, 1989) have recognized the potential
significance of nominal domestic debt. Yet, since many researchers have long believed domestic debt to be
relatively small and unimportant, the incentives to inflate it away have received scant attention in the
empirical literature.


                                                                                                           2
situations of greater duress than for pure external defaults—both in terms of an implosion

of output and marked escalation of inflation. It is important to note that we do not here

catalogue episodes of major de facto partial defaults, say through a sharp unexpected

increase in financial repression (e.g., of the type India and China still impose today).

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Since our new public debt database is

central to our analysis, we begin by describing some of its key features. Specifically, we

focus on four broad areas: the composition of public debt (domestic versus external); the

structure of domestic debt by maturity; the interest rates on domestic and external debt;

and, lastly, what little is known of its currency composition. Further details are discussed

in the Appendices.

       Section III introduces our approach to cataloguing defaults on domestic public

debt. Such defaults typically leave few footprints in the mainstream international or

business press and are therefore much more difficult to detect than external defaults

(which our database comprehensively catalogues). In section IV, we look at the

potential role of domestic debt during episodes of external default. Section V explores the

connection between high inflation and domestic debt in emerging markets and post-

conflict countries. Section VI attempts to shed light on the issue of who gets heavily

defaulted on more often, domestic or foreign residents.

       In our conclusion, we raise the question of whether the difficulties in unearthing

domestic public debt data should be addressed by an international agency that coordinates

greater transparency across sovereign debt issuers. The League of Nations once enforced

such reporting, although the results were under-publicized and subsequently forgotten.

Should not today’s multilateral lending institutions, such as the International Monetary




                                                                                            3
Fund and the World Bank, be able to do the same today, if not better? The IMF’s Special

Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) takes a step in that direction but only the most

recent figures appear and debt categories vary substantially by country. Absent a

borrowing history, it is impossible to conduct any meaningful credit analysis.

                           II. Domestic Public Debt: Some Features

        Unquestionably, the single most remarkable feature of our cross-country data set

is its apparent uniqueness. Until now, obtaining comprehensive long-term time series on

domestic debt has been extremely difficult for most countries. Even for the relatively

rich countries, the OECD database only goes back to 1980, and constructing long-term

time series from national sources is far less straightforward than one might imagine.

Outside the OECD countries, the dearth of data is stunning.

        Only recently, a few groups of scholars have begun constructing data for the

contemporary period. Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003) draw on national sources to

develop a data set for selected developing countries and emerging markets covering the

years 1990 to 2002. More recently, Jeanne and Guscina (2006) provide detailed data on

domestic debt for nineteen important emerging markets for 1980 to 2005. Cowan, Levy-

Yeyati, Panizza and Sturzenegger (2006) provide data for all the countries in the Western

Hemisphere from 1980 (or 1990) to 2004.6

        Figure 1 plots the share of domestic debt in total public debt for 1900 to 2006,

which averaged between 40 and 80 percent of total debt. See data appendix for data

availability by country. The figures in this chart are simple averages across countries,

but these ratios are also fairly representative for many of the emerging markets in the

        6
            Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) describe a companion database covering a broad range of related
variables, including external debt, that we also draw upon here.



                                                                                                         4
sample (including now-rich countries when they were still emerging markets, such as

Greece, Austria, and Spain).7 As the figure underscores, the data set here contains

significant representation from every continent, not just for a handful of Latin American

and European countries, as in most of the external debt literature.

        Of course, the experience is diverse. For advanced economies, domestic debt

accounts for the lion’s share of public-sector liabilities. At the other extreme, in some

emerging markets, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, domestic debt markets were dealt a

brutal blow by many governments’ propensity to inflate—or hyperinflate. For instance, in

the years following the hyperinflation of 1989 to 1990, domestic debt only accounted for

10 to 20 percent of Peru’s public debt. Yet, this was not always so. As with many other

countries in Latin America, the early (end of World War I) entries of the League of

Nations data show that Peru’s domestic debt then accounted for about two-thirds of

public-sector debt. Indeed, the share was even higher in the 1950s, when the world’s

financial centers were not engaged in much external lending.

        In addition to showing that the debt is large, the data also dispel the belief that

until recently, emerging markets (and developing countries) had never been able to

borrow long term. As Figure 2 shows, long-term debt constitutes a large share of the

total debt stock over a significant part of the sample, at least for the period 1914 to 1959.

(Over this sub-period, the League of Nations/UN database provides considerable detail

on maturity structure.) It may come as a surprise to many readers (as it did to these

authors) that modern bias towards short-term debt is a relatively recent phenomenon,

evidently a product of the “inflation fatigue” of the 1970s and 1980s.

        7
           Domestic public debt has never amounted to much in a few Latin American countries (Uruguay
stands out in this regard), and public debt markets are virtually nonexistent in the CFA African countries
(which originally were the Colonies françaises d'Afrique).

         Nor is the fact that many emerging markets are now paying market-oriented

interest rates on domestic debt new. Of course, during the post–World War II era, many

governments did repress domestic financial markets, with low deposit rate ceilings and

high bank reserve requirements, among other devices. But in fact, interest rate data for

the first half of the twentieth century shows that financial repression was neither so strong

nor so universal. As Table 1 shows for the years 1928–1946, the period over which we

have the best documentation, interest rates on domestic and external debt issues were

relatively similar, supporting the notion that the debt was market determined.

         A final issue is inflation or foreign currency indexation. Until very recently, most

observers held that domestic public debt was mostly non-indexed local currency

obligations. Most externally issued emerging market public debt was similarly viewed as

 It should also be noted that until the past ten to fifteen years, most countries’ external debt was largely
public debt. Private external borrowing has become more significant only over the past couple decades;

private debt and external government default.

major innovation. In reality, Argentina issued domestic government bonds in the late

1800s that were denominated in pound sterling, and Thailand issued dollar-linked

domestic debt in the 1960s (See Appendix Table 4 for sources).9

        We summarize by noting that for most countries over most of history (notably

including emerging markets), domestic debt has been large and highly significant.

Nothing about the maturity structure or interest rates paid on these debts lends

justification to the common practice of ignoring them in calculations of debt

sustainability or inflation stability.

        We acknowledge that our data set has important limitations. First, the data

generally cover only central government debt. Of course, it would be desirable to have

long time series on consolidated government debt, including state and local debt and

guaranteed debt for quasi-public agencies. Furthermore, many central banks across the

world issue debt on their own, often to sterilize foreign exchange intervention (See

Calvo, 1991, on these “perilous” practices). Adding such data, of course, would only

expand the perception of how important domestic public debt has been.

    We now take up some important potential applications of this data.

                      III.     Cataloguing Defaults on Domestic Public Debt

        Theoretical models contain a wide range of assumptions about domestic public

debt. The overwhelming majority of models simply assume that debt is always honored.

These include models where deficit policy is irrelevant due to Ricardian equivalence

(Barro, 1976), where domestic public debt is a key input in price-level determination

through the government’s budget constraint (Woodford, 1995), and where generations


9
 Of course, during the early years of the interim war period, many countries pegged their currencies to gold
(See Appendix Table 3).


                                                                                                          9
overlap (Diamond, 1965). There is a small literature that aims to understand why

governments honor domestic debt at all (e.g., Persson and Tabellini, 2000, or Kotlikoff,

Persson, and Svensson, 1988). However, the general assumption throughout the

literature is, whereas governments may inflate away debt, outright defaults on domestic

public debt are extremely rare. This is in stark contrast to the literature on external public

debt, where the government’s incentive to default is one of the main focuses of inquiry.

        In fact, our reading of the historical record is that overt de jure defaults on

domestic public debt, while less common than external defaults, are hardly rare. Our data

set includes 68 cases of overt default (compared to 250 post-1800 external debt defaults).

These de jure defaults took place via a potpourri of mechanisms, ranging from forcible

conversions, to lower coupon rates, to unilateral reduction of principal (sometimes in

conjunction with a currency conversion), to suspensions of payments. Appendix Table 3

lists these episodes.

        As we have already emphasized, our catalogue of domestic defaults is almost

certainly a lower bound, as domestic defaults are far more difficult to detect than defaults

on international debt. Even the widespread defaults on domestic debt during the 1930s

Great Depression in both advanced and developing economies are not well documented.

As a more recent example, consider Argentina. Between 1980 and 2001, Argentina

defaulted three times on its domestic debt. The two defaults that coincided with defaults

in external debt (1982 and 2001) did attract considerable international attention.

However, the large-scale 1989 default, which did not involve a new default on external

debt, is scarcely known outside Argentina.




                                                                                           10
         Why would a government refuse to pay its domestic public debt in full when it

can simply inflate the problem away? One answer, of course, is that inflation causes

distortions, especially to the banking system and the financial sector. Sometimes, the

government may view repudiation as the lesser evil. The potential costs of inflation are

especially problematic when the debt is relatively short term or indexed, since the

government then has to inflate much more aggressively to achieve a significant real

reduction in debt service payments. In other cases, such as the United States during the

Great Depression, default (by abrogation of the gold clause in 1933) was a precondition

for reinflating the economy through expansionary fiscal and monetary policy.

         Of course, there are other forms of de facto default (besides inflation). The

combination of heightened financial repression with rises in inflation was an especially

popular form of default from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Brock (1989) makes the point

that inflation and reserve requirements are positively correlated, particularly in Africa and

Latin America.10 Interest rate ceilings combined with inflation spurts are also common.

For example, during the 1972–1976 external debt rescheduling in India, interest rates

(interbank) in India were 6.6 and 13.5 percent in 1973 and 1974, while inflation spurted

to 21.2 and 26.6 percent. These episodes of de facto default through financial repression

are not listed among our de jure credit-event dating. Only to the extent that inflation

exceeds the 20 percent threshold we use to define an inflation crisis, do they count at

all.11



10
   Average reserve requirements for developing countries in his 1960 to early 1980s sample ran at about
0.25, more than three times the average for advanced economies.
11
   Another subtle type of default is illustrated by the Argentine government’s treatment of its inflation-
indexed debt in 2007. Most impartial observers agree that Argentina’s official inflation rate considerably
understates actual inflation because of government manipulation. This represents a partial default on index-


                                                                                                         11
        Clearly, the assumption embedded in many theoretical models that governments

always honor the nominal face value of debt is a significant overstatement, particularly

for emerging markets past and present. Nevertheless, we would also caution against

reaching the opposite extreme conclusion, that governments can ignore powerful

domestic stakeholders and simply default at will (de jure or de facto) on domestic debt.

We will now proceed to explore some implications of the overhang of large domestic

debt on external default and inflation.

               IV. Domestic Debt and External Default: The Missing Link

        We begin by revisiting the conventional wisdom on external debt default and its

implications for debt sustainability exercises and debt default thresholds. Indeed, in the

250 external debt default episodes in our database, it is clear that domestic debt loomed

large across the vast majority of them. Table 2 gives the ratio of both external debt and

total debt (including domestic and external liabilities) relative to government revenues on

the eve of many of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries’ most notable defaults. We

normalize debt by government revenues because data on nominal GDP is sketchy or

nonexistent for the nineteenth-century default episodes. (For many countries, standard

sources such as Maddison, 2004, do not provide anything close to a continuous time

series for GDP for the nineteenth century.) Exports, which usually have longer time

series, are not the obvious benchmark once domestic debt is added to the calculus of debt

sustainability.



linked debt by any reasonable measure, and it affects a large number of bondholders. Yet, Argentina’s de
facto domestic bond default has not registered heavily in the external press or with rating agencies.

        Looking more broadly at our the sample, Figure 4 is based on the 89 episodes of

external default over the period 1827 to 2003 where we have full data on external debt,

total debt, and revenues. In all regions except Latin America, external debt accounts for

less than half of total debt during the year a country defaults on external debt; for Latin

America, the average ratio is higher, but still only 60 percent.

        Thus, uncovering data on domestic debt suggests at least a partial answer to one

of the most basic puzzles in the entire literature on international debt, emphasized by

Bulow and Rogoff (1987) among others: Why do emerging market governments tend to

default at such stunningly low levels of debt repayments and debts to GDP? Reinhart,

Rogoff and Savastano (2003), for example, present evidence that “serial defaulters” tend

to default at ratios of debt to GDP that are below the euro area’s “Maastricht Treaty”

upper bound of 60 percent. In fact, taking into account domestic public debt, the anomaly

largely disappears.

           Figure 4 gives a different perspective on the data by providing the frequency

distribution of external debt to GDP and total debt to GDP across all the external debt

episodes in our sample for which we have full data. As the figure illustrates, external

debt to government revenue ratios are massed at a much smaller average than total debt

to government revenue ratios during the year of an external default, with a mean of 2.38

versus 4.21. This order-of-magnitude difference is consistent across individual episodes

(as Table 2 above highlights for some well-known cases). It is also consistent across

regions (Figure 4) and time.




                                                                                                14
         Obviously, if domestic debt were trivial, then the frequency distribution of the

total debt ratio at the time of default should overlap that of domestic debt. This is hardly

the case, and a standard battery of tests rejects this hypothesis across the board.12

         Finally, we note that domestic debt is not static around default episodes. In fact,

domestic debt often shows the same frenzied increases in the run-up to external default as

foreign borrowing does. The pattern is illustrated in Figure 5, which depicts debt

accumulation during the five years up to and including external default across all the

episodes in our sample.

         Presumably, the comovement of domestic and foreign debt is produced by the

same procyclical behavior of fiscal policy documented by previous researchers.13 As

shown repeatedly over time, emerging market governments are prone to treating

   See Gavin and Perotti (1997) and Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004) for evidence on procyclical
macroeconomic policies. See also Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) for a model in which the procyclical
behavior of the current account can be rationalized by the high ratio of permanent to transitory shocks in
emerging markets.

that ends in tears.14 Figure 5 does not continue past the default date T. If it did, we

would see that countries often continue to run up domestic public debt after they are shut

off from international capital markets.

                   Domestic debt often builds up in the aftermath of external defaults. The case of

pre-communist China is a caricature of the typical post-default trajectory. China’s

government depended almost exclusively on external debt until two major defaults in

1921 and 1939, with public domestic debt exploding in the aftermath of both incidents.

By the mid-1940s, China’s government relied almost exclusively on domestic debt.

  Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) argue that there are strong parallels between today’s emerging markets and
the behavior of today’s rich countries when they were at the same stage of development.

          V. Domestic Debt in High-Inflation Episodes: Again a Missing Link?

         Another literature that has by and large ignored domestic debt is the empirical

literature on high and hyperinflation. Ever since Cagan (1956), researchers have

concentrated on the government’s incentives to gain seignorage revenues off the

monetary base.15 Indeed, a recurring paradox in this literature is why governments

sometimes seem to inflate above and beyond the seignorage-maximizing rate. Many

clever and plausible answers have been offered to this question, with issues of time

consistency and credibility featuring prominently. We submit, however, that the presence

of significant domestic public debt may be a major overlooked factor, especially

considering—as we have already discussed—that a large share of debt was often long

term and non-indexed. We do not refer simply to the study of rare hyperinflation

episodes but equally to the much more common phenomenon of high and moderately

high inflation as studied, for example, by Dornbusch and Fischer (1986) and many others

since.

         Although there are literally hundreds of empirical papers on inflationary finance

in developing countries and post-conflict economies, domestic debt is rarely mentioned,

much less employed in time-series analysis. As in the external debt literature, the

implicit assumption is that domestic public debt is relatively unimportant. But is this a

good approximation? Perhaps the answer is yes in some cases, but as Table 3 suggests,

there are many important episodes where domestic debt appears to have been a major




15
  Sargent (1982) does include data on central bank holdings of treasury bills for the five post–World War I
countries (Austria, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia) in his classic paper. But of course, these
debts are essentially a wash on the consolidated government balance sheet.


                                                                                                        17
factor in the government’s incentive to inflate, if not indeed the dominant one.16 Thus a

comparison of actual inflation rates to any hypothetical “seignorage-maximizing rate,”

calculated only off the monetary base, may often be beside the point.

          We see in Table 3, for example, that when post–World War I inflation first spiked

up to 66 percent in Germany in 1920, domestic debt was almost triple the size of the

monetary base. In the case of Brazil, debt was almost 20 times the size of the money

base.17

          The importance of domestic debt is hardly confined to hyperinflations. Table 3

lists a number of high-inflation episodes as well. Domestic public debt was almost 80

percent of total domestic liabilities (including currency) in 1945 Japan, when inflation

went over 500 percent. In all of the cases listed in Table 3, domestic public debt is at

least the same order of magnitude as the monetary base (with the exception of Norway in

1918, where it was slightly below).

          Precise calculations of how much governments gained by inflating down the real

value of debt require considerably more information on the maturity structure and interest

payments than is available in our cross-country data set. One also needs to understand

bank reserve requirements, interest rate regulations, the degree of financial repression,

and other constraints to make any kind of precise calculation. But the fact that domestic

nominal debt is so large compared to base money across so many important high-




16
   Of course, the possibility of using unanticipated inflation to default on nominal debt is well understood
in the theoretical literature, e.g., Barro (1983).
17
   The Brazil case is exceptional in that some of the debt was indexed to inflation, although lags in the
indexation scheme still made it possible for the government to largely inflate away the debt with a high
enough rate of inflation. Indeed, this appears to be exactly what happened as the country lurched in and out
of hyperinflation for many years.


                                                                                                         18
inflation episodes suggests that this factor needs to be given far more attention in future

studies.18

                  VI: Who Is Senior? Domestic Residents or Foreigners?

         We have shown that domestic debt is large in general, and in many episodes of

external default or high inflation, in particular. Clearly, in trying to understand how

crises play out, it would be helpful to better understand the relative seniority of domestic

and foreign debt. This section is an attempt to provide a first pass at some key

characteristics of the data. Clearly, the answer is going to differ across countries and

time. Many factors, such as central bank independence and exchange rate regime, are

likely going to be relevant. Nevertheless, a few simple comparisons of the trajectory of

output and inflation during the run-up and aftermath to domestic and external defaults are

revealing.19

         Our calculations can be taken only as suggestive for several reasons. One is

simply that, as we have already emphasized, there is no comprehensive database on overt

domestic debt defaults prior to our own, much less on de facto defaults. While we are

confident that we have a relatively complete picture of external defaults and episodes of

high inflation in our sample, we simply do not know how many domestic default

episodes we may have missed, even restricting attention to de jure defaults. Appendix I

provides a broad indication of how hidden in the historical archives are clear episodes of



18
   Calvo and Guidotti (1992) develop a model of the optimal maturity structure of nominal debt, where the
government trades off flexibility (the option to inflate away long-term debt when under financial duress)
versus maintaining high credibility for maintaining a low inflation rate (achieved by having very short-term
debt which is more difficult to inflate away).
19
   It should also be noted that other economic indicators (besides inflation and per capita GDP growth,
which we examine in detail) would provide a richer answer to the broad question of how bad conditions
have to be before contemplating default (specifically, the impacts of domestic versus foreign default on
social indicators relating to poverty, health, income distribution, etc., are bound to be quite different).


                                                                                                         19
domestic default or restructuring. Thus, our list of domestic defaults is surely a lower

bound on the actual incidence.

          Finally, but worthy of discussion, our approach is systematic in documenting the

incidence of default but it is silent on assessing the magnitude of default. Even though

our new database on public debt can provide a valuable insight on the magnitudes

involved in the original default or restructuring, it would be a stretch of the imagination

to suggest that these data provide a snapshot of the subsequent restructuring nuances or

the actual recovery rates. With these caveats in mind, a number of results stand out.




                                                                                                    20
The antecedents of domestic and external default

        First, how bad are macroeconomic conditions on the eve of default?

Unambiguously, output declines in the run-up to default on domestic debt are typically

significantly worse than for external debt. As highlighted in Figure 6 and 7, the average

cumulative decline in output during the three-year run-up to a domestic default crisis is 8

percent. The output decline on the year of the domestic debt crisis alone is 4 percent; the

comparable average decline for the external debt events is 1.2 percent. To compare the

antecedents of the domestic and external defaults, we performed a variety of tests for

individual years, as well as for the cumulative change in the window prior to default. In

the latter test, there are a total of 224 observations for domestic crises (that is, the number

of annual observations in advance of domestic crises) and 813 for external crashes (again,

years times number of crises).

        As noted earlier, the results have to be interpreted with care, as many domestic

episodes are twin default crises and, as such, output is also suffering from limited access

(if at all) to external credit.

           The comparable exercise for the inflation rate yields even starker differences

(Figures 8 and 9); default through inflation goes hand in hand with domestic default—

before, during, and after the more explicit domestic expropriations. The extensive

scholarly literature on inflation has been silent on this point.20 Inflation during the year

of external default is on average high, at 33 percent.21 However, inflation truly gallops

during domestic debt crises, averaging 170 percent in the year of the default.22 After the

domestic default, inflation remains at or above 100 percent in the following years. We

conclude that overt domestic default tends to occur only in times of severe

macroeconomic distress.

The incidence of domestic and external default

         To shed some light on the incidence of expropriation of residents versus

nonresidents, we constructed four time series for the period 1800–2007: the probability

of external default (or the share of countries in our sample that are in external default in a

given year); the comparable statistic for domestic default episodes; the probability of an

inflation crisis (defined here as the share of countries in any given year during our more

than 200-year sample where the annual rate of inflation exceeded 20 percent); and the

sum of the incidence of high inflation and domestic default, which summarizes the

expropriation of the holdings of domestic residents.23, 24

         Figure 10 shows the probability of external default versus the comparable statistic

for domestic default either through inflation or explicit default. For the early period



23
  Details on the underlying macroeconomic data are given in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).
24
  The United States is, of course, the modern exception. Virtually all U.S. debt is domestic (as the Carter
bonds have been extinguished), yet about 40 percent is held by nonresidents (mostly central banks and
other official institutions), but it is dollar denominated. Thus, inflation in the United States would also
affect nonresidents.


                                                                                                            24
through World War II, the incidence of external default is higher.25 Table 5 presents

some summary statistics on the underlying data. For 1800–1939, the probability of

external default is about 20 percent versus 12 percent for domestic residents. For the

entire sample, there is no statistically significant difference in the incidence of default on

locals versus foreigners. With the widespread adoption of fiat money, inflation

apparently became the more expedient form of expropriation. As a result, the incidence

of taxing locals increased after World War II.26

        Figure 11 plots the probability of domestic default as a share of the probability of

default. A ratio above 0.5 implies domestics do worse, while one less than 0.5 implies

foreigners do worse.

        Certainly, this admittedly very crude first pass at the evidence does nothing to

dissuade our prior belief that domestic debt is often held by important political

stakeholders in debtor countries, and cannot always be lightly dismissed as strictly junior

debt.

   The huge spike in external defaults in the 1820s owes to the much-studied first wave of sovereign
defaults of the newly independent Latin American countries—but Greece and Portugal also defaulted at
this time.

                                                             VII. Conclusions

               In this paper, we provide an extensive new cross-country data set on a key

macroeconomic variable that governments often manage to keep remarkably hidden from


                                                                                                                  26
view: domestic public debt. We also present what we believe to be the first attempt at a

cross-country international catalogue of historical defaults on domestic public debt,

spanning two centuries and sixty-four countries.

        Our first look at the data suggests that researchers need to revisit the empirical

literature on the sustainability of external government debt and on government’s

incentives to engage in high and hyperinflation, taking into account the newly uncovered

data on domestic public debt. Of course, how the overhang of domestic debt impacts

inflation and external default will vary across episodes and circumstances. In some cases,

the domestic debt is eliminated through high inflation, in other cases, governments

default on external debt.

        How did domestic public debt in emerging markets fall off many economists’

radar screen? Many researchers, aware only of difficulties that emerging markets had in

issuing debt in the ultra-high-inflation 1980s and 1990s, simply believed that no one

would ever voluntarily lend money to a kleptocratic emerging market government. The

logical implication was that such debt must not exist. True, there are exceptions. Alesina

and Tabellini (1990) consider a theoretical case where domestic debt is honored ahead of

external debt. But absent any data, or even any awareness of the one-time existence of

significant quantities of domestic public debt in virtually every emerging market, these

isolated examples have had no great impact on the mainstream academic or policy

literature.

        Perhaps the most surprising and significant finding of our study is simply the lack

of transparency so many governments and multilateral institutions exhibit in making time

series on domestic debt easily available. After all, these governments routinely tap




                                                                                             27
domestic and foreign markets to sell debt. Standard auction theory—much of which is

admittedly static—suggests that it should be in the interest of sellers to convey

information, especially when the debt can be resold in secondary markets. Even more

puzzling is why global investors do not insist on historical information relevant to the

value of securities they may purchase. Understanding why so many governments do not

make it easier for standard databases to incorporate their debt history is an important

question for future research.

         From a policy perspective, there is a plausible case that an international agency

would be providing a valuable public good if it could enforce (or at least promote) basic

reporting requirements and transparency across countries. Given the apparent large

historical role of domestic public debt in helping to precipitate developing country

external debt and inflation crises, it is a great curiosity indeed that today’s multilateral

financial institutions have never fully taken up the task of systematically publishing the

data. This failure, especially in light of these agencies’ supposed role at the vanguard of

warning policymakers and investors about crisis risks, is stunning. Instead, the system

has seemed to forget about the history of domestic debt entirely, thinking that today’s

blossoming of internal public debt markets is something entirely new and different.27 But

as our historical data set on domestic debt underscores with surprising force, nothing

could be further from the truth.




27
  Beyond simply reporting debt data, international financial institutions such as the International Monetary
Fund or the World Bank can, of course, also help with disseminating best practices (see, for example, the
institutional evolution discussed in Wallis and Weingast, 1988).

       The debt data covers the countries shown in Appendix Table 1 (9 in Africa; 9 in

Asia; 23 in Europe; 19 in Latin America, 2 in North America; and 2 in Oceania). The

domestic default episodes encompass all countries that have defaulted on their domestic

debt (See Appendix Table 2 for a definition of default and Appendix Table 3 for a full list

of the episodes).

       As the final column in Appendix Table 1 illustrates, our sample of sixty-four

countries indeed accounts for about 90 percent of world GDP. Many of these countries,

particularly those in Africa and Asia, have become independent nations only relatively

recently (column 2).

       The central government debt data assembled in this study is both broad in its

cross-country coverage and spans nearly one-hundred years for most countries (1914 to




                                                                                          35
2007) and even longer for many others.28 Here we present a synopsis of “state-of-the-

art” information on public debt (available data, sources, scope, etc.). We also highlight

some of the salient characteristics of the long time series we study, in addition to what we

have already discussed in section II of the text.29

Data preliminaries

        Government debt is among the most elusive of economic time series.

        For the advanced economies, the most comprehensive data comes from the

OECD, which provides time series on general government debt since 1980. However,

this data has several important limitations: it only includes a handful of emerging

markets; for many advanced economies (France, Finland, Greece, and the U.K., to name

a few) the data actually begins much later (in the 1990s), which cannot be considered as

much of a time series; and only total debt is reported, with no particulars provided for the

composition of debt (domestic versus foreign) or its maturity (long-term versus short-

term). To state that the IMF’s well-known World Economic Outlook (WEO) database

extends to public debt requires a stretch of the imagination.30 Data is only provided for

the G-7 from 1980 onwards (out of 183 countries covered in the WEO).

        The most comprehensive data on public debt in emerging market economies

comes from the World Bank’s Global Development Finance—GDF (known previously

as the World Debt Tables). It is an improvement on other databases in that it begins (for

most countries) in 1970 and provides extensive detail on the particulars of external debt.

28
   The regional coverage is, unfortunately, uneven: coverage of Africa is relatively sparse (although we
incorporate some excellent data from colonial records); it is, of course, most complete for Europe, North
America, and Oceania.

   For compete references underlying this appendix and its accompanying database, see Reinhart and
Rogoff (2008).

   This description comes from the IMF’s web site “Download time series data for GDP growth, inflation,
unemployment, payments balances, exports, imports, external debt, capital flows, commodity prices,
more.”


                                                                                                        36
Yet, GDF also has serious limitations, besides the fact that it covers only external debt.

Neither advanced economies are included to facilitate comparisons, nor are such newly

industrialized countries as Israel, Korea, or Singapore. Unlike data from the IMF and the

World Bank for exchange rates, prices, government finances, etc., there is no data prior to

1970. For a few countries, such as Panama or Cote D’Ivoire, external debt is a sufficient

statistic on government liabilities, because domestic public debt levels are relatively

trivial. For most countries, however, domestic debt accounts for an important share of

total government debt. As we have already noted in the text, the all-country average

oscillates between 40 to 80 percent during 1900 to 2006.31

         In search of the elusive data on total public debt, we examined the archives of the

League of Nations and found that the institution collected information on, among other

things, public domestic and external debt in its Statistical Yearbook (1926–1944). While

neither the IMF nor the World Bank continued this practice after the war, the newly

formed United Nations (UN) inherited the data collected by the League of Nations. In

1948, the UN Department of Economic Affairs published a special volume on public debt

that spanned 1914 to 1946. From that time onwards, the UN continued to collect and

publish the domestic and external debt data in the same format as their prewar

predecessor on an annual basis in their Statistical Yearbooks. As former colonies became

independent nations, the database expanded accordingly. This practice continued until

1983, at which time the domestic and external public debt series were discontinued. In

total, these sources yield time series that span 1914 to 1983 for the most complete cases.

It covers advanced and developing economies. For the most part, it also disaggregates

   For some countries, such as the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United States, practically all public debt
is domestic.

domestic debt into its long-term and short-term components. To the best of our

knowledge, these data are not available electronically in any database. Hence obtaining it

required going to the original publications. These data provide the starting point for our

public debt series, which have been extended to the period prior to 1914 and post 1983

whenever possible. The sources are numerous. The material comes from large-scale

historical statistical compendiums (such as Carreras and Tafunell, 2005, Estadísticas

Históricas de España, Siglos XIX-XX) or from individual scholars (for example, Bazant’s,

1968, careful study of Mexico’s domestic and foreign debt, Historia de la Deuda

Exterior de Mexico: 1823-1946). Colonial records were also a valuable source of

information for pre-1914; country-specific statistical and government agencies provide

data for the more recent period.32 Data Appendix IV provides details for the sources by

country and time period. Foreign external debt is from Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).

                                    Appendix III: Crises dates

Appendix Table1 defines the criteria as to what constitutes a domestic debt crisis.

Specifically, as with sovereign default it is defined as:

1. A failure to meet a principal or interest payment on the due date (or within the

specified grace period). (These episodes also include instances where rescheduled debt is

ultimately extinguished on less favorable terms.)

2. The freezing of bank deposits and or forcible conversions of such deposits from

dollars to local currency.

3. The abrogation of indexation clauses, as the United States did in the 1930s and as

Argentina is doing at the time of this writing in 2008.

32
  For Australia, Ghana, India, Korea, South Africa among others, we have put together debt data for much
of the colonial period from British statistical sources which tracked the colonies. We also have similar
colonial data for former Japanese colonies.


                                                                                                      38
To our knowledge, this is the first effort to chronicle systematically sovereign defaults on

domestic debts, along the lines that economic historians have documented external

sovereign defaults. The closest source comparable to these dates on domestic sovereign

default is Standard and Poor’s.33

year see Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).

33
  See the careful analysis of Beers and Chambers, Sovereign Defaults At 26-Year Low, To Show Little
Change In 2007, which covers domestic default post-1975. Since this study is focused only on domestic
public debt, it does miss some key episodes, such as forcible conversions of foreign currency bank deposits.
These episodes constitute defaults on domestic debt because, typically, the government simultaneously
writes down the value of treasury debt held by banks.
