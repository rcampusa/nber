                                            ABSTRACT

We measure job-filling rates and recruiting intensity per vacancy at the national and industry levels
from January 2001 to September 2011 using data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.
Construction makes up less than 5 percent of employment but accounts for more than 40 percent of
the large swings in the job-filling rate during and after the Great Recession. Leisure & Hospitality
accounts for nearly a quarter of the large drop in recruiting intensity during the Great Recession. We
show that industry-level movements in job-filling rates and recruiting intensity are at odds with the
implications of the standard matching function in labor search theory but consistent with a generalized
function that incorporates an important role for recruiting intensity per vacancy.

    The number of unemployed persons per vacancy more than tripled during the 2008-09

recession. The ratio fell after July 2009 but remains more than double its pre-recession level as

of September 2011. According to the standard matching function in labor search theory, this

path for the ratio of unemployment to vacancies implies a similar path for the fill rate of vacant

job positions. The actual job-filling rate, however, does not conform to the path implied by

standard theory. In Davis, Faberman and Haltiwanger (2010, DFH hereafter), we account for

part of the gap between actual and implied fill-rate movements using a generalized matching

function that incorporates a role for recruiting intensity per vacancy.1 “Recruiting intensity” is

shorthand for the other instruments employers use to influence the pace of new hires – e.g.,

advertising expenditures, screening methods, hiring standards, and the attractiveness of

compensation packages. These instruments affect the number and quality of applicants per

vacancy, the speed of applicant processing, and the acceptance rate of job offers. Conditional on

the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, a higher recruiting intensity per vacancy raises the fill rate.

     In our earlier work, we measure the U.S. job-filling rate and construct a national index for

recruiting intensity per vacancy. In this paper, we construct national and industry measures of the

fill rate and recruiting intensity. We find that Construction and a few other industries play

disproportionately large roles in the national movements of these two series. In other words,

industries differ greatly in the cyclical behavior of job-filling rates and recruiting intensity. We

show that industry-level movements in these variables during and after the Great Recession are

inconsistent with the standard matching function but consistent with our generalized function.

  Davis (2011) accounts for an additional part of the gap by further generalizing the matching function to capture a
role for search intensity per unemployed person. Other researchers explore the role of mismatch in the breakdown of
the standard matching function and recent instability in the Beveridge curve. See, for example, Michael Elsby, Bart
Hobijn, and Ayşegül Şahin (2010), Regis Barnichon and Andrew Figura (2011), Şahin, Jae Song, Giorgio Topa, and
Gianluca Violante (2011), and Benedikt Herz and Thijs van Rens (2011).

I. Data and Measurement

       The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) samples about 16,000

establishments per month and yields data on employment, the number of hires and separations

during the month, and the number of vacancies on the last business day of the month. We use

JOLTS micro data from December 2000 to June 2011 and published JOLTS statistics through

September 2011. DFH develop a method to estimate the daily job-filling rate using JOLTS data.

Here, we apply the DFH method to estimate national, industry and regional job-filling rates.

       DFH also show that the log of the job-filling rate rises strongly with the log of the gross

hires rate in the cross section of establishments. As DFH discuss, there are two ways to

reconcile this empirical relationship with standard search theory. One is to posit increasing

returns to scale in the employer-level hiring technology, so that it becomes easier for an

employer to fill any given vacancy the higher its vacancy rate. A second way is for recruiting

intensity per vacancy to covary positively with the vacancy rate in the cross section. DFH

develop evidence of constant returns in the employer-level hiring technology and specify the

generalized matching function accordingly.

       The resulting generalized matching function yields an aggregate job-filling rate

(1)                                    !! = !(!/!)!! !!!
                                                  ! !!


where ! is a matching efficiency parameter, −! is the elasticity of the fill rate with respect to the

vacancy-unemployment, or v-u, ratio, and !! is the vacancy-weighted mean of the employer-

level recruiting intensity per vacancy in month t. As DFH discuss, cross-sectional evidence

supports a recruiting intensity specification given by ln !! = ε ln !! , where ε is the empirical

elasticity of the fill rate with respect to the gross hires rate. DFH construct a national recruiting


                                                  3
intensity index using data on the aggregate gross hires rate and an empirical elasticity ε = 0.82.

They show that the resulting fill rate given by (1) more closely tracks the observed national fill

rate than the one implied by the standard matching function with no role for !! . Incorporating a

role for the recruiting intensity index also improves the stability of the Beveridge Curve and

yields a better fit to data on the job-finding rate for unemployed workers.

        Motivated by the greater success of the generalized matching function in accounting for

the cross-sectional and time-series evidence, we construct an index of recruiting intensity per

vacancy for each industry, letting the elasticity ε vary by industry. We use the experienced

unemployed from the Current Population Survey (CPS) along with JOLTS vacancy data to

compute the industry v-u ratios by month. An unpublished appendix presents regional time

series for recruiting intensity and the job-filling rate and other results.



II. Recruiting Intensity and Job Filling since the Great Recession

        Figure 1 plots national time series for the job-filling rate and recruiting intensity per

vacancy. The job-filling rate rose sharply, from 4.4 percent per day in December 2007 to a peak

of 6.6 percent per day in August of 2009. It fell steadily thereafter, though it remains above pre-

recession levels at 4.8 percent per day as of September 2011. Recruiting intensity per vacancy

fell sharply during the Great Recession, declining by over 21 percent between December 2007

and its trough. It remains 11 percent below its pre-recession level as of September 2011.

how to calculate the job-filling rate and recruiting intensity per vacancy. Recruiting intensity is
scaled so that its 2004-07 average equals one. Shaded areas show NBER recessions.


                      Table 1 reports the contribution of selected industries to changes in the national job-

filling rate and recruiting intensity index during the recession and recovery periods. Relative to

2007Q4, the job-filling rate rose 39 percent during the recession and fell 21 percent from

2009Q2 to 2011Q2.2 Remarkably, Construction accounts for more than 40 percent of the swings

in the national job-filling rate during and after the recession, despite making up less than 5

percent of employment. Relative to 2007Q4, recruiting intensity per vacancy fell by 22 percent

during the recession but rose only 6 percent from 2009Q2 to 2011Q2. Construction plays almost

no role in the national drop in recruiting intensity, while the Leisure & Hospitality sector plays a

major role. Professional & Business Services, Manufacturing and Construction largely account

for the small post-recession recovery in recruiting intensity. Despite making up nearly 15

percent of employment and expanding throughout the recession, Health and Education account

for very modest shares of movements in the fill rate and recruiting intensity index. Government

also plays a disproportionately small role; in fact, recruiting intensity per vacancy in Government

fell during the recovery even as national recruiting intensity rose.

       Figure 2 plots three-month moving averages of the cross-industry variance in the logs of

the job-filling rate, recruiting intensity per vacancy, and v-u ratio. We weight industries in

proportion to employment in computing these variance measures. The industry dispersion of

job-filling rates rose from 8 to 16 log points during the Great Recession, then fell in a rather

erratic manner during the recovery to stand at 10 log points in September 2011. The dispersion in

the v-u ratio behaves similarly in the recession but declines rapidly in the recovery and returns to


                                                    6
its pre-recession level by July 2011. These two industry dispersion measures behave similarly to

closely related measures of “mismatch” in the labor market developed by Şahin et al. (2011). By

way of comparison, movements over time in the industry dispersion of recruiting intensity per

vacancy are modest. The industry dispersion in recruiting intensity actually rose in 2010 and

2011, even as dispersion in job filling and the v-u ratio fell.

                                                   Figure 3 plots industry changes in the log job-filling rate and log recruiting intensity per

vacancy against changes in the log v-u ratio in the recession and recovery periods. The left panel

shows that both periods exhibit a strong negative relationship between industry changes in the

fill rate and v-u ratio. The slope of the relationship is -0.49 during the recession and -0.28

afterward. Each slope is statistically significant at the 5 percent level, but the difference between

them is not. The right panel shows that changes in recruiting intensity are essentially unrelated to

changes in the vacancy-unemployment ratio during the recession. After the recession, however, a

tight positive relationship holds between the two. The increase in the slope is large (from 0.04 to

0.31) and, despite the small sample, statistically significant at the 5% level.

first term on the right side of (2) vanishes. This feature of the standard matching function is at

odds with the strong positive slope in Figure 3(b) for the post-recession period. Moreover, the

standard matching function implies a time-invariant negative relationship between the numerator

and denominator on the left side of (2). Despite the small number of data points, our sample

produces mild evidence against this implication as well.

        The generalized matching function implies a more subtle restriction on the empirical

relations in Figure 3, as encapsulated by (2). For the recession period, Figure 3 gives estimates

Δln ! Δ ln(!/!) = −0.49 and Δln ! Δ ln(!/!) = 0.04. Plugging these values into (2) and

solving yields ! = 0.51. For the post-recession period, we have Δln ! Δ ln(!/!) = 0.31  from

Figure 3(b). Plugging into (2) and evaluating at ! = 0.51 implies a value of -0.35 for

Δln ! Δ ln(!/!), close to the actual post-recession value of -0.28. Thus, the evidence in Figure

3 is consistent with restriction (2) and the underlying generalized matching function.

        In summary, Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3 highlight large differences across industries in

the cyclical behavior of job-filling rates and recruiting intensity per vacancy. The evidence in

Figure 3 is at odds with the standard matching function but consistent with a generalized

matching function that includes an important role for fluctuations in recruiting intensity per

vacancy. An open question is what drives the pronounced industry-specific variation in job

filling and recruiting intensity. We do not address that question here, but our analysis suggests

that it warrants attention in future research.

III. Concluding Remarks

        We find large differences across industries in the evolution of job-filling rates and

recruiting intensity per vacancy during and after the Great Recession. Construction makes up

less than 5 percent of employment but accounts for more than 40 percent of the large swings in

the national job-filling rate over the past four years. Leisure & Hospitality makes up 10 percent

of employment but accounts for nearly a quarter of the drop in recruiting intensity during the

recession. While Government, Health and Education jointly account for nearly a third of

employment, their contribution to national movements in job filling and recruiting intensity is

quite modest – less than 5 percent of swings in the job-filling rate, for example.

        The outsized role of Construction in the behavior of national job-filling rates raises

concerns about theories that abstract from industry differences in matching frictions. In this

regard, we note that Construction is highly atypical in terms of its “frictional” characteristics. As

reported in the online appendix, the job-filling rate in Construction is more than double that of

any other industry. Mean vacancy duration in Construction was 8 days prior to the recession and

only 3 days at the trough. In short, a small highly atypical sector accounts for much of the recent

movements in the national job-filling rate. Another concern pertains to the nature and role of

wage rigidities. As stressed by Robert E. Hall (2005), for example, search frictions create room

for wage rigidity on the hiring margin. In turn, wage rigidity on the hiring margin amplifies the

response of job creation and unemployment to aggregate shocks. In light of our statistics on job-

filling rates, there appears to be little scope for search-based wage rigidities in the highly cyclical

Construction sector. Of course, wage rigidities may arise for reasons unrelated to search

frictions.




                                                  10
       Like the earlier work in DFH on which we build, this paper points to an important role

for recruiting intensity in the cyclical relationship among hires, vacancies and unemployment.

Data limitations, however, require an indirect approach to the measurement of recruiting

intensity per vacancy. There is a need to develop data that support more direct measures. A

natural approach is to expand existing surveys, such as the JOLTS, to inquire about the

instruments and methods that employers use to recruit new hires. A simple suggestion that

avoids undue respondent burden is to include a list of recruitment methods on the survey

instrument and to ask respondents with vacancies to check off the methods they use – screening

of unsolicited applications, word of mouth, referrals from existing employees, help-wanted

advertisements in print media, web postings, the use of employment agencies, internships,

evaluation of temp workers, and so on.
