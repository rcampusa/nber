                                         ABSTRACT

Prior work has established that the financing environment can impact firm strategy. We argue that
this influence can shape the earliest strategic choices of a new venture by creating a potential
tradeoff between two objectives: rapid growth and reaping the benefits of a positive reputation
(glory). We leverage a simple reputation-building strategic choice, naming the firm after the
founder (eponymy), that is associated with superior profitability. Next, we argue via a formal
model that the availability of/dependence on external financing can explain why high-growth
firms are rarely eponymous. We find empirical support for the model's predictions using a large
dataset of 1 million European firms. Eponymous firms grow considerably more slowly than
similarly profitable firms. Moreover, eponymy varies in accordance with the firm's financing
environment in a pattern consistent with our model. We discuss implications for the literature on
new venture strategy.

1     Introduction
A significant literature in strategy and other fields has examined the influence of the fi-
nancing environment on the strategic choices of new ventures. Gans, Hsu, and Stern (2002)
identify the existence of financial intermediaries as a key driver of startup commercialization
decisions. Hellman and Puri (2000) and Hsu (2006) document relationships between venture
capital financing and product market strategies for new ventures. In this paper, we argue
that the financing environment can shape strategic choices even earlier in the life of a new
venture.
    We explore a scenario in which a new venture is considering two objectives: (1) establish-
ing a positive reputation for quality, which increases profitability, and (2) rapidly scaling the
venture, which typically requires attracting outside capital from financiers. We propose that
an early strategic choice—deciding what to name the venture—can entail a tradeoff between
these two objectives. This tension implies that the financing environment will shape new
venture strategy by favoring one objective over the other.
    We begin by building on prior work that has established a connection between a firm nam-
ing strategy, reputation, and profitability. This strategy is eponymy—meaning the founder
affixes her own surname to the business name—which more strongly links the firm’s rep-
utation to the entrepreneur’s personal one (Belenzon, Chatterji, and Daley 2017, BCD17
hereafter). Because eponymy is a choice, the willingness to create this stronger link is a sig-
nal of underlying quality, enhancing the firm’s reputation, which feeds back into improved
firm performance. In a dataset of over 1 million European small businesses, BCD17 doc-
ument that eponymous ventures earn approximately 50% greater return on assets (ROA)
than average firms.
    Despite this documented performance advantage, casual observation suggests that very
few firms with high-growth aspirations requiring outside capital choose this naming strategy.
We argue this is because these non-eponymous firms are strategically prioritizing growth
instead. Below, we a) empirically document that despite higher financial returns, eponymy
is associated with slower growth; b) propose that firms’ need for and access to outside capital
play crucial roles in explaining these patterns; and c) exploit variation in the financing
environment to provide additional empirical evidence consistent with our theory.
    In the same dataset as BCD17, we find that non-eponymous firms grow twice as fast as
their eponymous counterparts. This is also consistent with Guzman and Stern’s (2015, 2016)
finding that eponymous firms are significantly less likely to experience liquidity events such as
major acquisitions or initial public offerings, implying reduced prospects and/or aspirations
for growth. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the profitability/growth pattern we docu-
ment. First, eponymous firms have substantially greater ROA than their non-eponymous

counterparts. Second, eponymous firms have sales growth of 2.1%, which is considerably
lower than the 4.1% for their non-eponymous counterparts. Third, the regression line de-
picts, perhaps unsurprisingly, that within the entire sample, ROA and sales growth are
positively correlated, as both are indicators of “success.” Hence, the growth disparity be-
tween eponymous and non-eponymous firms is even more striking: Conditioning on their
superior ROA, eponymous firms should grow considerably faster than average, but instead
exhibit below-average growth.
    In our model, entrepreneurs of varying characteristics begin by choosing whether or not
to name their firm eponymously. The model has three key elements. First, entrepreneurs
differ on two dimensions: the quality of their product (or service) and their potential for
growth. Second, as in BCD17, eponymy creates a stronger association between the firm
and the entrepreneur that amplifies the reputational benefits (or costs) of favorable (or
unfavorable) perceived quality. Third, growth requires financing from outsiders, who may
be more reluctant to provide capital to eponymous firms.
    This reluctance could, potentially, have multiple rationales. For example, by virtue
of strengthening the association between the firm and founder, eponymy could (de facto)
confer greater control rights to the entrepreneur, or make it more challenging for her to


                                                                2
attract/maintain the team of highly talented individuals required for the firm to be a growth
prospect.1 We also identify a more subtle potential explanation for this reluctance by demon-
strating that it can arise when financiers face bandwidth constraints in their selection process,
often called due diligence in practice.
    We demonstrate that the empirical patterns described above are consistent with the equi-
librium of the model. In brief, high-quality but unscalable ventures always select eponymy.
In equilibrium, then, this is precisely the message that eponymy conveys: that the business
offers a high-quality product, but has poor growth prospects. Such a message is clearly
anathema to attracting external financing, so is avoided by entrepreneurs with scalable busi-
nesses when the benefits of growth are sufficiently large. In this regard, there is a strategic
choice between “growth” and “glory.”
    We therefore offer an equilibrium explanation for the seemingly conventional wisdom
that eponymy dissuades financiers from working with a particular firm. Notably, though,
the explanation need not be assumed outright—that is, eponymy itself does not have to be
unpalatable to financiers, but can merely signal that a business is a poor growth opportunity
in an environment where financiers cannot costlessly discern the growth prospects of every
new business.
    We exploit observable variation in firms’ need for and access to outside capital within
our dataset and find conditional correlations consistent with our theory. The differences
in ROA between eponymous and non-eponymous firms narrow in regions where financial
development is higher and in industries with greater dependence on external financing. These
findings are consistent with the argument that high-quality entrepreneurs with scalable ideas
more frequently select non-eponymous firm names in such settings. We also construct a
novel measure to capture financier bandwidth in each firm’s environment, and find evidence
consistent with the hypothesis that bandwidth constraints play a role in scalable ventures
forgoing eponymy. Finally, we are able to refute numerous alternative explanations for the
relationship between eponymy and financing (such as the proposed inability of eponymous
firms to attract/retain talented teams, as mentioned above), though one of our analyses
is suggestive of control rights possibly contributing to the hindrance eponymy poses for
financing.
    Our work contributes to the literature on new venture strategy, particularly as it relates
to the intersection between individual-level differences, market conditions, and strategic
choices (Wu and Knott, 2006; Arora and Nandkumar, 2011; Hsu and Ziedonis, 2013; Marx
et al. 2014; Kulchina 2015; Wang 2018). We also connect firm strategy decisions directly
to the literature on financing entrepreneurship (Black and Strahan, 2002; Kerr and Nanda,
   1
       We are grateful to three anonymous referees for these suggestions.

2009; de Bettignies, 2008; Chatterji and Seamans, 2012; Anderson and Nielson, 2012). We
provide a specific example of how a strategic choice that every startup faces is shaped by the
financing environment.2 Notably, our results indicate a central role for reputation-enhancing
strategies in the financing of new ventures more broadly, which few papers in this tradition
have formally considered (an exception is Gompers, Kovner, Lerner and Scharfstein, 2010).
    As mentioned above, our paper builds on BCD17, which both models a reputation-for-
quality-based explanation of why eponymous firms are more profitable and provides corrob-
orating empirical evidence. Neither growth nor financing are studied in BCD17. The present
paper extends the model of BCD17 by allowing for heterogeneity in business scalability (in
addition to quality) and analyzes the link between financing and eponymy. This addition
to the model allows us to explain why eponymous firms, though more profitable, grow more
slowly. In doing so we reconcile the results of BCD17 with those of Guzman and Stern
(2015, 2016). Empirically, we introduce measures of a firm’s financing environment at the
region, industry, and firm-specific levels to explore their impact on the performance patterns
of eponymous firms.
    In the next section, we present a model to reconcile the various findings discussed above.
We then test the implications of the model and assess alternatives using a dataset of over 1
million European firms. We conclude with the implications of our work for the literature on
new ventures, reputation, and financing.


2       The Model
Informal Sketch of the Model and Explanation
Before introducing the formalities, we discuss the logic of the model in words. Entrepreneurs
differ on two dimensions: the quality of their product (or service) and their potential for
growth or scalability.3 Among firms without growth potential, their only consideration is
their reputation for quality. Building on BCD17, their long-run payoffs are i) increasing
in perceived quality, and ii) amplified by eponymy: The stronger association between the
firm and the entrepreneur increases the benefits (or costs) of a favorable (or unfavorable)
reputation.
    2
      Aghion and Stein (2008) also model a tradeoff between growth and profitability, but for publicly traded
firms. In their setup, managers must decide how to allocate their efforts between a growth or a margin
strategy given the manner in which investors will interpret how the outputs on those dimensions reflect on the
manager’s unknown ability. Notably, BCD17 demonstrates that effort and signaling can be complementary
explanations.
    3
      Of course, a desire for growth is a prerequisite for scalability. An owner who does not want her business
to appreciably grow (for example, because she does not want to deal with the increased demands—see Hurst
and Pugsley, 2011) fits within our framework as not being scalable.



                                                      4
    This amplification effect was the key feature in BCD17. To provide a condensed version
of the description therein: These reputational factors can include both market-based pay-
offs and non-pecuniary ones. Market-based explanations include the possibility that future
business or employment opportunities for the eponymous entrepreneur depend more heavily
on the impression of her firm.4 A simple example of non-pecuniary factors could be that
the founder feels pride/shame if the market believes her (as opposed to an unnamed owner
of the firm) to be of high/low ability; according to the adages, an eponymous entrepreneur
may “bring honor to her name,” but also risks “besmirching” it.5
    In equilibrium, perceived quality accounts for any information conveyed by the firm’s
choice of name, as well as by the quality of the firm’s realized output (which, of course, is cor-
related with underlying firm-quality). Therefore, high-quality but low-growth entrepreneurs
engage in eponymy to amplify the benefits of their likely favorable reputation, while low-
quality ones mix, trading off the gain in impression from selecting eponymy against the
reputational cost of their likely negative outcome being amplified.
    Firms with growth potential face an additional consideration. We assume that growth
requires (or, at least, is substantially aided by) financing from outsiders. This financing
can be of many different forms, such as credit, capital infusions, IPOs, or even being ac-
quired. Financiers perform due diligence by investigating a firm before offering it financing.
Financiers are only interested in firms that are both high quality and scalable, which is
revealed by their investigation.6
    Hence, if eponymy is a hindrance to obtaining financing, high-quality firms with growth
potential would face a tradeoff in their choice between a) enjoying the amplified reputational
benefits of eponymy at a cost of lower (expected) financing and growth or b) forgoing the rep-
utational amplification in favor of greater access to financing and growth via non-eponymy.
In Section 2.1 we formulate and analyze the model under the assumption that eponymy
directly hinders a firm’s ability to obtain financing. This assumption could plausibly be
supported by, for example, an argument that eponymy confers greater control rights on firm
    4
       For example, Aubrey McClendon, co-founder of (non-eponymous) Chesapeake Energy described, “There
was some fear that we’d fail, maybe spectacularly, and we thought it would be easier to live with that if
our names weren’t on the failed enterprise.” (Robinson, Rick. “Oil Company Grows to Maturity,” The
Oklahoman, July 21, 2002.)
     5
       See Leary and Kowalski (1990) for an extensive survey of evidence that individuals care directly about
others’ impressions of them “even when no immediate or future outcomes depend on the impressions they
make.”
     6
       One interpretation is as follows. Three ingredients are necessary and sufficient for firm growth: a high-
quality product, a scalable business operation, and capital investment. The financier can provide the capital
for the entrepreneur to invest, but if either of the other two ingredients is missing, it will not yield a sufficient
return to the financier (creditor/equity-investor/acquirer).




                                                         5
owners, making financiers reluctant to provide capital to these enterprises.7
   We then consider a novel channel through which eponymy endogenously becomes a hin-
drance for financing (Section 2.2). Specifically, because due-diligence investigations require
time/effort/money, we posit that financiers may not be able to investigate every firm, but
only a fraction of them. Naturally, financiers focus their investigations on the firms that
they believe most likely to be high-quality growth opportunities. Hence, if financing consid-
erations are sufficiently important, the top priority of firms with growth potential will be to
appear to have growth potential. If eponymy is associated with low-growth ventures—even
though eponymy, per se, has no impact on the firm’s quality or growth potential—then it is
best to be avoided. Interestingly, this tradeoff arises in equilibrium when financiers’ capac-
ity for investigations (or bandwidth) is intermediate: Bandwidth must be large enough that
firms with growth potential have a hope of being found, but not so large that they will be
found no matter what strategy they choose.


2.1       General Framework
Players and Types
There is a unit mass of entrepreneurs, each with (a firm of) type θ, which has two dimensions.
First, the quality of her product/service/idea is either high, H, or low, L. Second, her business
is either scalable, S, or not, N . The commonly known distribution over the four possible
firm types, Θ ≡ {(H, S), (H, N ), (L, S), (L, N )}, is denoted π0 , with π0 (θ) > 0 for all θ ∈ Θ.
Each entrepreneur privately knows her own type. Let µ0 ≡ π0 (H, S) + π0 (H, N ) be the
proportion of H-quality firms.
   Each entrepreneur (also referred to as a sender ) cares about the impression of her firm’s
type held by two different classes of receivers: customers and financiers. For customers, the
scalability of the business is irrelevant, so the sender only benefits from improving customers’
impression of her firm on the quality dimension. In contrast, the entrepreneur can only
attract financiers if they believe her firm to be both high quality and scalable.

Sequence and Payoffs
The model consists of two periods. At the start of period 1, each entrepreneur engages
in a binary signaling activity, s ∈ {s, s}, where 0 < s < s (e.g., s = eponymy, s = not).
The market observes the choice of s, and updates its belief from π0 to π1 ∈ ∆(Θ). Let
µ1 ≡ π1 (H, S) + π1 (H, N ). As in Tadelis (1999), (i) the quality of a firm’s first-period
product (or service), g, is random, taking values in {l, h} according to Pr (g = h|θ = H) =
   7
       For further discussion of control rights as a potential basis for our assumption see Section 6.1.


                                                        6
Pr (g = l|θ = L) = p ∈ ( 21 , 1), independent across firms, and (ii) the first-period payoff to the
entrepreneur is the market’s belief that g will be realized h: V1 (µ1 ) ≡ µ1 p + (1 − µ1 )(1 − p).8
    After the conclusion of the first period, the market updates its belief from π1 to π2 ∈ ∆(Θ)
based on the observation of g. Once again, µ2 ≡ π2 (H, S) + π2 (H, N ). The entrepreneur’s
second-period payoff depends on this impression and on whether she receives financing,
and is intended as a reduced-form modeling of her long-run payoffs (as in Mailath, 1987).9
Specifically, we maintain the key assumption of BCD17 that a stronger association between
the entrepreneur and her firm amplifies the long-run reputational benefits (or costs) of a
favorable (or unfavorable) market impression. To capture this, let V2 (µ2 ) = µ2 − (1 − µ2 )
(i.e., the µ2 -weighted convex combination of 1 and −1). If only this feature were present
(as in BCD17), the sender’s second-period payoff would be represented as sV2 (µ2 ), and we
refer to V1 (µ1 ) + sV2 (µ2 ) as her stand-alone payoff. In addition, the entrepreneur’s firm may
receive financing, which generates an additional payoff of b > 0.10
    Because financiers perform due diligence, only (H, S)-firms can obtain financing.11 Let
Q(s) be the probability that a (H, S)-sender will receive financing if she selects s ∈ {s, s}.
As discussed above, we begin with the direct assumption that eponymy is a hindrance in the
market for financing:12

A.0 Q(s) > Q(s).

Hence, the expected financing benefit for a (H, S)-type selecting signal s is F (s) ≡ Q(s)b,
and the increase in this benefit from selecting s instead of s is ∆F ≡ F (s) − F (s) > 0.

Equilibrium Notion
Our solution concept is Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium, henceforth equilibrium. As is common
in signaling models, the game has multiple equilibria. Correspondingly, in the theory of
signaling games, there is a long tradition of employing criteria for deeming some equilibria
    8
        In Tadelis (1999), this payoff is micro-founded by consumers valuing quality g = h at 1 and g = l at 0,
and, being on the “long” side of the market, they pay their expected value before service is rendered.
      9
        As described in BCD17, “the two-period model is a simplified approximation of a longer dynamic process
... [in which] ... information and firm performance evolve jointly throughout the life of the firm, rather than
in one-shot. However, the works of Alos-Ferrer and Prat (2012) and Daley and Green (2014) show that
a fully dynamic, infinite-horizon modeling of this phenomenon, while more analytically complex, does not
meaningfully alter the incentives for the initial signaling decision.” (p. 1642)
    10
        As in footnote 9, b is a reduced-form encapsulation of the expected net benefit of the entire discounted
stream of value generated from access to financing, including the possibilities that financing may not take
place all at once and/or that attempting to scale could entail additional risks.
    11
        The model can accommodate imperfectly revealing investigations, meaning sometimes the wrong firms
will receive financing. Taking the limit to perfectly revealing investigations is done for simplicity.
    12
        In Section 6 we explore factors that, a priori, could plausibly contribute directly to this hindrance, such
as the control-rights argument mentioned above.



                                                        7
less desirable than others. We therefore say an equilibrium is trivial if it involves every
entrepreneur selecting s.13

Preliminary Analysis
First, notice that types (L, S) and (L, N ) have no meaningful distinction in the model since
customers do not view them differently, and financiers are not interested in either of them.
Hence, we group them together and simplify to three types: {(H, S), (H, N ), L}.
    Next, in any equilibrium, the market updates its belief twice: from π0 to π1 based on the
choice of s, and from π1 to π2 based on the realization of g. This second update is a straight-
forward application of Bayes rule. It follows that, given arbitrary values for s and µ1 , the
entrepreneur’s expected total stand-alone payoff is uθ (s, µ1 ) ≡ V1 (µ1 ) + Eg [sV2 (µ2 (µ1 , g))|θ].
    Direct calculations yield i) uθ is increasing in µ1 ; and ii) there exists µθ ∈ (0, 1) such
that uθ is increasing in s if and only if µ > µθ .14 Intuitively, all senders (i) enjoy increased
perception of being high quality, and (ii) wish to amplify their stand-alone payoff if and only
if they expect the second-period impression of their quality to be sufficiently high. Further,
because g is informative about quality, high-quality entrepreneurs are more willing to amplify
their stand-alone payoff than are low-quality ones: µ(H,S) = µ(H,N ) < µL .
    Consider now an L-type entrepreneur. Since her firm will not be receiving financing,
her payoff in equilibrium is just her stand-alone payoff. Suppose she selects s = s and that
receivers correctly believe her to be of type L, implying µ1 = µ2 = 0. Then her payoff is
uL (s, 0) = (1−p)−s. Now, define µ∗ to be the belief level that satisfies uL (s, µ∗ ) = (1−p)−s.
That is, the low type is indifferent between selecting s and s if the resultant first-period beliefs
satisfy µ1 (s) = 0 and µ1 (s) = µ∗ . From the preceding paragraph, µ∗ is unique and in (0, µL ).
As in BCD17, we assume that high-quality entrepreneurs are relatively rare:

A.1 π0 (H, S) + π0 (H, N ) ≡ µ0 < µ∗ .


Results
Let σ(θ) denote the proportion of type-θ entrepreneurs that select s. The behavior of type-
(H, N ) entrepreneurs is the easiest to characterize.
  13
       Such an equilibrium can be supported by having receivers believe with certainty that any entrepreneur
who selects s is of quality L. It is easily shown that such an equilibrium fails stability-based refinements
such as D1 (Cho and Kreps 1987; Banks and Sobel 1987). We directly designate this equilibrium as trivial
not only to simplify exposition, but also because we believe it is independently unappealing, regardless of
refinements.

Lemma 1 In any nontrivial equilibrium, all (H, N ) entrepreneurs select s (i.e., σ(H, N ) = 1).

   Intuitively, since they expect the realization of their first-period quality to be positive,
H-quality senders gain more than L-quality ones from payoff amplification of their stand-
alone payoff, which is the only consideration if the firm is also not scalable. Next, for the
behavior of L-types:

Lemma 2 In any nontrivial equilibrium, the proportions of L entrepreneurs selecting s and
selecting s are both strictly positive (i.e., 0 < σ(L) < 1).

   Intuitively, if no L-types select s, then given Lemma 1, selecting s would lead customers
to believe that one’s firm is certainly high quality. But then selecting s would lead to the
highest possible payoff for an L-type, so they would prefer to deviate. However, if all L-types
select s, then customers’ beliefs after seeing s are driven down. Since payoffs are amplified
when s is chosen, this leads to a lower expected payoff for the L-type than selecting s (even
if selecting s perfectly revealed that θ = L).
   Because some L-type entrepreneurs select s while others select s, it must be that they
are indifferent between them (which will be used to pin down the exact value of σ(L)). This
indifference requires that low types who select s, and thereby risk amplifying an unfavorable
impression, are compensated with a higher first-period belief, µ1 (s). Since beliefs must be
correct in equilibrium, we have the following.

Proposition 1 In any nontrivial equilibrium, the average quality of entrepreneurs selecting s
(eponymy) is higher than the average quality of entrepreneurs selecting s (i.e., µ1 (s) > µ1 (s)).

   What is left to specify is the behavior of (H, S)-entrepreneurs. Consider the following
two equilibrium candidates.

Candidate 1

 • σ(H, N ) = σ(H, S) = 1.
             µ0 (1−µ∗ )
 • σ(L) =    µ∗ (1−µ0 )
                        ,   which is the unique solution to uL (s, 0) = uL (s, µ0 +π0µ(L)σ(L)
                                                                                       0
                                                                                              ) = uL (s, µ∗ ).


Candidate 2

 • σ(H, N ) = 1 and σ(H, S) = 0.
                                                 π0 (H,S)
 • σ(L) is the unique solution to uL (s, π0 (H,S)+π  0 (L)(1−σ(L))
                                                                   ) = uL (s, π0 (H,Nπ0)+π
                                                                                        (H,N )
                                                                                           0 (L)σ(L)
                                                                                                     ).


                                                        9
    Candidate 1 is the natural extension of the equilibrium studied in BCD17: All high-
quality entrepreneurs select s, amplifying the expected reputational benefits of their likely
good reputation, while low-quality ones mix between imitating and not until the gain in
impression from selecting s is exactly offset by the fact that the reputational cost from their
likely negative outcome is amplified. Not surprisingly, if financing considerations are minimal
(i.e., ∆F is small), this is the characterization of equilibrium behavior.

Proposition 2 There exists ∆F1 such that if ∆F < ∆F1 , then Candidate 1 is the unique
nontrivial equilibrium.

    In Candidate 1, (H, S)-entrepreneurs forgo greater financing for the reputational benefit
of eponymy. As ∆F gets larger, this choice becomes increasingly costly for (H, S)-types.
Hence, when financing considerations are paramount, they will be better off forgoing the
positive payoff amplification of s, in favor of greater financing and growth.

Proposition 3 There exists ∆F2 such that if ∆F > ∆F2 , then Candidate 2 is the unique
nontrivial equilibrium.

    When ∆F is intermediate both Candidates are equilibria. However, all entrepreneurs
prefer Candidate 2 to Candidate 1, not just the (H, S)-types who enjoy greater financing.
Because (H, S)-types now choose s, doing so becomes more attractive to L-types, as they
get to pool with high-quality senders, which L-types enjoy. This increases the proportion
of L-types selecting s and, correspondingly, decreases the proportion of L-types selecting s.
Hence, s becomes a stronger signal of high quality, which (H, N )-types enjoy.15

Proposition 4 If ∆F ∈ [∆F1 , ∆F2 ], both Candidates 1 and 2 are equilibria. The equilibrium
expected payoffs of all entrepreneur types is greater in Candidate 2 than in Candidate 1.

    Finally, from Proposition 1, we know that eponymy is associated with higher average
quality in both candidate equilibria. However, in Candidate 2, less high-quality entrepreneurs
select into eponymy. In isolation this force decreases the relationship between eponymy and
entrepreneurial quality, but analysis is more subtle because low-quality senders also respond
by adjusting their mixing between eponymy and not. Nevertheless, the relationship between
eponymy and quality is indeed weaker in Candidate 2.
  15
     For ∆F ∈ [∆F1 , ∆F2 ] there is also a third equilibrium in which (H, S)-types mix between s and s. Each
type’s payoff in this third equilibrium is less than their payoff in Candidate 2, but greater than their payoff
in Candidate 1. There are no other nontrivial equilibria. Hence, whenever Candidate 2 is an equilibrium, it
generates the highest payoffs to all entrepreneur types among all nontrivial equilibria.



                                                      10
Proposition 5 Selecting s (eponymy) is associated with a larger difference in average quality
in Candidate 1 than in Candidate 2 (i.e., letting µC
                                                   1 (s) be the proportion of high-quality
entrepreneurs among those selecting s in Candidate C, we have µ11 (s)−µ11 (s) > µ21 (s)−µ21 (s)).



2.2    Bandwidth Constraints
The analysis above assumes that eponymy makes a firm less attractive to financiers. In
this subsection we further develop the model by considering a more subtle argument. In it,
financiers care only about the quality and scalability of a firm—which, recall, is revealed by
their due-diligence investigation. However, because such investigations take time/effort/money,
they cannot investigate every firm, but only a fraction of them. That is, there is a capacity
constraint that limits the fraction of firms that financiers can investigate. Because financiers
are only interested in (H, S)-firms, they will focus their investigations on the firms they
believe most likely to be high-quality growth opportunities.
   The subtlety in the model, then, is that Q(s) and Q(s) are no longer fixed, but instead
vary with the profile of play: The likelihood of being investigated and financed depends on the
equilibrium inference drawn from seeing the choice of signal, s. Hence, we no longer impose
the direct Assumption A.0. Instead, let q be the fraction of firms that can be investigated.
Further, in order for our results to be stated in terms of model primitives, from the financing
considerations F (s) and F (s) we must disentangle the benefit, b, from its likelihood, Q(s)
and Q(s), respectively. With these updates, we show that the main insights from Section
2.1 continue to hold, and identify the conditions under which eponymy endogenously leads
to a disadvantage in the market for financing.
   In the sequence of play, after observing a firm’s choice of signal s and the quality of its
first-period product g, financiers decide whether they are sufficiently interested in the firm
to investigate it further. For any candidate equilibrium profile, we must specify the priority
order of investigation given each firm’s choice of s and realization of g. Naturally, financiers
will focus on the firms they believe most likely to be of type (H, S), as summarized by their
belief π2 . Therefore, augment the description of Candidate 1 with: financiers first investigate
senders that select s, starting with those for which g = h. Likewise, augment the description
of Candidate 2 with: financiers first investigate senders that select s, starting with those for
which g = h.
   In subtle contrast to Section 2.1, there is now a coordination element to equilibrium:
Financiers focus their investigations using what they believe to be signals of (H, S)-types,
and (H, S)-types want to choose signals they believe will lead to financiers investigating


                                               11
them. Hence, while the property assumed in A.0 arises endogenously in Candidate 2, it is
actually violated in Candidate 1. The only two alterations from the results in Section 2.1
are then as follows. First, Candidate 1 is always an equilibrium. Second, Propositions 3 and
4 are replaced with the following.

Proposition 6 If b is large enough, then

    • there exists q < q, both in (0, 1), such that Candidate 2 is an equilibrium when q ∈ [q, q]

    • and, if p is also large enough, there exists q < q, both in (q, q), such that Candidate 2
      maximizes the payoffs of all entrepreneurs among nontrivial equilibria when q ∈ [q, q].

    Hence, the suitability of Candidate 2 as a prediction of behavior is strongest for inter-
mediate levels of due-diligence capacity. As in Section 2.1, the driving force behind the
eponymy-growth tradeoff is the relative financing disadvantage eponymy generates. When
financiers have the bandwidth to investigate almost all firms (i.e., q close to 1), (H, S)-firms
will almost surely be financed, no matter what name they choose, so they decide to enjoy
the reputational benefits of eponymy as well. At the other extreme, when financiers have so
little bandwidth that they investigate almost no firms (i.e., q close to 0), (H, S)-firms will
almost surely not be financed, no matter what name they choose, so they again decide to at
least enjoy the reputational benefits of eponymy.
    For intermediate q the titular tradeoff between growth and glory arises. For the (H, S)-
entrepreneur, selecting eponymy generates an expected reputational benefit, regardless of q.
On the other hand, selecting non-eponymy allows (H, S)-types to separate from (H, N )-types
(who always select eponymy, Lemma 1) and become more easily identifiable to financiers.
As described in the preceding paragraph, for this second consideration to bite, there must be
enough bandwidth for there to be a real hope of being financed, but not so much bandwidth
that there is no fear (H, S)-types will not be financed. Intuitively, there are two mechanisms
for sorting in the model: by name choice and by realized quality of output. High-quality
firms with growth potential differentiate themselves from high-quality but low-growth firms
via name choice, and from low-quality firms via realized quality.


3     Data
We use the same dataset as BCD17, which we briefly review here. The data are from the
Amadeus database, maintained by Bureau van Dijk (BvD), which contains ownership, man-
agement, and financial information for European firms. BvD obtains its data from regulatory
filings, third-party vendors, and its own proprietary sources. Amadeus includes both private

                                               12
and public firms in its data collection, allowing for an in-depth examination of new firms. It
also contains detailed ownership information, including the names of each shareholder, the
number and type of shares held, and information on the board of directors and management
of each firm. We supplement this data with information on the characteristics and locations
of banks from Bank Scope and Google Maps.
    We build our sample from firms located in Western European countries. In our sample,
19% of firms are from Italy, 19% from Spain, 17% from France, 15% from Great Britain,
14% from Portugal, and the remaining are from 10 other nations in the region.16 We retain
only those firms for which we have ownership information and data on their annual profits
(EBIT) and assets. The dataset covers the years 2002-2012 (inclusive). We aggregate the
data into a cross-sectional format by averaging the variables, such as ROA and sales growth,
within firm over time. The results we report are based on this cross-sectional data. Our final
estimation sample includes 1,363,694 firms.
    The main variable of interest in this paper is whether an entrepreneur names the firm
after herself. We refer the reader to BCD17 for an extensive discussion of how eponymy can
be defined and measured, as well as various sensitivity analyses. To code this variable in the
present paper, we use a string-matching algorithm that matches the firm name to the last
name of its leading shareholder. The automated process compares both names, assigns a
matching score, and identifies exact matches. We create a dummy variable that receives the
value of 1 for each firm whose name includes the name of its owner (eponymous ventures)
and 0 for all other firms. In the estimation sample, 23% of firms are eponymous.
    Table 1 presents summary statistics for the main variables in our sample. The average
firm has an ROA of 0.042 (a median of 0.019) and generates $2.2 million in annual sales (a
median of $402,000), has annual sales growth of 0.036 (a median 0.016), holds $2.6 million
in assets (a median of $418,000), has 17 employees (a median of 4), has 2 shareholders (a
median of 2), and equity dispersion (i.e., 1 − HHI) of 0.47 (a median of 0.50).17
    Table 2 presents mean comparison tests for differences in the main characteristics of
eponymous ventures and other companies. Eponymous ventures have higher ROA (0.059
vs. 0.037; difference is significant at the 1 percent level), but lower growth (0.021 vs. 0.041;
difference is significant at the 1 percent level). Table 3 shows that these differences in ROA
and growth are also evident in a regression framework (discussed further below). Although
eponymous firms are on average about 1 year older than other firms, they hold fewer assets
($2.3 million vs. $2.6 million; difference is significant at the 1 percent level). We find no
   16
      German firms are not required to report balance sheet information, and hence most of them are dropped
from our sample.
   17
      HHI is the sum of squared equity shares across the firm’s owners.



                                                    13
substantial differences in annual sales between eponymous and non-eponymous firms. Note
that eponymous firms have slightly higher profits (as measured by EBIT), even though they
have fewer assets than non-eponymous firms. These findings suggest that eponymous firms
are generating higher ROA (EBIT/assets) through superior asset efficiency and may possess
more intangible assets such as owner reputation.
    Firms in our sample are drawn from a wide industry distribution. For ease of presentation,
we aggregate the three-digit SIC codes to two-digit SIC categories. Appendix Table A1
presents the distribution of firms by industry. The most represented industries in our sample
are Business Services (124,890 firms), Real Estate (123,756 firms) and Construction (115,674
firms). The share of eponymous firms varies across industries, from a high of 56% in Legal
Services to a low of 8% in Communications.


4     Performance Patterns of Eponymous Ventures
We begin our analysis by presenting estimates of the relationship of the likelihood of eponymy
with ROA and sales growth. We estimate the following baseline specification:

        Pr(Eponymousi = 1) = β0 + β1 ROAi + β2 Growthi + Z0i γ + τt + µj + ϕc + i

where Eponymousi is a dummy variable receiving the value of 1 if firm i is eponymous and
                                                                           Salest
0 otherwise. ROA is EBIT divided by assets, and Growth is computed as ln( Salest−1
                                                                                   ); both
variables are averaged over the years 2002-2012. Z is a vector of firm-level controls including
logged sales, logged number of shareholders, and equity dispersion. τ , µ, and ϕ are complete
sets of year-of-incorporation, three-digit SIC code, and country dummies.  is a firm-level
i.i.d. error term.
    Aside from industry differences, there is also variation in the ownership structure of firms
in this dataset that should be considered. It is possible that firms with single owners or
more concentrated ownership might be more likely to be eponymous, and that ownership
structure might separately impact performance. We include controls for the annual number
of shareholders and concentration of equity among those shareholders in all specifications to
account for these possibilities.
    Our theory predicts a positive relationship between the likelihood of eponymy and ROA
(Proposition 1), and a negative relationship between the likelihood of eponymy and sales
growth when financing considerations are significant (Propositions 3 and 4). Therefore, we




                                               14
expect β̂1 > 0 and β̂2 < 0.18
   Table 3 presents the estimation results for the relationship between eponymy, ROA, and
growth. The general pattern of results shows that eponymous firms have better performance,
as indicated by higher ROA, but experience lower sales growth. We view these results
as conditional correlations that are consistent with our model. Column 1 includes ROA,
but does not control for sales growth. The coefficient estimate on ROA is positive and
highly significant. This estimate implies that a two-standard-deviation increase in ROA is
associated with a 3.3 percentage point increase (0.692 × 0.048) in the likelihood that a firm
is eponymous. Column 2 includes sales growth without controlling for ROA. The coefficient
estimate on sales growth is negative and highly significant. This estimate implies that a two-
standard-deviation increase in sales growth decreases the likelihood that a firm is eponymous
by 1.6 percentage points (0.782 × 0.020). Column 3 includes both ROA and sales growth in
a single regression. The coefficient estimates maintain their signs and statistical significance,
and slightly increase in absolute value (as one would expect given the positive correlation
between ROA and sales growth shown in Figure 1).
   In Column 4, we exploit variation within owners by comparing eponymous firms to non-
eponymous firms owned by the same owner. For this analysis, as in BCD17, we assigned a
unique identifier to each owner within and across years. We used direct and fuzzy match-
ing techniques to account for name-spelling errors and recording variations in determining
whether any two records are the same person. This process allows us to track within-firm
changes in eponymy and identify serial entrepreneurs. We supplemented this matching by
using detailed physical address information and business partners, which allows us to further
discern the identities of individuals with the same name. Using this process for the entire
sample, we matched over 11 million individual owner records associated with our sample
firms and assigned unique identifiers, both within and across years. For each multiple-
firm owner, we estimate owner fixed effects while controlling for observables. Based on our
unique identifier-assignment procedure, we have 1,144,878 distinct individual owners, out of
which about 10% owned at least two businesses. The vast majority of owners with mul-
tiple businesses focus on the same industry, both within a given year and over time. The
owner fixed-effect results are consistent with the previous specification, and the estimates
are slightly larger in absolute value. A two-standard-deviation increase in ROA (respec-
tively, sales growth) is associated with a 3.7 percentage point increase (2.4 percentage point
decrease) in the likelihood of eponymy.
   18
      When presenting results for the full sample of Western European nations, we expect that financing
considerations will be significant in aggregate. In other analyses, however, we exploit differences in the
financing environment to further test our theory.



                                                   15
   Column 5 explores differences between firms that are owner managed (the leading owner
is also the CEO or in an equivalent leadership position in the firm) and non-owner-managed
firms. The coefficient estimates on ROA and sales growth are similar to the estimates from
the complete sample.
   We also investigate whether ownership concentration may be related to eponymy, ROA,
and growth. While in all specifications we control for the number of shareholders and equity
dispersion, Columns 6-8 present separate estimates for firms with exactly one, two, or more
than two owners, respectively. Note that the incidence of eponymy is of similar magnitudes
across all of these firms; we do not see a significantly larger share of single-owner firms
choosing eponymy. Further, we find the same relationship between eponymy, ROA, and sales
growth for all subsamples, which is inconsistent with the notion that ownership concentration
is driving this relationship.
   We also seek to explore whether firm attributes or industry-specific shocks could explain
our results. Column 9 shows that we find similar results when we restrict the sample to young
firms (up to 3 years old), for which we would expect signaling one’s quality to be especially
important. In the final three columns, we consider whether the rise of Internet-enabled
commerce created the incentive to have a domain name and that this in turn influenced firm
naming decisions. Column 10 restricts the sample only to firms founded post-2002, at which
time the need for a business website would have been readily apparent. The same pattern
of results holds.
   Another set of tests to gain insights into the possible effect of e-commerce is to compare
businesses that sell to consumers versus to other businesses. We classified consumer products
industries by using the 4th revision of the United Nations’ Broad Economic Categories
(BEC).19 These categories allow for the identification of consumer durables and consumer
nondurable products. We crosswalk consumer products identified in the BEC to the United
Nations’ Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System.20 This list of products is
then finally matched to their corresponding SIC and NAICS codes as in the data appendix in
Pierce and Schott (2012). The same pattern of results holds for firms in consumer products
industries (Column 11) and those in industries that sell to other businesses (Column 12).
   In sum, the analysis in Table 3 indicates that eponymous firms are more profitable,
but grow more slowly, and this relationship is robust even when exploiting variation across
ventures of the same owner, dividing the data into key subsamples, and including additional
control variables.

5        The Financing Environment
We documented above that eponymous firms are more profitable but grow more slowly. Our
theory predicts that financing considerations are a key driver of this performance pattern. In
this section, we leverage variation in the firm’s financing environment to test these predictions
of our model.


5.1      Financial Development
Financial development refers to the quality and quantity of a firm’s local financial institutions
(Levine, 1997). In more financially developed regions, we predict that the expected benefits
of seeking financing are higher, since there are a greater number of financial intermediaries
with deeper expertise in comparison to less financially developed regions. Thus we use this
measure to proxy for aggregate financing considerations (i.e., ∆F in the model).

5.1.1     Measuring Financial Development
We first compute measures of financial development at the regional level. A challenge in this
approach is that firms in the Amadeus dataset are not classified to regions. Nevertheless, for
each firm we have information on its physical address. We use this information to manually
match each firm/city to a region. Regions are identified according to the Nomenclature of
Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS).21
     We collected data from Internet searches on all cities related to each NUTS level 1 code.
City lists were standardized by cleaning all non-alphabetic characters and converting all
strings to uppercase characters.22 We further verified the match by country since similar
names can be related to several countries.23 Firms in our sample are matched into 100
regions that are part of 15 Western European countries. The number of regions varies by
country. For example, British firms belong to 12 regions, French firms to 9 regions, Spanish
firms to 7 regions, and Italian firms to 5 regions. Due to the differences in the number of
regions per country, our econometric analysis is always performed within country.
     We first proxy for regional financial development by using the region’s absolute number
of employees in financial credit institutions. Because regions vary by size, in all regressions
    21
      http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview.
    22
      In addition, ligatures and letters that contain diacritics were replaced by their Latin character com-
bination equivalent; for example, “Æ” with “AE,” “ß” with “SS,” and “Ü” with “UE.” Finally, we used
an automated fuzzy string-matching algorithm on the standardized names to link each firm, based on the
city from its address field, to its related NUTS code. This match takes into account similar names, spacing
differences, spelling mistakes, and other data-entry errors. For example, “Norderstet” was matched to the
German city Norderstedt.
   23
      For example, Winkel is an Italian town in NUTS FR4, as well as a Swiss municipality in NUTS CH04.


                                                    17
we control for region fixed effects (ωr ). Information on the number of employees in financial
credit institutions in each region comes from Structural Business Statistics (SBS) provided
by Eurostat. SBS collects information on credit institutions, where a credit institution is “an
undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and
to grant credits for its own account” (SBS definition).24 The number of financial institution
employees varies considerably across regions, from a 10th percentile value of 18,501 to a
90th percentile value of 131,456 (mean of 75,103 and standard deviation of 39,060). Data
on employees in financial institutions are available only for the following countries: Austria,
Belgium, Germany, Great Britain, and Italy (covering a total of 39 regions).
    We use two additional measures of regional financial development: the number of credit
institutions in the region and the productivity of the local financial institutions. The number
of credit institutions in each region is based on SBS data, and varies from a 10th percentile
value of 1.3 to a 90th percentile value of 9.7 (mean of 5.7 and standard deviation of 3.7).
Financial sector productivity is the ratio between total revenues by financial institutions
in a region and the number of financial sector employees, which comes from the European
Competitiveness Index 2006-2007 report (Huggins and Davies, 2006). Financial sector pro-
ductivity varies from a 10th percentile value of 61,140 to a 90th percentile value of 121,770
(mean of 88,555 and standard deviation of 24,948). Information on the number of credit in-
stitutions is available for the following countries: Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain,
Italy, and Spain (a total of 53 regions). Information on productivity of financial institutions
is available for the following countries: Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great
Britain, and Spain (a total of 55 regions). Hence, using these additional measures has the
benefit of increasing the geographic coverage for our tests.25
    The three measures described above all capture financial development at the regional
level. We next develop finer measures of the financial development of each firm’s local
environment using the precise addresses of firms and proximate banks. Arguably, financial
development should be higher for firms that have greater access to banks. We introduce
data from BvD’s Bank Scope dataset to construct these financial development measures.
The first is the number of banks in the city of the focal firm, and the second is the minimum
distance between the focal firm and a bank in its city.
    To obtain distances between firms and banks, we undertake a multi-step process. We
first extract street address, city, region, postal code, and country information from Bank
  24
     All credit institutions under this definition operate in the NACE 65.2 or NACE 65.12 business segments.
  25
     An example of a region that is ranked highly on financial development is Northwest Italy (NUTS ITC).
The share of eponymous firms in this region is 0.1. An example of a region that is ranked low on financial
development is Schleswig-Holstein (Germany, NUTS DEF). The share of eponymous firms in this region is
0.4. The regions are nearly identical in terms of population density.


                                                    18
Scope. We then employ a custom program that utilizes the Google Maps Geocoding API to
obtain geographic coordinates of these locations. Based on these coordinates, we calculate
straight-line distances in kilometers between the firms and local banks within each city in
our sample. A main challenge for obtaining distances between street-level locations is that
street addresses are prone to misspellings. While this issue cannot be perfectly remedied,
using Google Maps Geocoding API enables us to handle small variations in spelling because
the API corrects incorrect addresses whenever it is able to find a close match. We manually
check a subset of these adjusted addresses to make sure that they are within reasonable areas
based on city and postal code information.

5.1.2   Empirical Findings on Financial Development
We now turn to exploring how the performance patterns of eponymous firms differ based on
the level of financial development in their area. We estimate the following specification:

Pr(Eponymousi = 1) = β0 + β1 ROAi × F inDevr + β2 ROAi + Z0i γ + τt + µj + ϕc + ωr + i

   Our model implies that in the absence of financing considerations, high-quality firms,
both scalable and non-scalable, will sort into eponymy (Proposition 2). In contrast, the
availability of financing pushes high-quality firms with growth potential out of eponymy and
into non-eponymous names (Propositions 3 and 4). When these high-quality firms choose
non-eponymous names, it should weaken the relationship between performance and eponymy
(Proposition 5). Thus, we expect that as the availability of finance increases, the positive
relationship between ROA and eponymy should weaken. Applying this logic to our empirical
analysis, we generally expect a positive eponymy-ROA relationship, β̂2 > 0, which weakens
as the level of financial development improves, β̂1 < 0.
   Table 4 presents the estimation results, which confirm our theoretical predictions. In
Column 1, the coefficient estimate on the interaction term between ROA and the log of the
region’s number of employees in credit institutions is negative and statistically significant.
This finding indicates that as financing considerations increase in importance, the difference
in ROA between eponymous and non-eponymous firms shrinks. Based on the estimate from
Column 1, moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile value of this measure of financial
development lowers the positive estimate on ROA by 33% (from 0.18 to 0.12). Columns 2
and 3 present the same pattern of results with our additional measures of regional finan-
cial development: number of credit institutions (Column 2) and productivity of financial
institutions (Column 3).
   Columns 4-6 present the results using our firm-level measures of financial development


                                             19
generated from Bank Scope. Here we measure financial development using the number of
banks in the city where the firm is located (Column 4) and the shortest distance between
the focal firm and a bank (Columns 5 and 6).26 Both of these measures moderate the
ROA-eponymy relationship as expected. The coefficient estimate on the interaction term of
ROA with number of banks is negative and significant (Column 4), which is consistent with
the idea that as the number of banks in the city of a focal firm increases (hence financial
development increases), more high-quality firms sort into non-eponymy. For distance from
a bank (Columns 5 and 6), the coefficient estimates on the interaction term between ROA
and distance are positive, consistent with the idea that as the distance between a firm and
its closest bank increases (hence financial development decreases), fewer high-quality firms
sort into non-eponymy.
    As a final robustness check, in Column 7 we use self-reported firm-distance-from-bank
data from the World Management Survey (WMS).27 The sign of the coefficient is as expected,
although only significant at the 11% level. Note that we have a much smaller sample of firms
from the WMS (1,370 firms), which may partially explain the precision of this estimate.


5.2     External Finance Dependence
The value of obtaining external financing should be higher for firms in industries that are
more reliant on external finance. Thus we exploit variation in industry external finance
dependence (Rajan and Zingales, 1998) to proxy for the benefit of obtaining financing (i.e.,
b in the model).

5.2.1    Measuring External Finance Dependence
We follow Rajan and Zingales (1998) and rank industries according to their dependence on
external finance. In computing measures of external finance dependence, we use American
Compustat firms, with values averaged over the pre-estimation sample period 1990-2001. As
discussed by Rajan and Zingales (1998), U.S. industries provide an appropriate benchmark
for analysis. Since the U.S. market is one of the most advanced capital markets in the world,
American firms face the least frictions in accessing external finance. This means that the
amount of external finance used by these companies is likely to be a “pure” measure of their
demand for external finance.
   26
      We are unable to extract distance information for the complete sample. Hence we report the estimation
results for the entire sample of firms in Column 5 and for a subsample of firms (254,393 observations) in
Column 6, where firm-bank distance information was successfully extracted.

                                                    20
   We compute two of Rajan and Zingales’s measures of dependence: External Finance
Dependence and External Equity Dependence. External Finance Dependence is the ratio
between capital expenditures minus cash flow from operations and capital expenditures.
External Finance Dependence varies from a 10th percentile value of 0.1 to a 90th percentile
value of 0.56 (mean of 0.35 and standard deviation of 0.19). External Equity Dependence
is the ratio between the net amount of equity issued and capital expenditures. External
Equity Dependence varies from a 10th percentile value of -0.3 to a 90th percentile value of
0.36 (mean of 0.10 and standard deviation of 0.32).

5.2.2    Empirical Findings on Finance Dependence
To investigate the effect of external finance dependence, we estimate the following specifica-
tion:

   Pr(Eponymousi = 1) = β0 + β1 ROAi × ExtDepj + β2 ROAi + Z0i γ + τt + µj + ϕc + i

Our theory predicts that the positive relationship between eponymy and ROA will weaken
as external finance dependence increases, and thus we expect β̂1 < 0.28
   Table 5 exploits variation across industries in terms of their demand for external financing
(measured by External Finance Dependence, except for Column 2, which uses External
Equity Dependence). Our theoretical predictions are confirmed. The coefficient estimate
on the interaction term between ROA and external dependence (Column 1) is negative
and statistically significant. Results are similar when using External Equity Dependence
(Column 2).
   To mitigate concerns that the ROA-external dependence interaction is driven by unob-
served industry heterogeneity, Column 3 controls for industry fixed effects (the linear term
of external dependence is absorbed by the industry fixed effects). The coefficient estimate
on the ROA-external dependence interaction remains negative and statistically significant.
Finally, Column 4 calculates External Finance Dependence based only on young Compustat
firms (5 years or less from their IPO year) to better align this measure with our sample
of firms, which are predominantly young and small. The negative ROA-external finance
dependence interaction remains.
  28
    Recall that external finance dependence proxies for b in the model, and that ∆F is increasing in b.
Hence the prediction follows the same logic described in Section 5.1.2.




                                                  21
5.3     Bandwidth Constraints
As described above, we found strong evidence for our theory’s predicted relationship between
the financing environment and eponymy. Recall that a critical component of our theory is
that eponymy is a hindrance in the market for financing (Assumption A.0 in the general
framework, Section 2.1). In Section 2.2 we demonstrated that this hindrance can arise
endogenously when financiers face bandwidth constraints. We next build a unique measure
to capture bandwidth and empirically explore the predictions of this endogenous explanation.

5.3.1    Measuring Bandwidth
We operationalize financier bandwidth as follows. For each firm, we identify its nearest bank
using Bank Scope data (see Section 5.1.1 for details). Then, we count the number of other
firms that are closer to that bank than the focal firm. Arguably, as the number of closer
firms increases, the likelihood that the focal firm will be able to attract financing decreases
(in other words, the bandwidth in the firm’s environment decreases). Hereafter we refer to
this notion as density. Note that density is inversely related to the concept of bandwidth in
the model.
    On average, there are 1.56 banks in a city where our firms reside. The average distance
between a firm and a bank is 5 km, and the minimum distance between a firm and a bank
is 0. The average distance between a firm and its nearest bank is 3.85 km. Per bank, there
is an average of 2,189 firms in a 50 km radius. For density, an average firm has 5,478 firms
that are closer to its nearest bank (a median of 1,673).29

5.3.2    Empirical Findings on Bandwidth
To explore the impact of bandwidth, we estimate the following specification:

Pr(Eponymousi = 1) = β0 + β1 ROAi × ln(1 + CloserF irmsi ) + β2 ROAi × ln(1 + BankDistancei )
                                      + β3 ROAi + Z0i γ + τt + µj + ϕc + ωr + i

Note that we control for the distance of the focal firm to its nearest bank in all specifications.
    We present the results from this analysis in Table 6. In Columns 1-3, we find that the
interaction between ROA and our measure of density (log of the number of firms closer to
the bank) is negative and statistically significant. This result holds whether we use all firms
in the dataset, even those that do not have detailed address information (Column 1) or only
  29
     Note that out-of-sample firms are also included in density calculations. That is, for in-sample firm i
with distance Di to its nearest bank Bi , we count all firms j within Di of Bi even if we do not have firm j’s
financial or ownership information.


                                                     22
firms that we have bank-distance data available for (Column 2). In Column 3, we show that
the result holds when we consider only small firms, defined by having sales lower than the
median firm in the sample.
     Just as in our earlier analyses (Sections 5.1 and 5.2), the negative coefficient on the
interaction of interest means that as density increases (i.e., bandwidth decreases), the positive
relationship between eponymy and ROA declines. This empirical pattern is consistent with
the argument that as density increases, high-quality scalable firms sort out of eponymy and
into non-eponymous names, which our theory predicts will happen when density rises from
low to moderate levels (Proposition 6).
     In contrast to our predictions about financial development and external finance depen-
dence however, the model predicts that if density further rises from moderate to high levels,
high-quality scalable firms would sort back into eponymy. Hence, the empirical findings in
Columns 1-3 are consistent with the preponderance of our sample firms existing in low to
moderate density environments. The descriptive statistics of the density measure (Table
1) support this conjecture, as the distribution of density is highly right-skewed, with the
average being far higher than the median.30
     We next turn to exploring whether there is in fact a U-shaped effect of bandwidth on
the eponymy-ROA relationship. In Column 4, we add density-quartiles to the specification
used in Column 2 (all proximate firms). We find that the negative effect is indeed non-
monotonic and strongest for firms in the 3rd quartile of density (the latter fact again being
consistent with the preponderance of our sample firms existing in low to moderate density
environments). In Column 5 we add density-quartiles to the specification used in Column 3
(all proximate small firms). Again, we find the same non-monotonic effect, which is strongest
in the 3rd quartile of firms.


6         Alternative Explanations
The evidence presented above provides support for our theory, including the endogenous
explanation for why eponymy hinders access to financing. In this section, we consider alter-
native explanations and present additional robustness checks. Recall first that in Table 3 , we
conducted robustness checks on the relationship between eponymy, ROA, and sales growth.
We demonstrated that differences in the number of owners, firm age, and opportunities for
e-commerce do not appear to explain our findings (Columns 6-12).
    30
         We also ran the analysis without taking the log in the density measure, and the result continues to hold.




                                                         23
6.1    Control Rights and Family Firms
One possibility is that eponymy confers greater control rights to the owner at the expense
of financiers. This scenario could lead to financiers avoiding eponymous firms, and thereby
become a potential factor supporting Assumption A.0 within our theory. Note that the notion
that eponymy confers greater control rights is not mutually exclusive with our bandwidth
explanation for why eponymy hinders access to finance.
   While we cannot measure control rights at the firm level, we can attempt to shed some
light on this argument by analyzing a set of firms that have long been associated with a
preference for control: family firms and those managed by their founders.
   We first establish that the same relationship between eponymy, ROA, and sales growth
holds within family and founder-managed firms, but that these firms alone do not drive the
results in the full sample. We then leverage the reputation of family and founder-managed
firms as control-loving to explore the above hypothesis that eponymy confers control rights
and could therefore factor into our Assumption A.0.
   There is a rich tradition of family firm scholarship in strategy, economics, and organiza-
tions. The role of family members as top executives, employees, and key stakeholders for
the firm has been found to be related to financial performance (Villalonga and Amit, 2006;
Miller, Breton-Miller and Scholnick, 2008; Minichilli, Corbetta, and MacMillan, 2010) and
preferences for growth (Mishra and McConaughy, 1999; Gallo, Tapies, and Cappuyns, 2004;
Block, 2012; Miller, Minichilli, and Corbetta 2013; Patel and Chrisman, 2014). A key driver
of performance patterns for family firms is that owners typically have stronger emotional
attachment to the business, leading them to play a more prominent role in the organization
(Gersick et al., 1997; Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007; Belenzon et al., 2016). Villalonga and Amit
(2008) document how founding families use various mechanisms, including dual-class stock,
to enhance their control of publicly traded companies. This body of work is consistent with
the idea that family owners have a preference for control.
   There is some overlap between the research on family firms and studies of founder-
managed firms (Wasserman, 2003). Founders are thought to have a stronger emotional
attachment to the firm and have been empirically shown to have a preference for control
(e.g., Bennett, Lawrence, and Sadun, 2015). In light of this work, in the analyses below we
aggregate family businesses and founder-managed businesses into a single group.
   In Table 7 we present results from analysis conducted on World Management Survey
data (WMS, 1,376 European firms). We implement the same eponymy coding procedure for
the WMS sample of firms, and use the WMS’s classifications of family and founder-managed
firms. About 13 percent of the firms in the WMS sample are eponymous (an incidence level


                                             24
lower than in our main sample, mostly because the WMS sample focuses on medium-sized
firms, whereas our sample includes many small firms).
   In Column 1, we replicate our main results on this far smaller sample, finding the same
relationship between eponymy, ROA, and sales growth. In Column 2 we limit the sample to
only family and founder-managed businesses, both of which are associated with a preference
for control. In Column 3 we run the analysis on the whole WMS sample and control for
family and founder-managed businesses. In both cases, our results are similar to that of our
main analysis. While these firms are slightly more likely to be eponymous, it is unlikely that
their preference for control is driving our findings on the relationship between ROA, sales
growth, and eponymy.
   Columns 4-6 examine how the eponymy-ROA relationship is moderated by the family-
ownership/founder-managed variable and by financial development. Consistent with the
view that family and founder-managed firms have a stronger preference for control, we find
that the ROA-eponymy relationship is stronger for these firms (that is, among family and
founder-managed firms, high-quality firms are more likely to be eponymous than are other
high-quality firms). However, this result is evident only in regions with low financial de-
velopment (Column 5). In regions with high financial development (Column 6), there is
no discernible difference in the ROA-eponymy relationship for family and founder-managed
firms compared to other firms.
   Returning to the conjecture that eponymy may confer control rights to the owner, our
results provide some insight. Suppose that eponymy confers greater control rights, which
financiers dislike (and family and founder-managed firms prize). Then the observed pattern
is consistent with family and founder-managed firms trading off the benefits from stronger
control with the desire for scalability. That is, when financial development is weak and
scaling is not likely, high-quality family and founder-managed firms disproportionately sort
into eponymy to enjoy the benefits of control (on top of reputation enhancement). But when
scaling is possible (i.e., financial development is high), these firms forgo eponymy to attract
financing, just as other high-quality firms do. Taken together, these results are consistent
with the suppositions that eponymy increases the owner’s control and hinders her access to
financing, which would lend support to Assumption A.0. within our model.


6.2    Management Style
Another potential explanation for our results could be that eponymous firms are managed
differently than non-eponymous firms. We explore this possibility in Table 8. Using the
World Management Survey (WMS), we can investigate whether there are systematic differ-


                                              25
ences between eponymous and non-eponymous firms in terms of how they are managed.
   As in Table 7, Column 1 of Table 8 replicates our baseline results for reference. In each
subsequent column, the “WMS variable” row indicates the conditional correlation between
the survey variable (e.g., “Developing talent”) and eponymy.
   In Column 2, we test for systematic differences in the overall quality of the firm’s man-
agement. For this question, the top manager rates from 1 to 10 the overall management
quality of the organization, self-excluded (survey section “Human Resources/Constraints on
Management, Question g”). We find no differences between eponymous and non-eponymous
firms.
   Eponymous entrepreneurs might have trouble attracting high-quality talent that is re-
quired for growth. Perhaps these would-be employees are unwilling to work for a firm where
the founder would presumably receive disproportionate credit for their contribution. If this
argument were true, we would expect to find systematic differences in talent management
between eponymous and non-eponymous firms. Columns 3-5 examine three survey questions
from the WMS that are likely to pick up such heterogeneity: Column 3, Developing talent
(survey Q16); Column 4, Retaining talent (Q18); and Column 5, Performance tracking (Q4).
Each of these questions is assessed on a 5-point scale. For all of these questions, there is no
systematic difference in the responses of eponymous and non-eponymous firms.
   We next explore whether there are differences in effort between managers of eponymous
and non-eponymous firms. In BCD17, the authors empirically explore whether there are
differences in effort between eponymous and non-eponymous firms and find none. For com-
pleteness, we include similar analyses on our slightly smaller set of firms in the present
manuscript. Columns 6 and 7 examine answers to the questions from the WMS about the
average weekly hours worked for managers and the entire workforce, respectively (“Human
Resources/Constraints on Management, Question c”). There is no systematic difference in
the amount of hours worked by managers or workers, inconsistent with the view that differ-
ences in total effort levels explain why eponymous firms have higher ROA but grow more
slowly than non-eponymous firms.
   Columns 8-12 investigate potential differences in several additional aspects of managerial
style. Column 8 (Time Horizon, Q10) and Column 9 (Targets, Q11) consider the extent
to which managers plan for the future and set targets. Both questions are assessed by the
interviewer on a 1-5 scale. Column 10 investigates whether there are differences in span of
control between eponymous and other firms (“Organization Questions, g”). Columns 11 and
12 explore whether there are differences between eponymous and non-eponymous firms with
respect to self-reported production capabilities (Lean Manufacturing Introduction, Q1) and
an assessment of the rationale for adoption of new methods (Lean Manufacturing Rationale,

                                              26
Q2). For all of these analyses, we find no differences between eponymous and non-eponymous
firms.
    In sum, based on World Management Survey data, we find exactly the same relationship
between eponymy, ROA, and growth as in our much larger sample—but no evidence that
these differences are driven by different management styles, practices, or capabilities.


7        Concluding Remarks
We seek to explain a puzzle in entrepreneurial strategy: If a particular reputation-enhancing
strategic choice is associated with greater profitability, why do more firms with growth aspi-
rations not use it? We present a model and provide supporting empirical evidence to argue
that the availability of and dependence on external financing are important considerations
in resolving this puzzle.
    We first observe a unique relationship between eponymous ventures (those named after
the owner), ROA, and sales growth. Eponymous firms are more profitable than the average
firm, but have lower sales growth. Our model is able to account for these patterns in
a setting where firms differ in both quality and scalability. We demonstrate how financing
concerns lead high-growth aspirants to sort into non-eponymous names, creating the patterns
of performance we observe in the data.
    The model makes further predictions about how these patterns should vary with the
firm’s financing environment. We use a large dataset of European firms and develop several
new measures of the firm-specific financing environment to test these implications of the
model, and we find support for its propositions.
    Our work has broader implications for the academic study of entrepreneurial strategy.
We propose that a key decision in entrepreneurship comes early on: when an entrepreneur
decides how closely to tie herself to her firm. This decision has attendant tradeoffs related
to reputational-payoff amplification and the possibility of growth, which are influenced by
the financing environment. We believe that this nexus between the individual and the firm
is an important area for future scholarly inquiry.

Notes: This table presents OLS estimation results for the relationship between eponymy, ROA, and growth. Analysis is cross-sectional and values are averaged over the period 2002-
2012. Column 4 restricts the sample to firms with owners who own more than one business and includes owner fixed effects. Column 5 classifies firms as owner-managed if the last
name of the manager is the same as the last name of the leading shareholder. Column 6 includes only firms that are named after an individual. Column 7-9 restrict the sample to firms
with 1, 2 and 3 and above shareholders, respectively. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust. * and ** indicate statistical significance at the 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Notes: This table presents OLS estimation results of how the relationship between eponymy and ROA varies by financial development. For Column 1-3, the Financial development
measures are at the NUTS level. In Column 3, No. of credit institutions is divided by 1000. For Columns 4 the Financial development measure is at the city level and is computed
based on the number of banks located in the focal firm's city as reported in Bank Scope for year 2009. In Column 5, the Financial development measure is at the firm level and is
measured by the minimum distance (km) between the focal firm and a matched Bank Scope bank in the same city, based on Google API. The estimation sample for Column 6 is
based on data from the World Management Survey for financial year 2007. In this specification, financial development is the actual distance from the nearest bank as reported by the
survey respondent. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust. * and ** indicate statistical significance at the 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Notes: This table presents OLS estimation results of how the relationship between eponymy and ROA varies by financier bandwidth. Bank
data is obtained from Bankscope for the year 2009 and is restricted to Commercial and Cooperative banks in the same city as the focal firm.
Distance from a bank is measured by the minimum distance (km) between the focal firm and a matched Bankscope bank in the same city,
based on Google API. For Column 1, No. of closer firms is measured as the number of firms in the focal firm's city with a shorter distance to
a bank (average of all relevant banks). Column 1 includes a dummy variable that equals 1 for observations with missing distance information
and zero for all other observations. Column 2 restricts the sample to firms with complete bank distance information. For Column 3, No. of
closer firms is restricted to small firms (below median sales). Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust. * and ** indicate statistical
significance at the 5% and 1% level, respectively.

A      Proofs
It is easier to prove Lemma 2 first, then Lemma 1. We also state and prove a third lemma, before
turning to the proofs of the propositions.

Proof of Lemma 2. For the purpose of contradiction, suppose that σ(L) = 0 in a nontrival
equilibrium. Since the equilibrium is nontrival, either σ(H, S) > 0 or σ(H, N ) > 0. Hence,
µ1 (s) = 1. By deviating to s, the low type would earn uL (s, 1) > uL (s, µ1 (s)) for any value of
µ1 (s). Hence, σ(L) > 0 in any nontrival equilibrium.
    Suppose instead that σ(L) = 1. Since the equilibrium is nontrival, either σ(H, S) < 1 or
σ(H, N ) < 1. Hence, µ1 (s) = 1 and µ1 (s) < µ0 < µ∗ , the last inequality by Assumption A.1. By
deviating to s, the low type would earn uL (s, 1) > uL (s, 0) = uL (s, µ∗ ) > uL (s, µ1 (s)). Hence,
σ(L) < 1 in any nontrival equilibrium.

Proof of Lemma 1.              From Lemma 2, in any nontrival equilibrium µ1 (s) and µ1 (s) satisfy
uL (s, µ1 (s)) = uL (s, µ1 (s)). The single-crossing property of uL and uH established in BCD17 then
implies that uH (s, µ1 (s)) < uH (s, µ1 (s)), so the (H, N )-sender strictly prefers s in any nontrival
equilibrium.


Lemma 3 Fix σ(H, N ) = 1 and σ(H, S) = k ∈ [0, 1). For any value of σ(L), denote the Bayesian
consistent beliefs as

                                               π0 (H, S)(1 − k)
                      µ1 (s|σ(L)) =                                     , and
                                    π0 (H, S)(1 − k) + π0 (L)(1 − σ(L))
                                           π0 (H, N ) + π0 (H, S)k
                      µ1 (s|σ(L)) =                                      .
                                    π0 (H, N ) + π0 (H, S)k + π0 (L)σ(L)

Then there exists a unique σ(L) ∈ (0, 1) that solves uL (s, µ1 (s|σ(L))) = uL (s, µ1 (s|σ(L))).

Proof. Since uL is continuous and strictly increasing in µ1 , i) uL (s, µ1 (s|σ(L))) is continuous and
strictly increasing in σ(L); and ii) uL (s, µ1 (s|σ(L))) is continuous and strictly decreasing in σ(L).
So there is at most one value of σ(L) that equates them. To see a solution exists we evaluate the
extreme values of σ(L).

           uL (s, µ1 (s|σ(L) = 0)) = uL (s, 1) > uL (s, µ1 ) ∀ µ1 , including µ1 (s|σ(L) = 0)

         uL (s, µ1 (s|σ(L) = 1)) = uL (s, 1) > uL (s, µL ) > uL (s, µ0 ) ≥ uL (s, µ1 (s|σ(L) = 1))

where for the σ(L) = 1 case, the first inequality is by definition of µL , the second is by Assumption
A.1, and the third is by direct calculation that µ1 (s|σ(L) = 1) ≤ µ0 . Hence, a solution exists by
the intermediate value theorem.

Proof of Proposition 1.             Fix any nontrival equilibrium. By Lemma 2, µ1 (s), µ1 (s) satisfy
uL (s, µ1 (s)) = uL (s, µ1 (s)). In addition, Bayesian consistency of equilibrium beliefs and the law of

                                                   A.1
iterated expectation require that E[µ1 (s)] = µ0 . Hence,

                             min{µ1 (s), µ1 (s)} ≤ µ0 ≤ max{µ1 (s), µ1 (s)}.

Suppose now that µ1 (s) ≤ µ1 (s). Then, µ1 (s) ≤ µ0 < µ∗ < µL , by Assumption A.1. But, by
definition of µL , satisfying uL (s, µ1 (s)) = uL (s, µ1 (s)) then requires µ1 (s) < µ1 (s), which is a
contradiction. Hence, µ1 (s) > µ1 (s).

Proof of Proposition 2. From Lemmas 1 and 2, in any nontrivial equilibrium σ(L) ∈ (0, 1)
and σ(H, N ) = 1. We first establish that if ∆F is sufficiently small, then σ(H, S) = 1 as well. The
(H, S)-type’s expected payoff from selecting s is uH (s, µ1 (s)) + F (s), and her payoff from selecting
s is uH (s, µ1 (s)) + F (s). From the proof Lemma 1, in any nontrival equilibrium, uH (s, µ1 (s)) <
uH (s, µ1 (s)). Therefore, if ∆F ≡ F (s) − F (s) is sufficiently small, the (H, S)-type must strictly
prefer s in any nontrival equilibrium, and equilibrium characterization is reduced to pinning down
the mixing behavior of the low types, σ(L).
    Given that all H-quality senders select s and L senders mix between s and s, receiver beliefs
must satisfy µ1 (s) = 0. Since low types are mixing, they must be indifferent, meaning µ1 (s) = µ∗
is required. Receiver beliefs must also be consistent with strategies:
                                                      µ0
                                   µ1 (s) =                      = µ∗ .                                (1)
                                              µ0 + (1 − µ0 )σ(L)
                                    ∗
Solving (1) yields σ(L) = µµ∗0 (1−µ  )
                               (1−µ0 ) , establishing that the unique nontrival sender-strategy profile
consistent with equilibrium is given by Candidate 1.

Proof of Proposition 3. From Lemmas 1 and 2, in any nontrivial equilibrium σ(L) ∈ (0, 1)
and σ(H, N ) = 1. We first establish that if ∆F is sufficiently large, then σ(H, S) = 0. The (H, S)-
type’s expected payoff from selecting s is uH (s, µ1 (s)) + F (s), and her payoff from selecting s is
uH (s, µ1 (s)) + F (s). The difference uH (s, µ1 (s)) − uH (s, µ1 (s)) is bounded above by the finite value
uH (s, 1) − uH (s, 0) = (2p − 1) + (s − s). Therefore, if ∆F ≡ F (s) − F (s) is sufficiently large, the
(H, S)-type must strictly prefer s in any nontrival equilibrium, and equilibrium characterization
is reduced to pinning down the mixing behavior of the low types, σ(L). By Lemma 3, given
σ(H, N ) = 1 and σ(H, S) = 0, there is indeed a unique σ(L) that solves the low-type indifference
condition, establishing Candidate 2 as the unique nontrival equilibrium.

Proof of Proposition 4. To find all nontrival equilibria, proceed as follows. From Lemmas 1
and 2, in any nontrivial equilibrium σ(H, N ) = 1 and σ(L) ∈ (0, 1). Letting µC  1 be the consistent
belief in Candidate C, it follows that in any nontrivial equilibrium, µ1 (s) ∈ [µ11 (s), µ21 (s)]. Recall
that µ11 (s) = 0, and to simplify notation let µ̄ ≡ µ21 (s) (which is unique by Lemma 3). Fix now
any value µ1 (s) = y ∈ [0, µ̄], and let z(y) be the unique belief such that uL (s, y) = uL (s, z(y)),
as required for L-type indifference. By the established properties of uL (see BCD17), Proposition
1, and y ≤ µ̄, we have z(y) ∈ (y, µL ). Finally, define D(y) ≡ uH (s, z(y)) − uH (s, y), which is
continuous on [0, µ̄].



                                                    A.2
    Putting it together, there are three (not necessarily mutually exclusive) equilibrium cases:
i) Candidate 1 is an equilibrium if and only if D(0) ≥ ∆F ; ii) Candidate 2 is an equilibrium if and
only if D(µ̄) ≤ ∆F ; and iii) there is an equilibrium with σ(H, S) ∈ (0, 1) if and only if there exists
y ∈ (0, µ̄) such that D(y) = ∆F . To see when each case can arise, for each s ∈ [s, s], define `(s|y)
to be the unique belief value satisfying uL (s, `(s|y)) = uL (s, y), which is strictly increasing in both
s and y. Noting that z(y) = `(s|y), D(y) can then be expressed as
                                               Z     s
                                                         d
                                      D(y) =                uH (s, `(s|y))ds.                           (2)
                                                 s       ds

Expanding the integrand gives

                      d                   ∂uH (s, `(s|y)) ∂uH (s, `(s|y)) ∂`(s|y)
                         uH (s, `(s|y)) =                +                        .                     (3)
                      ds                       ∂s            ∂`(s|y)        ∂s

Finally, because uL (s, `(s|y)) is constant in s by construction,

                                          ∂`(s|y)  − ∂uL (s,`(s|y))
                                                          ∂s
                                                  = ∂u (s,`(s|y))   .                                   (4)
                                            ∂s        L
                                                                ∂`(s|y)

Combining (3), (4), and the functional forms of uH and uL , we obtain a closed-form (though
cumbersome) expression for the integrand of (2). Tedious algebra establishes that this expression
is strictly decreasing in the belief level, `, for all values in [0, µL ]. Hence, the integrand of (2)
strictly decreases pointwise as y increases, meaning D is strictly decreasing in y.
    We conclude that ∆F1 = D(µ̄) < D(0) = ∆F2 . The equilibrium characterization statements in
Propositions 2-4 (as well as in footnote 15) follow immediately.31
    It is left to establish the claim that Candidate 2 maximizes the payoffs of all types among
nontrival equilibria. For the L-type, by Lemma 2, in any nontrivial equilibrium her payoff is
uL (s, µ1 (s)). In Candidate 2, σ(H, S) = 0 and µ1 (s) is therefore maximized among nontrivial
equilibria. Since uL is increasing in µ1 , the claim is established for the L-type. For the (H, N )-
type, by Lemma 1, in any nontrivial equilibrium her payoff is uH (s, µ1 (s)). In Candidate 2, µ1 (s)
is maximized among nontrivial equilibria, and the L-type is indifferent between s and s in all
nontrivial equilibria. Since uL is increasing in µ1 , µ1 (s) is likewise maximized among nontrivial
equilibria. Since uH is increasing in µ1 , the claim is established for the (H, N )-type. Finally, for
the (H, S)-type, in any nontrivial equilibrium with σ(H, S) < 1, her payoff is uH (s, µ1 (s)) + F (s).
Hence, just as for the L-type, Candidate 2 maximizes her payoffs among such equilibria. Therefore,
the last step is to verify that the (H, S)-type prefers Candidate 2 to Candidate 1 whenever both
are equilibria. This is indeed the case because

                  uH (s, µ21 (s)) + F (s) ≥ uH (s, µ21 (s)) + F (s) > uH (s, µ11 (s)) + F (s),

where the first inequality holds because Candidate 2 is an equilibrium, and the second inequality
is from µ21 (s) > µ11 (s) and uH increasing in µ1 .
  31
     Therefore, the current proof also establishes Propositions 2 and 3. Their proofs above are retained for
their directness and simplicity.


                                                          A.3
Proof of Proposition 5.             Let fL (s|ûL ) be the indifference curve, as a function from s to
µ1 , for the low type’s excepted payoff level ûL (i.e., uL (s, fL (s|ûL )) = ûL ). Throughout, we use
superscripts 1 and 2 to refer to objects from Candidate 1 and Candidate 2, respectively. Recall
that µ11 (s) = 0 < µ21 (s) < µL . Since, σ 1 (L), σ 2 (L) ∈ (0, 1) (see Lemma 2), we have that:

                 û1L = uL (s, µ11 (s)) = uL (s, µ11 (s)) < uL (s, µ21 (s)) = uL (s, µ21 (s)) = û2L .

To prove the proposition, we need to show that

                                        µ11 (s) − µ11 (s) > µ21 (s) − µ21 (s)
                                fL (s|û1L ) − fL (s|û1L ) > fL (s|û2L ) − fL (s|û2L )
                                fL (s|û2L ) − fL (s|û1L ) > fL (s|û2L ) − fL (s|û1L ),

which is simply that the two indifference curves are closer together at s than they are at s. Using
the fact that uL (s, fL (s|ûL )) = ûL , it is a matter of direct calculation to observe i) that fL (·|ûL ) is
continuous, increasing, and concave for all ûL < uL (s, µL )—which, recall, does not depend on s by
definition of µL —and ii) that
                                          ∂fL
                                                    is increasing in s.
                                           ∂s s,µ1

Hence, for a given value of s, letting s̃ > s be the solution to uL (s̃, fL (s|û2L )) = û1L , we have that

                                    0 < fL0 (s|û2L ) < fL0 (s̃|û1L ) < fL0 (s|û1L ),

meaning the respective indifference curves are getting closer as s increases.

Proof of Proposition 6. The proposition has two claims.
1. Verification of Candidate 2 as an Equilibrium: Fix the profile of play and corresponding beliefs
in accordance with Candidate 2 and let ∆Q(q) be the endogenous value of Q(s|q) − Q(s|q). Clearly,
∆Q(q) is continuous in q, with ∆Q(0) = ∆Q(1) = 0. Next, define q ∗ = π0 (H, S)+π0 (L) (1 − σ(L)),
which is the total mass of senders selecting s in Candidate 2. Since (in Candidate 2) financiers
prioritize their investigations on senders who select s, as q increases between 0 and q ∗ , Q(s|q)
continuously increases from Q(s|0) = 0 to Q(s|q ∗ ) = 1, while Q(s|q) remains constant at 0. Next,
as q increases between q ∗ and 1, Q(s|q) remains constant at 1, while Q(s|q) continuously increases
from Q(s|q ∗ ) = 0 to Q(s|1) = 1. Hence, ∆Q is single-peaked about q ∗ .
    Given the results of Section 2.1, for Candidate 2 to be an equilibrium it is sufficient to show

                       uH (s, µ21 (s)) + Q(s)b ≤ uH (s, µ21 (s)) + Q(s)b
                       uH (s, µ21 (s)) − uH (s, µ21 (s)) ≤ Q(s)b − Q(s)b = ∆Q(q) × b.                       (5)

Recall that i) uH (s, µ21 (s)) > uH (s, µ21 (s)) and ii) ∆Q is continuous, single-peaked about q ∗ , and
equals 0 for q = 0, 1. Therefore, (5) can only hold on an interval [q, q], and such an interval exists
if and only if b is sufficiently large, establishing the proposition’s first claim.



                                                          A.4
2. Payoffs: For now, fix q = π0 (H, S). If b and p are both sufficiently large, then the only possible
nontrival equilibria are Candidates 1 and 2. To see this, consider any nontrival equilibrium. By
Lemma 1, σ(H, N ) = 1. If σ(H, S) = 1 as well, then the equilibrium is Candidate 1. Now fix
any σ(H, S) ∈ [0, 1). By Lemmas 2 and 3, there is a unique value of σ(L) ∈ (0, 1) consistent
with equilibrium. Hence, it is sufficient to establish that the (H, S)-type cannot be strictly mixing:
σ(H, S) 6∈ (0, 1). Suppose that σ(H, S) ∈ (0, 1). Then, if p is sufficiently large,

                                                    π0 (H, S)(1 − σ(H, S))p
               π2 (H, S|s, g = h) =
                                       π0 (H, S)(1 − σ(H, S))p + π0 (L)(1 − σ(L))(1 − p)


                                       π0 (H, S)(1 − σ(H, S))
                                   ≈                          =1
                                       π0 (H, S)(1 − σ(H, S))

and
                                                       π0 (H, S)σ(H, S)p
              π2 (H, S|s, g = h) =
                                       π0 (H, S)σ(H, S)p + π0 (H, N )p + π0 (L)σ(L)(1 − p)


                                             π0 (H, S)σ(H, S)
                                  ≈                                  1
                                       π0 (H, S)σ(H, S) + π0 (H, N )

Hence, financiers prioritize (s, h) senders, and every high-quality sender is virtually certain to
produce g = h. Hence, as p → 1, the total mass of (s, h) tends to π0 (H, S)(1 − σ(H, S)) < q, so
Q(s) → 1 as well. However, the total mass of senders with g = h tends to π0 (H, S) + π0 (H, N ) > q,
so Q(s) 6→ 1. Then by the same argument at end of the “verification” proof above, with b sufficiently
large the (H, S)-type strictly prefers s, contradicting the premise that she is mixing.
    Thus, for the q = π0 (H, S) case, it is now sufficient to establish that all types achieve a higher
expected payoff in Candidate 2 than in Candidate 1. For the L and (H, N )-types, the arguments
are the same as provided in the proof of Proposition 4. For the (H, S)-type, the difference between
her payoff in Candidate 2 and Candidate 1 is

               uH (s, µ21 (s)) + Q2 (s)b − uH (s, µ11 (s)) + Q1 (s)b
                                                                     

                  = Q2 (s) − Q1 (s) b − uH (s, µ11 (s)) − uH (s, µ21 (s))
                                                                             
                                     
                                   q
                                         b − uH (s, µ11 (s)) − uH (s, µ21 (s))
                                                                              
                         → 1−                                                     [as p → 1].
                                  µ0

Since q = π0 (H, S) < π0 (H, S) + π0 (H, N ) = µ0 and uH (s, µ11 (s)) − uH (s, µ21 (s)) is bounded above
by the finite value uH (s, 1) − uH (s, 0) = (2p − 1) + (s − s), the (H, S)-type achieves a higher payoff
in Candidate 2 if b is sufficiently large. Finally, see that equilibrium payoffs are continuous in q,
establishing that the result holds on an interval [q, q].
