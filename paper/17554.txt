                                              ABSTRACT

Developing countries spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year on schools, educational materials
and teachers, but relatively little is known about how effective these expenditures are at increasing
students’ years of completed schooling and, more importantly, the skills that they learn while in school.
This paper examines studies published between 1990 and 2010, in both the education literature and
the economics literature, to investigate which specific school and teacher characteristics, if any, appear
to have strong positive impacts on learning and time in school. Starting with over 9,000 studies, 79
are selected as being of sufficient quality. Then an even higher bar is set in terms of econometric methods
used, leaving 43 “high quality” studies. Finally, results are also shown separately for 13 randomized
trials. The estimated impacts on time in school and learning of most school and teacher characteristics
are statistically insignificant, especially when the evidence is limited to the “high quality” studies.
The few variables that do have significant effects – e.g. availability of desks, teacher knowledge of
the subjects they teach, and teacher absence – are not particularly surprising and thus provide little
guidance for future policies and programs.

I. Introduction and Motivation

         Economists and other researchers have accumulated a large amount of evidence that

education increases workers’ productivity and thus increases their incomes.1 There are also

many non-monetary benefits of education, such as improved health status and lowered crime

Lochner (2011)). Finally, at the country level there is also a large amount of evidence that

education increases the rate of economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann (2008)). These

analyses all highlight the value of improving a country’s human capital and provide the

motivation for developing countries to invest in the skills of their populations. They do not,

however, indicate which types of specific investments should be pursued.

         Policymakers in developing countries have quite generally accepted the message of these

benefits from improved human capital and have greatly increased their funding of education. As

seen in Table 1, since 1980 real government expenditures on education doubled in Latin America

and Sub-Saharan Africa, almost tripled in the Middle East, and increased by more than five-fold

in East Asia and by almost eight-fold in South Asia. International development agencies have

also called for greater resources to be devoted to education, and have increased their levels of

assistance for education projects in recent years, as shown in Table 2.

         The most consistent focus of investment has been on increasing primary and secondary

school enrollment rates, with the ultimate goal of higher levels of educational attainment. The

increases in enrollment over the past three decades, particularly at the primary level, have been

quite dramatic. From 1980 to 2008 primary and secondary enrollment rates have increased in all


1
  The majority of this work, following the seminal studies of Jacob Mincer (1970, (1974), has focused on how
school attainment relates to individual earnings, and there are now estimates of the return to schooling for a majority
of countries in the world (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004)). More recent work has added measures of
achievement to this (e.g., Mulligan (1999), Murnane, Willett, Duhaldeborde, and Tyler (2000), and Lazear (2003)),
although little of this relates to developing countries (see, however, Hanushek and Zhang (2009)).
                                                          1
regions of the developing world (Table 3), so that by 2008 gross primary enrollment rates were

at or above 100 percent in all regions, and gross secondary enrollment rates were above 50

percent in all regions except Sub-Saharan Africa.2 Similarly, Table 4 shows that primary school

completion rates increased in all regions from 1991 to 2008, and were close to 100 percent in all

regions except for South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

        Much of the increased funding for education, particularly in the earlier periods, took the

form of building and staffing schools in areas where no school previously existed, reflecting the

simple fact that it is hard to go to school if no school exists. Moreover, there is ample evidence

that enrollment increases when the distance to the nearest school decreases. When increased

spending on existing schools makes them more attractive, either by reducing school fees and

other direct costs of schooling or by improving the quality of the educational opportunities they

provide, enrollment would be expected to increase further.3

        More recently, however, attention has begun to swing toward the quality of schools and

the achievement of students – and here the evidence on outcomes is decidedly more mixed.

Over the past decade, it has become possible to follow changes in student performance on tests

offered by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). While student learning

appears to be increasing in several countries, this tendency is not universal. More specifically,

Table 5 presents evidence on learning among 15 year old students in 12 countries (of which 7 are

in Latin America). Examining trends from 2000 to 2009, five countries show clear upward

trends (Chile, Colombia, Peru, Tunisia and Turkey), while the rest show either mixed or even

decreasing trends. At the aggregate level, it may simply be that expanded enrollment brings in

  Gross enrollment rates compare numbers of school children to the size of a specific age cohort so that grade
repetition, late enrollment, and the like can lead to gross enrollment rates over 100 percent.
3
  Hanushek, Lavy, and Hitomi (2008) find that school dropout decisions are very responsive to the quality of the
school (in terms of value-added to achievement).
                                                         2
progressively less able and less qualified students, who then pull down the average score. Yet

some countries with mixed or declining trends did not show large increases in school enrollment,

and were increasing real expenditures per student on education. For example, in Argentina the

gross secondary school enrollment rate has been about 85 percent from 1998 to 2007, and

spending per pupil was somewhat higher in 2004-06 than in 1998-2000; yet test scores in 2007

were lower than in 2000. Similarly, Brazil’s progress has been uneven at best, yet it experienced

only a moderate increase in secondary school enrollment (7-13 percentage points) from 2000 to

2007, and real spending on education steadily increased over time.4

        The concern about quality becomes more significant in analyses of the impact on student

learning (achievement) of demand side programs that stimulate increased enrollment. A recent

survey of high quality analyses of currently popular demand side programs – fee reductions,

conditional cash transfers, and school nutrition programs – the higher enrollment induced by

these programs was not accompanied by increased achievement (Hanushek (2008)).5 It is natural

to think that bringing students into school must certainly increase their learning and achievement,

but this impact may be limited to new students who were not previously in school with no effect

(or even a negative effect) on current students.

        This discussion is related to a substantial body of literature, particularly for developed

countries, that suggests that money alone is not the answer to increase student learning.

Specifically, for developed countries there is substantial research indicating that overall

expenditures, and common school initiatives funded by those expenditures such as lower class

4
  See the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. Note that Brazil’s gross (net) secondary school enrollment
rate increased from 99 (66) in 1999 to 106 (79) in 2005, Educational expenditures (in terms of real U.S. $ per
secondary student) increased from, on average, about 1340 (350) from 1998 to 2000 to about 1510 (500) from 2004
to 2006 in Argentina (Brazil).
5
  The only demand side program that increased achievement was a Kenyan scholarship program that directly related
incentives to achievement (Kremer, Miguel, and Thornton (2009)).
                                                       3
sizes or more educated teachers, are not closely related to student outcomes.6 Similar findings,

although not as strong, come from the research on schools in developing countries (Fuller and

Clarke (1994), Harbison and Hanushek (1992), Hanushek (1995)).

         In response to findings that increased educational spending has had little effect on student

performance, many policymakers and researchers in both developed and developing countries

have advocated changing the way that schools are run – such as changing the incentives faced by

teachers (and by students) and, more generally, changing the way that schools are organized.

         Yet it is still possible that spending that changes basic school and teacher characteristics,

if properly directed, could play a role in improving students’ educational outcomes in developing

countries. Thus it is useful to review the more recent literature on school spending and

resources, extending the prior reviews that covered studies through the early 1990s. Indeed,

significant numbers of new studies have appeared since 1990.

         More importantly, many of the newer studies employ much stronger research designs

than were previously used. The appreciation of researchers for the difficulty of obtaining clear

estimates of causal impacts has grown considerably over the past two decades. The sensitivity to

these issues, along with more care about the underlying methodological approach, suggests that

the new studies may in fact yield conclusions different from those drawn on the older research.

         This paper examines both the economics literature and the education literature published

in the last two decades to assess the extent to which school and teacher characteristics have a

causal impact on student learning and enrollment. More specifically, this paper reviews the

literature that attempts to estimate the impact of school infrastructure and pedagogical materials


6
 These conclusions have been controversial, and much has been written about the interpretation of the evidence.

(such as electricity, condition of the building, desks, blackboards and textbooks), teacher

characteristics (education, training, experience, sex, subject knowledge, and ethnicity), and

school organization (pupil-teacher ratio, teaching methods, decentralized management, and

teacher contracts and working conditions) on student enrollment and learning.

       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes a simple

interpretive framework. This is followed by a description of the parameters of this review and of

how studies were selected for inclusion. Finally, we present the results of our review and draw

conclusions about priorities for future research.



II. Interpreting the Research on Basic Education Inputs

       The overarching conceptual framework employed here considers schools as “factories”

that produce “learning” using various school and teacher characteristics as “inputs”. This is the

production function approach introduced early in microeconomics courses. However, the actual

application and interpretation in education differs from the simple textbook treatment.

       The reasoning underlying this conceptual framework is that the process by which

cognitive skills are learned is determined by many different factors, and production functions are

expressions, in simple terms, of this process. The relationship can be very flexible, allowing for

almost any learning process. In this sense, an education production function always exists,

although its existence does not guarantee that one can estimate it.

       In the ideal case, if one can estimate this relationship, one can use information on the

costs of school characteristics, classroom materials, and even teacher characteristics to select the

combination of these that is most effective in increasing enrollment and/or student performance



                                                    5
(e.g. increase in test scores per dollar spent) given a limited budget. In theory, this could also

apply to pedagogical practices, which have implementation costs.

        A. Relationships of Interest. It is useful to step back to consider what relationships are

of interest and how those relationships interact with households’ behavior. The theory of the

firm, where analyses of production functions are generally introduced, takes the perspective of a

decision maker who optimally chooses the combination of inputs for his or her firm. But this

perspective ignores a key reality of education: students and parents -- both important inputs into

achievement – also make their own decisions in response to the school decision maker’s choices.

        To begin, assume that the parents of the child maximize, subject to constraints, a (life-

cycle) utility function. The main arguments in the utility function are consumption of goods and

services (including leisure) at different points in time, and each child’s years of schooling and

learning. The constraints faced are the production function for learning, the impacts of years of

schooling and of skills obtained on the future labor incomes of children, a life-cycle budget

constraint, and perhaps some credit constraints or an agricultural production function (for which

child labor is one possible input). Following Glewwe and Kremer (2006), the production function

for learning (a structural relationship) can be depicted as:



                                   A = a(S, Q, C, H, I)            (1)



where A is skills learned (achievement), S is years of schooling, Q is a vector of school and teacher

characteristics (inputs that raise school quality), C is a vector of child characteristics (including

“innate ability”), H is a vector of household characteristics, and I is a vector of school inputs under

the control of parents, such as children’s daily attendance and purchases of textbooks and other

                                                    6
school supplies. Although children acquire many different skills in school, little is lost by treating

A as a single variable.

        Assume that all elements in the vectors C and H (which include parental tastes for

schooling, parental education, and children’s “ability”) are exogenous. Some child characteristics

that affect education outcomes (such as child health) may be endogenous; they can be treated as

elements of I, all of which are endogenous.

        In the simplest scenario, only one school is available and parents can do nothing to change

that school’s characteristics. Thus all variables in Q are exogenous to the household. Parents

choose S and I (subject to the above-mentioned constraints) to maximize household utility, which

implies that years of schooling S and schooling inputs I can be expressed as general functions of

the four vectors of exogenous variables:



                                  S = f(Q, C, H, P)               (2)

                                  I = g(Q, C, H, P)               (3)



where prices related to schooling (such as tuition, other fees, and prices of textbooks and

uniforms), which are also exogenous, are denoted by the vector P.

        Inserting (2) and (3) into (1) gives the reduced form equation for (A):



                                  A = h(Q, C, H, P)               (4)



This reduced form equation is a causal relationship, but it is not a textbook production function

because it reflects household preferences and includes prices among its arguments.

                                                   7
           The more realistic assumption that households can choose from more than one school

implies that Q and P are endogenous even if they are fixed for any given school. In this scenario,

households maximize utility with respect to each schooling choice, and then choose the school

that leads to the highest utility. Conditional on choosing that school, they choose S and I, as in

the case where there is only one school from which to choose.

           Policymakers are primarily concerned with the impact of school and teacher characteristics

(Q) and prices related to schooling (P) on years of schooling (S) and eventual academic

achievement (A). For example, reducing class size can be seen as a change in one element of Q,

and changing tuition fees can be seen as altering one component of P. Equations (2) and (4)

show how changes in the P variables would affect S and A. In addition, equation (2) also shows

how changes in school and teacher quality (Q) affect students’ years of schooling (S).

           Turning to the impact of school quality variables (Q) on student learning, there are two

distinct relationships. To see this, consider a change in one element of Q, call it Qi. Equation (1)

shows how changes in Qi affect A when all other explanatory variable are held constant, and thus

provides the partial derivative of A with respect to Qi. In contrast, equation (4) provides the

total derivative of A with respect to Qi because it allows for changes in S and I in response to the

change in Qi.7 Parents may respond to higher school quality by increasing their provision of

educational inputs such as textbooks. Alternatively, if they consider higher school quality a

substitute for those inputs, they may decrease those inputs.

           The fact that parental actions may reduce or reinforce school decisions may help to

explain a portion of the prior inconsistencies in estimating the impact of school resources.

Indeed, different studies could obtain different estimates of the impacts of the Q variables on

7
    For an early development of this idea, see Kim (2001).
                                                             8
student learning because some studies estimate the production function, that is equation (1),

while others estimate the reduced form relationship in equation (4), and it is quite possible that

impacts of the Q variables will be different in these two equations.

          When examining the impact of school quality (Q) on academic skills (A), are the impacts

in equation (1) or equation (4) most useful for policy purposes? Equation (4) is useful because it

shows what will actually happen to A after a change in one or more element in Q. In contrast,

equation (1) will not show this because it does not account for changes in S and I in response to

changes in Q and P. Yet the impact in equation (1) is also of interest because it may better

capture overall welfare effects. Intuitively, if parents respond to an increase in Qi by, for

example, reducing purchases of inputs I, they will be able to raise household welfare by

purchasing more of some other good or service that raises utility. The impact of Q on A in

equation (4) (i.e. the total derivative) reflects the drop in A due to the reduction in I, but it does

not account for the increase in household welfare from the increased purchase of other goods or

services. In contrast, the structural impact measured in equation (1) ignores both effects. Since

these two effects have opposing impacts on household welfare, they tend to cancel each other

out, so the overall welfare effect is reasonably approximated by the change in A measured in

equation (1). This is explained more formally in Glewwe, Kremer, Moulin, and Zitzewitz

(2004).

          B. Estimation Problems and Potential Solutions. Many published studies in both the

economics literature and the education literature attempt to estimate the impact of school and

teacher characteristics on enrollment and learning, but these attempts face a number of serious

estimation challenges.



                                                   9
         Consider estimation of a simple linear specification of the production function in

equation (1):



                    A = β0 + β1S + βQ1Q1 + βQ2Q2 + … + βC1C1 + βC2C2 + …                     (1′)

                               + βH1H1 + βH2H2 + … + βI1I1 + βI2I2 + … + uA



where each variable in Q, C, H and I is shown explicitly.8 An “error term”, uA, is added, for

several reasons. First, data never exist for all variables in Q, C, H, and I, so uA accounts for all

unobserved variables. Second, uA indicates that (1′) is only a linear approximation of (1). Third,

observed test scores (A) may measure actual skills with error, so uA includes measurement errors

in the “true” A. Finally, the explanatory variables in (1′) may also have measurement errors,

which are also included in uA.

         The causal impacts of the observed variables in (1′) on learning, the β coefficients, can be

consistently estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) only if uA is uncorrelated with ALL the

observed “explanatory” variables. Unfortunately, under a range of circumstances, uA is likely to

be correlated with those variables.

         The potential pitfalls of statistical analysis aimed at uncovering the causal impact of

various factors on achievement are now fairly well understood. They are the subject of graduate

courses in evaluation methods as well as critiques of existing research. For detailed discussions,

see Glewwe (2002) and Glewwe and Kremer (2006); the rest of this section summarizes both the

problems and the potential solutions.

8
  A common first assumption made in much of the existing literature is that equation (1) can be approximated by a
linear function; this assumption is not particularly restrictive. The estimation generally relies on the model being
linear in the parameters, and a variety of specifications that are nonlinear in the variables can be accommodated by
this specification, say by adding adding squared or interaction terms to the variables in (1).
                                                         10
         The most common generic concerns are omitted variable bias, sample selection,

endogenous program placement, and measurement errors. Turning to the first concern, if major

inputs to achievement are omitted from the estimation of equation (1), they will end up in uA. If

these omitted factors are correlated with the included variables, bias is introduced, with the bias

being proportional to the importance of the omitted factors (their coefficient in equation (1)) and

their correlation with the included factors. Similarly, school and teacher factors often affect

which children attend school and how their parents make decisions about their schooling (see,

for example, Hanushek, Lavy, and Hitomi (2008)). School quality could also be correlated with

uA if governments improve schools that have unobserved education problems (Pitt, Rosenzweig,

and Gibbons (1993)). Governments may also raise school quality in areas with good education

outcomes, if those areas have political influence (World_Bank (2001). The former causes

underestimation of school quality variables’ impacts on learning, while the latter causes

overestimation.9 Finally, measurement error – a ubiquitous problem that can be particularly severe

in developing countries – can bias estimates, often pushing estimates toward zero and making

factors look insignificant.

         Considerable effort has now gone into how to deal with these problems. Besides better

measurement to correct errors in variables, the essential thrust has been to develop estimation

methods that ensure that uA is uncorrelated with the variables of interest. Most significant in recent

decades has been the design of experiments that work to ensure this, i.e., the use of randomized

control trials (RCTs); see, for example, Kremer (2003). But other methods such as regression

discontinuity (RD) designs and panel data methods have also been pursued to achieve the same


9
  This type of problem has also been prominent in many discussions of the estimation of teacher effects in the U.S.
literature. If school principals assign teachers to classrooms based on unobserved characteristics of the teachers, the
ability to estimate the impact of teachers may be affected; see Rothstein (2010) and Rivkin (2008).
                                                          11
goal. While these are the subject of considerable current research, there are also good reviews and

discussions of them elsewhere (e.g., Imbens and Wooldridge (2009), and Blundell and Dias

(2009)). The important fact for our purposes is that these approaches have begun to appear in the

literature on achievement in developing countries. And we explicitly include this literature in our

review below.



III. Scope of Review

         We now move to the heart of this study – reviewing relevant research on the determinants

of student achievement and time in school in developing countries. This review is, however,

more limited than that statement might suggest. First, it focuses on studies from 1990 to 2010

and does not return to prior studies that have been reviewed elsewhere. Second, it focuses only

on primary and secondary education, and thus it does not include pre-primary, vocational or

post-secondary education (see Attanasio and Meghir, 2011, for a review of the evidence on pre-

primary education). Third, the primary outcome of interest is student learning (usually measured

in terms of test scores), although we also consider school enrollment (including related

phenomena such as daily attendance and years of schooling attained).10 Finally, this paper will

not examine school policies related to incentives for students and parents (since this is covered

by Behrman, Parker, and Todd (2011)), school organization and management (covered by

   Of the 79 papers eventually examined (see below for details), only one examined grade repetition, which is an
indirect measure of student learning. Yet repetition can also depend on school policies and other factors (such as
crowding in particular grades) and so it is a noisy measure of student learning. Because of this problem, and the
lack of studies that examined repetition, we exclude studies of repetition in our analysis of the determinants of
student learning. (The sole paper that examined repetition also has regressions with test scores as the dependent
variable, so it remains one of the 79 studies.)

Bleakley (2011)).

        The rest of this section explains how the vast literatures in economics and education were

searched. The objective of the review process was to identify as many relevant, high-quality

papers as possible. The strategy was to search a wide variety of sources, and then systematically

eliminate individual papers that do not meet a series of criteria for relevance and quality. The

first step was to conduct the search for journal articles published between 1990 and 2010 using

two search engines that cover the economics and education literatures, respectively: EconLit and

the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). The search was conducted during October

and November of 2010; for this reason, papers that were not yet available at that time are not

included in this review. The authors searched for papers that listed both “education” as a key

word, and any one of a list of 72 educational inputs as keyword (see Appendix I for this list).

Because of the overwhelming number of papers found in ERIC using these search terms (over

half a million), the search was limited to papers that also included the name of at least one

developing country or the term “developing country” or “developing countries” in the abstract.

Developing countries are defined as in the International Monetary Fund’s list of emerging and

developing countries, as published in its World Economic Outlook Report, published in April

2010.

        This search yielded a total of about 9,000 articles. Two of the authors reviewed each of

the 9,000 articles individually, selecting those that looked potentially relevant based on the

information found in the abstract (and, in some cases, looking at the introduction or conclusion

of the paper). Based on reviews of the abstracts only, papers that did not focus on developing

countries, or that did not estimate the impact of a school-level (or teacher level) variable on

                                                 13
students’ educational outcomes, were eliminated. Papers selected by either of these two authors

were included in the next phase of the review; this winnowing process reduced the total number

of papers to 307.11

        In addition to published papers, the authors also searched several prominent series of

working papers in economics: National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working papers;

World Bank Policy Research working papers; the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA); the

Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR); and the CESIfo Research Network. Papers

listed as education papers on the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab’s website were also

searched. Working papers published before 2005 were not included, as it was assumed that high

quality working papers written before 2005 should have been published by 2010. When the

same paper appears both as a working paper and as a journal article, only the journal article was

included. Using this process, 29 working papers were added to the 307 published articles. All

four authors reviewed the abstracts of this large group of papers and narrowed the sample to 253

by eliminating duplicate papers and papers that did not focus on one or more of the following

factors that affect students’ educational outcomes: school infrastructure and pedagogical

materials; teacher (and principal) characteristics; and school organization.

        In the second phase, the authors read each of the 253 papers (in contrast to first phase,

when only abstracts were read) to obtain further information about each study. During this

phase, additional papers were eliminated for lack of relevance. These fell into three categories:

1. The paper’s focus was not on a developing country (this was not clear in the abstracts of some

papers); 2. The paper focused on an education policy unrelated to school infrastructure and


11
  In the economics literature, most papers that included education as a keyword were studies of the impacts of
education on some other social phenomenon, as opposed to studies that investigated the impacts of other factors on
education outcomes.
                                                        14
pedagogical materials, teacher (and principal) characteristics, and school organization; and 3.

The paper did not include quantitative analysis of the impact of a school or teacher characteristic

on students’ educational outcomes. A little more than half of the 253 papers chosen in the first

stage were eliminated at this stage, which reduced the studies considered to 112.

       In a third phase, the remaining 112 papers were reviewed for their quality, considering

both the econometric methodology used and, when appropriate, covariates included in the

analysis. All articles that were based on a randomized controlled trial (RCT) were retained, as

these studies avoid, or at least minimize, many of the estimation problems discussed in Section

II. Further, estimates based on a difference in differences (DD) regression, regression

discontinuity design (RDD), or matching methods were also included. Finally, papers that used

other, simpler quantitative methods (e.g. OLS) and included at least one general family

background variable (e.g. parental schooling or household income) and school expenditure per

pupil, or one family background variable, one teacher variable, and at least one additional school

variable, were included. By excluding papers that did not meet these restrictions, the sample was

reduced to 79 papers (listed in Appendix II).

       A fourth and final phase of the review made further quality distinctions. We examined

further all papers that did not use an RCT, DD or RDD estimation method. Of these, 36 papers

that relied on ordinary least squares analysis of cross-sectional data failed to employ any more

sophisticated methodology to control for potential omitted variable or endogeneity bias (such as

instrumental variables or selection correction methods) and these were deemed to be of lower

quality. While results are presented for all 79 studies, a separate analysis is also done for the 43

papers considered to be “high quality” by this more stringent methodological criterion. The

evolution of the sample is summarized in Table 6.

                                                 15
IV. What Have We Learned from Studies of Education in Developing Countries Since 1990?

       Based on these quality distinctions, this study presents three sets of results that focus on

student learning, as measured by test scores. In subsection A, the results of all 79 studies are

summarized. In subsection B, the results of the 43 studies that passed the higher quality bar are

separately reviewed. Subsection C shows only results from 13 randomized control trials.

Finally, Subsection D examines studies that investigate the determinants of time in school

(attendance, years of schooling, etc.) outcomes.

       Obviously, there is an inevitable tradeoff between raising the standard one sets for a

study to be credible and the number of studies one has for drawing general conclusions. In

particular, when the review is limited to studies that used randomized control trials there are only

13 studies that examined school and teacher characteristics, while there are dozens of school and

teacher characteristics (including pedagogical practices) in which one may be interested. A

related issue is how many studies of a particular school or teacher characteristic are needed to be

included in the summary tables. We have set a low limit of requiring only two studies, which

some readers may argue is too low; yet it is easy for any reader to exclude some of the rows in

the summary tables that are deemed to have too few studies. The exception to this rule is the

subsection that focuses on randomized trials; all studies are included, even when there is only

one study that examined a particular school or teacher characteristic.

       Our review of the literature falls into the general category of “meta-analysis,” or the

systematic combining of results from multiple studies. These techniques have been employed

for over a century, with the most intense work found in reviews of medical research. More

recently, however, various forms of meta-analysis have been applied to education research (see,

                                                 16
for example, Hedges and Olkin (1985) for an early application to the education literature). Meta-

analysis can be used for many different purposes, including generalizing to wider populations,

understanding the heterogeneity of effects, and improved statistical power. Here we do not

undertake any formal statistical analyses of the study results because we are interested in the

simplest issue: do studies find consistent impacts of school resources and pedagogical factors on

student achievement?

       The general literature on meta-analysis does, however, raise one potentially serious issue

related to our review, that of “publication bias.” In particular, if authors tend to submit studies

with positive (or negative) findings more frequently than those with null findings, or if editors

and journals are more likely to publish articles with significant results, our review of the

published work may overstate the statistical significance of any particular factor.

       This problem may be less important in our review than in other areas for meta-analysis,

but in the end we are unable to assess its importance. The reason for potentially less impact here

is that many of the statistical studies reviewed here attempt to estimate the impacts of multiple

factors – such as pupil-teacher ratios along with the impact of textbooks and of teacher

experience. Thus, a given publication can easily contain a mixture of significant and

insignificant factors, whereas a medical publication that addresses a single effect (e.g., the

treatment outcome related to a specific drug) will be more focused on the significance or

insignificance of this single parameter. Nonetheless, we do not present any quantitative analysis

of how publication bias may affect our review.

       A. Summary Results from All 79 Studies. This section casts the widest possible net,

examining the impacts of over 30 school and teacher characteristics on student test scores. It is

convenient to divide these school and teacher characteristics into three broad types: 1. School

                                                 17
infrastructure and pedagogical supplies; 2. Teacher (and principal) characteristics; and 3. School

organization. In some cases, one could debate whether a particular characteristic belongs in one

category or another (e.g. contract teachers could be thought of as a teacher characteristic or a

school organization characteristic); in such cases an admittedly somewhat arbitrary assignment is

made, but of course the conclusions drawn regarding any particular school or teacher

characteristic do not depend on which of these three categories it has been assigned.

       Table 7 summarizes the findings of the 79 studies in terms of the impact of the first broad

type of variables on students’ test scores. Within this broad type, the variables are ordered by the

number of estimates available from these 79 studies, starting with those with the largest number

of estimates. Note that many studies present multiple estimates of the impact of the same

variable, because of multiple estimation methods or multiple subsamples. In general, different

estimation methods or estimations based on different subgroups (for example boys and girls, or

different grades) were counted as separate estimates, but adding or removing a few variables for

the same estimation method (or a similarly minor change) was not counted as a separate

estimate. In cases in which an author presents results from multiple estimations, but argues that

one is a more reliable set of estimates than the others, only the author’s preferred estimate is

included. This is likely to result in an overrepresentation of results from studies that present

multiple estimation methods and do not indicate which method is the preferred one. In order to

allow the reader to give equal weight to studies, that is not to give a large weight to a single

study that produced many different estimates of the impact of the same variable, the numbers in

parentheses show how many separate publications found a particular impact. Finally, note that

for any given estimate, there are five possible classifications: significantly negative,

insignificantly negative, zero (or insignificant but sign not reported), insignificantly positive and

                                                 18
significantly positive. A 10 percent significance level cut-off was used; while this relatively

generous definition of statistical significance will classify more findings as significant, it is

possible that some results that would have fit this criterion are omitted from the analysis since

some authors may not have presented results that are significant only at the 10 percent level.

         1. School Infrastructure and Pedagogical Materials. Turning to the results, Table 7

summarizes the findings for eight different school infrastructure and pedagogical material

variables. By far the most commonly estimated impact is that for textbooks and workbooks;

there are 60 estimates from 21 different studies. (The numbers in parentheses add up to 33, but

this reflects the fact that some studies found different effects using different estimation methods

or different subsamples, and thus a single study can appear in parentheses more than once; the

last column in the table gives the total number of studies.) Although these studies are not

unanimous in their estimates, most of them (36) find positive effects, and most of these (26) are

significantly positive. This is what almost anyone would expect, and the number of estimates

that are negative and significant is quite small (four estimates from three studies).12 Thus this

evidence strongly suggests that textbooks and similar materials (workbooks, exercise books)

increase student learning.

         The next most commonly estimated impacts are those of basic furniture (desks, tables and

chairs) and of computers and electronic games. The evidence in Table 7 suggests that adequate

amounts of desks, tables and chairs raise student test scores, as common sense would suggest.



12
   A significantly negative effect is not necessarily an error; it could be that some textbooks or workbooks were not
well written, or not well matched to the students, and that this caused problems. More generally, one should expect
some heterogeneity in the impacts. Given our 10% significance level standard, if a certain school variable had zero
impact in all schools one should find that 90% of estimates are not significantly different from zero, while 5% are
significantly negative and 5% are significantly positive. As will be seen, there are some cases where more than 5%
are significantly positive and more than 5% are significantly negative; such a result suggests heterogeneity in the
impacts due to differences across countries and across schools within the same country.
                                                         19
More specifically, of the 28 estimates from eight studies, none is negative and 15 are positive (of

which 8 are significantly positive). The evidence is even stronger if one counts studies instead of

individual estimates (the 13 estimates of zero impact are all from a single study); all but one

study finds a positive impact, and four of the eight find significantly positive impacts. In

contrast, the results for computers and related materials are less clear; 18 of the 26 estimates are

statistically insignificant (and they are almost evenly divided between negative and insignificant

and positive and insignificant), while seven are significantly positive and one is significantly

negative. Given that computers can be relatively expensive, this suggests caution when deciding

whether scarce funds for education should be used to purchase computers and related products.

        Another commonly estimated school characteristic is electricity.13 One would expect a

positive effect, since electric lighting should help students read and see the blackboard, and it

may also help by providing power for other useful items (e.g. fans to keep the classroom cooler).

Of the fifteen estimates in Table 7, only three are negative (and none is significantly negative)

while twelve are positive (of which six are significantly positive). A similar result holds if one

counts the number of studies with these results; of the six studies only two find negative impacts

(neither of which is significant) while five find positive but insignificant impacts and two find

significantly positive impacts. Thus the evidence gives fairly strong support to the proposition

that providing electricity to schools increases student learning.




13
   While electricity could simply be an general indicator of the physical condition of the school, most of the six
studies that examined the impact of electricity included other measures of the physical condition of the school. We
tend to interpret electricity literally, although it may just be one of the most important, and most accurately
measured, dimensions of the quality of school facilities.
                                                        20
         Similarly positive effects are found for general indices of school “infrastructure” and for

blackboards (and other visual aids).14 Again, this is what one would expect. Turning to a more

costly school characteristic, school libraries also appear to have generally positive impacts on

student learning as measured by test scores; this is particularly the case when each study is given

equal weight (five of the six studies found a significantly positive effect, while only one found a

significantly negative effect). Finally, it is also the case that high quality walls, roofs and floors

appear to lead to better outcomes: five of the six estimates are positive, and two of the five are

significantly positive (the sole negative estimate is not significant).

         2. Teacher (and Principal) Characteristics. Table 8 summarizes the findings from the

79 studies for teacher and principal characteristics. The most commonly examined characteristic

is the teacher’s level of education; there are 72 separate estimates from 24 distinct studies. Of

these estimates, 46 found a positive impact on student learning, and 24 of these were

significantly positive. In contrast, only 15 estimates were negative, and only four of these were

significantly negative. Counting the number of studies (as opposed to distinct parameter

estimates) in each category gives similar results; only three studies found significantly negative

effects while eleven found significantly positive effects. Thus, as one would expect, the results

generally support the proposition that providing more educated teachers raises students’ test

scores. Similarly, teacher experience seems to have a positive effect, but the evidence is not

quite as strong. More specifically, 43 of the 63 estimates found no statistically significant

impact, although of the 20 that did almost all (17) found a significantly positive effect.15


14
   In almost all of the school infrastructure studies, the index counts whether schools have some or all of the
following: library, cafeteria, science labs, playground, and computer labs. As mentioned previously, electricity
could also be part of a general infrastructure measure.
15
   Note that both of these findings about teacher characteristics are very much at odds with the U.S. evidence. In the
U.S., where all teachers have bachelor’s degrees and the focus is on advanced degrees, there is virtually no evidence
                                                         21
         A more direct measure of teacher competence is teachers’ knowledge of the subjects that

they teach. The 79 studies include 33 estimates of the impact of teacher knowledge, as measured

by teacher test scores, on student learning. Almost all (29 out of 33) found positive effects, and

most of these positive effects (18) were statistically significant. The evidence is not quite as

strong if one examines number of studies instead of number of estimates (seven studies found

significantly positive effects while only two studies’ findings were significantly negative), but it

is still strong and thus supports the common sense notion that teachers who better understand the

subjects they teach are better at increasing their students’ learning.

         One teacher characteristic that has more ambiguous effects is whether the teacher is

female. There are 39 estimates, of which 13 are negative (and 6 of these are significant) and 24

are positive (and 12 are significant). While positive impacts are more common than negative

ones, when one counts the number of studies the results are even more ambiguous: four found

significant negative effects, while five found significantly positive effects. Overall, there is little

support for any systematic difference in teacher effectiveness by gender.16

         The next most common teacher variable in the 79 studies is in-service teacher training.

Of the 29 estimates, 17 are insignificant (10 are negative and 7 are positive) while 11 are

significantly positive and only 1 is significantly negative. Giving each study equal weight leads

to a similar conclusion. Overall, in-service teacher training appears to have a strong positive

impact on student learning.




that more education for the teachers helps. Similarly, experience past the first few years has no effect. See
Hanushek (2003).
16
   There is currently a debate about the effectiveness of single sex schools and, implicitly, that female teachers may
have a larger impact on girls than boys (see Billger (2009), Kaufman and Yin (2009), Park and Behrman (2010)).
However, in all but one of the studies examined here estimates are not given separately for male and female
students, and the sole exception found no difference.
                                                          22
        The last two teacher variables are a general index of teacher quality and whether the

teacher has a teaching degree (as opposed to a general degree).17 Of the 14 estimates of indices

of teacher quality, none is negative, eight are zero (or insignificant but of unknown sign) and six

are significantly positive. A similar result holds if one gives each study equal weight, although

there are only two studies. This suggests that indices of teacher quality have strong positive

impacts on student learning. In contrast, the two studies that considered whether a teacher had a

teaching degree yield less clear conclusions. Of the six estimates from the two studies, two are

insignificantly negative, two have point estimates close to zero, and two have significantly

positive impacts. The same distribution holds if one gives each study equal weight.

        Two principal characteristics were examined in several different studies: years of

experience and level of education, and their impacts appear to be different. In particular, years

of experience had a positive impact in five of the six estimates, and of the five positive estimates

two were statistically significant (the sole negative estimate was not significant). Giving each

study equal weight does not change this finding. In contrast, of the six estimates of the impact of

the principal’s level of education, two were significantly negative, one was significantly positive,

and the other three were not statistically significant (and the same general result holds if each

study is given equal weight). Thus principal experience appears to lead to increased student

learning, but there is no clear evidence that the same is true of principal education.

        3. School Organization. Table 9 examines the third general category of school and

teacher variables, school organization. These variables focus on how schools are organized, as

opposed to the basic characteristics of schools and teachers. By far the most common variable of

this type in the literature is class size, that is the pupil-teacher ratio; there were 101 separate
17
   The 14 estimates of teacher quality come from two studies, which define teacher quality in terms of an index of
teacher experience, level of education, and scores on math and reading tests.
                                                        23
estimates from 29 different studies.18 Intuitively, one would expect the pupil-teacher ratio to

have a negative effect on student learning, and that was the case in 59 of the 101 estimates,

although only 30 of the 59 were statistically significant. Another 39 estimates had an unexpected

positive sign, but only 15 of these were statistically significant. In terms of numbers of studies,

instead of numbers of estimates, 26 studies found a negative impact, of which 13 were

significantly negative, and 21 found a positive impact, of which 9 were significantly positive.

         Overall, these estimates suggest that increases in class size usually have negative impacts

on student learning, as one would expect, but the finding that 9 of the 29 studies found a

significantly positive effect suggests caution. These positive effects could reflect either random

chance or estimation problems; an example of the latter is that schools that are of high quality

due to unobserved characteristics will attract more students, raising the pupil teacher ratio and

thus leading to a positive correlation between that ratio and student test scores. Nonetheless, the

frequency of “unexpected” positive impacts, even in developing countries where pupil-teacher

ratios can be very large, is similar to the findings for developed countries (Hanushek (2003)).

         Clearer results are seen in the next two variables: teacher absenteeism and teacher assigns

homework. As one would expect, for teacher absenteeism 13 of the 15 estimates are negative,

and 7 of the 13 are significantly negative. None of the 15 estimates is positive, although two are

insignificant and of unknown sign (the paper did not report the signs of the insignificant results).

In contrast, but also as expected, teacher assignment of homework generally has positive impacts

on students’ test scores. Of the 16 estimates, 12 are significantly positive and only four are

negative (and none is significantly negative). The main caveat is that these findings are less


18
  In the United States, pupil-teacher ratios and class sizes can diverge noticeably because teachers have fewer class
meetings than students have courses, because teachers perform a variety of nonteaching duties, and so forth. This
divergence is likely to be less important for schools in developing countries.
                                                         24
strong when each of the five studies is given equal weight: three are significantly positive and

two are insignificantly negative.

       School provision of meals has been used in many developing countries to achieve two

distinct goals: improved child health and increased student learning. Four of the 79 studies

examined the impact of school meals on student test scores, producing 13 distinct estimates. The

evidence is inconclusive; seven estimates are negative, of which four are significantly negative,

while six estimates are positive (all of which are statistically significant). Considering the

number of studies gives a somewhat more positive impact; only one found a significantly

negative impact, while two found insignificantly negative impacts and three found significantly

positive impacts. Even so, the evidence does not provide strong support for this intervention, at

least as a means to raise student learning, and school meal programs have the disadvantage that

they can be relatively expensive.

       The next two school organization practices yield unambiguous results. The first is one

that is unavoidable in small, rural schools: multi-grade teaching, where one teacher teaches more

than one grade in the same classroom. There are 21 estimates of its impact, based on only four

distinct studies. Four estimates (all from the same study) show a significantly negative effect,

while seven estimates yield positive effects (of which two, from two different studies, are

statistically significant). Overall, these results are decidedly ambiguous, and the actual impact

may vary given other factors, such as class size and teacher characteristics. In contrast, results

are relatively unambiguous, and in the expected direction, for hours of the school day; six of the

eight estimates are positive, and four are significantly positive (although when studies are given

equal weight the distribution of the findings is less clear cut).



                                                  25
           The results for tutoring are more ambiguous; while four of the five estimates are positive,

and two of these four are significantly positive, when studies are equally weighted two of the

three studies show a positive effect, of which one is significant, but the third shows a

significantly negative effect. While intuitively one would think that tutoring should help, and

would not have any negative effects, it could be that the tutors are simply the students’ teachers,

who may be curtailing effort during the school day to obtain paying students for their tutoring

classes (for a general discussion, see Dang and Rogers (2008). Participation in tutoring may also

be an indicator that the student needs extra help, i.e., that achievement is causing tutoring rather

than the other way around.

           The next two school organization variables focus on teacher pay: teacher salary and

whether the teacher is a contract teacher. There are only six estimates of the impact of teacher

salary, but all are positive and two are significantly positive, which may indicate that higher

salary raises teacher morale or leads to better selection into teaching. The findings for contract

teachers, however, indicate a possible contradiction. These teachers are hired on short-term

contracts and, in general, have relatively low qualifications, less experience, little or no benefits,

and lower salaries, a combination that might superficially suggest that these teachers would be

less effective.19 Yet five of the six estimates yield positive impacts, and four of them are

significantly positive (although the results are more ambiguous when weighted by publication).

The counterbalancing force behind the positive impact of contract teachers, according to several

researchers, is that they have much stronger incentives to perform well than regular teachers,

who are insulated from performance concerns by civil services rules. Thus, even with lower

salaries, they are induced to perform well in school (perhaps so that they can subsequently get a

19
     For a detailed review and analysis of recent research on contract teachers, see Galiani and Perez-Truglia (2011).
                                                           26
regular teaching position with its higher salary and greater job security). Overall, the teacher

salary results are consistent with pay inducing more teacher effort or leading to better selection

into teaching, although the interpretation is ambiguous because much of the variation in salaries

comes from pay for different characteristics rather than identifying the impact of increasing or

decreasing the overall salary schedule for teachers.

       There are only three estimates in Table 9 regarding the impact of overall school

expenditures per pupil, but the results are somewhat puzzling; in two of the three cases, the

estimated effect is significantly negative (an unexpected effect), while in the other it is

significantly positive. This measure is somewhat difficult to interpret. It could simply reflect

compensatory funding – i.e., schools that are doing poorly get additional funds. And, it is also

possible that the estimated negative effects arise because other school characteristics are included

in the regression; in both studies from which these estimates come (Nannyonjo (2007); Du and

Hu (2008)) several other school and teacher characteristics are included in the regression. Again,

however, there is little overall evidence to support a strong positive impact of school

expenditures, a repeated finding in a wide range of reviews for developed countries (Hanushek

(2003)).

       The next two school variables have rather inconclusive results. The cost of enrolling in

school could have a negative effect if it interferes with schooling (a child may be excluded from

school until fees are paid) or if it leads to a reduction in home-supplied pedagogical materials,

but the evidence in Table 9 is inconclusive. Similarly, the overall size of the school has no clear

tendency, and it is not clear a priori what the sign of the effect should be.

           The next two variables focus on specific elements of pedagogical style: group work and

whether the teacher gives examples in class. Overall, group work seems to have a positive

                                                 27
impact on students’ test scores. In contrast, teachers giving examples in class is more ambiguous

(five estimates are positive, of which three are significantly positive, but two are significantly

negative).

       The last school organization variable in Table 9 is student attendance. All eight estimates

from the two studies that examined student attendance are significantly positive. This, of course,

is quite plausible, and it shows that for a few variables the results are clear and unambiguous

       B. Summary Results from 43 Higher Quality Studies. This section repeats the

analysis of the last section but drops 36 studies that were deemed to be of lower quality because

they used simple OLS on cross-sectional data without attempting to use any of the more

sophisticated methods to address the potential estimation problems. As in the previous

subsection, results are shown only if the same school or teacher characteristic was examined in

two or more separate studies.

       1. School Infrastructure and Pedagogical Materials. The first panel in Table 10 shows

summary results for seven different school infrastructure and pedagogical material variables (the

school infrastructure index was dropped because it was considered by only one of the 43

studies). As in subsection A, the most common estimated effect is that for textbooks and

workbooks; there are 21 estimates from 8 different studies. While intuitively one would expect

that these items would increase student learning, the estimated effects are far from unanimous:

slightly less than half of the estimates (9 out of 21) find positive effects, but only three of these

are significantly positive (and one is significantly negative). Thus, after dropping less rigorous

studies, the evidence that textbooks and similar materials (workbooks, exercise books) increase

student learning is quite weak.



                                                  28
        In contrast to textbooks and workbooks, the evidence in Table 10 supports much more

strongly the hypothesis that desks, tables and chairs raise student test scores. More specifically,

all seven estimates are positive, and three of them are significantly positive. On the other hand.

the results for computers and related materials are at best only weakly supportive: 17 of the 22

estimates are statistically insignificant (and they are almost evenly divided between negative and

insignificant and positive and insignificant), but of the five that are statistically significant four

are significantly positive. These results suggest caution when advocating the introduction of

computers and related devices, especially if they are relatively expensive.

        The next most commonly estimated school characteristic is electricity. While the

evidence when all 79 studies were examined strongly supported the proposition that providing

electricity to schools increases student learning, this finding completely disappears when less

rigorous studies are dropped: all six estimates are insignificant, of which three are negative and

three are positive. This result is somewhat counterintuitive, but it suggests that the impact of

providing electricity (or, more generally, better school facilities) may not be very strong.

        The findings for blackboards (and other visual aids) are generally positive. More

specifically, while four of the six estimates are positive, and two are significantly positive, the

two significantly positive results are from a single study. The results for libraries are almost

unanimous: four of the six estimates are significantly positive, and none is significantly negative.

        The last school infrastructure variable is the quality of the schools walls, roofs and

ceilings. When all 79 studies were considered, they offered strong support that improvements in

these school characteristics raised students’ test scores. The evidence in Table 10, based on only

the higher quality studies, also strongly supports this conclusion (since all of the estimates in

Table 7 are still in Table 10).

                                                   29
       2. Teacher Characteristics. The second panel of Table 10 summarizes the findings from

the 43 higher quality studies for teacher characteristics. (There are no results for principal

characteristics because none had more than one higher quality study.) The first characteristic,

the teacher’s level of education, has ambiguous results; of the 13 estimates 10 are statistically

insignificant (and evenly divided between insignificantly positive and insignificantly negative),

and while two of the other three are significantly positive the third is significantly negative.

Counting the number of studies in each category gives similarly ambiguous results. These

results stand in sharp contrast to those when all 79 studies were included; once lower quality

studies are eliminated there is little evidence that teachers’ level of education has any impact on

student test scores. There is some evidence that teacher experience has a positive effect; 17 of

the 28 estimates found positive effects, and 5 of the 17 are significantly positive (and only one is

significantly negative). Yet with 22 of the 28 estimates being statistically insignificant (and

these are almost even split between insignificantly negative and insignificantly positive), there is

only weak evidence that teacher experience has a beneficial effect, especially when one focuses

on the number of studies (the numbers in parentheses).

       In contrast to teachers’ education and experience, more direct measures of their

competence, their knowledge of the subjects that they teach, shows very strong positive effects.

More specifically, of the 20 estimates of the impact of teacher knowledge (as measured by test

scores) on student learning, all are positive and 13 are significantly positive, which provides very

strong support to the hypothesis that teacher knowledge plays a very large role in student

learning.

       As when all 79 studies are examined, teacher gender has an ambiguous impact within the

43 highest quality studies. There are eight estimates: six are statistically insignificant (although

                                                 30
five of these are positive and only one is negative), one is significantly negative and one is

significantly positive. Looking at the counts of studies does not alter the ambiguous results.

       The last teacher characteristic in the middle panel of Table 10 is in-service teacher

training. Of the six estimates of its impact, three are significantly positive and three are negative

but insignificant. Thus the evidence at best provides only moderate support to the hypothesis

that in-service teacher training has a positive impact on students’ test scores.

       3. School Organization. The third panel of Table 10 examines seven school organization

variables (nine of the variables that were in Table 7 have been dropped because they were not

included in two or more high quality studies). As in subsection A, by far the most commonly

estimated impact is that of the pupil-teacher ratio; there are 46 separate estimates from 14

different studies. As with the 79 studies examined above, most of the estimates are negative,

with 32 (70 percent) of the 46 showing a negative impact, which is a higher percentage than

when the 79 studies were examined (58 percent). In addition, 14 of the 32 are significantly

negative, while only three are significantly positive. In terms of numbers of studies, however,

the results are not as decisive. In particular, five studies found significantly negative effects

while three studies found a significantly positive effect. Overall, these results again suggest that

increases in class size usually have negative impacts on student learning, as one would expect,

but this is not always the case. Another interpretation is that the effect is negative but it is quite

small, so that random variation in estimates often yield positive point estimates, which on

occasion are significantly positive.

       In contrast, the results for teacher absenteeism are clearly negative. Of the six different

estimates, all are negative and four are significantly negative. This finding also holds when each

study is given equal weight.

                                                  31
       Turning to school meals, the evidence is scarce and remains ambiguous. In particular,

there are only three estimates from two studies; one study presents two estimates that are

significantly positive but the other study finds only an insignificantly negative impact.

        The next school organization variable is multi-grade classrooms; there are ten estimates

of its impact, although they are based on only two distinct studies. Four estimates (all from the

same study) show a significantly negative effect, while six find positive effects, although only

one of the six is significantly positive. Overall, these results are decidedly ambiguous, as was

the case when all 79 studies were examined.

         The next two variables in Table 10, hours of the school day and tutoring, also have

unambiguous results. Regarding the former, all four estimates (from two different studies) are

significantly positive. The results for tutoring are almost as unambiguous and equally plausible:

all four estimates are positive and two are significantly positive. This is less ambiguous than was

the case when all 79 studies were examined.

       Finally, for contract teachers, the results are identical to those in Table 7 because all the

79 studies that examined the impact of contract teachers were found to be sufficiently rigorous to

be in the 43 higher quality studies. Again, if one gives equal weight to each estimate, contract

teachers appear to have strong positive impacts on students’ test scores, but, if one gives equal

weight to studies, the results are more ambiguous.

       C. Results from 13 Randomized Control Trials. This subsection presents the results

from 13 randomized control trials (RCTs) that altered school characteristics. As noted above, the

RCT methodology is best suited for analysis of specific programs or resources that can be

identified and manipulated easily within an experiment. Thus, the evidence in this section

focuses on a more limited set of inputs; indeed, there are no results for teacher or principal

                                                 32
characteristics, which are difficult to randomize. Unlike the previous subsections, results are

shown even if there is only one study for a given school or teacher characteristic, since there are

very few RCTs available.

       1. School Infrastructure and Pedagogical Materials. The first three rows in Table 11

show results for three different general school infrastructure and pedagogical material

characteristics that have been analyzed using randomized trials: textbooks, computers and flip

charts. Two studies examined textbooks, one in the Philippines Tan, Lane, and Lassibille

(1999)) and one in Kenya Glewwe, Kremer, and Moulin (2009)). Overall, the results suggest no

impact of providing textbooks; none of the four estimates is positive, and none is statistically

significant. This is consistent with the weak results found above (subsection B) for the 43 higher

quality studies.

       The next variable in Table 11 is the availability of computers and related electronic media

(internet connections, educational video games, etc.). Five different RCTs have examined the

use of these types of materials. The results have been rather mixed, which is consistent with the

findings of the 43 high quality studies. Of the 20 separate estimates, eight were negative (but

only one significantly so) and twelve have been positive (of which three were significantly

positive).

       To understand the variation in results, it is useful to examine each of these five studies.

Banerjee, Cole, Duflo, and Linden (2007) evaluate an intervention in Indian primary schools in

which school teachers received training on how to use educational mathematics software in the

classroom. In treatment schools, students used the software for two hours a week. After two

years of the treatment, students in treatment schools were found to score significantly higher on

math tests than students in the control group, but there was no significant difference in language

                                                 33
scores. In contrast, Osorio and Linden (2009) evaluated the Computers for Education program in

Colombia and found less positive results. In this program, teachers receive computers as well as

eight months of training on how to use the computers in the classroom. In the schools in their

sample, teachers were trained on how to use the computers to support language education.

Pooling results across grades 3 through 9, there were no significant results of the intervention on

any of the eight math and language skills evaluated. Disaggregated by grade, there are significant

positive effects in grade 9 and significantly negative effects in grade 8.

       Linden (2008) evaluated a computer-assisted learning program in India and also found

mixed results. When students used computers instead of interacting with classroom teachers for

part of the day, the intervention had a significant negative effect on test outcomes. Students that

used the computer program after school as a complement to their classroom experience,

however, showed some (albeit insignificant) improvement. In another study conducted in India,

Inamdar (2004) evaluated a program that consisted on installing “Minimally Invasive Education

kiosks” in rural Indian schools. These kiosks have internet connected computers installed where

children can explore without any adult direct intervention. Students in the experimental group

obtained better results in Grade 8 computers examination. Note, however, that the sample size of

this investigation is quite small, collecting information for a total of only 103 students.

       Finally, Rosas et al. (2003) evaluated the effects of introducing educational videogames

in a sample of primary schools in disadvantaged areas of Chile. These videogames cover basic

mathematics and reading comprehension, and they were designed for first and second grade

students. The results indicate the children in the experimental group performed better in

mathematics, Spanish and spelling.



                                                 34
          The last RCT that examined a school infrastructure variable is that of Glewwe, Kremer,

Moulin, and Zitzewitz (2004), who examined the impact of flip charts in Kenya. As seen in

Table 11, the results were disappointing, with a negative but statistically insignificant impact.

Note that this result does not necessarily contradict the results in the previous subsection for the

43 high quality studies. In particular, recall that only two of the six estimates were significantly

positive.

          2. School Organization. Several RCTs have been conducted that examine the ways in

which school are organized. Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2008) examine the impact of

class size on achievement in India. In this paper, class size is reduced in schools that were

randomly assigned to receive an extra contract teacher. That paper presents five estimates of the

impact of class size on student achievement; three are significantly negative while two are

negative but not significant. More specifically, the effect of class size on combined math and

language test scores is significantly negative in grades one through three, but not in grades four

and five. While these findings are consistent with what one would expect, the authors cannot

separate out the class size effect from the contract teacher effect. Moreover, it is only one study,

and thus it is hard to generalize.

          One RCT has considered the impact of providing school meals. Tan, Lane, and

Lassibille (1999)) found a negative but insignificant effect of this type of program in the

Philippines. Tutoring has also been examined by a randomized trial, the study of the Balsakhi

tutoring program in India by Banerjee, Cole, Duflo, and Linden (2007). That study found that

providing tutors to children who are falling behind in the curriculum greatly increased their test

scores.



                                                 35
        Turning to contract teachers, Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2008) present four

estimates of the impact of contract teachers on student performance, and all four are significantly

positive. This is somewhat more positive than the average over the 43 high quality studies.

However, recall from the discussion of this paper above that the contract teacher was an “extra”

teacher. For this reason, the effect that is found could also be, at least in part, a class size effect.

        Another RCT conducted in India, Pandey, Goyal, and Sundararaman (2009), examined

the impact of community information campaigns on students’ test scores. The study presents 14

different estimates of impacts on reading, writing and math tests, varying by grade and state, but

all are statistically insignificant except for one that is significantly positive. Overall, there is

little evidence that these campaigns had sizeable effects on students’ test scores.

        A final school organization variable is the provision of merit-based scholarships. The

single RCT study, conducted by Kremer, Miguel, and Thornton (2009), provides two estimates,

both of which are positive with one being statistically significantly.

        D. Impact of School and Teacher Variables on Time in School. Almost all (69) of

the 79 studies examined above focused on student test scores as the outcome of interest. Yet 18

of these studies also examined time in school variables, such as daily attendance, current

enrolment and years in school. This subsection reviews the findings of these 18 studies on these

time in school variables. It is of course necessary to interpret these studies with added caution,

because a variety of programs aimed directly at enrolment and attainment—such as many

conditional cash transfer programs – have failed to lead to added learning (see the review in

Hanushek (2008)). Simply increasing time in school without commensurate additions to

learning and achievement has little value (Hanushek and Woessmann (2008)).



                                                   36
       1. All 79 Studies. Table 12 summarizes the findings when all 79 studies are examined (of

which 18 examined time in school), for all school or teacher variables found in at least two

separate studies. The first five lines examine school infrastructure and pedagogical material

variables. The first examines textbooks and workbooks, for which there are seven estimates

from four distinct studies. These seven estimates yielded only two significant results:

textbooks/workbooks lead to increased time in school. While this is intuitively plausible, the

other five estimates are insignificant, of which two are negative and two are positive (and one is

insignificant but of unknown sign). Thus it appears that textbooks do not have a strong effect on

students’ time in school.

       The next two school infrastructure variables are whether the school has a library and the

condition of its roof, walls and floors. There are only two estimates, from two distinct studies,

for school library, but they are both statistically significant, in the same direction, and intuitively

plausible: school libraries increase the time the students spend in school. Only two separate

studies examined the impact of the quality of the physical building (roof, wall and floor) on

students’ time in school. Of these, one found a significantly positive effect while the other found

an insignificantly negative effect. This lack of agreement, as well as the small number of

studies, prevents any general conclusions from being drawn.

       The next infrastructure variable, building new schools, has a more consistent set of

findings. Of the five distinct estimates, all are positive and four are significantly positive. A

similar finding holds when one gives each of the three studies from which these estimates come

equal weight. All three had at least one set of estimates with a significantly positive impact, and

only one had a positive but insignificant impact. Of course, these finding is of little surprise;

building new schools (which in effect reduces the distance to the nearest school, and may also

                                                  37
reduce capacity constraints) should increase enrollment on eventual years of completed

schooling.

        Finally, a general school quality index was used in two separate studies. Together there

are five sets of estimates. All five show positive effects, and four of the five are statistically

significant. Yet the evidence is somewhat less strong if one gives each study equal weight; one

study’s estimates were significantly positive while the other study’s results had a significantly

positive impact and an insignificantly positive impact. More importantly, the school quality

index in one paper is composed of several different variables, so it is unclear which variables are

the most important, and in the other paper school quality is a school fixed effect from a previous

estimation, which also does not indicate what school characteristics determine school quality.

        Table 12 presents results for three teacher characteristics: education level, experience and

in-service teacher training. For teachers’ level of education there are five estimates from four

distinct studies that point to ambiguous results: only one of the five is statistically insignificant.

While that one significant estimate is in the expected direction – more educated teachers lead

students’ to spend more time in school – the other four are statistically insignificant, with two

negative and two positive.

        The findings for teacher experience are puzzling. While on the one hand six of the seven

estimates are positive and two are significantly positive, the one that is negative is significantly

negative, so that when one considers only the estimates that are statistically significant one is

negative and two are positive. Thus there seems to be a positive impact, but it may be prudent to

examine only the studies that are of higher quality (which is done below).

        Finally, the three estimates of the impact of in-service teacher training are similar but

give an unexpected result: all three are negative and one is significantly negative. Given that

                                                  38
there are only two studies, one cannot draw a strong conclusion. Yet it is reasonable to conclude

that the small amount of evidence that exists provides no support for the conjecture that in-

service teacher training leads to increased student time in school.

       The last three variables in Table 12 focus on school organization. For the first, the pupil-

teacher ratio, five of the seven estimates are statistically insignificant (of which three are

negative and two are positive). The two that are significant, which are from the same study,

show a positive impact. At first glance, this is an unexpected result; a higher pupil-teacher ratio

would have a negative effect on learning and so would make time in school less valuable. On

the other hand, schools that are attractive for unobserved reasons will increase student enrollment

and years of schooling, which will lead to a positive correlation between time in school and the

pupil-teacher ratio that is not necessarily a causal effect. This makes it difficult for any study

(with the possible exception of a randomized trial) to determine the impact of the pupil-teacher

ratio on time spent in school.

       The cost of enrolling in school (e.g. tuition) should have little direct effect on learning,

but other things being equal it should reduce time spent in school. Of the six estimates shown in

Table 12, five are negative while only one is positive. However, all six of the estimates are

statistically insignificant, so there is not strong evidence that a higher cost of enrolling in school

will lead to lower enrollment and reduced years of completed schooling. As with the pupil-

teacher ratio, there could be serious estimation problems; schools that are more expensive may

be attractive in unobserved ways, which will lead to upward bias of the impact of the cost of

attending school.




                                                  39
       Finally, two studies examined merit based scholarships, producing three sets of estimates.

Two estimates are positive while one is negative, yet none of the estimates is statistically

significant. Thus there is no clear impact of merit scholarships on time spent in school.

       2. The 43 High Quality Studies. Table 13 also examines the impacts of school and

teacher variables on students’ time in school, but it considers only the 43 high quality studies, of

which 14 examined the impacts of those variables on time in school. Turning to school

infrastructure and pedagogical materials, the results are identical to those in Table 12 for

textbooks and workbooks, roof, walls and floors, and building new schools, because for those

categories all of the studies were high quality studies. In contrast, neither library nor school

quality index appears because neither had two or more high quality studies.

       The results pertaining to teacher characteristics in Table 13 are also almost identical to

those in Table 12; of the three types of teacher characteristics considered (teacher education

teacher experience, and teacher in-service training) almost all of the studies are high quality

studies. The only exception is teacher experience, yet even here four of the five studies from the

full set of 79 are high quality studies; for these four studies the impact of teacher experience on

time in school is mixed, with one study finding a significant positive effect, another finding a

significant negative effect, and three finding positive but insignificant effects.

       Finally, for the three school organization variables (pupil-teacher ratio, cost of attending

and merit-based scholarships) the results in Table 13 are identical to those in Table 12 since all

of the studies for each of those variables are considered to be high quality studies.

       3. The 13 Randomized Trials. Lastly, Table 14 examines six randomized control trials

that have estimated impacts of school and teacher variables on students’ time in school. Two of

these studies examined the impact of providing textbooks or workbooks; two of the three

                                                  40
estimates in these two studies found significantly positive effects. There were also two studies of

the impact of building new schools; both found significantly positive impacts on time in school.

In contrast, there is no significant impact of merit based scholarships, with one estimate

insignificantly negative and the other insignificantly positive. Similarly, the one estimate of

school-provided meals is statistically insignificant.




VI. Conclusion and Priorities for Future Research

       By describing the results sequentially by specific items and quality of studies, it is

difficult to see the overall picture. The results across this review of the literature from 1990 to

2010 are summarized in Tables 15 and 16. Table 15 does this for the results of studies that focus

on students learning, as measured by test scores, while Table 16 does the same for the results for

students’ time in school.

       Table 15 summarizes the impacts of 35 different school and teacher variables on student

learning. When all 79 studies are examined, about half of these variables seem to have clear

negative or positive impacts on student learning. However, when the evidence is limited to the

43 high quality studies, only a few inputs appear to have unambiguous results.

       Perhaps the clearest finding is that having a fully functioning school – one with better

quality roofs, walls or floors, with desks, tables and chairs, and with a school library – appears

conducive to student learning. Of course, these attributes may partially be signaling an interest

in, and commitment to, providing a quality education. On the personnel side, the most consistent

results reflect having teachers with greater knowledge of the subjects they teach, having a longer

                                                 41
school day, and providing tutoring. Additionally, and again unsurprising, it makes a difference if

the teacher shows up for work; teacher absence has a clear negative effect on learning.

         Randomized trials arguably provide the most rigorous evidence, but for most variables

there is either no study at all, or at most one study. Thus, it is currently difficult to draw general

conclusions from the available results. Somewhat surprisingly, however, for the two variables

with more than one RCT (textbooks/workbooks and computers), no clear results have been

found.

         On the other hand, perhaps the most useful conclusion to draw for policy is that there is

little empirical support for a wide variety of school and teacher characteristics that some

observers may view as priorities for school spending. While one could argue that the absence of

strong results simply reflects insufficient data (low statistical power) to detect systematic effects,

it could also be the case that most of the effects are themselves small. Quite plausibly, part of

the ambiguity comes from heterogeneous treatment effects, where the impact of various inputs

depends importantly on the local circumstances, demands, and capacities.

         Turning to Table 16, there is also meager evidence at best for what can be done to

increase students’ time in school and attainment.20 Focusing on the 43 high quality studies, only

two findings receive fairly clear support: building more schools increases students’ time in

school, and in-service teacher training reduces student time in school. The latter result is

unexpected and admittedly is based on only two studies, but it may reflect that in-service teacher

training takes teachers out of the classroom, so that the primary effect is similar to that of teacher

absence. The randomized trials to date again provide insufficient evidence for clear policy



20
   One exception to this lack of evidence is the finding that conditional cash transfer programs induce greater school
attendance. This is discussed in detail in Behrman, Parker, and Todd (2011).
                                                         42
directions, although if many more were conducted it is possible that clearer policy conclusions

could be drawn.

        Taken as a whole, these studies are consistent with much of the current policy discussion

that the focus should shift from basic school and teacher characteristics to changing incentives in

schools and permitting more local decision making; if the effects are generally small or if they

depend on, say, local capacity, it is then difficult to set overall resource policies at the national or

international level. Indeed, the variation in results may reflect that some interventions work well

in some contexts but have no effect, or even negative effects, in other contexts. This evidence

would be consistent with cross-country evidence that generally indicates positive effects from

more local autonomy in decision making (at least when there is also an accountability system in

place); see Hanushek and Woessmann (2011).

        This state of affairs raises the question about the value of research on the effect of basic

school and teacher characteristics on student learning and time in school. The various research

efforts have led to many ambiguous results – either because there are few consistent results or

because the methodological problems are too large. A deeper appreciation for the

methodological issues in obtaining causal estimates has emerged in the past two decades. Both

the inconsistent results from past work and the distinct possibility of rather deep methodological

problems suggest that a continued quest for identifying the specific inputs of teachers and

schools from cross-sectional analyses of samples of convenience is unlikely to lead to strong

policy guidance.

        But a complementary conclusion is that conducting research into policy relevant aspects

of schooling often requires early researcher involvement in the design and data collection before

programs or policies are introduced. For several classes of policy issues – largely ones involving

                                                  43
well-identified programs and specific resources – obtaining randomized or quasi-randomized

observations is key to instilling confidence in research results. RCTs provide the easiest to

understand research design, and it is probably the case that researchers have historically under-

invested in their use. At the same time, actually implementing these can be time-consuming,

difficult, and expensive – leading to a limited number of such analyses to date, although a larger

number are either currently underway or will soon be started.

       Two other kinds of approaches offer promise. First, the availability of panel data

provides the possibility of addressing a wider range of issues while still being sensitive to the

threats to statistical analysis. For example, much of the recent analysis of large panels of

administrative data in the U.S. has shown how panel data techniques can reduce analytical

problems while opening up a much wider range of analyses.

       Second, with the cooperation of government policy makers, randomization in the

implementation of education programs across villages or over time can provide the kinds of

variation that are needed to evaluate the impacts of these programs. This approach is distinct

from researcher-driven RCTs because the programs being evaluated are chosen by the

government. Further, given sufficient training, governments can evaluate these interventions

with no need to bring in expatriate academic researchers. More specifically, this approach builds

on local ideas for programs that local policy makers believe are likely to lead to improvements,

and it also capitalizes on the fact that funding for many programs is frequently insufficient to

introduce a new program across all possible locations. By staggering the introduction of a given

program over time, it is possible to develop a built-in control group to assess the impact of that

program. But here is where early involvement (by either higher level decision makers or outside

researchers) is essential, because, for example, giving the program first to the most politically

                                                 44
powerful locales or to the most needy locales (as opposed to a random selection of locales)

reduces, if not eliminates, the analytical possibilities.

        Part of future success in designing and implementing effective education policies is

introducing an evaluation mindset. The absence of interest in learning about the efficacy of new

programs or policies is not restricted to developing countries, but is indeed present in developed

countries. But the evidence to date reviewed in this paper underscores the importance of this

perspective. This review of existing evidence suggests little in the form of “best policies” that

can readily be introduced through central provision or through regulatory approaches. This

realization implies that progress is likely to proceed with local experimentation built on local

knowledge and capacities. Yet local experimentation is unlikely to be successful unless there is

a process of evaluation that works to continue the policies and programs that rigorous

evaluations demonstrate are successful and to discontinue those that such evaluations indicate are

unsuccessful.

        One other aspect of this review deserves mention. Nothing has been said along the way

about the costs of any programs. Clearly, effective policy needs to consider both the benefit side

and the cost side, particularly in developing countries where resource constraints are binding at

low levels. However, very few of the existing evaluations have provided solid information about

costs of programs and policies. This topic is further addressed by Dhaliwal, Duflo, Glennerster,

and Tulloch (2011).

        At the beginning of this paper we noted that education, and especially the skills

developed through high-quality education, can have an enormous positive impact on

individuals’ lives and on countries’ economic growth. Yet education is a complicated process,

and in both developed and developing countries policymakers and researchers are trying to

                                                   45
understand which policies are most likely to improve education outcomes. In this review we

have found that, despite a large and increasingly sophisticated literature, remarkably little is

known about the impact of education policies on student outcomes in developing countries.

There are two likely reasons for this. The first is that what works best may vary considerably

across countries and even within countries, which implies that future research should attempt to

understand which policies work best in which settings. The second is that much of the literature

has focused on basic school and teacher characteristics, when in fact the ways that schools are

organized may matter most. Such a conclusion implies that future research should focus on how

schools are organized and the incentives faced by teachers, administrators, parents and students.

Appendix I: Search Terms
The methodology used to search for papers is described in detail in Section III of the paper. This
appendix reports the specific search terms used. The search terms used to search EconLit from
1990 to 2010 are as follows. The code “KW” refers to a key word.

KW=education and KW=("class size" OR "school size" OR "Student teacher ratio" OR "Pupil
teacher ratio" OR "School expenditure*" OR “expenditure per pupil” OR "texbook*" OR
"instructional material*" OR "Workbook*" OR "exercise book*" OR "computer*" OR "laptop*"
OR "internet" OR "school infrastructure" OR "Facilities" OR "Building condition*" OR

inputs" OR "pedagogical resources")

These search terms yielded over half a million results in ERIC. To narrow the results to a
reasonable number, results in ERIC were further limited to articles that included the name of at
least one developing country or related term in the abstract. The search terms used to limit results
accordingly are as follows. The code AB refers to abstract.
