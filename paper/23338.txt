                                         ABSTRACT

We construct a synthetic panel of household expenditures from the Consumer Expenditure
Survey (CEX) and use the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System to estimate expenditure
shares and income elasticities of demand that vary by good-income-time. We show that the size
and distribution of income shocks drives expenditure change in a manner that varies profoundly
across traded goods. Our estimates of expenditure shares and income elasticities could be useful
in many applications that seek to explain changes in trade behavior from the demand side, and
indicate the strong sensitivity of trade to changes in the tails of the income distribution. We
explore an application involving the Great Trade Collapse. Income-induced expenditure changes
are positively correlated with the cross-good pattern of import changes, generating a predicted
change 40% as large as the raw variation in import declines.

1. Introduction
          After an extended lull, a recent literature has begun to re-emphasize the importance of non-
homothetic preferences for explaining patterns of trade. These papers have tended to emphasize
forms of non-homothetic preferences that permit relatively easy aggregation of demands over
income levels. As such, their estimation involves minimal data requirements, and they are ideal
for incorporating into general equilibrium theories and evaluating welfare consequences of trade.
          We pursue a different approach to understanding the role of income effects in import
demand, using household expenditure data from the US to estimate a parametrically rich non-
homothetic demand system. We recover income elasticities of demand for traded goods that are
good-income-time varying. Combining this with information on the share of good expenditures
at different income levels, we show that the size and distribution of income shocks drives
expenditure change in a manner that varies profoundly across traded goods. These estimates could
be useful in many applications that seek to explain changes in trade behavior from the demand
side. That is, they provide an extension of the classic demand curve instrument – income – by
allowing the distribution of income changes hitting a country to differentially affect consumption
and import demand for each good and time period. To show this, we explore an application in
which we explain changes in import demand over a period that includes the Great Trade Collapse.
Income-induced expenditure changes are positively correlated with the cross-good pattern of
import changes, generating a predicted change 40% as large as the raw variation in import declines.
          We employ the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS), which allows income
elasticities to depend non-linearly on prices and incomes. We estimate key parameters using
quarterly data from 1995Q1-2010Q1 taken from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX).
The CEX provides household expenditure data for many traded and nontraded goods. We
construct a synthetic panel of 10 income bins corresponding to income deciles in each quarter, and
aggregate over households within each bin to create a representative household at each income
decile.
          This has several advantages. First, while individual household purchases of durables are
infrequent, the representative household will have positive expenditures for (nearly) all goods and
periods. Second, we can control for key demographic characteristics (family size, age, location)
that systematically covary with income and that affect expenditures. Third, the synthetic panel
structure allows us to exploit cross-sectional variation across bins in a given period to control for

                                                                                                   2
unobservable prices and quality of goods, while exploiting variation in income and expenditure
both within and across bins. Fourth, and most important, the system allows us to estimate spending
shares and income elasticities that vary at the level of good-income-time.
       Adding over all goods, the top two deciles are responsible for 49 percent of spending on
traded manufactures (excluding food) found in the CEX, while the bottom two deciles are
responsible for 3 percent of spending. Of note, the extent to which traded good expenditure is
driven by the upper deciles varies tremendously across seemingly similar goods and over time.
This is best shown by comparing expenditures for the top decile to the fifth (median) decile. The
top decile spends 8.9 times more on “Men’s Suits” than does the fifth decile, but only 3.2 times as
much for “Men’s Uniforms”. Similarly, the top decile spends 13.4 times more than the fifth decile
for “Winter/Water Sporting Equipment” but only 2.7 times more for “Fishing and Hunting
Equipment”.
       Income elasticities differ from one, vary significantly across good-income-time, and are on
average falling with income levels. Moreover, the data clearly reject that the ratio of income
elasticities for two goods is constant across income levels – a central prediction of Constant
Relative Income Elasticity (CRIE) preferences used in the literature.
       The combination of expenditure shares and elasticities varying over good-income-time
means that even a uniform income shock will result in large changes in the distribution of
expenditures across goods categories. Moreover, income shocks are not uniform, and there are
pronounced differences in the distribution of income shocks during recent crisis periods. In the
period just before the Dot-Com Crash of 2000-01 higher income households experienced a sharp
increase, then a more pronounced slowdown in incomes, while changes for lower income
households were more muted. In the period just before the Great Trade Collapse of 2008-9 the
rise and fall of expenditures was more pronounced in lower and middle income households.
       By combining data on the distribution of shocks with our estimates of income-specific
expenditure shares and income elasticities we can construct predicted changes in expenditures
specific to each good-income-time period.. Aggregating over income bins we have a measure of
predicted expenditure change that is good-time varying, arising only from income shocks.
       In a final exercise, we explore whether these predicted expenditure changes can explain
time series variation in imports and the pattern of import declines during the recent crashes. We
regress changes in imports at the good level on changes in actual expenditures on that good taken

                                                                                                3
from the CEX. Of course, actual expenditures depend on good prices and quality, and a myriad
of other endogenous factors. Accordingly, we use our measure of predicted expenditure change
arising from income shocks as an instrument for actual expenditure change. The first stage yields
a strong fit, and in our preferred second stage specification we find an elasticity of import change
with respect to expenditures of 0.17.
       A key to understanding the Great Trade Collapse is that the import change was not uniform,
and in fact varied dramatically across goods. Using our estimates for the peak of the GTC, we
find that a good with an expenditure change in the 10th percentile (large decreases) had an
associated import decline 16 percentage points larger than a good with an expenditure change in
the 90th percentile. The actual (10-90) gap in import change was on the order of 41 percentage
points, suggesting that expenditure changes arising from the distribution of income shocks played
a significant role in the overall decline. These results are robust to changes in sample years and
width of household income bins used in the estimation, and our point estimates are robust to
incorporating other variables emphasized in the Great Trade Collapse literature, including
inventories, shocks transmitted through supply chains, and financing constraints.
       Our emphasis on non-homothetic demand relates to an older branch of the trade literature
that studies per-capita income as a determinant of trade patterns. Linder’s (1961) seminal work
emphasizes how income affects the composition of the consumption basket, and suggests that more
similar countries will have higher bilateral trade volumes. Markusen (1986) and Bergstrand (1989,
1990) formalize these insights using Stone-Geary preferences to generate income effects in models
of monopolistic competition and trade. Thursby and Thursby (1987) and Francoise and Kaplan
(1996) formalize and test the Linder Hypothesis. Hunter and Markusen (1988) and Hunter (1991)
show that per-capita income can serve as a basis for interindustry trade, and stress the importance
of departures from homotheticity in explaining commodity level import demands.
       More recently, Caron et al. (2014) and Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) estimate gravity
equations derived from non-homothetic preferences to generate income elasticity estimates. Caron
et al. (2014) use “Constant Relative Income Elasticity” preferences from Fieler (2011) and focus
on explaining home bias and biases in the factor content of trade. Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal
(2016) use the Almost Ideal Demand System and focus on measuring the unequal gains from trade
across consumers of different income levels. In both cases, the authors combine non-homothetic
demand systems with structural assumptions on the production side of the model to generate trade

                                                                                                 4
predictions. They estimate sector level gravity regressions that exploit cross-country variation in
per capita incomes at a point in time to explain the level of expenditures and trade across broad
sectors of the economy (including agriculture, manufacturing and services). We focus on the
distribution of income and expenditures across households within the US and focus on how shocks
to the household income distribution drive changes in expenditures and import demand within
specific traded manufactured goods over time.
       Focusing on the distribution of income shocks within a country is non-trivial. Non-
homothetic systems used in the older literature, such as the linear expenditure system (LES)
derived from Stone-Geary preferences, allow the level but not the distribution of income within a
country to affect expenditures. Further, the LES system generates identical income elasticities for
all non-subsistence goods. (See Appendix A).       More recent innovations, such as CRIE, allow
elasticities to vary with income levels and across goods, but constrain the ratio of income
elasticities to be the same at all income levels. These more restrictive systems are ideal for use in
cases where parameters are identified from the aggregated trade behavior of an entire country.
       An intriguing difference in the results generated by these different approaches has to do
with the behavior of spending on manufactured goods across different income levels. Fajbelbaum
and Khandelwal’s (2016) cross-country evidence suggests that budget shares devoted to
manufactures fall with income, and income elasticities for manufactures rise with income. This
pattern lies at the heart of their conclusion that trade is pro-poor. Our within-US household panel
evidence suggests exactly the opposite. Expenditure shares devoted to manufactures are only 5
percent at the first decile and sharply rise with income, and associated income elasticities fall.
While we do not perform any formal welfare calculations, it is hard to see how trade in
manufactures could much benefit poor consumers in the US if they are spending as little as 5
percent of their income on these goods.
       Our study tangentially relates to the literature that uses Nielson scanner data (Faber and
Fally (2017), Handbury (2013), and Jaravel (2016)) and incorporates income effects in the
analysis. Faber and Fally (2017) find that rich and poor households source their consumption from
different parts of the firm size distribution, and related, Jaravel (2016) finds that rich household
gains more from new and innovative goods. Handbury (2013) assesses biases arising from
homotheticity in spatial price indexes across income groups, and find the bias is the largest for
high-income households. Our emphasis is on estimating budget shares and income elasticities to

                                                                                                  5
generate predicted panel variation in national expenditures and imports across a wider range of
traded manufactures that do not appear in the scanner data (Handbury 2014, for example, is
focused on extremely detailed food products),
         Our final application also relates to the literature on the Great Trade Collapse. In one year
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, world trade declined by a third, a drop many times larger
than the corresponding decline in incomes or output.1 A variety of explanations have been offered
for this severe downturn. Recent papers on trade finance (Ahn, Amiti and Weistein (2011), Amiti
and Weinstein (2011)) and credit tightening (Chor and Manova (2012)) attribute decreases in trade
to the reduction in the availability of external finance during crises. Bems, Johnson and Yi (2010)
focuses on the transmission of shocks through vertical production linkages. Alessandria, Kaboski
and Midrigan (2010) examine whether agents depleted inventories as a substitute to buying more
from abroad. On the expenditure side, several authors (Baldwin and Taglioni (2009), Eaton,
Kortum, Neiman and Romalis (2016)) examine production composition. If international trade
occurs disproportionately in sectors whose domestic demand (or production) collapsed the most,
we would expect trade to fall more than GDP. Related, Levchenko, Lewis, and Tesar (2011) argue
that a reduction in quality demanded after income losses will result in a contraction in the value
(price, rather than quantity) of imports.2
         We have little to say about the supply side of trade in the recent crisis, though we examine
whether our estimates are sensitive to including correlates from this literature. Our work is closely
related to the composition effect hypothesis, in that we focus on a systematic decline in expenditure
for certain categories of goods. Unlike this literature, we offer a direct test of why particular good
categories experienced sharp expenditure contractions as a function of income elasticities and the
distribution of income shocks.
         Finally, we note at the outset that our approach is deliberately stark. We are not trying to
fully explain the Great Trade Collapse or to fully explain what gives rise to expenditure changes
on imported goods over time. Rather, we are interested in one aspect of expenditure change arising


1 In 2008q3 and 2008q4, world trade flows were 15% below their previous level (Baldwin and Taglioni (2009)). The
trade growth rate of 23 OECD countries reached a record negative growth of -37% in April 2009 (Araújo and Oliveira
Martins (2011)). Within the US, GDP declined by 3.8% from its peak to the trough, real U.S. imports fell by 21.4%
and real exports fell by 18.9% over the same period (Levchenko, Lewis and Tesar (2010)).
2 Levchenko et al. (2010) test multiple hypotheses, finding support for vertical production linkages and a composition
effect, but no support for the credit tightening hypothesis. Haddad, Harrison, and Hausman (2010) provide a simple
explanation for this finding: import price in sectors requiring high external finance rose by much more than the prices
in other sectors, which offsets the decline in quantities.

                                                                                                                    6
from the distribution of income shocks and whether that expenditure change can generate some
significant portion of the relevant change in trade behavior. The advantage of this approach is that
we can identify the relevant income effects from the household data, and a stark specification
provides some hope of being able to implement the resulting instrument outside the immediate
context. Undoubtedly there are interesting questions about how changes in the availability of
household credit, the housing crisis, or an overhang of consumer spending on durables, may have
had significant changes in the pattern of expenditures in this period. We put all this to the side to
focus on incomes.
         The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the methodology for estimating
budget shares, income elasticities, and expenditure changes. Section 3 describes the CEX data,
and construction of the synthetic panel. Section 4 presents stylized facts and key results from
estimating the demand system. Section 5 reports results linking expenditure change to the trade
decline, along with robustness checks. We conclude with remarks on the broader applicability of
our estimates in section 6.


2. Methodology
2.1. Overview
         To begin, write imports M of good 𝑔 at time 𝑡 as a share of national income Y:
                                                 𝑀𝑔𝑡 𝑀𝑔𝑡 𝐸𝑔𝑡
                                                     =    ∙                                                       (1)
                                                  𝑌𝑡   𝐸𝑔𝑡 𝑌𝑡

         The first term is the share of imports in expenditures E for good 𝑔. The second is the
expenditure share of good 𝑔 in national income. Much of the focus of the literature on the Great
Trade Collapse is on the first term, explaining why imports as a share of expenditures would
decline. Our focus is on the second term, explaining movements in the expenditure shares on good
𝑔 over time.3
          The problem is that expenditures are endogenous to many of the supply shocks posited in
the literature. For example, if financing constraints raise traded goods prices and demand is price
elastic, we expect expenditures to decline. Accordingly, we need an instrument for expenditures
that is good x time varying and orthogonal to supply shocks. Note that the classic demand

3In section 5 we use a variance decomposition to show that, in our data, 42 percent of the panel variation in equation
1 is driven by variation in the second term.

                                                                                                                   7
instrument, changes in income, provides no cross-good variation if demand for traded goods is
homothetic. That is, a 5% fall in income generates an identical 5% reduction in expenditures for
all goods. However, cross-good variation in income elasticities arising from non-homothetic
demand, combined with a distribution of income shocks, can generate good x time variation in
expenditures.
        To see how this works, note that the change in aggregate expenditures on a good is a share-
weighted aggregation of expenditure change at the household level. To smooth purchases we will
focus on bins of similar households (more in the data section below). Denoting traded goods by 𝑔,
and household bins by 𝑏, the change in expenditures over four quarters is:

                                       𝐸𝑔𝑡                        𝐸𝑔𝑏𝑡
                           𝑑𝐸𝑔𝑡 ≡ 𝑙𝑛 (       ) = 𝑙𝑛 (∑ 𝑆𝑔𝑏,𝑡−4 ∙         )                               (2)
                                      𝐸𝑔,𝑡−4                     𝐸𝑔𝑏,𝑡−4
                                                          𝑏

where 𝑆𝑔𝑏,𝑡−4 is the share of bin 𝑏 in national expenditures for good 𝑔 at (𝑡 − 4). To prevent
confusion, note that high income households may devote a relatively small share of their budget
to a particular good and yet be responsible for an outsized share of economy-wide spending. We
are interested in the predicted change in expenditures. To build this up from the level of household
bin, we need to estimate the level of household bin spending on good 𝑔 and how that spending
changes in response to changes in income.


2.2. Expenditure Shares and Income Elasticities in the QUAIDS
        The Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) was first introduced by Banks,
Blundell, and Lewbel (1997) as an extension of the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS). In
QUAIDS, budget shares depend not only on the log of real total expenditure but on its square. The
quadratic allows more flexibility in expenditure responses while still satisfying theoretical
restrictions necessary for well-behaved utility. The QUAIDS in budget share form is:
                                                                                      2
                                                   𝑦     𝛿𝑔           𝑦
                    𝑤𝑔 = 𝛼𝑔 + ∑ 𝛾𝑔𝑘 𝑙𝑛 𝑝𝑘 + 𝛽𝑔 ln ( ) +         (𝑙𝑛 (   ))                               (3)
                               𝑘                   𝑃    ∏𝑘 𝑝𝑘𝛽𝑘       𝑃

The household budget share for good 𝑔 is 𝑤𝑔 , y is total expenditure for the household, 𝑝𝑘 is the
price of a good k, and 𝛼𝑔 , 𝛽𝑔 , 𝛿𝑔 and 𝛾𝑔𝑘 are parameters. 4 ln 𝑃 is a price index defined as ln 𝑃 =


4 For well-behaved utility, the following restrictions are necessary: ∑𝑔 𝛼𝑔 = 1, ∑𝑔 𝛽𝑔 = 0, ∑𝑔 𝛾𝑔𝑘 = ∑𝑘 𝛾𝑔𝑘 =
0, 𝛾𝑔𝑘 = 𝛾𝑘𝑔 , 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∑𝑔 𝛿𝑔 = 0.

                                                                                                          8
                      1
𝛼0 + ∑𝑔 𝛼𝑔 log 𝑝𝑔 + ∑𝑔 ∑𝑘 𝛾𝑔𝑘 log 𝑝𝑔 log 𝑝𝑘       By setting 𝛿𝑔 = 0 this system nests the more
                      2

commonly used AIDS.
       Using equation (3) we can calculate the income elasticity for each good 𝑔:
                                                  2𝛿𝑔         𝑦    1
                                𝜂𝑔 = 1 + (𝛽𝑔 +           ln (   ))                             (4)
                                                 ∏𝑘 𝑝𝑘𝛽𝑘      𝑃 𝑤𝑔


From equation (4), we can infer three properties of the income elasticity:
   1. 𝜂𝑔 can differ from one.
   2. 𝜂𝑔 varies across income levels for a particular good.
   3. The sign of 𝛽𝑔 and 𝛿𝑔 determine if a good is income elastic or inelastic at a given income
       level and price index.

To illustrate these properties, let 𝑝𝑔 = 1 ∀𝑔 and set 𝛼0 = 0, so that 𝑃 = 1. Then, 𝜂𝑔 reduces to:
                                                  𝛽𝑔    2𝛿𝑔
                                     𝜂𝑔 = (1 +       )+     ln 𝑦
                                                  𝑤𝑔    𝑤𝑔
It is immediate that if both 𝛽𝑔 > 0, 𝛿𝑔 > 0, then 𝜂𝑔 > 1 and is increasing in income at all income
levels. Conversely, if both are negative, then 𝜂𝑔 < 1 and is decreasing in income at all income
levels. However, if 𝛽𝑔 and 𝛿𝑔 have opposite signs goods can switch from income inelastic to
income elastic and vice versa as incomes vary.    Figure 1 displays these cases.


2.3. Estimation Methodology: Budget shares
       We estimate the relevant parameters of equation (3) using data on income and expenditures
from a panel of households.     Rewriting (3) to incorporate household bin 𝑏 and time 𝑡 variation:


                                                                                   2

We assume that demand parameters 𝛼𝑔 , 𝛽𝑔 , 𝛿𝑔      and 𝛾𝑔𝑘 are time invariant. The various price
terms pose the main difficulty in estimation because we do not have price data for the specific

goods in the CEX. 5 However, our goal is to construct an instrument for expenditures that is
orthogonal to supply shocks, based on consistently estimated income elasticities. That is to say,
even if we had price data we would not want to incorporate it because it would invalidate the IV.
          To resolve the difficulty in estimation we assume that, after conditioning on location,
households of varying income within the US face the same vector of prices at a point in time. This
means that the expression 𝛼𝑔 + ∑𝑘 𝛾𝑔𝑘 𝑙𝑛 𝑝𝑘𝑡 can be eliminated by incorporating a good-time
fixed effect, 𝑎𝑔𝑡 . We proxy for the QUAIDS-appropriate price index using the CPI. Note that
the quadratic income term interacts with an aggregated measure of prices that is common across
                                      𝛽
goods but varies over time, ∏𝑘 𝑝𝑘𝑡𝑘 . However, if this price measure takes on the same value for
each household at a point in time we can absorb this variation by interacting the quadratic income
with a time dummy 𝑇𝑡 . To complete the specification we incorporate a vector of demographic
characteristics 𝑿𝒃𝒕 which may affect expenditures such as age of household head, family size, and
location (urban/rural).
                                                                            2

          These elasticities are of independent interest. But they also enable us to implement an
instrumenting strategy for changes in expenditures at the good-time level and potentially explain
changes in import demand. Recalling, equation (2), expenditure change at the national level is a

to emphasize differences in the availability and set of prices facing households in the US. We do not employ these
data because we do not have access to them, because these data cover a subset of the goods covered in the CEX, and
because we are interested in variation in expenditures that is exogenous to changes in prices.

3. Data
         We employ data from the quarterly interview panel survey of the CEX from
1995q1~2010q1. Each consumer unit (CU) in the sample is interviewed once per quarter for five
consecutive quarters6 and they report expenditures on major items of expense over the preceding
quarter. CEX covers a complete range of household expenditures including services, non-durable
and durable goods. The CEX data are organized by universal classification codes (UCC). There
are 330 UCC, of which 102 we classify as traded goods.
         We are interested in examining how changes in income affect expenditures on traded
goods, including consumer durables. The short panel dimension of the CEX prevents us from
examining within household changes in income. In addition, durable goods purchases at the
household level are infrequent and hence households register zero expenditures for many goods in
most periods.
         To overcome these problems, we create a synthetic panel with households aggregated into
decile bins by total expenditure in each quarter (we also experiment with using 20 bins). We use
total expenditures in place of income for three reasons.                    One, reported incomes and total
expenditures are very highly correlated.                Two, the income field in the CEX has known



6 The sample design of CEX is a rotating panel survey in which one-fifth of the sample that has completed its final
interview is dropped and a new group added in each quarter. Specifically, each quarterly sample is divided into three
panels of approximately equal size, each of which is nationally representative. CUs in these panels are interviewed
once during the first, second, or third month of each quarter for five consecutive quarters. After CUs have been in the
sample for five quarters, they are replaced by new CUs.


                                                                                                                  11
measurement problems at the household level. Three, we have nothing to say about savings
behavior or how households spend beyond apparent income, this latter issue being especially
problematic when fitting expenditures at very low income levels. Henceforth, we will use
“income” and “total expenditures” interchangeably.
        There are approximately 300 households (CEX Consumer Units) in each bin in each
quarter. In the bottom 7 deciles the income range spanned by a bin is $925 on average, though the
range of incomes rises sharply in the top two deciles. Within each bin we construct average
expenditures across households for each category of purchases within the CEX, including 102
traded goods. We also keep track of household characteristics within each bin. For numerical
demographic characteristics such as age and family size, we use averages within bins. For
categorical characteristics, we use shares of categories within each bin, for example the share of
households living in urban areas.
        Following standard practice in the CEX literature, the sample is restricted to improve the
measurement of consumption. In particular, households (HH) are dropped from the sample in
these cases: multiple consumer units in the HH; HH lives in student housing; the head/spouse of
HH is farmer/fisher; the HH does not complete all interviews; HH has incomplete information on
income, negative income, or zero income. Additionally, topcoded expenditures are dropped from
the sample, and to remove potential outliers we drop the top and bottom 1 percentile of income
bins.
        For some of our exercises, we will match expenditure data from the CEX to trade data.
The CEX data are organized by UCC which we sort into traded goods and non-traded services.
We match UCC product descriptions to those found in 10-digit HS import data descriptions,
building on a concordance constructed by Ardelean and Lugovskyy (2015). In many cases, there
are multiple HS codes corresponding to a single UCC, and we aggregate these HS codes into a
single good category. Note that our data cover consumer expenditures, and not expenditures on
industrial supplies. In this period we match codes representing 27% of imports by value and will
focus primarily on these goods. In some cases we also aggregate similar UCC’s. The list of UCC
product descriptions and concordance to HS codes is available on request.




                                                                                              12
4. Expenditure Shares and Changes, and Income Elasticities

        From equations (2) and (9) we know that the aggregate response of expenditures to an
income shock depends on how spending is initially distributed across households, and the
responsiveness of each household to a change in income. In this section, we use the CEX data,
and income elasticities estimated from it, to show how profoundly different the effect of an income
shock on traded good spending can be depending on where that shock hits.

        Figure 2 displays the (over-time) average budget shares for traded manufactures (excluding
food) for each of 20 income bins in our data.7 The share of expenditures devoted to traded goods
is less than 5 percent for the bottom decile, rising to more than five times that number for the top
decile. In contrast, food and housing comprises half the expenditures of low income households,
but only a quarter of spending at the upper end. Repeating this exercise using one percentile
increment bins results in a more continuous distribution of spending shares in the upper deciles.
In this case, spending on traded manufactures reaches as high as 40 percent of household income
in the 99th percentile, and spending on food and housing as low as 20 percent.

        Why do these data differ so markedly from the cross-country evidence provided in
Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016), who show the share of aggregate expenditures on
manufacturing falling in income? First it is notable that housing and food expenditure data
displayed here is consistent with micro-household evidence showing income elasticities
significantly below one for these categories.8 In the CEX data, rising expenditure shares on traded
manufactures mirror declining expenditure shares on food and housing. Second, data taken from
national accounts and trade statistics may differ in important ways from household expenditure
data. This is hard to characterize with great specificity because it requires knowing details about
data construction for many countries, but a few key areas seem a plausible source of difference.
Spending on intermediate inputs will be included in national accounts and trade statistics but will
be omitted from household expenditures, and attempts to split absorption into industrial versus


7 Complete information on the share of good g spending for each income bin b is captured in Appendix Table B.2.
8 Haurin (1991), Ioannides and Rosenthal (1994), Polinsky (1977), and Zorn (1993) estimate income elasticity of
demand for housing, ranging 0.35 to 0.75. Alderman (1986) reports that estimates of the income elasticity of demand
for food ranges between 0 and 1 in many countries. Recently, Aguiar and Bils (2015) use the US CEX data to estimate
housing and food (at home) expenditure elasticity to be approximately 0.9 and 0.4, respectively.

                                                                                                              13
household use necessarily relies on industrial and household survey data. Related, and particularly
important in this context, personal consumption expenditures on an already-built housing stock is
meant to be captured in national accounts data. However, implementing this requires sophisticated
imputation of the rental value of owner-occupied housing. It is plausible to us that the quality of
imputation in separating absorption and in identifying the value of the housing service flow might
vary with the sophistication of the national statistical agency, and be missed for lower income
countries.

         We turn now to our estimation of equation (6) and calculation of corresponding budget
shares and income elasticities captured in equations (7) and (8). Since our estimates vary across
102 expenditure categories, 10 income bins and 65 time periods, we have a total of nearly 6500
elasticities and budget shares. To show relevant properties, we report illustrative examples and
capture full details in an appendix.

         In Figure 3, we display income elasticities for four specific goods (Infants Undergarments;
Watches; Bedroom Linens, and Women’s Sweaters and Vests) with variation across income
deciles at three points in time. While all show elasticities dropping with income, there are quite
significant differences in the level of the elasticity (about 50% larger for Watches than for Infants
Undergarments), the dispersion across income levels (much greater for Bedroom Linens), and in
over-time changes in the elasticity (the watch elasticities rises then falls, while the women’s
sweater elasticities rise over time). Of particular note, Infants Undergarments and Women’s
sweaters are income elastic at low income levels, but income inelastic at higher income levels in
1998q1. Picking up this sort of variation is a strength of the highly flexible QUAIDS system.

         To show that we have not cherry-picked these examples, we report (over-time mean)
income elasticities for each decile and good category in Appendix Table B.1. Income elasticities
exhibit significant variation across goods within income bins, and across income bins within
goods.
         It is useful to compare these estimates with a baseline from an important new literature
(Fieler 2011; Caron et al. 2014) in trade using non-homothetic CRIE (constant relative income
elasticity) preferences. These preferences allow income elasticities to differ from 1 and to differ
across income levels. However, they constrain the relative income elasticity between two goods

                                                                                                 14
to be constant over income levels. In the top panel of Figure 4 we calculate the relative income
elasticity for Watches and Bedroom Linens at each decile and the three points in time. The ratio
of elasticities rises with income levels, and at different rates over time. To be more systematic,
we calculate the relative income elasticity for every pair of goods 𝑔𝑔′ , income bin and time, and
express them relative to the mean (across bins and time) relative elasticity for 𝑔𝑔′ . The bottom
panel of Figure 4 displays the distribution of these values. Were relative elasticities constant, we
would find values of 0 throughout but there are clearly large deviations from this baseline.
       To be clear, CRIE preferences are a very powerful tool for incorporating non-
homotheticities into general equilibrium trade theories and for performing associated welfare
calculations. Our point is that a more flexible functional form estimated from household micro
data allows us to generate richer variation in these elasticities than are permitted by CRIE, and that
this greater variability may be useful for identifying income-induced shocks to good level import
demand.
       Recall from equations (2) and (9) that changes in aggregate expenditures for a good are a
function of the change in expenditures for each income bin, weighted by the share of that bin in
aggregate expenditures. In Appendix Table B.3, we report the share of bin 𝑏 in aggregate spending
on good 𝑔. Aggregating over all goods, the top two deciles are responsible for 49 percent of
spending on traded goods, while the bottom two deciles are responsible for 3 percent of spending.
       Of note, the extent to which traded good expenditure is driven by the upper deciles varies
tremendously across seemingly similar goods and over time. This is best shown by comparing
expenditures for the top decile to the fifth (median) decile. The top decile spends 8.9 times more
on “Men’s Suits” than does the fifth decile, but only 3.2 times as much for “Men’s Uniforms”.
Similarly, the top decile spends 13.4 times more than the fifth decile for “Winter/Water Sporting
Equipment” but only 2.7 times more for “Fishing and Hunting Equipment”. Even though Men’s
Suits and Men’s Uniforms have quite similar income elasticities, and those elasticities vary only a
little over the income distribution, the difference in the high end spending shares will result in
profoundly different changes in aggregate spending in the presence of non-uniform income shocks.
       To explore how spending shares and elasticities interact, we use equation (9) to calculate
the effect that a 10% rise in income would have on expenditures for the four goods shown in Figure
5. The vertical axis shows aggregate (summed over all households) expenditure change for good



                                                                                                  15
𝑔 and the horizontal axis shows a series of left and right skewed income shocks that aggregate up
to a 10% increase in total incomes.9
          Starting in the middle of Figure 5, we see that a uniform increase in incomes results in
expenditure increases ranging from just over 13% (for infant undergarments) to over 18% (for
women’s sweaters and vests). When we skew these shocks to the left (giving more income to the
richest households and less income to the poorest), the expenditure response becomes more highly
dispersed. When we skew these shocks to the right (giving more income to the poorest households
and less to the richest), the expenditure response narrows for all but women’s sweaters and vests.
Note that the responsiveness of aggregate expenditures to these distributional changes varies
considerably over goods as a function of expenditure shares at each income level and the relevant
income elasticities. For example, Watches have high income elasticities throughout the income
distribution, and generate large expenditure responses to the income change. But that effect
becomes more muted when income is given to poorer households because their baseline
expenditure shares comprise only a small part of overall spending on watches. The disparate
response across goods, and its dependence on the distribution of income shocks, generates an ideal
source of variation for an econometrician, i.e. no two “10% income shocks” are created alike when
it comes to their expenditure effects.
           This point is especially important when we consider that the distribution of income shocks
during two recent recessions. Figure 6 shows changes in total expenditure during the Dot Com
Crash, and the Great Trade Collapse. During the two recessions, expenditure declined throughout
the income distribution. However, the distribution of expenditure shocks is distinctly different
during the two recessions.             During the DCC the top decile experienced sharp expenditure
reductions. During the 2008-2009 recession the fall of expenditures more pronounced in the
bottom decile and fifth-seventh deciles. Given our results on expenditure shares and elasticities,
the distribution of income shocks in these two episodes should lead to significantly different effects
on trade.
          Taken together, we have significant variation across income bins in the share of spending
on particular goods; the change in aggregate expenditures (income) in particular periods, and the
income elasticity of demand for particular goods and income levels. This provides the raw material

expenditures and imports that occur over time.


5. Application: Explaining Import Change During Recent Crises

         Recalling equation (1), we can express imports of good 𝑔 as share of GDP as a product of
the import share of expenditures for good 𝑔 and good 𝑔’s share in aggregate expenditures. Taking
logs of equation (1) and expressing in first differences yields

                                                     𝑀𝑔𝑡       𝑀𝑔𝑡      𝐸𝑔𝑡
                                                   𝑑(    ) = 𝑑(     )+𝑑( )
                                                      𝑌𝑡        𝐸𝑔𝑡      𝑌𝑡

            𝑀𝑔𝑡           𝑀𝑔𝑡         𝑀𝑔,𝑡−4
where 𝑑 (         ) ≡ 𝑙𝑛 (        /            )    and similarly for the other two terms.   Using actual
            𝑌𝑡               𝑌𝑡        𝑌𝑡−4

expenditures from the CEX, a simple variance decomposition of this expression shows that about
42 percent of the total variation in imports/GDP is due to variation in the second term. This is
true whether we calculate the variance over 𝑔-𝑡 unconditionally, or after subtracting time or good
means.

         We can make a similar point using predicted expenditures for each 𝑔-𝑡 calculated from
equation (9) rather than actual expenditures. For all 𝑔-𝑡 we calculate the year on year change in
imports and predicted expenditures and display the distribution of these changes in Figure 7. The
top panel shows the pre-crisis time periods in a histogram. The bottom panel scatters the good-
level changes in imports and predicted expenditures during the recent crisis period (including a 45
degree line for reference). These graphs make clear two key points. One, there is tremendous
variation across goods in year-on-year changes in imports and expenditures which we can exploit
to test the role of income changes. Two, the magnitude of import changes differs somewhat from
expenditure changes, with higher import growth rates pre-crisis, and larger import declines during
the crisis. This is not surprisingly. After all, we know of many supply side changes in these
periods that led to rising, then falling imports. But the order of magnitude of changes is
comparable.

         We now turn to the estimation of our main equation and begin very simply.

         All variables are in log change over four quarters (sample 1995Q1 through 2010Q1), and
𝑔 corresponds to a good from the CEX (we have matched HS10 imports data to the 102 traded
UCC codes in the CEX and aggregated).
         Note that by first differencing we eliminate level differences across goods in expenditure
shares, and in supply characteristics such as price, quality, and variety. We incorporate good fixed
effects (𝛽𝑔 or 𝜃𝑔 ) to allow for good specific time trends in these components, and a year fixed
effect (𝛾𝑡 or 𝜌𝑡 ) to control for aggregate shocks that affect trade or the macroeconomy and are
common to all goods. In addition, we use sum of import-share weighted distance between the US
and its trading partners as a proxy for trade cost, 𝑑(𝑀𝐷𝐼𝑆𝑇)𝑔𝑡 . In all estimates we cluster standard
errors on goods to account for serial correlation in the first differences.10
         Conceptually, we can think of equation (11) as rewriting equation (1), and assuming that
the ratio of imports to expenditures is absorbed into differencing, good fixed effects, or the error
term. We return to this below. Equation (12) can be thought of as rewriting (1) after first
multiplying both sides by GDP. The difference in the two functional forms is that when we scale
imports and good expenditures by GDP, we absorb any effects of income shocks that reduce trade
in proportion to changes in GDP.
         We report OLS regression results for equations (11) and (12) in Table 1. For completeness
we report estimates with and without good and year fixed effects. In each case we find a very
small response, an elasticity of about 0.03.
         Next, we instrument for actual expenditures using predicted expenditures arising from
income shocks interacted with good x income bin x time varying income elasticities as described
above. The top panel of Table 2 reports the second stage, the bottom panel the first stage. In the
first stage we see that predicted changes in expenditures arising from income shocks is a very good
predictor of actual expenditure changes. Coefficients are precisely estimated with an elasticity of


10This is particularly important in this context because first differencing may inadvertently introduce serial correlation
within a good time series. To explain, suppose that 𝐼𝑀𝑔𝑡 or 𝐸𝑔𝑡 exhibits an idiosyncratic, one time increase – perhaps
a shipment scheduled for January arrives in December, or perhaps the CEX samples a few households with
extraordinarily high purchases in a month. Our differencing strategy means that an idiosyncratic increase at time t
will correspond to an idiosyncratic decrease at time t+4.

                                                                                                                     18
0.4 to 0.5, and F-stats are large. We have similar results whether we use the level of expenditure
or scale it by GDP, and whether we include or exclude fixed effects. In the second stage we find
a (highly significant) elasticity with largest coefficients (0.17) in our preferred specifications with
saturated fixed effects.
        Note also that the IV coefficients are much larger than the OLS results. Why? The OLS
results could be biased downward if omitted supply side factors in the regression are positively
correlated with imports and negatively correlated with expenditures. 11 More likely, the CEX
expenditure data are measured with error, either due to household reporting bias or because
infrequent purchases of durable goods in smaller samples induce fluctuations in first differenced
data. This induces attenuation bias in the OLS regressions, but by projecting raw expenditure data
on the instruments we eliminate the error and the attenuation bias.
        Table 1-2 use the full 1995-2010 period, but it might be useful to explore the cross-good
variation in trade declines in these periods in isolation. Specifically, the GTC generated an
unusually large set of changes in expenditures and imports and we wish to see whether we can fit
the relationship excluding it from the sample. In Table 3 we experiment with the sample years,
showing only the specifications with good and time fixed effect. In columns 1, 2 we omit the GTC
period and find quite similar elasticities to the comparable estimates in Table 2. In columns 3-6
we experiment with including a dummy variable for the GTC period, as well as interacting that
dummy with our predicted expenditure variable. The point estimate on the interaction is negative
but not significant suggesting no change in the imports-expenditure pattern in the crisis year.
(Even if we ignore the significance and take the point estimates at face value, adding the direct
and interaction coefficients implies that the relationship between imports and expenditures is still
positive during the GTC).
        To explore this a little further, Table 4 reports data on the cross-good distribution of
expenditure and import changes in each quarter of the GTC. Because of outliers we focus on the
goods in the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of predicted expenditure change (where the largest
decline is 1st percentile and the largest increase is 99th). For example, in 2008q4, the 10th percentile
good had a 59.5% decline in year-on-year expenditures, the median good saw a 16.2% drop, while



11While it is easy to think of omitted supply side factors, it is harder to identify any with this particular sign
configuration. For example, suppose financing constraints raised import prices relative to domestic purchases. This
should be negatively correlated with both imports and expenditures, generating upward bias in the OLS estimates.

                                                                                                              19
the 90th percentile good saw a 27.6% increase in year-on-year expenditures. Employing the
estimated elasticity of imports with respect to (instrumented) expenditures of 0.174 from Table 4,
the associated import changes for 2008q4 are        -10.3%; -2.8%; and +4.8%. Expressing that in
percentage point differentials, we report in the table that the 10th percentile good had an associated
import reduction that is 7.5 percentage points larger than the median good and 15.2 percentage
points larger than the good with a 90th percentile change in expenditures. Comparing this to the
actual variation in import changes at these percentiles, it appears that the change in expenditures
generates a predicted change in imports 30-45 percent as large as the raw variation in import
changes we observe in the data. The remainder of the table repeats this calculation for each quarter,
and using variables scaled by GDP, with similar results.


Robustness
       Our specification is intentionally stark, but we briefly describe some robustness checks
related to data construction and other covariates. (All results available on request.) Our strategy
of grouping households into bins is designed to register positive expenditures for all goods
categories in all periods. However, by using 10 bins we group together dissimilar households,
especially at the high end of the income distribution, and we lose some of the data variation that
would be useful in picking up quadratic effects in estimation. We re-repeat all our estimation of
budget shares and calculated elasticities using 20 income bins, then repeat our Table 2 specification
with this sample. We see little qualitative change in our estimates in either the first or second stage
       Some of our goods – especially cars, trucks, and motorcycles – exhibit very infrequent
purchases at the household level and have expenditure shares highly concentrated in upper income
households. We experimented with dropping these goods from the estimation and found no
qualitative difference in any results.
       Recalling equation (1), changes in imports for a good can arise either from a change in
expenditures relative to GDP for that good or from changes in the share of imports in expenditures.
While our focus is on the former, the trade literature has focused a great deal of attention on supply
characteristics, including good price, quality, variety or trade costs between partners.          Our
specifications incorporate first differences, good and time fixed effects. First differences eliminate
any supply factors that are good specific but not changing year to year. Good fixed effects
eliminate any good specific trends in these factors, and time effects eliminate any remaining

                                                                                                   20
variation that is common to all goods in a year. This makes it challenging to identify sources of
exogenous variation in supply factors that are good-time varying and that might be correlated with
the income generated good-time varying expenditure shocks of interest to us.
       One possibility is to focus on the variables uncovered in the literature on the Great Trade
Collapse. Many of the covariates found in that literature are collinear with our fixed effects, i.e.
our results are already robust to these explanations. Exceptions include trade credit measures from
Levchenko et al. (2010), and inventory data in the spirit of Alessandria et al. (2010). These
variables are measured at the industry level. Using industry rather than CEX good data required
us to aggregate our data considerably, and to eliminate roughly 2/3 of our observations. There
are two notable features of these results. First, restricting our sample to match these industry level
observations does not affect the point estimates on predicted expenditure in baseline specifications
that omit the additional variables. However, losing so many observations results in a loss of
statistical significance. Second, incorporating these additional controls has no effect on the point
estimates. From this we tentatively conclude that these supply side explanations for trade collapse
are orthogonal to the income-induced expenditure change we are focused on.


6. Conclusion
       We estimate budget shares and income elasticities from household variation in
expenditures for the US using QUAIDS, a non-linear non-homothetic demand system. We show
that expenditure shares and income elasticities vary dramatically across income levels, and violate
the assumption of constant relative income elasticities found in several recent papers on non-
homothetic demand. Interacting these shares and elasticities with the distribution of income
shocks within the US provides an excellent instrument for good x time variation in expenditures
on traded goods. Income-induced expenditure shocks are positively correlated with the cross-good
pattern of import changes, and during the Great Trade collapse these shocks generate a predicted
change 40% as large as the raw variation in import declines.
       While we have provided an application focused on explaining the Great Trade Collapse,
our findings could be useful for several additional literatures. First, we show that spending on
traded goods is concentrated in upper income households (the top two income deciles are
responsible for nearly half of traded goods expenditures), and that expenditures on traded
manufactures are rising in income. While this is consistent with other household micro evidence,

                                                                                                  21
it seems counterintuitive given the structural change literature and Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal’s
(2016) recent trade paper. That works suggests that when we look at cross-country data, higher
incomes are associated with shifts away from traded manufactures in production. It would be
intriguing to understand how one can find such different patterns looking across countries as
opposed to looking within a given country at a point in time. As we discuss in the text, this could
be a simple measurement issue tied to how intermediate inputs and expenditures on the housing
stock are captured in the two approaches. Of more economic interest, we speculate that the effect
could be related to the price of non-traded goods and services. That is, as incomes rise and push
up the price of non-traded goods and services such as housing, these price changes absorb a rising
portion of household income for the poor, leaving relatively little to spend on traded manufactures.
       Our estimates, and the resulting instrument for expenditure change, have application to two
additional literatures. The political economy literature shows that optimal tariffs depend on the
elasticity of export supply. The existing literature (notably, Soderbery (2010, 2015) and Broda,
Limão, Weinstein (2008) based on the technique in Feenstra (1994)) identifies export supply
elasticities by assuming that shocks to export supply and import demand are independent. If this
identifying assumption does not hold, instruments are necessary for consistent estimation. While
instruments for supply are straightforward to construct, instruments for import demand that are
good x time varying have, prior to this paper, not appeared in the literature.
       Similarly, the role of demand shocks has become prominent in another literature focused
on firm-level export data and on export “failures”. A number of papers, including Kee and Krishna
(2008), Lawless and Whelan (2008), Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2011), Munch and Nguyen
(2014), and Nguyen (2012) incorporate demand shocks in a heterogeneous firm framework to
reconcile the canonical Melitz (2003) model with the data. Put another way, these authors rely on
unobserved demand residuals to fit the data, suggesting that import demands are highly
idiosyncratic, varying across countries and time even within narrowly defined product groups. A
related literature, following from Besedeš and Prusa (2006) emphasizes the short duration of trade
relationships at the country pair x product level. In both cases, the availability of micro-founded
demand shocks, rather than residuals, could prove useful in extending our understanding of firm-
level trade and trade volatility arising from demand.

Note: Figure 5 reports aggregate expenditure changes of four expenditure categories under the mean-
preserving shocks: the uniform shock, left- and right-skewed shocks. For the uniform shock, the income of
                                       𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢
all decile points increases by 10%: 𝑦𝑦𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏            = 1.1𝑦𝑦𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1 where t − 1 = 2008q4 (one of the GTC periods).
For the right-skewed shocks, we illustrate changes in skewness by changing 𝛼𝛼 𝑖𝑖 , intercept values, from 1 to 5
                                                                         𝑖𝑖                                                              10∙𝛼𝛼 𝑖𝑖
while for the left-skewed shocks, the intercept changes from -5 to -1: 𝑦𝑦𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 𝛼𝛼 𝑖𝑖 + �1.1 − ∑                                                        � 𝑦𝑦𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1
                                                                                                                                         𝑏𝑏 𝑦𝑦𝑏𝑏,𝑡𝑡−1
where subscript b and t indicate bins and time, respectively, and superscript 𝑖𝑖 is used to indicate a type of
income shock.
