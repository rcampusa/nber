                                              ABSTRACT

The creation of non-contributory pension schemes is becoming increasingly common as countries
struggle to reduce poverty. Drawing on data from Mexico’s Adultos Mayores Program (Older Adults
Program) – a cash transfer scheme aimed at rural adults over 70 years of age – we evaluate the effects
of this program on the well-being of the beneficiary population. Exploiting a quasi-experimental design
whereby the program relies on exogenous geographical and age cutoffs to identify its target group,
we find that the mental health of elderly adults in the program is significantly improved, as their score
on the Geriatric Depression Scale decreases by 12%. We also find that the proportion of treated individuals
doing paid work is reduced by 20%, with most of these people switching from their former activities
to work in family businesses; treated households show higher levels of consumption expenditures
(on average, an increase of 23%). Very importantly, we also rule out significant anticipation effects
that might have been associated with the program transfers. Thus, overall, we find that non-contributory
pension schemes target to the poor in developing countries can improve the well-being of poor older
adults without having any indirect impact (through potential anticipation effects) on the earnings or
savings of future program participants.

1. Introduction

Undoubtedly, pensions are one of the most important components of a social security system.
Pensions improve welfare by helping individuals to smooth out their consumption levels over their life
cycle. By contributing to a pension, people consume less than they produce in the present so that they
can consume more after they retire and are no longer earning an income. Pensions allow people to
withdraw from the labor market without fear of falling into poverty or impoverishing their relatives.

The most common type of pension in the U.S and many other high-income countries is a contributory
plan that is financed by taxing own labor income. However, contributory plans have proved to be
difficult to fully scale up in economies with large informal labor markets (Dethier, 2007; Galiani and
Weinschelbaum, 2012; and Levy 2007). As a result, in the developing world, large segments of the
population are not covered by contributory pension schemes. In Latin America, contributory pension
coverage ranges from 10% to about 60% (Dethier et al., 2010). In Mexico, the site of this study,
coverage is only 23%. Most of these countries have instead turned to non-contributory pension
systems targeted on the basis of age and income (Holzmann et al., 2010; and McKinnon and Sigg,
       1
2006).

In this paper we study the effect of an at-scale non-contributory pension program on the economic
security and well-being of pensioners and their families. The Programa de Atención a Adultos Mayores
en Zonas Rurales (Assistance for Older Rural Adults Program) provides a nationwide non-contributory
universal pension scheme for seniors.2 At the time that the data used in this study were collected,
adults were eligible for the pension if they were over 70 years old and lived in communities with fewer
than 2,500 inhabitants.3 Applicants must provide documentation to prove their age and place of
residence. Beneficiaries receive a cash transfer of 1,000 Mexican pesos (USD 90) every two months.
The beneficiaries of the program are also invited to take part in workshops and social development
activities. The program started up in 2007 and had extended coverage to 2.1 million beneficiaries living
in 76,000 communities across Mexico over time. Its budget is just over 13 billion pesos, or about 0.1%
of GDP, making it the second-largest social program in Mexico after the Oportunidades Program (Rubio
and Garfias, 2010; Aguila et al., 2013).

We look at a number of important questions. We first ask whether the economic security afforded to
beneficiaries through the program increased their well-being as measured by mental health. We then
investigate the extent to which a lack of economic security prevents older adults from retiring; we do
this by examining the program’s impact on labor-market activities. We also seek to determine whether
the program reduces the economic burden on the beneficiary’s family; we do this by gauging the
extent to which the transfer increases shared household consumption levels. Finally, we ask whether
individuals who are nearing the age at which they will become eligible for the program start to reduce
their involvement in the labor market and begin to draw on their savings ahead of time in anticipation
of receiving the cash transfers from this program in the near future.

  The program is known as “70 y más” (70-and-over).

  The program completed its expansion to all villages with less than 2500 inhabitants in late 2008. Subsequently,
it started expanding to localities up to 20,000 inhabitants (Aguila et al., 2013 Rubio and Garfias, 2010, and
Sedesol, 2012). However, under agreement with the Government, the control localities included in this study
were not incorporated nor informed about the possible incorporation until at least the finalization of the follow-
up survey.


                                                                                                                2
We begin by sketching out a conceptual framework to guide the empirical analysis and help us to
interpret the results. The framework provides the theoretical underpinnings for our identification
strategy as applied in the empirical work. We then test the predictions of the model using a quasi-
experimental design that exploits discontinuities in the age and geographical eligibility requirements of
the program to identify causal impacts.

Our results provide the first evidence that non-contributory pension systems significantly improve
beneficiary mental health as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). These mental health
effects are also present in qualitative assessments of the program, in which a large number of
beneficiaries specifically commented on being “…relieved from the stress of having to work to provide
support for their families” (Tellez-Rojo et al., 2012) Our results are related to the recent works of
Finkelstein et al. (2012) and Baicker et al. (2013), which examine extending access to health insurance
under Medicaid to a low-income, uninsured adult population. They find, within the framework of a
randomized controlled experiment, that Medicaid coverage lowered self-reported depression. These
results are very important since mental health is a well-accepted and critical measure of quality of life
among the elderly (Campbell et al., 1976; Walker, 2005), and about 121 million people globally, many
of who are older and suffer from chronic depression (World Health Organization (WHO), 2003).

We also find that beneficiaries reduced their participation in formal gainful employment outside the
home in favor of less stressful and less demanding informal unpaid work within the household. The
share of beneficiaries working for pay fell from 23% to 18%, while the share who were working without
pay in family enterprises rose from 13% to 19%. Analogously, hours in wage work fell by 2.6 per week,
and hours in unpaid work increased by 2.2 per week. These results are consistent with an international
comparison of pension schemes in 11 countries that shows that increasing social security is associated
with an increase in the rate of retirement of older adults from formal employment (Gruber and Wise,
1998).

These effects of the program on labor-force participation rates are also consistent with the findings
concerning improved mental health results. While the literature indicates that unemployment among
adults is usually associated with lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of depression,4 recent
research decomposes the impact of unemployment on mental health into: (1) a “saddening” effect
generated by not being able to find work, and (2) a “time-composition” effect, whereby happiness
increases as people are able to devote more of their time to more pleasant activities (Knabe et al.,
2010; Krueger and Muller, 2012; and Ruhm, 2001). As people age, the time-composition effect
becomes more important. The economic security afforded by a pension allows older adults, who place
a great deal of value on the time-composition effect, to reduce their involvement in the labor market
and enjoy life.

We also show that the program is associated with a significant increase in the material well-being of
the household in which the beneficiary lives. In rural Mexico, almost without exception, people over 70
years of age live with another family (usually their children or other relatives). We find that 71% of the
pension is spent on shared household consumption, which translates into a 23% increase in household
consumption. The marginal propensity to consume the pension is close to estimates of the marginal
propensity to consume (0.78) out of Oportunidades Program cash transfers given to female heads of
household (Gertler et al., 2012). This suggests that the beneficiaries of the Assistance for Older Rural
Adults Program fully share their transfers with the families with which they live. These results are also

  See, for example, Clark and Oswald (1994), Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1998), Di Tella et al. (2001),
Blanchflower and Oswald (2004) and Kahneman et al. (2004)).

                                                                                                          3
consistent with evidence from South Africa that shows that the expansion of a non-contributory
pension system for older black adults after the end of apartheid was effective in reducing poverty (Case
and Deaton 1998).5

We also find no negative effects on the labor supply of other adults in the beneficiary’s household.
Gasparini et al. (2007) argue that pensions are essential to keep poverty among older adults low.
However, this result assumes that there are low disincentive effects on labor supply and earnings. Our
work provides some of the first evidence that non-contributory pension systems clearly have positive
effects on material well-being without generating significant negative labor-supply effects on working-
age members of the household.

Finally, one general concern about all pension systems is whether their implementation affects the
work and savings behavior of the younger population in anticipation of a pension in the future (e.g.,
Feldstein, 1974). However, one of the key predications is that anticipation effects depend on a person
having access to liquidity and/or credit. Most people who work in informal labor markets in developing
countries are subject to major liquidity and credit constraints (Karlan and Murdoch, 2010), which
suggests that we are unlikely to find anticipation effects in connection with this program.6 In this paper
we present evidence to support this hypothesis as applied to a poor rural population in a developing
country. Our results do not provide empirical support for the presence of anticipation effects in regard
to household total labor earnings or savings (i.e., consumption anticipation).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present a conceptual framework
for our empirical analysis. In Section 3, we describe the strategy used to identify the causal effects of
interest, while in Section 4, we describe our dataset and summary statistics. Section 5 presents the
empirical results and Section 6 concludes the paper.

2. Conceptual Framework

We present a very simple model in which agents live for two periods and consume two goods: a good
purchased in the market with a price normalized to 1, and a family good produced at home. Utility in
period t is given by:



                            (      )        ( )     (       ) ( )               (    )



At the beginning of each period, each person is endowed with one unit of time, which she must decide
how to allocate between working in the market for a wage (w), which we will assume it is fixed over
time, and working at home to produce good X. Let h be the amount of time that the person devotes to
market work and 1-h be the amount of time that the person devotes to working at home. For
simplicity’s sake, we assume that the technology used for home production is             . In the first

5
  Duflo (2000) also shows that the expansion of the pension system had positive effects on child health. See also
Ardington et al. (2009), who quantify the labor supply responses of prime-aged adults to the presence of
pensioners in their households, using longitudinal data collected in South Africa.
6
  In fact, there is also substantial evidence of credit constraints in rural Mexico, the site of our empirical
investigation. See, for example, Angelucci (2012), Gertler et al. (2012) and Love and Sánchez (2010) for evidence
suggesting the presence of credit constraints in both rural Mexican households and firms.

                                                                                                               4
period, families are able to borrow (or save) at the exogenous interest rate of r, with the loan to be
repaid in the second period. They also may receive a government pension in period t. If she receive a
pension in both periods, we assume that they are of an equal amount and denote them as T.7 Finally,
we assume there is no uncertainty about future realizations of the variables involved in their decision
process.

Let F be the amount that a person borrows in the first period and let β be the discount rate; in that
case, the dynamic optimization problem faced by the agent is                  (      )        (       )
subject to the budget constraints:                                             , where i = 1 + r. In an
interior solution8, the first-order conditions are:



                                                                                                                  (1)

                                                                                                                  (2)

                                                                                                                  (3)



Equations 1 and 2 indicate that the marginal gain from working in the market must be equal to the
marginal gain from working at home; equation 3 is a standard Euler equation.

For expositional simplicity, we assume that       , which enables us to isolate the incentives to borrow
embodied in the differences in pension benefits across periods.9 In this case, the solution simplifies to:



                                                [       ]                  (             )                        (4)

                                                [       ]                  (             )                        (5)

                                                                                                                  (6)



Consider now three types of individuals, who are defined by whether and when they receive a pension:

    (1) Treatment (TT): This type receives a pension in both periods;

7
  We do not consider explicitly the possibility that a family could also rely on its initial existent assets to smooth
consumption over time since that possibility would only reinforce the anticipation effects of future transfers that
we highlight in the present analysis.
8
  A necessary and sufficient condition is
9
  If this assumption did not hold, then agents would save (if         ) or borrow (if        ) even when there were
no transfers. The main results still hold but are less straightforward (see Appendix A for the complete solution to
the model).

                                                                                                                    5
     (2) Internal Control (IC): This type receives a pension only in the second period; and
     (3) External Control (EC): This type never receives a pension.

This taxonomy allows us to explore two effects: (1) the treatment effect of pensions on labor supply
and consumption, which we can examine by comparing the solutions for TT and EC, and (2) the
anticipation effect of the program, which can be discerned by comparing EC and IC in the first period.

Treatment Effect. Assuming that neither TT nor EC will lend or borrow (F=0), so, in both periods:



                                                                                                                  (7)

                                                (       )                                                         (8)



The treatment effect of giving the pension is then simply:



                                                        (       )                                                 (9)

                                                                                                                (10)



As agents experience an exogenous increase in their income owing to receipt of the pension, they
replace working hours in the market with hours working at home and hence consume more of both
goods.

Anticipation Effect. The IC group knows that income will increase in the second period as a result of the
pension and therefore borrows in order to spend some of the pension money in the first period. The
first-period working and consumption decisions are:



                                            (       (   )
                                                            )                                                   (11)

                                        (               )                                                       (12)



In this case, individuals reduce their labor in the market and increase their consumption of both goods
in the first period in anticipation of receiving the pension in the second period. The higher the cost of
borrowing is, the smaller the anticipation effect will be.10 If families were completely credit-constrained

10
  This also results because we assumed that agents are liquidity constrained or directly lack initial assets. If this
were not the case, families might still anticipate future transfers and increase consumption of both types of goods
by using their previously accumulated assets.

                                                                                                                   6
because interest rates were prohibitive,11 then the anticipation effect would be zero (at least, as we
already mentioned, they could instead use previous accumulated assets to anticipate the future stream
of transfers). In that case, IC and EC groups would have the same outcomes in the first period.

Alternative Treatment Effects. Suppose that we were to estimate the treatment effects of the pension
by comparing TT to IC, as opposed to TT and EC, in the first period:



                                                    (   )
                                                (   (   )
                                                            )                                             (13)

                                            (       )                                                     (14)



We can see from a comparison of equations (9) and (10) with equations (13) and (14) that we might
underestimate those treatment effects, since IC anticipates the pension in period 2 by reducing labor
supply and increasing consumption in period 1. IC is only a valid comparison group when anticipation
effects are null in terms of both labor and consumption outcomes.

Thus, the theoretical model illustrates the potential effects of the program in a relatively
straightforward manner: the treatment effects on labor and consumption arise from the fact that the
pension transfer works as an exogenous increase in income which the beneficiary uses to consume
more of both types of goods. Anticipation effects exist whenever future participants in the program can
anticipate the future stream of earnings to finance current consumption and switch to non-paid work in
the home. The model also provides us with a reasonable guide for our empirical work by outlining the
equations that describe both types of effects.

3. Identification Strategy

The empirical challenge is to create the three types of groups described in our model. While we would
like to randomly assign eligible individuals to groups given their age, we are not able to do so because
the government rolled out the program for all eligible persons at the same time. Instead, we identify
plausible comparison groups from the program eligibility cutoffs across two dimensions: (1) age, as
people have to be at least 70 years old to take part in the program, and (2) geography, as people have
to live in communities with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants (SEDESOL, 2007). We then use the panel
structure of the data to control for unobserved heterogeneity.

     a. Treatment and Comparison Groups

Our design exploits these two dimensions as shown in Figure 1. We assign adults between 70 and 74
years of age at baseline in localities with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants to the Treatment Group and
adults between 66 and 69 years of age at baseline in the same localities to the Internal Control Group.12
Adults between the ages of 70 and 74 at baseline in non-treated localities are in the External Control

11
   If we posit a very high interest rate on loans, ceteris paribus, the assumption being that will not hold, so
we would have to differentiate between interest rates on loans and deposits.
12
   We attempted to keep this later group within a narrow age window near the cutoff point of eligibility to the
program benefits.

                                                                                                             7

We estimate the treatment effect by comparing the outcomes of TT with those of EC1. The people in
EC1 are the same age as those in TT and live in localities that are right above the population cutoff, so
they will not receive the transfer.13 Our particular group structure also allows us to determine the
nature of anticipation effects, if any, by comparing the outcomes of IC and EC2. While people in IC and
EC2 are of the same age, those in the IC group will receive the pension in the near future, whereas
those in the EC2 group will not.

     b. Unobserved Heterogeneity

An intuitive way of calculating the treatment effect would simply be to estimate the difference
between the average of the relevant indicator in the treatment group and the same average in the
control group. However, for this to be a consistent estimator of the parameter of interest, there should
be no difference between the characteristics of the two groups apart from their treatment status. The
analysis of the baseline survey, presented below, indicates that there are some non-negligible
differences between the treatment and external control groups – that is, the groups are not perfectly
balanced in some pre-treatment characteristics.

We use a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to control for these differences. Using DID, we can
compare the differences in changes in means between the two groups for the period between the
baseline and the follow-up survey. We estimate the DID regression models using the individual or
household as the unit of observation and conditioning on unit and year fixed effects. Specifically, in this
way, we control for individual and locality characteristics that are time invariant, as well as for secular
trends that are common to both treatment and comparison groups.

Specifically, we estimate the following empirical model:




13
  An alternative that other studies use is to rely on IC as the comparison group. However, in that case, a bias
could be generated by anticipation effects and by the nonlinear aging effects of the passage of time on both
groups.



                                                                                                             8
                                                                                                   (15)

where       is the outcomes for individual i living in locality j in year t,  is an individual fixed effect,
   is the year fixed effect, TTjt indicates treatment status and varies only by locality and year, and is
our parameter of interest, measuring the treatment effect of the pension program on the outcomes of
interest. To assess the sample variability of our estimates, we cluster the standard errors both at the
locality-year and locality level.

    c. Robustness Tests

The maintained assumption needed for this approach to yield consistent estimates of the causal
impacts of the intervention is that the changes observed in the treatment and control groups would
have been the same in the absence of the program. While this assumption is not directly testable, we
can test it indirectly by evaluating whether indicators that should not be affected by the intervention
change by the same amount in the treatment and comparison communities. We implement this test by
estimating versions of the DID specification in equation (15) with placebo outcomes.

We consider food prices and wages. On the one hand, the disbursement of pensions could have a
direct effect on prices and wages, e.g., the transfers could increase market demand for food, thereby
raising local market food prices (Angelucci and De Georgi, 2009; and Lehmann, 2013). On the other
hand, prices and wages could also change differentially between the treated and control areas if there
were differential secular trends other than equilibrium market effects induced by the program. We
provide empirical evidence that prices and wages do not correlate with the introduction of the
Assistance for Older Rural Adults Program in treatment communities, which therefore supports the
identifying assumption used in this study.

4. Data

    a. Sample

The data for our analysis come from two surveys that were carried out by the Mexican National Public
Health Institute) in the early stages of the program’s implementation (Instituto Nacional de Salud
Pública, 2007 and 2008). The first survey –which we will call the baseline survey– was carried out
between September and November 2007. This survey collected information on individuals and
households before the disbursement of cash transfers took place. The second –or follow-up survey–
was carried out between November and December 2008, once the program had been operating for
almost a year. Both surveys have a household module and a module for which the older adult was
interviewed individually. The data come from surveys that were collected in the states of Guerrero,
Querétaro, Michoacán, San Luis Potosí, Puebla, Veracruz and Hidalgo.

The surveys collected detailed information from female heads of household concerning household
demographic structure, household members’ labor activities and outcomes, and household
consumption. The surveys were also used to collect information directly from the older adults in the
relevant age range about their labor-market activities and mental health.

We measured mental health using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) developed by Sheikh and
Yesavage (1986). The index is based on a 15-item yes/no questionnaire that contains queries about
whether one feels satisfied with life, whether one is bored or lacks attention from other people,
whether one prefers to stay at home rather than going outside or feels full of energy, and so on. The


                                                                                                          9
answers to each question are then compared with those corresponding to a person with no trace of
depression. Each opposite answer is assigned a value of 1. The GDS score is simply the sum of the
points assigned to the answers, with a higher score reflecting the presence of more symptoms of
depression. See Table B1 in Appendix B for a full definition of all the variables used in this paper.

From the baseline survey, we retain in our sample the households with at least one adult between 66
and 74 years of age. We have at the baseline survey 3,792 individuals in that age range. From this
sample, we use data for persons for whom we observe all outcomes both in 2007 and 2008 so that we
can form a panel. Our final dataset contains a panel of 3,556 individuals for which we have complete
data on labor-market outcomes, out of which 168 live in a household with another person over 65
years of age. Our dataset includes complete data for both adults for 158 cases and for one of the two
adults for 10 cases. Thus, we have a total of 3,477 households in 463 localities.

Out of the 3,388 households with one adult, a shorter version of the questionnaire without a module
on expenditures was applied to 444 randomly chosen households in localities smaller than 2500
inhabitants to reduce survey costs and stay within the limited budget. Out of the 2,944 for which a
module on expenditures was applied, we have complete information on total expenditures on both
waves of the survey only for 2,873. Total expenditure is defined as the sum of food and non-food
expenditures by the household. Non-food expenditures include transportation, tobacco, cigarettes and
alcohol, newspapers and magazines, hygiene products, medicine, energy, home utensils, clothes,
expenditures on education and on social events.

    b. Descriptive Statistics

Tables 1 and 2 present descriptive statistics for the individuals and their households, respectively, for
the four groups described in Figure 1 using the 2007 baseline survey. Panel A reports the statistics for
the 70-74 age group, disaggregated by treatment and control locality, and Panel B reports the same
statistics for the 66-69 age group. There appears to be no difference in depression symptoms between
treatment and control localities for either age group. Persons in the older age group in treatment
localities are more likely to engage in household activities for no pay and have slightly more years of
schooling than their counterparts in the control localities. While the differences in individual
characteristics between treatment and control localities are small, households in the control localities
do appear to be wealthier in terms of both labor income and consumption.

5. Results

In this section first present our main findings and then the results of the robustness tests.

    a. Mental Health

The first row of Table 3 shows that the program has a significant negative effect in terms of the GDS
score – that is, treated individuals are less depressed than non-treated individuals. The average GDS
score for treated persons is 0.424 points less than the one for people in External Control Group 1 –a
decrease of 12%. As mentioned above, we present two standard errors for our point estimates. Within
parentheses, we report standard errors clustered at the locality-year level, while, within brackets, we
present standard errors clustered at the locality level. The effect is significant at conventional levels for
both approaches used to assess the sample variability of our point estimators. Table 3 also shows no
significant anticipation effects in terms of mental health. As a robustness check, we also estimate the
anticipation effect when excluding adults who were 69 years of age at baseline, which is a pertinent

                                                                                                          10
robustness check to this test since some of those individuals might have turned 70 between both
surveys. The results remain unchanged.

     b. Labor Supply

Table 3 also reports the results for participation in the labor market. The program does not appear to
have an effect on overall labor-force participation or hours worked, which remain stable at around 0.37
for participation and 14 hours worked per week. However, the program does have a significant effect
on the composition of work. The pension is associated with a reduction in paid work outside the house
and an increase in unpaid work on a family farm or in a family business. Specifically, the proportion of
individuals in paid work decreases by 18% in relation to the baseline level (from 0.23 to 0.18), while
unpaid work rises from 0.13 to 0.19 (a 48% increase from baseline levels). Similarly, the level of
substitution is also equal in terms of hours per week, as beneficiaries engaged in 2.6 fewer hours of
paid work and 2.2 more hours of unpaid work. All these substitution effects are statistically significant
at conventional levels. A similar pattern of behavior is seen for the anticipation effects, although it is
less pronounced for all these outcomes in relation to baseline levels and in most cases is not
statistically significant at conventional levels. In fact, if the group of persons of 69 years of age is
excluded from the analysis then none of the anticipation results are statistically robust.

     c. Household Income and Consumption

In Table 4 we present the estimates of treatment and anticipation effects for household labor income
and consumption expenditures per adult equivalent.14 Since we want to interpret the results on this
section through the lens of our theoretical model, and check that the changes in earnings and
consumption satisfy the change in the budget constraint of the households, we do not include the
analysis the households with two beneficiaries of the program.

Expenditure and labor income data is subject to large measurement errors. Therefore, before
conducting the analysis, we decided first to drop potential outliers. We compute the changes in total
consumption and labor income and drop the observations for which the absolute difference between
baseline and follow up values for either variable is at the top 5% of the corresponding distribution. We
end up with 2,577 households in the usable dataset. This induced attrition in the usable dataset (2,944
to the 2,577) does not correlate with treatment status and demographic baseline characteristics. It is
positively correlated with baseline household income, baseline household consumption and household
size. This suggest that the large changes in consumption and income discarded for the analysis are not
the result of the program and are potentially the result of large measurement errors among the
households at the top of the distribution (see Table B2 in Appendix B).

The results show that the program had a negative effect on household labor income per adult
equivalent of 34 pesos, which amounts to 17% of household labor income. Most of the effect vanishes
when the income of the treated adult is not considered. On the other hand, consumption increases by
63 pesos per adult equivalent in the treated households, which amounts to a 23% rise in consumption.
The reduction in income plus the increase in consumption is equivalent to about 97 pesos, which is very
close to --and not statistically different from (P-value = 0.80)-- the pension transfer amount per adult
equivalent of 89 pesos per month.15 Hence, 71% of the transfer is used for consumption and 28% is

14
   The adult equivalence scale weights each person older than 12 as 1 and those aged 12 or younger as 0.5.
15
   Our results are at odds with Juárez (2009) who examines the effect of public pension transfers on private
transfers by exploiting an increase in public pensions in Mexico City in 2001. She uses a set of repeated cross-
sections to estimate the effect of income on private transfers instrumented by a dummy representing pension

                                                                                                             11
taken in the form of increased leisure (reduced labor supply). We find no evidence of anticipation
effects either on labor earnings or on consumption.16

    d. Robustness Tests

In this section we test whether the trend in food prices and wages was different across treated and
control localities. We estimate DID regressions to test whether there is a treatment effect, i.e., do
wages or prices change over the study period at a different rate in treatment localities than in control
localities.

Using the sample of working people, we estimate the DID model in equation (16) for log wages of
people aged 18 - 65 (see Table B4 in Appendix B) and for people aged between 66 and 88 years (see
Table B5 in Appendix B). The individual fixed effects control for bias from the usual socio-demographics
included in wage regressions. We estimate separate models for males and females and a number of
specifications, including a single treatment effect and separate treatment effects by age and level of
education. Overall, there appear to be no changes in hourly wages as a result of the implementation of
the program.

We measure food prices at the locality level using the module on consumption expenses. We examine
both prices for individual food items and a price index where the weights are the average budget
shares for household consumption collected at baseline using a model similar to the one in equation
(15) but estimated with data aggregated to the locality level, and where individual fixed effects are
therefore replaced by locality fixed effects. Thus, we only present standard errors clustered at the
locality level. The results show that the program has no effect on prices, since by large there was no
difference in the change in prices between treatment and control localities over the study period (see
Table B6 in Appendix B).

The estimates for the price and wage equations rule out the possibility of equilibrium effects and other
differential secular trends in prices and wages that could have potentially invalidated the identification
assumptions underlying our econometric model. While these results do not completely eliminate the
potential sources of differential secular trends, they do provide substantial reassurance about the
validity of our identification strategy.




eligibility post 2001. Identification is driven off the cross-sectional difference in eligibility in Mexico City compared
to individuals outside Mexico City. Her analysis does not include either time fixed effects or location fixed effects.
She finds that a one-peso increase in the income from public pensions is associated with a reduction of private
transfers by 86 cents. In contrast, our results suggest that there is no crowding-out. Otherwise, the effect on
consumption and income would not add up to the pension transfer. One explanation for the difference maybe
that our sample is comprised of rural villages with less than 2500 inhabitants for which such transfers are
substantially smaller than the large urban population of 20 million inhabitants in Mexico City. In our sample, only
8% of households report a positive private transfer at baseline compared to 19% for the 70+ group in the sample
used by Juárez (2009). Unfortunately, our 2008 survey did not collect private transfer information.
16
   These results are robust to including the few households with two treated adults. The results are also robust to
only excluding the 1% top of the distribution of the changes in total consumption and labor income (see Table B3
in Appendix B). Though the point estimates are somewhat larger, and the drop in household income is statistically
significant, qualitatively, the results are not different. We still find that the reduction in income plus the increase
in consumption is not statistically different from 89 pesos -the pension transfer amount per adult equivalent per
month- (P-value = 0.15).

                                                                                                                      12
7. Conclusions

In many developing countries, the recent large increase in life expectancy has resulted in large
increases in poverty among the elderly. Until recently, countries relied on traditional contributory
pension schemes to cater for the needs of people upon retirement. However, high levels of labor
market informality have limited the effectiveness of these systems as a means of providing adequately
for older adults. Faced with rising poverty among the elderly and the inadequacy of contributory
pension systems, countries such as South Africa, Brazil and Mexico have adopted non-contributory
pension schemes in an effort to extend coverage to all members of their older population. Although
very popular, these non-contributory plans have received little attention from empirical economists.

Our paper is one of the first to provide conclusive, comprehensive evidence about the effect of these
schemes in terms of various outcomes in the case of Mexico. We first sketched out a theoretical
framework to guide our analysis using a model that allows for possible anticipation effects in response
to future benefits. The model predicts a shift from paid formal work to unpaid informal work and an
increase in consumption. The model also identifies early reductions in participation in the labor force
and increased consumption (lower savings) in anticipation of future benefits, depending on the ability
to borrow. The anticipation effects disappear in the presence of liquidity and credit constraints. We use
a quasi-experimental design that relies on the exogeneity of the age and geographical eligibility
requirements to which we applied the DID analysis. We interpret our results in light of our simple
theoretical framework.

Our results are encouraging in a number of different ways. Most importantly, mental health appears to
improve substantially, as is indicated by the 12% decrease in the group’s score on the Geriatric
Depression Scale. This result should not be taken lightly, since good mental health helps to improve
happiness and is a key determinant of overall well-being. The program also appears to be effective in
allowing older poor people to exit the formal labor market; it should be noted, however, that they did
not completely retire but instead continued to work in the delivery of unpaid services on family farms
or in family businesses. We find that 71% of the pension was used to finance an increase in household
consumption of about 23%. However, family labor earnings fell, which indicates that 38% of the
pension was used to offset reductions in labor earnings. Finally, we find no evidence of anticipation
effects in respect of labor earnings or consumption, which makes sense in view of the lack of liquidity
and the credit constraints existing in rural Mexico.

Overall, the results are very positive, since the program appears to lead to a substantial improvement
in the material and psychological living standards of older people residing in rural areas. Moreover, the
absence of notable anticipation effects suggests that the equilibrium costs of the policy may not be so
sizeable. Thus, the program appears to be an effective tool for improving the living conditions of older
people who are living in poverty.

Notes: Row represent different dependent variable in a regression model. The first column reports the
difference-in-difference estimated effects of treatment (i.e. pension) on the dependent variable from a
regression that also controls for individual fixed effects and year fixed effects using the data from the T
and EC2 groups. The second and third columns reports the difference-in-difference estimated effects of
treatment on the dependent variable from a regression that also controls for individual fixed effects and
year fixed effects using data from the IC and EC1 groups. Standard errors clustered at the locality-year
level in parenthesis. Standard errors clustered at the locality level in brackets. *, **, *** indicate that the
estimates coefficient is significantly statistically different from zero at the 0.10, 0.05 and 0.01 level,
respectively.

Appendix A: Generalized Model

In this appendix we present the model that we have used while relaxing the assumption that
             and show that the model’s predictions still hold. In this case, the solution to the
first-order conditions (1) – (3) is:



                                (               )                                            [       ]
                                                        (            )       (       )



                                    (               )                                    [       ]
                                                                         (       )


                                                (                    )
                                                (                   )        (       )


Then the treatment and anticipation effects are:


                                        (           )(          )
                                            (         )
                                                                                                         (A1)


                                            (               )
                                        (               )
                                                                                                         (A2)


Again, the treatment (A1) and anticipation (A2) effects are negative, and the anticipation effect
is smaller the higher interest rates are.




                                                                                                          21

 Notes: The Price of each food item is calculated as the median of expenditures reported over
 quantities reported by households. Municipality-year median of a given item is imputed to
 localities that do not report expenditure in a given item. The price index is a weighted average of
 items for which at least 500 localities report prices in both years. A locality is said to have
 reported price if at least one household reported price. Weights are defined as average shares
 among households of expenditure on a given item over the expenditure on the items included in
 the index in 2007. Standard errors clustered at the locality level. *, **, *** Indicate that the
 estimates coefficient is significantly statistically different from zero at the 0.10, 0.05 and 0.01
 levels, respectively.
