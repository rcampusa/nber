                                             ABSTRACT



        This paper estimates the NAIRU (standing for the ~on-~ccelerating             Inflation Rate of

unemployment)      as a parameter that varies over time. The NAIRU is the unemployment         rate that

is consistent with a constant rate of inflation.   Its value is determined in an econometric model in

which the inflation rate depends on its own past values (“inertia”), demand shocks proxied by the

difference between the actual unemployment         rate and the estimated NAIRU, and a set of supply

shock variables.

        The estimated NAIRU for the U.S. economy differs somewhat for alternative measures of

the inflation rate. The NAIRU estimated for the GDP deflator varies over the past forty years within

the narrow range of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; its estimated value for the most recent quarter(1996:Q1)      is

5.7 percent. In that quarter a lower NAIRU of 5.3 percent is obtained for the chain-weighted       PCE

deflator. Recent research claiming that there is a three-percentage-point    range of uncertainty about

the NAIRU is rejected as inconsistent with the behavior of the American economy in the late 1980s

and early 1990s.

          The relationship      between inflation     and unemployment         is central to the conduct      of

monetary      policy.   More than 35 years ago Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow (1960) coined

the term “Phillips curve” at the 1959 AEA meetings, reacting promptly                  to the publication     of

Phillips’s seminal (1958) article.         A few years later Milton Friedman        (1968) coined the term

“natural rate of unemployment,”           which more recently has come to be known by the familiar

acronym      “NAIRU,” standing for the ~on-&ccelerating             ~nflation Bate of ~nemployment.              If

at any given time there exists a unique NAIRU, then the Phillips curve tradeoff                      is vertical

at that unemployment         rate. The Fed cannot make the actual unemployment               rate differ from

the NAIRU in the long run, but it can maintain                a stable rate of inflation    if it succeeds in

setting the actual unemployment           rate equal to the NAIRU.       If instead of maintaining     a stable

rate of inflation,      the Fed desires to reduce the inflation          rate toward    zero or some other

target, then it needs to keep the actual unemployment                rate above the NAIRU.       Either way,

whether     the goal is steady inflation      or lower inflation,    the Fed needs to know the value of

the NAIRU.

          The NAIRU is not carved in stone.          In Friedman’s      (1968) interpretation,   the NAIRU

is “ground out” by the set of ‘Walrasian” macroeconomic              relations in the economy,       including

the structure    and institutions     of product    and labor markets, and any of these relations           can

change.     There is a perception      that much about the economy has changed in the 1990s, and

if so the NAIRU has doubtless            changed   as well.   Indeed,    as we shall see, the NAIRU has

exhibited    pronounced      cycles over the postwar      period,    albeit within a surprisingly      narrow

range.

          The Fed acts as if it already accepts the fact that the NMRU                  can move and has

adapted     policy procedures       that implicitly incorporate     new information     to update previous
                                                                  The Time-Varying      NAIRU, Page 2




estimates of the NAIRU.          Whereas in early 1994 it implicitly believed that the NAIRU was

around    6.0 percent and sharply raised short-term           interest rates when it correctly predicted

that the actual unemployment            rate was about to fall below 6.0 percent,      for most of 1995

and early 1996 it allowed short-term          interest rates to drift down slightly when inflation     did

not accelerate in response        to an average unemployment         rate well below 6.0 percent.1

          For many years it was reasonable        to assume that the NAIRU was 6.0 percent,          and I

tested that assumption        repeatedly   by running     dynamic simulations   of regression   equations

that predict   the value of the inflation        rate. 2 Because these simulations      were capable    of

tracking the inflation     rate accurately for many years after the end of the regression         sample

period,   e.g., 1987-94,      without   any appreciable    drift, I had submitted   the accuracy of such

post-sample    simulations     as evidence that the NAIRU was still 6.0 percent.         The substantial

acceleration   of inflation    that occurred in 1988-89,      when the unemployment       rate fell below

6.0 percent for a period of three years, is consistent          with the view that the NAIRU was at

6.0 percent or above as recently as 1988-89.




        1. Even though the actual unemployment rate averaged 5.6 percent in the 21 months ending
in May, 1996, below the Fed’s previous NAIRU estimate of 6.0 percent, the inflation rate did not
accelerate. Indeed, one key measure of inflation, the personal consumption deflator (on the new
chain-weighted basis) decelerated. The implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures
on the new chain-weighted basis rose 2.7 percent in 1992, 2.6 percent in 1993, 2.4 percent in 1994,
2.4 percent in 1995, and only 1.9 percent in the four quarters ending in 1996:Q1.

         2. The inflation equation was developed in a series of papers, including Gordon (1970,
1975, 1977a, and 1982b).       King-Watson (1994) have called this approach the “Gordon-Solow
model,” citing the first of my papers and Solow’s 1969 book. In order to determine whether the
inflation relationship has changed, I have maintained unchanged the set of variables, lag lengths, and
other features of the equation introduced in Gordon (1982b) and Gordon-King (1982). The most
recent assessments of the performance of this equation are contiined in Gordon (1990a, 1994).
                                                                The Time-Varying         NAIRU, Page 3




            However,   numerous      factors have changed    since 1988-89      in a way that may have

reduced      the NAIRU, and indeed         the absence of an acceleration       of inflation    in 1995-96

suggests that the NAIRU may well have fallen below 6.0 percent.                  Labor unions are weak

and their penetration       in the labor force continues      to decline.    Manufacturers        have been

under intense pressure from consumers            and foreign competitors     to restrain price increases.

The rest of the industrial         world has experienced     a sluggish recovery,     and there is ample

foreign capacity to provide supplies to U. S. manufacturers.           Business executives are quoted

as arguing that the economy          has changed drastically in the last ten years.    General Electric’s

John F. Welch Jr. recently stated that ‘There is no inflation          . . . there is no pricing power

at all” (Stevenson,     1996).


The “Quiescence” of Phillips Curve Research

            Has the NAIRU declined?        If so, from what level a decade ago to what level today?

Surprisingly,     macroeconomists      have thus far provided    no answer to this question         that can

be taken “off the shelf’ by policymakers          who need to know the answer.           For remarkably

little research     has been conducted       on the U. S. inflation   process    in the past decade,       in

contrast to feverish research activity in the 1960s and 1970s.         King-Watson      (1994) comment

on the “quiescence” of the field.          One explanation    of this void is that the U. S. inflation

process is so stable, and the models developed           in the early 1980s work so well, that there

have been no behavioral          mysteries to solve.   In the words of King and Watson,          “Keynesian

economists”       have continued     to view the Phillips curve as an essentially        intact structural

relation,    once the original econometric       models of the 1960s were amended              “to represent
                                                                         The Time-Varying          NAIRU, Page 4




supply shocks and build in a zero long-run                  tradeoff” (1994, p. 160).         Once this task had

been accomplished          (as in Gordon,        1977), there was no further agenda warranting             continued

research,      except periodically         checking   that the relation     remained   stable, and indeed          “the

remarkable       feature of the Phillips curve in the post war period was its stability” (Watson-

King, 1994, p. 160).

           In this interpretation,       macroeconomics        has split into two camps.          Across the street

from the Keynesians are the “neoclassical and monetarist                   economists, ” They (notably Lucas-

Sargent 1978) dismissed           the Phillips curve as “econometric           failure on a grand scale,” since

the long-run         negative   correlation      between   inflation    and unemployment          predicted     by the

models of the late 1960s contrasted               with the distinctly positive correlation        in the data of the

1970s.      At that point neoclassical economists           stopped paying attention        to empirical work on

the Phillips correlation        and did not notice,         much less take seriously,       the resurrection       of a

new breed        of post-1975        Phillips    curve estimates       that incorporated     a vertical       long-run

tradeoff     and included       supply-shock       variables that allowed      the model to generate           either a

negative or positive correlation           between inflation and unemployment,             depending    on whether

the economy          was subjected to demand          or supply shocks.

           Instead    of taking      inflation    as the variable       to be determined       by their       models,

neoclassical     economists       turned      to real theories     of aggregate    fluctuations      in which       the

behavior of inflation was neither explored              nor explained.      While real output was determined

by the set of behavioral          equations      in the model (whether        of the Lucas “surprise” or real-

business-cycle       variety), the determination        of the price levei was left unspecified.          Implicitly,
                                                                  The Time-Varying         NAIRU, Page 5




the price level was left as a residual, i.e., as the level of nominal          GDP (in turn often equal

to the money supply plus a stochastic error term) divided by whatever level of real GDP was

determined      by the model.     This treatment     was the diametric   opposite     to that implied in the

Phillips curve approach,        in which an equation      is specified to determine      the inflation    rate,

while the growth rate of real GDP is implicitly a residual equal to the rate of nominal                  GDP

growth     minus the rate of inflation.


Agenda for this Paper

         The NAIRU is defined           as the unemployment       rate consistent     with steady inflation

under a specified set of conditions.         It is meaningful   only within a well-specified        model of

the inflation    process.    This paper begins by describing       the mainstream       “triangle model” of

the inflation    process that incorporated      and resurrected    the Phillips curve from what Lucas

and Sargent (1978) had called the “wreckage” of the early and mid 1970s.                     We define the

NAIRU in terms of this model and examine                 both what the model includes            (e.g., supply

shocks and rate of change effects) and what it excludes             (any explicit role for expectations

or wages).

         Then, instead of simply assuming a value for the NAIRU and testing the validity of

that assumed      value in dynamic        post-sample    simulations,    this paper     adapts    an explicit

econometric      technique     that allows a time-varying       NAIRU     to be esti~ted.          We show

intituitively   why some previous authors, notably Staiger et. al. (1996), have found estimates

of the NAIRU to be highly imprecise,          and we propose a simple criterion          to clear the cloud

of ambiguity      which     surrounds   the topic.    We emerge with a set of alternative             NAIRU
                                                                       The Time-Varying       NAIRU, Page 6




estimates for the 1955-96        period which differ only moderately            from each other depending

on which inflation       measure, specification,        and sample period is used.

          As we shall see, the most interesting          differences    among the proposed          NAIRU series

for the current period relate to the contrasting           behavior of alternative      price indexes, and we

suggest that the Fed needs to decide which inflation                 index it is trying to stabilize, e.g., the

GDP deflator, the deflator for Personal Consumption                  Expenditures     (PCE), or the Consumer

Price Index.      After we identify the alternative       NAIRU series, we then use preferred             versions

of the inflation equation to compute dynamic simulations                 of the inflation rate in future years

on the assumption        of alternative       paths for the actual unemployment             rate.     The paper

concludes    by examining      implications     for the past, current, and future conduct            of monetary

policy.

          Several important    topics lie outside of the research agenda in this paper.                 First, it is

entirely concerned      with the inflation       process in the United States and does not treat the

quite different     behavior   of inflation     and unemployment          in Europe    or Japan.      Second,     it

estimates the time-varying       NAIRU within the context of the “triangle” model of the inflation

process developed       in my previous        work; it does not develop        such a model from scratch.

Third, it asks which unemployment             rate should be the Fed’s target but does not inquire into

the methods by which the Fed should attempt to accomplish                   that goal, i.e., it does not study

the channels       of monetary     policy     that    link changes     in the short-term     interest     rate to

subsequent     lagged responses    of output,        income, employment,       and unemployment.

          To preview the main conclusions,            at any given time there is a NAIRU for the U. S,
                                                                          The Time-Varying           NAIRU, Page 7




economy.        Our alternative     NAIRU estimates differ moderately                    among among       themselves

regarding      the exact fevel of the 1996 NAIRU, depending                       primarily   on the inflation     index

to be used. The alternative        estimates all support the conclusion               that the NAIRU has declined

substantially    since 1988-89,      opening    up the opportunity                for the Fed to maintain        a lower

unemployment        rate than was feasible then.             Further,     the time-varying       NAIRU provides             a

marginally better explanation         of inflation behavior in the 1990s than the previously assumed

fixed NAIRU of 6.0 percent.



The “Triangle” Model of Inflation

         The “Phillips curve” has become a generic term for any relationship                        between the rate

of change of a nominal price or wage and the fevel of a real indicator                            of the intensity     of

demand      in the economy,       such as the unemployment                rate.     Long ago, the simple Phillips

relation was amended        by incorporating       supply shocks and a zero long-run                tradeoff.3    What

emerged     was an interpretation       of the Phillips curve that I have called the “triangle” model

of inflation     — a label summarizing         the dependence           of the inflation      rate on a tripartite    set

of basic determinants:       inertia, demand,           and supply.

         In this framework        a general specification       for the rate of price change (p,) is:



         Pt = a(L)p~.l + b(L)D~ + c(L)z~ + et.                                                                        (1)


Here   lower-case      letters    designate     first     differences      of logarithms,         upper-case      letters



       3. Schultze (1975) and Gordon (1975) introduced explicit variables to isolate the effect of
food and energy prices and price controls on the U. S. inflation rate.
                                                                 The Time-Varying       NAIRU, Page 8




designate logarithms       of levels, L is a polynomial   in the lag operator,   D, is an index of excess

demand       (normalized    so that D,=O indicates the absence of excess demand), z, is a vector of

supply shock variables (normalized         so that Zt =0 indicates an absence of supply shocks), and

et is a serially uncorrelated    error term.     The “triangle” rubric is associated with the three sets

of basic determinants,       respectively “inertia” (i.e., the influence of the lagged inflation   terms),

demand       (the D, terms), and supply (the z, terms).

           If the sum of coefficients    on lagged inflation equals uni~     (Z ~ = 1), then there is a

“natural rate” of the demand         variable (Wt ) consistent     with a constant    rate of inflation.

While the estimated        sum of coefficients   on lagged inflation   is usually roughly equal to unity

(see Tables 1-3 below), that sum must be constrained             to be erectly   unity for a meaningful

natural rate of the demand variable to be calculated from (1).            Among the demand variables

that have been entered as proxies for D~ are the “output gap” (log ratio of actual to natural

or potential     real GDP), the “unemployment        gap” (difference between the actual and natural

rate of unemployment         — or NAIRU), and the rate of capacity utilization.

           As written in (1) the model is incomplete,      even if the supply shock variables (z,) are

exogenous,      since there are two endogenous       variables, the inflation rate (PI) and the demand

variable (D~). The model can be closed with one or more equations                specifying the demand

process.      The simplest    approach    defines D, as the log output       ratio (R, = /n&l ~,     )) or

“output     gap,” treats as exogenous      the growth     rate of nominal    GDP in excess of natural

output growth (“excess nominal GDP growth”), and closes the model with a second equation

which is simply an identity        relating the change in the output        gap to inflation   and excess

nominal GDP growth.           This identity, used in one form or another in many macroeconomics

textbooks,   states that the change in the output gap equals the growth rate in nominal                      GDP

(x,) relative to natural output growth              (y’,), minus the inflation        rate:


                 R, - R,.l    = xt-y*t      -pt.                                                               (2)


The model consisting         of (1) and (2) has two equations                in two unknowns,    & and p,.    The

exogenous       demand       shock    variable      is excess      nominal     GDP     growth   (xi - y*, ), the

exogenous    supply shock variable is the vector Z1, an d the lagged elements pf.l and &.l are

predetermined        in previous time periods.


Interpretations       of the NAIRU

        In this paper we are interested            in estimating    the NAIRU, i.e., the unemployment         rate

that is consistent     with steady inflation.        The equations      estimated     in this paper are identical

to (1) with the unemployment            gap substituted      for Dt:



        Pt = a(L)pt.l + b(L) Wt-wt ) + c(L)zt + et,                                                            (3)


where   the unemployment             gap is the difference         between      the actual unemployment       rate

and the time-varying         NAIRU      @t-U~t ).      If excess nominal         GDP growth     is again taken as

exogenous,    the model can be closed by adding two equations,                       one of which is (2) above,

and the other of which is an “Okun’s Law” equation                       relating    the unemployment     gap to
                                                                       The Time-Varying           NAIRU, Page 10




the output     gap.4

         The NAIRU,            or alternatively     the “natural rate of unemployment,”               is simply   that

unemployment            rate which     is consistent     with     steady      (nonaccelerating      or decelerating)

inflation.     The structure         of (3) suggests     wo     alternative     concepts   of the NAIRU.          The

standard     version is the “no-supply-shock”            NAIRU, that is, the unemployment              rate which is

consistent     with steady inflation          in the absence of supply shocks. This is the NAIRU that

emerges from the estimation             of (3) with the z, “supply shock” variables included              to control

for the influence of supply shocks.               For example, if the inflation rate has been steady in the

recent past, but then suddenly exhibits a “spike” that is entirely explained                     by the Zj variables,

the current     unemployment           rate is the “no-supply-shock           NAIRU” that is compatible           with

steady inflation       in the absence of supply shocks.            An alternative     unqualified    NAIRU would

increase sharply in response            to an adverse supply shock by the estimated                  amount    of the

shock [c(L)zJ divided by the sum of the b coefficients.

         By taking excess nominal GDP growth as exogenous,                       the triangle model allows us to

focus   on     the    inflation     process    without    the distraction        of building      a model     of the

determinants         of aggregate    demand.        Admittedly,     this simplification     sweeps two-thirds       of

macroeconomics           under the rug, And it ignores channels by which inflation                   feeds back into

the determination         of nominal GDP, which may cause econometric                  bias in inflation equations


        4. Using the symbols in the text, an Okun’s law equation that closes the model would be:

                     U, - ~,   = O(L)& + c,.

Empirically the sum of the 8 coefficients has been around -0.5 for most of the postwar period,
although in the 1990-95 subinterval that sum has been close to -1.0.

in which        nominal    GDP     appears    directly    an an explanatory      variable.      As a general

proposition,      in the presence of contemporaneous           feedback from inflation to nominal           GDP

and of supply shocks that are imperfectly            measured,    estimates of the triangle-type      inflation

equation      (1) that use nominal        GDP as a proxy for the demand          (D~) variable will yield a

coefficient     on nominal        GDP which is biased away from zero.             Alternatively,     using the

output gap or unemployment            gap as a proxy for the demand variable will yield a coefficient

which      is biased toward       zero,     The more     accurately   the influence    of supply     shocks    is

measured,       the smaller    the bias.5      In their     consideration     of the   endogeneity         of the

unemployment         rate in an inflation    equation    like (2), King-Watson    support     the inclusion    of

unemployment         by finding     that unemployment        Granger-causes    inflation,    but they do not

consider      the issue of bias in the coefficient       on the unemployment      variable in the presence

of imperfectly      measured   supply shocks.G

        In general, supply shocks create an omitted variable problem in the traditional                Phillips

curve specification       that includes only lagged inflation         and the unemployment         gap.’     One



        5. Formal measures of the bias are developed in Gordon (1990b, Table 1, p. 1121).

       6. “More specifically, in a reduced form vector autoregression, past unemployment is
important for predicting current inflation but past inflation contains little information about current
unemployment” (King-Watson, 1994, p. 161).

        7. While early work on the Phillips curve focussed on wage behavior, and required a “mark-
up” equation to relate inflation to wage changes, it has proven more useful since the mid-1970s to
estimate a reduced-form equation in which inflation is directly related to unemployment, thus
eliminating the need to be concerned with the two-way links between wages and prices. A complete
set of wage equations for both the U. S, and for Germany, estimated with the same specification as
in this paper, can be found in Franz-Gordon (1993). That paper determined that the U. S. wage
NAIRU for 1990 was 6.2 percent, almost exactly the same as estimated in this paper for the GDP
deflator by the time-varying approach described below.
                                                                      The Tim~Varying       NAIRU, Page 12




expects inflation     to be negatively related to unemployment,               but if supply shocks create an

extraneous    positive     correlation     between       inflation    and unemployment       and   no e~licit

variables are inclu&d to proxy for the influence of supply shock,                    then the coefficient   on

unemployment        will be biased toward zero, and the resulting              equation   is likely to produce

unreliable   predictions    in periods when supply shocks are absent.


Rate of Change Effects

        In previous      research I have found that wage and price change depend                   on both the

level and change in the demand variable, i.e., the output gap or unemployment                       gap.a The

role of the change effect is automatically           allowed         to enter as long as the gap variable is

entered with more than one lag. For instance, if the gap variable is entered as the current

value and one lagged value and the coefficients are estimated as -0.5 and +0.3, respectively,

then this is identically     equal to an equation         in which the current level and current change

of the gap are entered       separately,    with respective coefficients       of -0.2 and -0.3.    In light of

the high statistical significance of the change effect in the results discussed below, time-series

equations    that do not allow for the change                effect (either by entering     it directly   or by

allowing the level of the gap to enter with one or more lags) are misspecified.                    The change

effect is particularly     important     in explaining      macroeconomic      price behavior   in the 1930s,

a result that I have found previously          and that Romer (1996) has recently substantiated.




        8. I first noted the importance of the rate-of-change effect in Gordon (1977a, pp. 270-1).

Missing Eiements:              Expectations          and Wages

         The original         Phillips   article     was about        the relation     between    wage changes       and

unemployment.         bter,     expected inflation was added and we had the “expectational                      Phillips

curve. ” But the triangle model as summarized                         above has no expectations        and no wages.

These are issues of substantive            significance.

         The omission of expectations                is deliberate.      Much attention      was diverted    in the late

1960s and early 1970s             to the interpretation          of the lagged effect of prices on wages as

reflecting    adaptive   lags in the formation            of expectations.          Since then we have learned that

price and wage inertia             is compatible         with rational      expectations.        The speed     of price

adjustment      and the speed of expectation               formation      are two total] y different      issues.   Price

adjustment      can be delayed by wage and price contracts,                        and by the time needed for cost

increases      to percolate       through      the      input-output       ~bie,     and   yet everyone      can    form

expectations      promptly      and rationally        based on full information            about the aggregate      price

level.   The role of the lagged inflation                terms in (1) and (3) is to capture         the dynamics       of

inertia, whether     related to expectation             formation,     contracts,    delivery lags, or anything     else.

         As important     as the omission of expectations                 is the omission of wages in the triangle

model.       The earlier fixation        on wages was a mistake.             The relationship     of prices to wages

has changed over time and is not well described by a constant                          markup equation      of the type

used in the eariy Phillips-curve          literature.      Labor’s share in national income exhibits a strong

upward       movement    be~een          the mid-1960s        and early 1970s that has not been adequately

explained.       The Fed’s goal is to control               inflation,     not wage growth,        and models       with
                                                                       The TimeVarying         NAIRU, Page 14




separate wage growth and price markup equations                      do not perform as well as equations          like

(1) and (2) above in which wages are implicitly                      solved out and only a reduced          form is

estimated.       By treating the relationship         of inflation    to unemployment,       rather than of wage

change to unemployment,               the triangle approach      returns   to the framework         of the original

Samuelson        and Solow article (1960) that coined the term “Phillips curve” and plotted U. S.

data on the inflation-unemployment                  quadrant.    The earliest credit for ignoring          wages is

claimed by Irving Fisher (1926), whose neglected article discovered                    the Phiilips curve in the

form of a relationship        between the unemployment           rate and price changes, not wage changes.




implications        of the Triangie Model

          Whether       the unemployment        gap or some other demand variable enters an equation

like (1) or (3) determining          the inflation rate, this equation,    together with the assumption          that

nominal        GDP is exogenous        as in (2), generates several clear implications.

          1.    In the long run inflation           is “always and everywhere        an excess nominal           GDP

phenomenon.”            To control     inflation,   policy needs a nominal         anchor,   most plausibly       the

excess growth           of nominal     GDP itself.      Targeting      the no-supply-shock      NAIRU,       or the

equivalent      level of “natural” or “potentiai” real GDP, will lead to accelerating                inflation   in a

decade like the 1970s when supply shocks are significant,                    serially correlated,     and positive

(i.e., adverse).

          2.    There     is no special connection       between      the growth    in the money supply and

inflation;     any effect of money growth on inflation is shared by an identical effect of velocity
                                                                     The Time-Varying             NAIRU, Page 15




growth    on inflation.

         3.   In the short run, fluctuations         in excess nominal         GDP growth         lead to clockwise

loops on a diagram plotting           inflation against the unemployment             gap. The loops come from

inertia, i.e., the role of the lagged dependent          variable in equation        (3) in slowing the response

of the inflation    rate to a change in the unemployment                gap.

         4.     Supply     shocks    can cause a positive          correlation      between       inflation    and   the

unemployment        gap.    The observation        that the Phillips curve correlation            between     inflation

and unemployment           was positive rather than negative in the 1970s is consistent                       with the

triangle model, due to its explicit treatment            of supply shocks like the rise in oil prices.

         5. The triangle model is resolutely            Keynesian.      Prices are prevented           by inertia and

by the finite Phillips curve adjustment            coefficient    (b) from mimicking          changes in nominal

GDP growth.         With excess nominal            GDP growth       treated      as exogenous,       the output      and

unemployment        gaps are determined        as a residual.       However,       the triangle model does not

incorporate     the implication       that King-Watson       (1994) attribute        to their “Keynesian” straw

man that “unemployment              is dominated    by aggregate demand            disturbances.”       Instead, ktb

demand and supply shocks influence both the inflation rate and the unemployment                               rate. For

any given level of excess nominal           GDP growth,          an adverse supply shock (e.g., an increase

in oil prices) raises the inflation       rate, reduces the output gap, and raises the unemployment

gap.

         What    theoretical    story is consistent     with the mainstream            triangle     model?      Agents

implicitly are price setters and demand takers. Although the Patinkin-Clower                          disequilibrium
                                                                     The TimeVarying            NAIRU, Page 16




framework,       as developed     by Barre-Grossman           (1976) and others,       has no model       of price

setting, it is the right model of quantity determination              given whatever sources of inertia and

finite Phillips slopes prevent prices from clearing markets.                Agents are pushed off notional

supply and demand           curves by constraints       that spill over from rationed         markets.    Today’s

macroeconomists        tend to brush off the disequilibrium            framework     because it has no theory

of price determination,        while forgetting    that it has the right theory of output determination.


Validation of the Triangle Modei

          The triangle      model may be unique in that its textbook              version came first, and the

econometrics      and theory came after that.           The textbooks    were published       in 1978; the basic

equations were set out in 1976.9 The econometric                  version, developed    in the late 1970s, was

validated      in 1981-87      when     the sacrifice     ratio   experienced     by the economy         (i.e., the

percentage      loss in output        associated   with    the deceleration      of inflation     that occurred)

corresponded       almost     exactly    to what    had been predicted           in advance     on the basis of

parameters      estimated     through     the end of 1980.10          Versions    of the equation        estimated

through     1987 in post-sample         dynamic simulations        tracked quite precisely the acceleration

of inflation    observed in 1987-90        and the deceleration      of inflation that occurred in 1990-93.



        9. See Gordon (1977b), a paper presented at the AEA meetings in October, 1976.            A
diagrammatic version originated in a classroom handout that Rudiger Dornbusch developed at the
Chicago Business School in early 1975. Both my version and that of Dornbusch combined a Phillips
curve, long-run neutrality, a nominal GDP identity like (2), and a role for exogenous supply shocks.

        10.      Gordon-King (1982, Table 5, line 3) computed a sacrifice ratio of 6.2 from their
econometric      version of the triangle model. Using the data avaiiable at the time, the cumulative
deviation of    actuai from potential output during the period 1980-87 was 26.2 percent and inflation
was reduced     by 4.1 percentage points from 1979-80 to 1985-86, for an actual sacrifice ratio of 6.4.

         The positive       performance      of the triangle         model   stands in sharp contrast            to the

shambles in which the Phillips curve literature found itself in the mid-1970s.                        A central point

of departure      for Lucas’s new classical revolution         was the failure of the 1960s Phillips curve.

In the language of Lucas and Sargent (1978, pp. 49-50), “that these predictions                          were wildly

incorrect,      and that the doctrine on which they were based is fundamentally                      flawed, are now

[is] that of sorting through         the wreackage.     . . of that remarkable       intellectual    event called the

Keynesian Revolution.”           The triangle model was in print in its present form before Lucas and

Sargent wrote those lines; it has survived and thrived,                  while empirical attempts          by Robert

Barro (1978) and others to valididate             the new classical policy ineffectiveness               proposition

failed, running        aground   on the bedrock       of inflation    inertia.



Estimating         a   Time-varying NAIRU

         For almost       two decades      a time series for the NAIRU has been published                        in my

macroeconomics           textbook.     My NAIRU series increases                 from the 1950s       to the 1970s,

following       George    Perry’s (1970) innovation         by using a demographic              adjustment       to the

unemployment           rate to reflect the rising share of teenagers and females in the labor force

during that era. However,            when in the late 1980s (Gordon,               1990) I tested to see whether

the demographic          reversal of the 1980s (notably a reduced                share of teenagers     in the labor

force)   had reduced         the NAIRU       accordingly,     I found        that it had      not.     Without     any

justification    other than its empirical performance,          I arbitrarily set the textbook NAIRU equal

to 6.0 percent         for the entire period     after 1978.         The NAIRU series that combines                 the
                                                                       The Time-Varying          NAIRU, Page 18




demographic        adjustment     through     1978 with an assumption          that the NAIRU is conswnt              at

6.0 percent thereafter        is henceforth     called the “textbook NAIRU series.” This paper assesses

the relative      performance      of the textbook        NAIRU series and an alternative              time-varying

(’W’) NAIRU series that bases changes in the NAIRU on time-varying                          parameter       estimates.


Form of the Inflation Equation

       The estimation         of the TV-NAIRU combines the above inflation equation                    (3), repeated

here, with an explicit specification           of the TV-NAIRU:



       p,     =    a(~)p,.1 + b(L)(u,-@, ) +         c(L)z,    + e,,                                                (3)

           w,= UN,.,+ Et.                                                                                           (4)


In (3) the error term ●, is iid with a mean of zero and a standard                     deviation     of o..     When

the standard      deviation     o, = O, then ~t         is constant.     When a= # O, the model allows the

NAIRU to vary by an amount                 E, each quarter.       If no limit were placed on the ability of

UNt to vary each time period,              then the TV-NAIRU           would be free to jump up and down

and soak up all the residual           variation    in the inflation      equation.    The model           (3)-(4) is a

standard     “stochastic time-varying         parameter     regression    model” that can be estimated           using

Gaussian      maximum         likelihood      methods      as described     by Hamilton          (1994).       It was

previously     applied     to the issue of the NAIRU,            using a very different         version    of (3), by

King, Stock, and Watson           (1995) and Staiger, Stock, and Watson               (1996).

       The following          are the key elements         of the inflation    equation     (3), as developed         in

previous papers.         The sample period is 1955:2-1996:1,             or 164 quarters.       All right-hand-side

variables are allowed to enter with unconstrained           distributed   lags.    Lag lengths are chosen

to be identical to those in Gordon       (1990).11 Note that with a sum of a(L) coefficients         equal

to unity, inflation     remains constant      in a steady state with the unemployment          rate at the

NAIRU ~, - ~,         =0) and with supply shocks absent (z,= O). Supply shock variables include

changes      in the relative   price of imports,    the change    in the relative      price of food and

energy, 12and the change in the real effective foreign exchange rate.13 Dummy variables are

included     for the “on” and “off’ effects of the Nixon price controls.          These dummy variables,

and indeed all the other variables, are defined exactly the same as in all my papers starting

with (1982 b).      Also included    is the difference   between productivity       growth and its trend,

reflecting    the fact that, while most of any cyclical increase or decrease in productivity              is

reflected    in a movement       in profits   in the same direction,      a small fraction    remains    to




         11. The only smoothing structure imposed on the lag distributions involves the lagged
dependent variable, where 24 lagged terms enter. Rather than estimating 24 unconstrained
coefficients, the lagged dependent variable is entered as a series of four-quarter moving averages of
rates of change, e.g., the first variable is a four-quarter average of lags t-1 to t-4, the next t-5 through
t-9, etc. The coefficients on the individual moving averages are unconstrained. Exclusion tests
indicate that the moving averages representing lags 13 through 24 enter with a significance level of
between 1 and 2 percent in the two equations displayed in Table 1 for the sample periods 1955-96
and are thus highly significant.

        12. The food-energy effect is defined as the difference of the rate of change of the chain-
weighted consumption deflator minus the rate of change of the chain-weighted consumption deflator
net of food and energy. Chain-weighted deflators are available back to 1959 and are linked to the
implicit deflator prior to 1959.

          13. An additional supply shock variable, the change in sensitive raw materials prices, BCD
series 99, was tested and found to be insignificant, with a t-ratio below 1.           See Gordon (1994,
footnote 7).

influence     the inflation   rate in the opposite     direction.14


Data on Unemployment                 and infiation

          Figure     1 displays   the actual unemployment        rate and the textbook        NAIRU.        The

difference between the actual unemployment                rate and the textbook   NAIRU is the textbook

unemployment          gap (separately dispiayed below in Figure 4). The unemployment                   gap tells

a familiar story of poswar            business cycles, with short back-to-back     recessions    in 1957-58

and 1960-61,        and then a long period of excess demand in the 1960s followed                by the mild

1969-70       recession   that barely nudged       the actual unemployment        rate above the NAIRU.

More excess demand followed in 1973-74,               followed by the severe recessions of 1974-75 and

1981-82.       Another     cycle occurred      in the late 1980s, with excess demand          comparable      to

1973-74,      followed    by a positive unemployment        gap during 1991-93     and another        period of

mild excess demand between              late 1994 and early 1996.

          Figure 2 compares three alternative         price indexes from which we will calculate three

alternative    NAIRU series.         The chain-weighted    GDP deflator   (the basic deflator concept in

the U. S. National        Income and Product Accounts since early 1996) is convenient                 to use in

the context        of the triangle    model,   since it makes the definition      linking    output    growth,

nominal       GDP growth,     and the inflation      rate in equation   (2) above hold exactly.         A case

could be made that it makes more sense for the Fed to stabilize consumer                    prices than GDP



        14. The productivity deviation variable was first introduced in exactly the same form in my
(1970) paper. The productivity deviation is defined as the log ratio of actual nonfarm private output
per hour to a Ioglinear piecewise trend running through 1950:Q2, 1954:Q4, 1963:Q3, 1972:Q2,
1978:Q3, 1987:Q3, and 1994:Q3.        The 1987-94 growth rate of this trend is 1.07 percent per
annum.

prices, and for this reason we compute alternative NAIRU series for the chain-weighted                         PCE

deflator,    also shown in Figure 2. For reference is shown a third series, the inflation                 rate of

CPI-U-X 1.15 All three series show the mme basic cycles of acceleration                     and deceleration    in

the inflation     rate, although     there are notable     differences.       In both supply-shock      episodes

(1974-75      and 1979-81)       the consumption     deflator and CPI inflation          rates accelerate earlier

than the GDP deflator,           and in 1980-81       they rise further.        On average consumer         price

inflation was more rapid than GDP inflation from 1987 to 1994, and this is the counterpart

of the fact that the real wage grew less rapidly in terms of consumer                 prices than in terms of

product     prices.   The opposite     phenomenon        occurred    during    1955-60     and 1965-73,    when

consumer      price inflation    was slower than inflation       in the GDP deflator.


Alternative Time-Varying            NAIRU Series

          As indicated    above, the model (3)-(4) requires that an assumption               be imposed on the

smoothness       of the computed        TV-NAIRU       series.      An assumption        of a, = O implies         a

completely      constant NAIRU wries of 6.0 percent, as shown by the horizontal                   line in Figure

3. At the other extreme an assumption              of aC = 0.4 implies a highly variable NAIRU series,

as shown by the line with the long dashes in Figure 3. In between are series with assumed

standard     deviations   of 0.1 and 0.2.    Which of these and other possible assumptions                 about

the standard     deviation      should we make?

          This problem     is analogous   to the choice of a smoothness          parameter     for the Hodrick-



           15. This hybrid series is equal to the CPI before 1967 and aher 1982, while between 1967
and 1982 substitutes the current rental-equivalence approach for owner-occuped housing in place
of the official CPI pre-1983 treatment that is universally regarded as erroneous.

Prescott     filter so often used to detrend       time-series     variables.     The most sensible standard

deviation      may not be the same for every variable or topic.                  If the NAIRU is viewed,          to

paraphraw       Milton Friedman,      as “ground out” by the macroeconomic             structure     and behavior

of the economy,      then it should shift slowly.      This is especially true, since the concept of the

NAIRU incorporated            into equation    (3) is the unemployment            rate consistent     with steady

inflation    in the absence of supply shocks. Allowing a shift in the NAIRU of 0.1 percentage

point per quarter might be considered            reasonable      and of 0.4 percentage      points per quarter

as excessively rapid.        The zig-zags in the series assuming a standard           deviation     of O.4 appear

implausible;     why should the no-supply-shock          NAIRU jump up and down from quarter to

quarter?       In essence,    we propose       using a “smoothness        prior” to reduce          the ambiguity

presented      by the various NAIRU series in Figure 3. We allow the NAIRU to move around

as much as it wants to, subject to the qualification                that sharp quarter-to-quarter          zig-zags

(negative serial correlation)       are ruled out.

           In the series developed     in the rest of the paper, we wlect a standard                deviation   (uc)

of 0.2,      As shown    in Figure 3, this results in a NAIRU series that exhibits                      substantial

movements       but just avoids sharp quarter-to-quarter           zig-zags.     It declines from 6.0 percent

in the mid-1950s      to a minimum      of 5.3 percent around         1962, rises to a plateau of about 6.2

percent between       1967 and 1972, declines briefly between              1973 and 1978, then exhibits a

hump of about 6.5 percent between              1978 and 1982, and then drifts down gradually to 5.7

percent in the final quarter,        1996:1.

           Figure 4 compares       the unemployment       gaps implied          by the textbook      NAIRU and
                                                                   The Tim~Varying              NAIRU, Page 23



various TV-NAIRU series. We see that all the TV-NAIRU series indicate substantially                                  more

excess demand       than the textbook      series in 1955-57,      1965-70,        and 1979-80.          For 1995-96

the TV-NAIRU          wries   corresponding        to a standard       deviation     of 0.2 and 0.4 indicate

somewhat     less excess demand        than the textbook     series.

        Previously     (Gordon,    1994) we argued that the behavior of inflation                     in the 1988-89

expansion     and     1990-91     recession    period     was consistent         with   the     textbook         NAIRU

assumption     of 6.0 percent.     Indeed, we shall see that the textbook            NAIRU does a very good

job of tracking the inflation       rate in a dynamic simulation           applied to 1987-96.             But Figure

4 demonstrates       that this evidence       presented    previously     is not sufficient           to support      the

textbook     NA.IRU prior to 1987 or so.             The textbook       NAIRU performs               well after 1987

simply because during that interval it happens to be quite close to the 7V-NAIRU.                                During

most of the period prior to 1987, the econometrically                   derived TV-NAIRU               is substantially

higher than the textbook          NAIRU.


Understanding         the Ambiguity in Bounding the NAIRU

        Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1996) have cast doubt on the enterprise                          of estimating    the

NAIRU, concluding         that “a typical 95V0 confidence          interval for the NAIRU in 1990 is 5.1

percent to 7.7 percent . . . . This imprecision           suggests caution in using the NAIRU to guide

monetary     policy.” Interestingly,    our NAIRU estimate for the GDP deflator, using a standard

deviation    of 0.2, is 6.2 percent for 1990, close to the midway point of the Staiger et. al.

band.

        Figure      4 displays    five different     unemployment          gap     series,    that     is, the    actual

unemployment          rate minus five alternative NAIRU series.                The alternative          gap series look

almost the same, are very highly correlated,                  and resuit in inflation      equations        that fit about

as well       as each     other.      Accordingly,      by standard       statistical     criteria,    one     cannot   be

distinguished      from      the other,     leading    to the Staiger et. al. conclusion.                However,       the

smoothness       criterion     proposed      above cuts through         this ambiguity       by using an economic

rather than a statistical criterion          to choose between alternative              NAIRU series.         As we shall

see, the remaining           ambiguity     regarding   the NAIRU for the very recent period                     concerns

differences      among       alternative    measures    of inflation,     which    exhibit      differing     degrees    of

acceleration,     constancy,       or deceleration.


Estimated Equations for the GDP Defiator

        The estimated equations             are presented     in the four columns of Table 1. Two versions

each are estimated          for 1955-87     and 1955-96,       corresponding      to the two alternative          NAIRU

series (textbook        and TV with a, = 0.2).              Estimated     sums of coefficients           on the lagged

dependent       (inertia) variable     and on the unemployment           gap are always highly significant and

of the correct      sign.     No constant      is included,     an essential element         of the approach        if the

demand variabie is defined as a deviation from the NAIRU.                         The pattern of lag coefficients

on the unemployment             gap zig-zags, indicating       the presence of a rate of change effect.              In an

alternative     version     of the equation     in column       (4), in which the current             level and current

change in the unemployment                 gap are entered      instead of the current and four lags on the

level, the coefficient        on the change is -0.99 with a t ratio of 4.0.

        The significance           of the various supply variables         differs, depending           on the sample

period and on the length of the LDV distribution,               but they all have the correct sign. A one-

percentage-point        excess of productivity     growth above trend reduces inflation            by about 0.1

percent.       A one-percentage-point        increase in the relative price of imports         raises domestic

inflation     by 0.06 to 0.09 percent, not far from the average share of imports in GDP during

the sample period.           Between 30 and 40 percent of the food-energy           relative price effect feeds

through       to inflation    in the GDP deflator.     And a ten percentage         point appreciation     in the

real exchange       rate of the dollar reduces domestic inflation         by about 0.1 percent within the

first year.     The Nixon         “on” and “off’ dummy variables continue         to be essential elements       in

explaining      the dynamics of inflation       during the 1971-75      period.     The summary statistics in

the middle of Table 1 indicate             that the TV-NAIRU       equation   has residual variance that is

about 17 percent lower than the textbook NMRU equation,                    in both the 1955-87 and 1955-

96 sample periods.

           The next-to-bottom         section of Table 1 lists the root-mean-squared        errors (RMSE) of

versions of the equations          in which the sum of coefficients on the LDV have been constrained

to sum to unity.             These RMSE’S are shown          for four sub-periods      (1955-70,    1971-87:2,

1987:3-1994:3,         and 1994:4-1996:        1) in order    to assess the relative performance           of the

alternative     NAIRU series. As would be expected,            the measures of fit are uniformly         superior

for the TV-NAIRU versions.              The largest relative improvement      in fit is during the pre-1970

period, indicating       that the textbook     NAIRU version mis=s an important            source of inflation

in 1955-57       and 1965-70,       namely that excess demand was substantially          greater than implied

by the textbook         series.     An important   result is that the equation       errors are substantially
                                                                    The Time-Varying         NAIRU, Page 26




smaller during       1987-94     and in 1994-95          than the average standard        error for the entire

sample period.       This indicates that the basic structure         of the inflation    equation,   as specified

more than fifteen years ago, has proven to be very successful in tracking                       inflation    during

quite different     sets of economic       conditions.

         The final section at the bottom of Table 1 lists mean errors and RMSE’S for dynamic

simulations     in which the LDV is fed back endogenously                  over the period      1987:4-1996:1.

Separate errors are listed from the same simulations               for the final six quarters during which

the actual unemployment          rate fell below 6.0 percent, 1994:4-1996:1.            The results in the left-

hand column, based on the textbook NAIRU, uses absolutely no information                          from the post-

1987:1      interval to estimate     the coefficients.     The results in column        (2), based on the TV-

NAIRU, uses post-1987           information    to estimate the NAIRU using model (3)-(4) but uses no

other post-1987       information.

         When actual inflation        turns out to be above the simulated            rate of inflation,     there is

a positive mean error, and this occurs for 1987-96                 in all four columns.       This implies that

during this interval the assumed NAIRU series is too low. A negative mean error means that

the assumed       NAIRU        series is too high.         The   results   for the 34-quarter        post-sample

simulations     are quite encouraging.        While the mean error is positive, both the textbook               and

TV-NAIRU versions are almost exactly on track in the final six quarters.                    And the root mean

squared error of the simulations           in all four columns is lower than the standard            error of the

estimated     equation.   The textbook        NAIRU series predicts almost as well as the TV-NAIRU

series and overpredicts        inflation   by only a modest amount          during   1995-96.

          The simulation      results in columns     (3) and (4) use the coefficients       estimated    over the

full wmple       period    through     1996 and of course yield smaller          RMSE’S for the 1987-96

simulation.      Here it is important      to emphasize     how little the coefficients      change when the

sample period        is extended     and how stable the structure       of the inflation     process seems to

have been during          1987-96    from the perspective     of coefficients   estimated    for the pre-1987

period.

          How much do the supply-shock              variables change the estimated       W-NAIRU?         Figure

5 displays two TV-NAIRU              series for the GDP Deflator        and a standard       deviation    of 0.2,

differing only that the solid line displays the TV-NAIRU               for the full version of the 1955-96

equation      displayed in column (4) of Table 1, while the dashed line shows an alternative                  TV-

NAIRU series that omits all right-hand-side             variables other than the lagged inflation            terms

and the set of unemployment            gap terms.     The results are intuitively     plausible   — during the

1973-81     period influenced        by adver=   supply shocks, the TV-NAIRU            is much higher when

the contribution       of the supply shock variables to inflation         is ignored.       The reverse is due

after 1982,     presumably     due to the declining       real prices of oil and imports.


Nonlinearity

          Recently     both   Robert    Eisner (1996)     and George      Akerlof,     William    Dickens,    and

George Perry (1996) have suggested that the linear specification                of the inflation equation      (3)

is incorrect.        Eisner argues that the Phillips        curve is concave,       that is, flatter    when the

unemployment          rate is below the conventional      NAIRU and steeper when the unemployment

rate is above the conventional           NAIRU.       I have tested Eisner’s proposition          by adding     to
                                                                      The TimeVarying           NAIRU, Page 28




equation     (3), in the version displayed in Table 1, column                (4), an additional      variable equal

to zero when the unemployment              gap is negative and equal to the unemployment                   gap when

the latter is positive.      If Eisner is correct,    this “POSGAP” variable would have a significant

negative     sign, indicating      a steeper    negative      slope    for the short-run        Phillips   curve    at

unemployment         rates above the NAIRU.          The sum of coefficients          on the POSGAP variable

(entered    as the current      value and four lags) indeed            is negative,   -0.12,   but the statistical

significance    of the sum is very weak,             with a significance        level of 0.61,       far from the

conventional     0.05 criterion.

        Akerlof et. al. (1996) argue for the opposite                 nonlinearity,    a convex Phillips curve

which      becomes    much     flatter   when    inflation     is low and unemployment               is above      the

conventional     NAIRU.      To test their proposition,        I defined another variable equal to zero in

all quarters except when the unemployment                   gap was positive and the four-quarter            change

in the GDP deflator        was below 3,0 percent.             The sum of coefficients          on this additional

variable, entered again as the current value and four lags, is precisely zero. Thus I conclude

that the short-run     Phillips curve is resolutely linear, at least within the range of inflation and

unemployment         values observed     over the 1955-96        period.


Estimated Equations for the PCE Deflator

           Table 2 displays an identical         set of results that differs only by using the chain-

weighted     PCE deflator      in place of the chain-weighted              GDP deflator.       Most elements       of

Table 2 are similar to the corresponding              elements        of Table 1.     Coefficients     are similar,

except (as would be expected)            the coefficients     on changes in the relative price of imports
                                                                 The Time-Varying         NAIRU, Page 29



and of food and energy are higher and more significant                   in the PCE deflator     equations      in

Table 2 than in the GDP deflator equations              in Table 1. The Nixon “off” dummy variables

are uniformly      small and insignificant     in Table 2, in contrast       to Table 1. Goodness        of fit

statistics are similar in both tables. Perhaps the most notable difference occurs in the bottom

two lines of Table 2, where improvement                 in performance     of the TV-NAIRU        equation      in

columns      (2) and (4), relative to the textbook         NAIRU versions      in columns      (1) and (3), is

much greater for the PCE deflator.       The textbook NAIRU causes a substantial               overprediction

of the inflation    rate during   1994-96     that does not occur with the TV NAIRU.

           Further insight into the “big miss” of the textbook NAIRU series is presented             in Figure

6, which plots the textbook NAIRU against the TV-NMRU                    series, using a standard deviation

of 0.2, for both the GDP deflator and the PCE deflator.              The TV-NAIRU        series for the PCE

deflator    was fairly close to that for the GDP deflator           between     1980 and 1990 but then

plummets      from 6.2 to 5.2 percent        over the 1990-96      period.    In late 1995 and late 1996

there is a sharp      disagreement    between      the textbook     NAIRU       and the PCE TV-NAIRU

regarding demand pressure in the economy;               the former implies excess demand and the latter

implies excess supply.

           Two other consumption-based        TV-NAIRU series are displayed in Figure 7. These are

for the fixed-weight      consumption        deflator    and CPI-U-X1.       The two PCE deflators           tell

roughly the same story up to the last few years, when PCE TV-NAIRU                     series for the chain-

weighted     PCE deflator drops well below that for the fixed-weight             PCE deflator.      It appears

that the chain-weighted       PCE deflator       places a substantially      higher   weight    on consumer
                                                                     The Time-Varying          NAIRU, Page 30




electronics,    especially personal         computers,    that have exhibited      a drastic decline in relative

prices in the 1990s.           During the mid 1980s the TV-NAIRU              for CPI-U-X1         was lower than

for the two PCE deflators,           but after 1990 it has been somewhat             higher.


Splitting the Sample Period

           One possible criticism          of the preceding     results concerns     the length     of the sample

period.     Why should the Fed base its estimate of the current NAIRU on more than forty

years of previous        data?     Why is not the more recent past, say the last 20 years, a more

relevant     interval    for which     to estimate       the inflation   equation?      Accordingly,     Figure      8

contrasts    the full-sample      NAIRU estimate for the GDP deflator with a 20 percent standard

deviation      (the same series as was plotted           in Figures 3, 5, and 6) with alternative        estimates

based on the two halves of the sample period.                 Splitting the sample period results in a sharp

jump in the estimated          NAIRU at the break point (1975:1).             The two sub-samples         result in

an estimate of the NAIRU for 1955-74                that is between 0.1 and 0.5 percentage           points lower

than the full-sample           estimate,    and an estimate      of the NMRU         for 1975-96       that ranges

beween       0.0 and 0.3 percentage          points higher than the full-wmple         estimate.    However,      for

the purpows       of conducting      current monetary policy, it is reassuring that the NAIRU estimate

for 1996:1      is identical     in the full-sample      and split-sample   alternatives.

           The estimated coefficients and performance             statistics of the split-sample equations        for

the GDP deflator are displayed in Table 3. The sum of coefficients                      on the unemployment

gap is somewhat         higher in the second sub-sample, while the coefficients              on the supply-shock

variables are quite different.         The mean error and root-mean-squared                 error in the 1987-96

dynamic simulation          are considerably         lower for the split sample results in Table 3 than the

full-sample       results in Table 1. However,             a Chow test just misses accepting           the hypothesis

of a structural break between the two sub-samples at the conventional                         5 percent significance

level.lg



Simulations            of Alternative Post-1996 Unemployment                            Scenarios

           How rapidly       would       inflation   accelerate      if the Fed “let her rip” (referring          to the

economy,         not interest rates) and allowed unemployment                to fall one percentage          point below

the NAIRU?          We can simulate our inflation model, assuming all future values of the supply

shock variables are zero, and specify an artificial unemployment                        gap scenario that generates

an acceleration        of inflation.     The particular      scenario plotted by the dashed line in Figure 9

allows the unemployment                gap (actual unemployment          minus NAIRU) to decline from 0.0 in

1996:2      to -1.0 in 1997:2 and thereafter.              The prediction    of inflation     is based on the 1955-

96 inflation equation         coefficients     estimated     in column (4) of Table 1, that is, using the TV-

NAIRU.           The    predictions      are compared         with     a baseline      prediction     that    leaves   the

unemployment           gap at zero forever, starting in 1996:2.

           The     simulations     of the      negative     unemployment        gap      scenario    display     a rapid

acceleration       of inflation    during 1997, reflecting the fact that the pattern                of lag coefficients

on the unemployment               gap variable embodies           a “rate-of-change”     effect as well as a “level”

effect. After the economy settles down at an unemployment                       gap of -1.0 percent, the rate-of-



        16. The F(28,108) ratio is 1.51, compared to a 5 percent significance value of 1.57 and a
1 percent significance value of 1.89.

change effect temporarily           interrupts      the acceleration     of inflation    in early 1998, after which

the acceleration     proceeds steadily, reaching 5.4 percent by the year 2005.                         Many journalists

and financial      market       experts    would      be surprised      at the slow pace of this acceleration,

although      it is clear that the bond market would be “spooked” by the rapid pace of inflation

acceleration     during 1997.        A constant unemployment              gap set at zero causes the economy to

settled down to an inflation              rate of 2.3 percent forever.



Conclusion


The Triangle Model and the Time-Varying NAIRU

        The      inflation      process      in     the    United    States     is one    of     the   most    important

macroeconomic         phenomena           in the world,       but it is also one of the best understood.                In

contrast to the wild gyrations of inflation in many other countries,                      the U. S. inflation process

is dominated      by inertia.     Inflation       changes little from year to year, and any deviation               of the

actual unemployment           rate from the NAIRU has extremely                   small consequences          in the short

run.   The best example          is the 1988-90           period, when unemployment             was on average about

one percentage        point     below      the 6.2 percent          estimated    NAIRU,        and the GDP deflator

accelerated     over the three years 1987-90                from 3.1 to 4.4 percent.           This implies a response

of inflation     of a bit less than half a point per one percentage                      point that unemployment

remains below the NAIRU for a single year. The estimated coefficient on the unemployment

gap in Table 1, line 2, ranges from -0.60 to -0.69, somewhat                         above one-half.

        Because the U. S. inflation               process has been so stable, and is so well characterized              by
                                                                            The TlmeVarylng          NAIRU, Page 33




the triangle model of inflation            developed     in the late 1970s and early 1980s, that model has

performed        extremely     well in dynamic         post-sample      simulations      extending     out for up to a

decade after the end of the sample period.                       In such simulations           the model      has proven

capable of tracking the disinflation           of the early and mid 1980s,              the acceleration      of inflation

of the late 1980s,           and the subsequent          deceleration        of inflation      in the 1990s.        Those

empirical successes were achieved despite the fact in previous research, the NAIRU inserted

into the model was assumed arbitrarily                 to be constant        at 6.0 percent for the entire period

after 1978 rather than estimated             econometrically.

          The main contribution            of this paper has been to allow the NAIRU to vary each

quarter over the period between              1955 and 1996.           The resulting      time-varying        (TV) NAIRU

stays remarkably          close to 6 percent        over the entire four-decade          interval,    ranging between

extreme values of 5.3 and 6.5 percent.                 In recent years there has been a downward                  drift in

the NAIRU from around                 6.2 percent in the late 1980s to current estimates                 of 5.7 percent

for the GDP deflator           and 5.2 percent for the PCE deflator.                The fact that the TV-NAIRU

was very close to 6 percent during the expansion                  of the late 1980s and recession of 1990-91

helps to explain          how my previous       assumption        that the NAIRU was fixed at 6.0 percent

performed        so well in tracking the acceleration            and deceleration        of that period.

          This    paper     rejects    the recent     argument       that    the band       of statistical    uncertainty

surrounding       the NAIRU is so broad as to render                  the concept       useless for the conduct          of

policy.      We propose       an economic      criterion    based on smoothness,              rather than a statistical

criterion,    to choose among alternative            NAIRU estimates for any given measure of inflation.

The recent suggestion of Staiger et. al. (1996)     that the NAIRU for the year 1990 could range

from 5.1 to 7.7 percent makes no economic           sense.   If the NAIRU had been 5.1 percent in

the period since 1987, inflation would not have accelerated         during 1987-90,       since the actual

unemployment       rate never fell below 5.1 percent in any calendar quarter.        If the NAIRU had

been 7.7 percent      in the period   since 1987, inflation    would     not have decelerated      during

1990-93,     since the actual unemployment      rate never rose above 7.7 percent in any calendar

quarter.    The fact that the inflation   rate for the GDP deflator was roughly constant           during

the six quarters    (1994:4-1 996: 1), when the actual unemployment            rate was approximately

constant    at 5.6 percent, suggests that the TV-NAIRU for the GDP deflator during those six

quarters was very close to 5.6 percent.

           The new TV-NAIRU      series allows a new series for potential        output    to be created,

measuring      the real GDP that can be produced     each quarter when the economy           is operating

at the TV-NAIRU.       I have produced    such a series by estimating    an Okun’s law equation        like

that written     above in footnote    4; the resulting   series on potential    output    increases at an

annual rate of 2.07 percent beween          1990:3 and 1996:1.17        Since the TV-NAIRU        declines

from 6.2 percent in 1990 to 5.7 percent in 1996, this potential           output series grows at about

0.1 percentage     point faster than would be implied by a NAIRU fixed at 6.0 percent.               Thus




         17. In estimating the Okun’s law equation written in equation (4), I invert it to regress the
unknown output gap on current and leading values of the unemployment gap implied by the new
TV-NA.IRU series based on the GDP deflator and a standard deviation of 0.2. I allow the sum of
coefficients on the unemployment gap to differ during 1990-96 from their values in 1972-90.          I
calculate the fitted output gap, and then compute a trial value of potential output as actual real GDP
minus the fitted output gap. The final potential output series is a 12-quarter centered moving
average of the trial series.

caution    is advised regarding           the advice of “growth          hawks” that the U. S. economy             could

grow at 3 percent or more per annum if only the Fed’s monetary                            policy is less restrictive.

Since the economy             is currently    at the NAIRU, the ceiling on non-inflationary                    growth   is

about 2.1 percent a year, unless the NAIRU falls further below its values of early 1996.


The Conduct of Monetary Policy

          What evaluation         of past and current monetary            policy is implied by this new research

on the NAIRU?             According      to our new TV-NAIRU measures, there was considerably                      more

excess demand             in 1955-57     and 1965-70     than implied        by the previous      textbook       NMRU

series, suggesting that monetary             policy was even more overly expansionary                in the=     periods

than was previously           thought.       The new TV-NAIRU            series also boosts modestly        the extent

of estimated excess demand in 1979-80                and 1988-90.         However,      the new series implies that

monetary         policy     in 1995-96        has been      almost     precisely   on   target,   with     an average

unemployment          rate during        the six quarters     1994:4-1996:1        of 5.6 percent,       only slightly

below the average estimated TV-NAIRU of 5.7 percent for the GDP deflator in that interval.

If the Fed considers          its goal as the stabilization      of the rate of change of the PCE deflator

rather    than    the GDP deflator,           then the estimated         average TV-NAIRU         during       the same

interval was 5.3 percent, implying that monetary                     policy was slightly too restrictive in 1995-

96.

          The TV-NAIRU            by any measure has declined              in the 1990s.      If the Fed’s current

deliberations      about interest rate changes are intended              to influence the actual unemployment

rate roughly       one year from now, should                the Fed extrapolate         the recent    decline     in the
                                                                       The Time-Varying        NAIRU, Page 36




NMRU        into the future,     or shouid      the Fed set its estimate      of the NAIRU one year hence

equal to the current         value?     The TV-NAIRU         specified    in equation     (4) above is a random

walk and thus is just as likely to increase                over the subsequent          year as to continue      to

decrease.     There is no information          about future inflation      available beyond that contained       in

the lagged values of the explanatory             variables in the inflation equation        that are already used

to derive the NAIRU.

          While the TV-NAIRU technique               does not provide a magic crystal ball that allows the

Fed to see into the future, it makes two valuabie contributions                   to the conduct    of monetary

policy.     First, it quantifies      in a systematic way the Fed’s intuitive           feeling that the NAIRU

must have fallen in the 1990s, because as of early 1996 inflation                       had not accelerated    as it

did in 1988-90.        Second,       it highlights   the differences      in the TV-NAIRU       series implied by

alternative    inflation     measures, e.g., the GDP vs. PCE deflator,           and forces the Fed to take a

stand on what inflation          concept     it is trying to stabilize.

          Estimated    movements         in the NMRU        over time naturally         raise the question    as to

which factors caused these movements.                  This question       is most easiiy posed for the three

consumption       price indexes used to generate the TV-NAIRU                  series of Figure 7. There only

NO major changes occur, an increase in the NAIRU from about 5.8 percent                               in 1965 to

roughly     6.5 percent       in the two decades after 1970, and then a decline from about 6.4

percent     in 1990 to 5.3 percent          in 1996.     The late 1960s were a time of iabor militancy,

relatively strong unions, a relatively high minimum                wage, and a marked increase in labor’s

share in national          income.     The 1990s have been a time of labor peace, relatively                  weak

unions,      a relatively low minimum    wage, and a very slight decline in labor’s income share.

The role played       in the recent decline    of the NAIRU by these aspects of labor market

structure,     and other plausible   causes relating to global competition,   remains a tantalizing

topic for future research.
