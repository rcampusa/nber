The establishment and growth of industrial research laboratories is one of the key organizational

innovations affecting technological progress in the United States in the 20th century. In this paper,

we investigate the rise of industrial research laboratories in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry

between 1927 and 1946. Our evidence suggests that institutional factors, namely the presence of

universities dedicated to research, played a significant role in the establishment and diffusion of

private pharmaceutical research laboratories. Specifically, we document that the growth of industrial

pharmaceutical laboratories between 1927 and 1946 is positively and significantly correlated with

the extent of local university research, after controlling for other observable factors likely to

influence the geographic distribution of industrial research. We supplement our core results with

case histories illustrative of early university-industry interaction and an examination of the

determinants of university-industry research cooperation. Our qualitative historical evidence and

analyses of the birth of chemical engineering programs suggest that industry also played a role in

influencing university research agendas. We correct for feedback effects from industry to

universities using instrumental variables. Overall, our analyses suggest that while the presence of

industrial facilities helped shape the direction of university research programs, there was a

significant, positive, and causal effect running from university research to the growth of

pharmaceutical research laboratories in the first half of the twentieth century in the United States.

I.     Introduction

       The establishment and growth of industrial research laboratories is one of the key

organizational innovations affecting technological progress in the United States in the 20th

century (Mowery, 1990).      We investigate in this paper the rise of industrial research

laboratories in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry between 1927 and 1946. Our evidence

suggests that universities played a significant role in the establishment and diffusion of

industrial research laboratories in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry during this period. The

foundation of our quantitative analysis is the demonstration that the emergence and growth

of private pharmaceutical research laboratories depends upon the extent and growth of

nearby academic science. We complement the quantitative results with qualitative evidence

that elucidates some of the mechanisms by which universities and industry interacted during

this period. For example, our qualitative analyses demonstrate evidence of university-

industry collaboration involving prominent academics, considerable academic participation

in industrial patenting, and the staffing of emerging industrial research laboratories with

graduates of nearby university programs. We are also alert to the fact that this relationship

may not have been unidirectional, and devote particular attention to the possibility that the

local industrial base affected the nature of academic science at universities during this

period. Our analyses provide suggestive though not dispositive evidence of the impact of

local firms on university programs.     Even when we correct for this endogeneity bias,

however, the result that laboratory births are positively related to PhD program graduates

remains. We interpret this combination of qualitative and quantitative evidence as support

for the hypothesis that universities played a significant role in the birth of early American

pharmaceutical research laboratories.
          Hand-in-glove relationships between firm laboratories and universities in the life

sciences are commonplace in the early 2000s, but were substantially more rare a century

ago. Indeed, many academic scientists and academic bodies viewed industry with extreme

skepticism or overt antipathy. Quoting a 1915 report of the Committee of the Board of

Trustees of the American Medical Association, Parascandola (1985) illustrates the contempt

held by medical scientists for industry: “It is only from laboratories free from any relations

with manufacturers that real advances can be expected.”1 Though a fictional tale, Sinclair

Lewis’s novel Arrowsmith is more severe but also representative of the attitude of the time.

Reacting to the news of famed biology professor Max Gottlieb’s decision to join the

research laboratories of a private firm, colleagues grieved: In one lab, “sorrowing men

wailed, ‘How could old Max have gone over to that damned pill peddler?,’” while in other

places colleagues lamented, “Of all the people in the world! I wouldn’t have believed it!

Max Gottlieb falling for those crooks!,” and “I wish HE hadn’t gone wrong!” (Lewis, 1925,

p. 52).2 It is, then, somewhat surprising that an environment that harbored such scorn for

industry would, ultimately, be actively involved in planting the seed corn for the

development of industrial research laboratories.

          History demonstrates, however, that Prof. Gottlieb’s decision to work with the pill

peddlers was emblematic of the growing ties between university scientists and private firms

in the U.S. pharmaceutical and chemical industries during this time period. Indeed, while,

“American drug companies by and large had no interest in research [in the early years of the

20th century,]” (Swann, 1990, p.77), industrial research laboratories grew throughout the

    This quote is used commonly among historians of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry to reflect the attitudes of

                                                                                                              2
1920s and 1930s such that they were a common organizational form among large

pharmaceutical manufacturers by the time of World War II. The increasing relevance of

academic science for industrial purposes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries appears to

have been a principal underlying force that enabled collaborations between universities and

industry to be ultimately fruitful (Mowery and Rosenberg, 1998; Murmann, 2003). We

argue that the existence of U.S. universities (and their specific form and nature) animated

the potential for interaction between academic scientists and pharmaceutical firms in the

U.S. interwar period.            We examine the early mechanisms through which universities

affected research in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries and devote particular

attention to the labor market for trained researchers, collaborative research and consulting

agreements, and contract research arrangements.3 While our primary aim is to ascertain the

extent and nature of university influence on the development of industrial research

laboratories, we also examine the extent to which university researchers and their

institutions were affected by their interactions with industry. Some qualitative evidence

suggests that large pharmaceutical companies with substantial research needs did, indeed,

influence proximate universities, and our statistical analyses provide some evidence

consistent with this phenomenon.

           In our principal analysis, we assesses the relationship between academic science and

the establishment of pharmaceutical research laboratories by estimating the impact of the

presence of universities and the count of PhD graduates on the number of industrial

pharmaceutical laboratories established and number of pharmaceutical R&D workers in

geographically proximate areas.              We set the stage for this analysis by reviewing case

     the industrial histories of John P. Swann (1988, 1990).


                                                                                                                3
histories of early U.S. pharmaceutical firms and describing the nature of relationships

between academic scientists and pharmaceutical firms. The empirical evidence reveals that

pharmaceutical labs were more likely to be located in counties that contained research in

academic chemistry or science. Specifically, the number of pharmaceutical laboratories in a

county in 1938 and 1947 is, across a wide range of specifications, positively and

significantly associated with the initial number of research laboratories and the

contemporaneous count of local science PhD graduates.

       Building on the quantitative analyses, we clarify some of the mechanisms by which

universities appear to have influenced the birth of pharmaceutical research laboratories. In

particular, drawing on records from the rosters of Who’s Who in Chemistry (1928), we

demonstrate the involvement of adopting firms in the labor market for graduating PhDs.

Further, we present evidence that collaborative arrangements between academic scientists

and industry and, occasionally, contract research agreements were both important pre-

cursors and complements to firms developing their own laboratories. Combining patent data

with data from American Chemical Society membership rosters, we find that a substantial

share of pharmaceutical patents for which we can identify inventor affiliations included

academic inventors.

       Overall, our results paint a picture in which the role of universities in the

development of industrial research laboratories is significant and multifarious. In addition to

serving as the launching pad for the careers of individuals who found employment in private

firm laboratories, U.S. universities appear to have played a role in the creation of such

laboratories, via collaborative research and consulting, and in their developing expanded

research capabilities over time. We also cite qualitative evidence of feedback effects from




                                                                                             4
firms to universities.     By both providing financial support for university research

laboratories and a market for future trained labor, firms supported the growth of scientific

capabilities at local universities. The relationships between Merck and Rutgers and Dupont

and the University of Delaware are illustrative of the bi-directional impact of the

relationship between universities and industry.      Our analysis of the birth of chemical

engineering programs provides evidence consistent with these qualitative accounts. Our

core results about the influence of universities on the birth of research laboratories do,

however, hold up, even after correcting for endogeneity using instrumental variables.

       The remainder of the paper proceeds in the following way: Section 2 introduces

background research on university-industry interaction and reviews the history of the

pharmaceutical industry in the early 20th century, and the origins of industrial research

laboratories. Section 3 reviews historical interactions between the U.S. pharmaceutical

industry and academic science. Section 4 describes our core dataset. Section 5 evaluates the

importance of universities in influencing the growth of pharmaceutical research laboratories.

Section 6 assesses the mechanisms of interaction between universities and pharmaceutical

firms in greater detail. Section 7 reviews quantitative evidence on the role of industry in

affecting program births in universities. Section 8 discusses our instrumental variables

estimates. Section 9 concludes, discussing the implications of the results and speculating

regarding related, future research.



II.    University-Industry Interaction and the Origin of Industrial Research
       Laboratories

       In this section, we lay the groundwork for our argument that U.S. universities

contributed to the establishment and growth of industrial research laboratories. In particular,



                                                                                             5
we review research that describes the growth of the U.S. universities in the late 1800s and

early 1900s, suggests the importance of universities to the United States’ emerging industrial

leadership, and suggests that proximity and specific institutional arrangements played an

important role in university-industry interaction.



II.1 The emergence of U.S. universities and the nature of university-industry interaction

          Goldin and Katz (1999) identify the period of 1890-1940 as the “formative years” of

American higher education. States dramatically increased their support of higher education

during this period and the U.S. research university emerged in a form similar to that which

exists today. These years were also formative for university-industry collaboration and the

rise of industrial research laboratories in the United States. Figures 1-3 display the number

of public universities, private universities, and industrial research labs by founding date,

beginning in 1830. They reveal that more universities were founded in the late 19th century

than in any other period. In large part, the rise of universities was due to the Morrill Act of

1862, which established the land-grant universities, and the Hatch Act of 1887, which

provided aid for the study of scientific agriculture. The emergence of industrial research

labs came somewhat later, in the 1920s and 1930s.4 The boom during this period was,

however, quite substantial, so substantial in fact that university-industry interaction reached

a high point in the period between World War I and World War II. As Mowery and

Rosenberg (1998) note, “university-industry research linkages… were well-established

     It should be taken into account that these graphs are snapshots taken at two different points in time: the
    university data were compiled in 1924 and the industrial research lab survey was conducted in 1946. As a
    result, firms that were founded prior to 1946 but did not survive to that date are not counted.


                                                                                                             6
before World War II. Indeed, the share of university research expenditures financed by

industry appears to have declined throughout much of the postwar period” (p. 37).5

          Rosenberg, Mowery, Nelson and a number of co-authors have argued that the

research universities that emerged during this period – and, in particular, the aspects of

academic science that responded to the needs of industry – became one of the main drivers

of American technological leadership in the twentieth century.6                     These authors note a

number of examples of commercially important early inventions that originated in

universities, including the Babcock test (which improved the way dairy producers tested the

butterfat content of milk); Edwin Armstrong’s research on vacuum tubes at Columbia

University (which influenced the development of radio technology); and the development of

hybrid corn at agricultural experiment stations.7                 Noting the important influence on

innovation in the later part of the 20th century, these authors further acknowledge the

seminal contributions of university research on the development of computers and lasers

(Rosenberg and Nelson, 1994; Mowery et al., 2003, p. 1).

          The role of proximity in facilitating university-industry linkages is central in our

investigation of the factors that led to the rise of industrial research laboratories. Existing

empirical studies of contemporary university-industry research linkages suggest that

research conducted in universities has a significant and geographically focused effect on

innovation. Jaffe (1989) provides evidence that corporate patenting in certain industries is

    Also, Swann (1988) argues that post-war increases in federal funding for university research in the health
    sciences reduced collaboration between universities and the pharmaceutical industry.

    As another example, the University of Akron supplied local rubber producers with skilled employees, and its
    scientists conducted research in the processing of rubber and, later, polymer chemistry (Mowery et al.,
    2003), p. 1). Additional examples include the University of Oklahoma’s research in the field of petroleum,
    the University of Kentucky’s and the University of North Carolina’s focus on the processing of tobacco, and
    the University of Illinois and Purdue University’s work on railroad technologies (Nelson and Rosenberg,
    1994).


                                                                                                             7
positively associated with state-level spending on university research in related academic

disciplines. Acs, Audretsch and Feldman (1992) substitute innovation counts for patent data

and find even stronger evidence for spillovers from university research. Jaffe, Trajtenberg,

and Henderson (1993) find that knowledge spillovers from university research, as measured

by patent citations, are geographically concentrated.8                   In a study of the biotechnology

industry, Zucker, Darby and Brewer (1998) show that biotechnology firms tend to locate

near universities in order to take advantage of the areas’ higher levels of “intellectual

capital”. In both the qualitative and quantitative evidence we review, geographic proximity

plays an important role in facilitating interactions between universities and pharmaceutical

firms.

           The nature of university-firm interactions is informed by research that examines the

organizational locus of innovative activity. Specifically, a set of recent papers examine

whether innovative activity takes place in divisions of the corporation or in entrepreneurial

firms that transact in the market for technology. Teece (1988) explains how transaction

costs can dictate the organizational form in which innovation takes place. Arora, Fosfuri

and Gambardella (2001) document the growth in technology trade in the late twentieth

century, led by high-tech industries like software, chemicals, semi-conductors and

electronics. Arora, Fosfuri and Gambardella (2003) model the division of “inventive labor”

under different conditions. Stern and Gans (2003) focus on how several aspects of the

“commercialization environment” affect the innovative start-up’s optimal choice of co-

operation or competition with incumbent firms. Peretto (1998) develops a model that

explains the transition from independent inventors to corporate R&D labs in the late

II.2   The origins of industrial research

       The first organized industrial research laboratories appeared in Germany in the

1870s, in firms that sought to commercialize inventions based on recent breakthroughs in

organic chemistry (Mowery and Rosenberg, 1998, p. 13.). Murmann (2003) describes the

co-evolution of the dye industry and academic research in chemistry in nineteenth-century

Germany, and argues that spillovers from universities to the dye industry and vice versa led

Germany to dominate the international dye industry in the 19th century. Mowery and

Rosenberg argue that it was not scientific developments alone which led to the growth of in-

house research in the United States, but also the strength of U.S. anti-trust policy following

the Sherman Act (which triggered a search for alternative sources of market power through

industrial innovation) and stronger protection of intellectual property rights through the

patent system. However, as Mowery points out, “a weak antitrust climate in other nations,

such as Germany, was associated with growth in industrial research, making it difficult to

assert a direct cause-and-effect relationship between anti-trust policy and the growth of

intrafirm R&D” (Mowery, 1990, p. 346). It could also be argued that the increasing strength

of intellectual property rights in the late 19th and early 20th centuries would seem to promote

greater specialization in innovation and vertical dis-integration rather than a shift in

innovative activity from the realm of the independent inventor to within the boundaries of

the corporation. Indeed, Lamoreaux and Sokoloff (2002) argue that, in the nineteenth

century,




                                                                                             9
     “the U.S. patent system created a framework that supported trade in technology,
     and that the patent agents and lawyers who serviced this system often took on the
     functions of intermediaries, matching inventors seeking capital with investors
     seeking profitable outlets for their funds and also inventors seeking to sell new
     technological ideas with buyers eager to develop and commercialize them” (p. 5-
     6).

Lamoreaux and Sokoloff (1996) document a well-functioning market for technology in the

late nineteenth century United States. In 1870-71, for example, 72% of all patents that were

assigned to a party other than the inventor were assigned after issue. By 1910-11, this

number was halved (36.5%). Fisk (1998) explains that, prior to the 1890s, courts almost

always favored the rights of the inventor in cases where the ownership of an employee’s

invention was contested by an employer.          Starting in the 1890s, Fisk documents the

emergence of the “shop right” patent doctrine, which favored the employer in intellectual

property disputes. This change in intellectual property doctrine no doubt made it much more

attractive for firms to establish in-house research labs.

       Mowery and Rosenberg also emphasize the importance to industrial innovation of

science conducted in universities. In this paper, we argue that the unique form taken by

American universities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries helped promote the

adoption of industrial research laboratories within the boundaries of firms. Whereas during

the nineteenth century, “most industrialists believed the manufacturer’s job was to

manufacture; new ideas to improve manufacturing could be purchased or otherwise

appropriated … managers offered little support for research until they had evidence that a

worker’s results indicated likely commercial application,” (Swann, 1988, p. 13) the

institutionalization of scientific research in universities facilitated the adoption of scientific

research in industry. The scientific research undertaken in universities reduced the cost to

firms of acquiring scientific knowledge, and this led firms located near universities to



                                                                                               10
engage in research. Furthermore, the trend towards specialization and professionalization in

science increased the supply of qualified workers with easily identifiable skills. Once firms

could access a pool of potential research workers whose academic credentials reduced the

uncertainty associated with hiring them, firms could establish labs to engage in long-term

research projects.

       Several interrelated historical forces combined to favor the organization of invention

within the firm. Changes in the nature of technology, in the extent to which firms could

claim intellectual property rights over their employees’ inventions, and in the enforcement

of anti-trust rules contributed to firms seeking to adopt of in-house industrial research

facilities. In order for firms to respond to these forces to organize invention within firm

boundaries, they needed skilled R&D workers and scientific expertise.           Universities

provided these inputs to production of new technology through consulting relationships and

by providing certification for the skills of potential R&D employees.



III.   The U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry and Academic Science in the Early 20th
       Century

III.1. Research in the pharmaceutical industry in the early 20th century

       Although a select number of pharmaceutical firms employed in-house researchers in

the early years of the 20th century, the period between the 1920 and World War II witnessed

a substantial change in the organization and function of U.S. drug makers (Swann, 1988).

Over this period, the industry changed from consisting of nearly entirely manufacturing-

oriented firms to being largely comprised of firms dedicated to the systematic discovery and

introduction of efficacious medicines. Some of the changes in the industry were preceded or

accompanied by legislative changes, such as the Biologics Control Act of 1902 and Pure



                                                                                          11
Food and Drug Act of 1906 (and 1912 Shirley Amendment), each of which pushed the

industry away from sometimes fraudulently-labeled ‘patent’ medicines towards more

rationalized practices.

       In addition to US-based characteristics and policies, Europe played an important role

in aiding American firms in their transition to science-based pharmaceutical research. In the

years prior to World War I, European-trained (mainly German-trained) researchers and

students returned to the United States, often to Philadelphia, New York, and the region in-

between (Feldman and Schreuder, 1996) offering expertise, particularly in biologics, to

pharmaceutical firms, universities, and public health administrations. The development of

research capabilities in U.S. pharmaceutical firms was further accelerated by World War I.

The loss of access to European medicines increased the need for national medicine-making

capabilities, and the ability to develop medicines was enhanced both by European

immigration and by the seizure and auction of German intellectual property by the Office of

the Alien Property Custodian.

       These developments were concomitant with an increasing relevance of academic

science for drug-making during late 19th and early 20th centuries, which in the eyes of

Mowery and Rosenberg (1998) and Murmann (2003) helped set the stage for fruitful

collaborations between universities and industry and, as we argue, for the US

pharmaceutical industry to draw on resources in universities to help develop in-house

research facilities.      From the early part of the century, during which research and

development expenditures were minimal, Mahoney (1959, p. 4) reports that research

expenditures increased to $15 million in 1939 and $110 million by 1956. Mahoney claims

that the nature of the pharmaceutical industry changed dramatically during the 1930s and




                                                                                          12
1940s, as a result of increasing average firm size and technical sophistication. For example,

he reports that during the depression years of 1932 and 1934, more than 3,500 firms failed

(p. 4) and that even until the 1940s most firms were quite small: “As late as 1939 no ethical

drug manufacturer in America had a sales volume as large as a department store like Macy’s

in New York” (p. 4).

       Although the nature of the industry was already changing by the early 1940s, the

loss, once again, of medicines from Europe and the exigencies of war prompted significantly

increased investment in research during World War II.           For the first time, the U.S.

government became actively involved in promoting drug development and manufacturing.

Two major projects in which the government played a large role were the production of

penicillin and dried plasma. These projects were mainly dedicated towards large-scale

manufacturing, but significant R&D capabilities were a pre-requisite for achieving the

knowledge to effectively produce the products, and those firms that had already achieved

some level of in-house research expertise were at considerable advantage.



III.2. Historical evidence of the influence of early 20th century academic science on
       pharmaceutical research

       In order to characterize the relationship between academic science and the early

industrial research labs, we exploit the fact that geographic proximity facilitates interaction

between people and organizations. We argue that firms located near research universities

were more likely to adopt in-house R&D facilities because local universities provided both

part-time faculty consultants with highly specialized knowledge and scientifically-trained

university graduates who could be employed as full-time research employees. Because

long-distance collaboration was more difficult in the first half of the twentieth century than



                                                                                            13
it is today, firms were more likely to focus their search for scientific expertise on nearby

institutions. In this section, we discuss histories of a number of early pharmaceutical firms,

including Mulford and Sterling, whose cases appear illustrative of the influence of local

university science on firm-specific investments in innovation.9

           III.2.1 Illustrative Cases – Mulford & Sterling at the turn of the 20th century

           Founded by two graduates of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, the H.K.

Mulford Company commenced operations in Philadelphia in 1891 when H.K. Mulford and

Milton Campbell purchased the “Old Simes” drugstore. After initial successes in improving

pill-making technologies, the founders undertook a more ambitious challenge for which they

themselves were by no means sufficiently trained – the synthesis of diphtheria antitoxin.

Bacteriological illness had become increasingly problematic for urban areas as a result of the

increased density of city life. This problem was of particular concern to the Municipal

Health Department in Philadelphia, which was the third largest city in the country at the

time. Philadelphia’s Health Department, like that of New York, was especially active in

promoting efforts to address bacteriological illnesses.                Long known as the “Cradle of

Pharmacy” (Mahoney, 1959; Feldman and Schreuder, 1996), Philadelphia was the home to

some of the most advanced biomedical research institutions in North America. In addition

to the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, several other institutions were pursuing

bacteriological research, including the University of Pennsylvania, Medico-Chirurgical

College, and Pepper Clinical Laboratories of the University Hospital. Together with the

Municipal Health Department, these institutions were engaged in research on diphtheria in

response to “public clamor” for a diphtheria antitoxin (Galambos, 1995, p. 13). Galambos

    Furman (2003) reviews the relationship between local resources and the strategic orientation of Mulford and
     Sterling.


                                                                                                            14
argues that Mulford “recognized the opportunities embodied in the “clamor” for diphtheria

antitoxin” and set out to produce a commercially viable drug (Galambos, 1995, p. 13). In

1894, the firm hired Dr. Joseph McFarland, who was on faculty at the University of

Pennsylvania’s Medical Department and the Philadelphia Polyclinic and College for

Graduates in Medicine and had trained in bacteriology in Heidelberg and Vienna, and

created for him a laboratory in which he could concentrate on developing diphtheria

antitoxin (Galambos, 1995). In his efforts, McFarland benefited greatly from interactions

with the New York City Health Department and the Laboratory for Hygiene at the

University of Pennsylvania. By 1895, Mulford was able to become the first commercial

provider of a diphtheria anti-toxin. The firm’s success with McFarland then led them to hire

Professor Leonard Pearson from Penn’s Veterinary School and to establish a full-fledged

laboratory in 1896 in Glenoden, PA dedicated to biological, veterinary, and vaccine research

(Galambos, 1995). In the absence of these locally-available academic scientific resources, it

does not appear as if Mulford would have engaged the task of synthesizing diphtheria

antitoxin or, ultimately, of founding a dedicated research laboratory.

       The Sterling pharmaceutical company was founded under circumstances similar to

those of Mulford and around the same point in time, yet it pursued a very different trajectory

with respect to research. Upon graduation from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, the

same institution attended by the founders of Mulford, William E. Weiss returned to his

hometown of Wheeling, West Virginia and founded the company that became Sterling in

conjunction with his childhood friend Albert Diebold.           Like Mulford, the fledgling

drugmaker met with considerable success; unlike Mulford, however, the firm succeeded at

marketing and distributing patent medicines, products of questionable medical validity




                                                                                           15
which were often alcohol- or narcotic-based. By 1912, it was valued at $4 million (Mann

and Plummer, 1991). In the wake of World War I, Sterling acquired the assets of the Bayer

Company, including all U.S. rights to Bayer Aspirin in the auction of seized German

property rights held by the Office of the Alien Property Custodian. That the fact that

Sterling was able to raise the funds required for this acquisition demonstrates the triumph of

the firm’s marketing and distribution resources. Its technical and research capabilities were

substantially less well-developed, however. Sterling’s drug-making competence was, in

fact, so limited that it was forced to solicit substantial guidance from Bayer in order to have

any chance to manufacture the basic products it won at auction.

       Both demand and supply side factors appear to have had an influence on Sterling’s

choice of organizing strategies. Serving the mainly rural populations of West Virginia and

central and western Pennsylvania, Sterling did not face substantial demand for medicines to

fight the bacteriological illnesses towards whose cures academic science had begun to work.

Even if such demand had existed, however, Sterling did not have ready access to trained

individuals who could have contributed to effectively to drug discovery; at the very least, it

seems fair to say that the comparative advantage of Sterling’s West Virginia location was

not based in scientific research.

       While stylized, these stories seem to be illustrative rather than unique. The early

history of Detroit’s Parke-Davis, another one of the first chemical firms to establish science-

based industrial research, resonates with that of Mulford.        Similar to its Philadelphia

counterpart, Parke-Davis began serious research efforts with the aim of making diphtheria

anti-toxin.   To do so, it hired Elijah M. Houghton, a research assistant at the nearby

University of Michigan in 1895 and Charles McClintock, a research assistant in




                                                                                            16
bacteriology, in 1896 (Swann, 1988). Parke-Davis established a research lab in biology, and

succeeded in producing diphtheria anti-toxin within a few months. McClintock then turned

his efforts to other biological research, which dominated the firm until the 1920s when a

separate department for chemical research was established (Swann, 1988).

       These early examples of the importance of local labor markets in diffusing

biomedical research knowledge are typical of the experience of U.S. firms in the 1920s and

1930s. Firms located near universities appear to have had greater ease in recruiting scholars

for their research efforts. The differences in the strength and relevance of the science bases

in Philadelphia, PA and Wheeling, WV during the formative years of Mulford and Sterling

are vast. The “Cradle of Pharmacy,” Philadelphia was home to numerous universities with

departments dedicated to biomedical sciences, including the University of Pennsylvania

(which was founded 1740, and offered its first doctorate in 1871), as well as the Philadelphia

College of Pharmacy (founded 1821), the Medical College of Pennsylvania (1850),

Jefferson Medical College (1825), Hahnemann Medical College (1848), Temple University

(1884), and the Drexel Institute of Technology (1892). The University of Pennsylvania was

one of the country’s leading biomedical institutions, and had granted, on its own, 919

doctorates by 1925. By contrast, Sterling’s hometown, Wheeling, WV was 50 miles from

the nearest university. The closest large universities to its home base were in Pittsburgh (59

miles from away), Morgantown, WV (79 miles away), and Penn State (198 miles away).

Though not immediately nearby, Pittsburgh was an emerging center of university life at the

turn of the century, offering the University of Pittsburgh (which was founded in 1786 and

granted its first doctorate in 1886), the Carnegie Institute of Technology (founded 1905),

and Duquesne University (founded 1878). However, even if Sterling had opened facilities




                                                                                           17
in Pittsburgh, these growing universities would not have been able to offer research services

comparable to those of Philadelphia – by 1925, the city’s largest university, the University

of Pittsburgh, had only granted 86 PhDs, and Carnegie and Duquesne did not grant any

PhDs until the 1920s.

           III.2.2. Early university-industry interactions - collaborations & local labor markets

           In this section we review historical evidence that suggests that university academics

were sought-after collaborators for early research labs, and that suggests that geographic

propinquity played an important role in the ability to collaborate with university-based

researchers.       Both the importance of some academic collaborators and the potentially

prohibitive cost of long-distance collaboration are illustrated by the agreement struck

between Du Pont and consulting chemist Roger Adams, a professor at the University of

Illinois. Du Pont offered Adams $5,000 a year, which was substantially more than half his

university salary, to entice him to make a monthly trip from Urbana to Wilmington, and to

visit for a month or so during the summers. Adams negotiated a deal in which he received

$3,000 annually (plus travel expenses) for a visit every other month, along with $750 for

each summer month spent at Du Pont (Hounshell and Smith, 1988).10 While Du Pont, one

of the first and most successful companies to adopt in-house research, had access to the

funds required to invest in long-distance relationships with consultants (and had little choice,

given the absence of a major research university in the vicinity of Wilmington), younger and

smaller firms did not. Table 1 lists the industrial labs in the National Research Council

(NRC) data that in 1938 listed the names of the universities at which they funded consultants




10
     While a consultant for Du Pont, Adams told a colleague, “I feel that I get quite as much out of the contact
     from the chemical standpoint as they do” (Ibid, p. 298).


                                                                                                             18
or research fellows.11 Local universities, where they exist, predominate. While other more

distant universities were supported by firms with larger research efforts (like Merck, with a

research staff of 111), even these firms continue to be associated with nearby universities.

           Universities, in addition to providing consulting services, fed the labs with a supply

of skilled labor. We have seen that Mulford and Parke-Davis both hired graduates of local

universities (the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan, respectively) to

form two of the first in-house research labs in the United States. Looking at a larger sample,

we draw on evidence of the geographic mobility of university graduates from the Chemical

Who’s Who, a directory published in 1928 that contains biographical sketches of executives

and researchers in the chemical industry. For a sample of the thirty largest labs in the

National Research Council (NRC) volume of 1927, we collected information on the

educational background and location of first employment of executives listed in the Who’s

Who. Many of the executives, whether directly involved in research or not, came from

scientific backgrounds, and the biographical information on the location of an individual’s

alma mater and post-graduate employment is instructive whether or not the individual joined

the company immediately upon graduation. The information we collected revealed that the

first employment after graduation from a university was very often in the same city as the

university, and that many firms seemed to hire graduates of nearby universities. While the

extent of this practice varied by firm, the firms that did hire from nearby universities

(“nearby” defined loosely to include universities within 100 or 200 miles of the lab) tended

to hire almost exclusively from those universities. For example, at Sharp and Dohme of

Baltimore, one of the two directors of pharmaceutical research listed in the Who’s Who in


11
     In the NRC publication, this is described as “grants to university labs for research projects in support of
     program of association.”


                                                                                                             19
1928 was J.C. Krantz, a former professor at the University of Maryland and a former

lecturer at Johns Hopkins. The other director of pharmaceutical research graduated from the

Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and had worked at Mulford and Co. in Philadelphia

before joining Sharp and Dohme. One laboratory superintendent (C. Neal) was a graduate

of the University of Maryland department of Pharmacy, and another superintendent (E.

Miller) earned a doctorate from Johns Hopkins. Of the nine employees and executives

whose educational credentials are described in the Who’s Who, six joined after studying or

working at Johns Hopkins or the University of Maryland. Three were graduates of the

Philadelphia College of Pharmacy (two of whom came to Sharp & Dohme after initial

employment at Mulford & Co) and one came to Sharp & Dohme after working as a

professor at the University of Vermont.12

          Another example of localization in early research collaborations, Eli Lilly & Co., of

Indianapolis, Indiana, engaged in collaborative research with Purdue University. Lilly hired

Purdue grads, like director of research development H.W. Rhodehamel, chief pharmacist

F.E. Bibbins, and assistant chief engineer J.C. Siegesmund.                Pharmaceutical research

scientist E.H. Stuart was a graduate of Indiana University. The majority of Lilly employees

whose credentials are listed in the Who’s Who were graduates of Indiana universities. Of the

ten listed university-educated employees of Eli Lilly & Co. of Indianapolis, four were

graduates of Purdue University (62 miles away in West Lafayette) who joined Lilly upon

graduation. Two attended other universities in Indiana (DePauw and Indiana University),

one came from the U.S. Industrial Alcohol Co. in New Orleans after graduating from

Louisiana State University, and the others studied at Trinity College and the Philadelphia


12
     Sharpe and Dohme acquired Mulford around this time (officially, 1929; Galambos, 1995) , which may
     explain the number of Sharpe and Dohme executives that Who’s Who credits with Mulford experience.


                                                                                                   20
College of Pharmacy. As we discuss in some more detail below, Lilly also provides an

interesting example of early firms’ abilities to work with distant researchers.

       At Abbott Labs of Chicago, the president, Alfred Burdick, was a former professor at

the Illinois Medical College; consulting scientist Roger Adams was chair of the department

of Chemistry at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Adams’ former student,

Henry Volwiler, chief chemist in 1928 (later president and chairman of the board), was a

graduate of the University of Illinois, as was Floyd Thayer, a former research chemist who

was in 1928 manager of the chemical sales department. Of the eight people listed, six joined

the firm after graduating from or working at an Illinois university. Swann notes that several

of Adams’ students also went on to join Abbott (1988).

       In contrast to these examples, there are fifty-five individuals listed as employees of

Du Pont, and the list of universities is almost as long. It is clear that not every firm in the

industry hired graduates of local universities – mainly because it was not always the case

that local universities produced graduates with the skills required during this period.

Although the Who’s Who was published in 1928, most of the individuals who appear in it

had been with the firms for many years, most of them having been hired in the previous

decade or earlier.

       The example of Alfred Newton Richards’ work for Merck provides one example

how academics played active roles in the establishment of in-house R&D labs. Richards

essentially acted as a head-hunter and recruiter when Merck set up its in-house facilities

starting in 1930. Richards was professor of pharmacology and vice-president of medical

affairs at the University of Pennsylvania. As Swann notes, “The University of Pennsylvania

was a logical site for Merck to establish connections for biomedical research and clinical




                                                                                            21
investigations of its drugs. Pennsylvania was a major research institution with access to

extensive clinical facilities; the university was conveniently located not far from Rahway;

and most important, Merck had close contact with one of the faculty whom the university

community esteemed – Newton Richards” (Swann, 1988, 74-75). Richards acted as a

liaison between Merck and the academic community, helping not just in recruiting but also

in the organization of collaborative projects. Students and clinicians at Penn carried out the

investigation and testing of methylcholine, a vasodilator eventually marketed by Merck as

Mecholyl Chloride. Pharmacologists at Penn also helped develop Vinethene, an anaesthetic

originally discovered by a pharmacologist at the University of California Medical School.

Merck “did not feel that it would be advantageous to spend a great deal of money for the

pharmacological study of vinyl ether in California. The distance was so great that a true

cooperation could not be obtained.”13 Instead, the work was undertaken by clinical faculty

at the more geographically proximate University of Pennsylvania.

           While firms with larger R&D budgets often engaged academic consultants at more

distant universities who were specialists in a specific field, younger and smaller firms appear

to have been more likely to collaborate with local academics.                            Starting in 1925,

Northwestern University chemist Arthur Tatum did routine testing a few times a year for the

small Chicago firm Cook Laboratories. Tatum had no unique knowledge of the drugs he

tested, and Swann notes that “Cook probably engaged Tatum simply because of his

proximity to the firm” (Swann, 1988, p. 103). Selman Waksman worked part-time at nearby

Cutter Laboratories while a graduate student at UC Berkeley and at Takamine Labs of New

Jersey while a young assistant professor at Rutgers (Israel, 2004).

       Geographic proximity appears to matter most for (a) labs at early stages of

development, or (b) relatively informal or occasional consulting contracts on general

scientific matters, but not large-scale research projects requiring specialized scientific

knowledge. For example, Lilly had 4 general consultants at nearby universities by 1943: an

organic chemist from U Chicago ($2000/yr), chemical engineer from Purdue ($600/yr),

biochemist from U Illinois ($600/yr), organic chemist from U Indiana ($2,400/yr) (Swann,

1988, p. 52). However, Lilly’s large-scale collaborative research projects were undertaken

with researchers at more distant universities, for example their collaboration with Banting

and Best’s work on synthesizing insulin at the University of Toronto, and with scientists at

Harvard and the University of Rochester on the treatment of pernicious anemia in the 1920s

(Swann, 1988, Chapter 5).

       III.2.3. Some from early university-firm interactions: Data from patents

       Some of the fruits of the early collaborations between universities and

pharmaceutical firms can be found in data on firm-level patenting in the 1930s. Combining

data gleaned from original patent documents with the 1930 and 1935 registries of the

American Chemical Society, we have identified the affiliations of many of the inventors

listed on the patents granted to the firms in our sample in 1938. Among the subset of patents

for which we were able to identify at least one inventor’s affiliation, approximately 13%

included at least one academic inventor. (We were able to identify the inventors for 184 of

the 384 patents we examined.) Among prominent pharmaceutical firms Abbott, Lilly, and

Parke-Davis, 50%, 56%, and 67% of patents granted, respectively, included academic

inventors (when the inventor could be identified in the ACS directory). Other well-known

firms with academic inventors include Merck (1 of 8 patents whose inventors could be



                                                                                          23
identified had an academic inventor) and Sharp and Dohme (1 of 1). Some smaller firms,

including Ostro Research Labs Lewis Chemical Co, Sonneborn and Sons, Zonite Products

Corp., and Commercial Solvents Corp. also included academic inventors on their patents, as

did Monsanto (although for only 2 of 21 patents with identifiable inventors). While this

sample is not sufficiently large to derive substantial statistical power, it provides suggestive

evidence of considerable academic involvement in important research-oriented tasks in

some pharmaceutical firms as early as 1938.



III.3. Reciprocal relationships: Historical evidence of the influence of early 20th century
       firms on academic science

       In addition to the documented episodes of academic researchers’ roles in nurturing

the birth and growth of industrial pharmaceutical research, the historical record suggests that

a number of companies were influential in shaping the evolution of university research

programs. The relationships between Merck and Rutgers University and DuPont and the

University of Delaware appear to be illustrative of this phenomenon.

       Merck’s choice of Rahway, NJ as the location for the plant it built in 1899 –

influenced in part by a board member who owned land in the community (Feldman and

Schreuder, 1996, p. 856) – proved propitious for nearby Rutgers University. In the 1930s,

Merck developed a relationship with microbiologist Selman Waksman of the College of

Agriculture at Rutgers. Starting in 1939, Merck agreed to supply assistance for antibiotics

developed by Waksman, who would assign all ensuing patents to Merck in exchange for a

2.5% royalty to be paid to Rutgers. In 1943 Waksman developed streptomycin, a new

blockbuster antibiotic that was less toxic and more effective (particularly in treating

tuberculosis) than existing alternatives. Motivated by fear of a public outcry over the



                                                                                             24
monopolization of such an important drug, Waksman and Rutgers convinced Merck to

relinquish their rights to Waksman’s patents to the Rutgers Research and Endowment Fund,

which licensed the patent to several competing companies. The Fund collected $12 million

in royalties from Waksman’s discoveries over the next forty years.                         Swann quotes

Waksman, whose work earned the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1952, as suggesting that he

owed more to support from Merck than from Rutgers for the discoveries (Swann, 1988).14

           The University of Delaware’s relationship with Du Pont proved to be similarly

beneficial to that institution. Established in 1802 on the banks of the Brandywine river, in

part because the location provided easy access to waterpower and an abundant supply of

willow trees (from which charcoal could be produced), Du Pont was founded long before

chemical research was widespread in American universities and, consequently, without

regard to the availability of local academic science.               Nonetheless, Du Pont played an

important role in the subsequent development of scientific research at the University of

Delaware through a number of significant gifts from the Du Pont family and other

individuals associated with Du Pont. In 1924, the first physics professor was brought to

Delaware with the help of Lammot Du Pont, who contributed $2,000 for equipment and

pledged an additional $600 a year for five years, half for research equipment and half to top

off the new professor’s salary (Munroe, 2004, Chapter 9).                    The university’s chemical

laboratory was established between 1935 and 1937 with a $300,000 gift from Fletcher

Brown, a former Du Pont Vice President. Brown also made a donation to supplement the

salary of Allan Colburn, a Du Pont engineer who became the first professor of Chemical

Engineering at Delaware in April 1938. Chemical Engineering quickly became the most

     Waksman stated that, “Without the help…of an industrial organization that took over a major part of the
     pharmacological evaluation of the antibiotic [streptomycin] and large-scale production our contribution
     would have never attained its goal” (Swann, 1998, p. 90).

experiment station (Munroe, 2004, Chapter 10).



IV.        Data on Universities and Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories, 1920-1946

           We use the historical and mainly qualitative evidence of the preceding section to

inform and complement a quantitative analysis of the role of academic science in the

establishment of industrial research labs. Our analysis takes advantage of data on the

number of research labs by city over several years from the publication Industrial Research

Laboratories of the United States, collected by the National Research Council. In 1920 the

National Research Council began to circulate surveys inquiring about firms’ industrial

research activities. While the term “industrial research” was interpreted broadly to include

development and product improvement, the term “laboratory” was restricted to apply only to

those departments of companies that had “separate and permanently established research

staff and equipment,” excluding “firms that indicated they only occasionally carry out

research, using teams temporarily recruited for the purpose or assembled from their

operating staffs” (Industrial Research Laboratories of the United States, 1956, Introduction,

testing and analysis but no research.

           These publications contain information on the characteristics of industrial research

labs in nineteen years between 1920 and 1985.15 In the earliest years in which the series was

published, these characteristics include the firm’s address, the number of its research

employees, and a brief description of its activities. In later years, the surveys list the labs’

     The years in which volumes were published are: 1920, 1927, 1931, 1933, 1938, 1940, 1946, 1948, 1950,
     1956, 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975, 1977, 1979, 1982, 1983, and 1985.

founding dates, number of scientific and other personnel by type (i.e.: biologists, chemists,

etc.), the names of important researchers, scientific journals published by the lab, and their

partners in collaborative research.16

         We combine these data with (a) information on American universities drawn from

the Bulletin of the Office of Higher Education (Biennial of Education) and the American

Council on Education’s serial publication American Universities and Colleges17 and (b) data

on county-level population and manufacturing establishments drawn from the US censuses

of population and US censuses of manufacturing, respectively, for the years 1920-1950.18

By including population and manufacturing data in the county-level regressions, we control

for the extent to which the size, magnitude of economic activity, and, to a degree,

urbanization affect the extent of industrial pharmaceutical research in US counties.

         Figures 4, 5, and 6 plot the industrial research labs, universities, and manufacturing

establishments, by county on maps of the United States, respectively.19 The figures suggest

that manufacturing and industrial research were more concentrated (particularly in the

manufacturing belt of the Northeast/Midwest) than were population and universities and

colleges. Table 2 provides summary statistics from the dataset. It shows that counties with

more      Ph.D.-granting        universities      tend     to    have     a    much       larger     number       of

chemical/pharmaceutical industrial research labs per capita, in each year of the sample. We

restrict ourselves to data on the number of labs per county in the years 1927, 1938, and

1946.

   Starting in 1950, the volumes also contain indices of universities that participate in collaborative research,
   indicating whether or not the university possesses “facilities for research in practically all fields of science”,
   its facilities are limited to specific fields, or it has particular capabilities in certain areas.

V.         Evaluating the Role of Universities as a Determinant of Pharmaceutical
           Laboratory Growth

           Table 3a contains results from panel regressions in which the dependent variable is

the number of pharmaceutical industrial research labs by county and year. Because our

dependent variables are non-negative integers truncated at zero (i.e., count variables), we

employ Negative Binomial regressions designed to account for these characteristics of the

data. To facilitate the interpretation of the coefficients on the covariates as elasticities, each

of these enters in logs.20 Each regression includes county population and the number of

manufacturing establishments in the county to control for factors associated with county size

and economic composition.                    Throughout the Table, we address county-specific

heterogeneity by controlling for the impact of initial conditions (conditions in the county in

1927) on the number of laboratories in subsequent years of the data.

           In the first four columns of Table 3a, we model the number of pharmaceutical labs in

a county as a function of county population, county manufacturing establishments, the initial

number of pharmaceutical labs in the county in 1927, and, depending on the column, both

the 1927 count and contemporaneous count of Chemistry or Science-oriented PhDs granted

by universities in the county.21 The initial number of pharmaceutical labs in the county

helps control for county-level heterogeneity, but is also relevant for adjudicating competing

hypotheses regarding the birth of industrial research labs. Specifically, the significance and

direction of the coefficient on initial labs helps evaluate whether their growth is random or

follows a pattern consistent with convergence or divergence. This variable enters positively

and significantly in each of the models.                       That implies that counties with more

20
     In each case, we add 1 to the variable before taking logs.
21
     These variables are expressed in logs to account for heteroskedasticity.


                                                                                                28
pharmaceutical labs in 1927 had faster rates of growth in labs to 1938 and 1946. Controlling

for other relevant factors, this suggests that counties with a larger number of initial

laboratories are more likely to experience laboratory births in the future, a pattern consistent

with the divergence hypothesis. The finding is consistent with the pattern of path dependent

growth evident in Feldman and Schreuder’s study of the early pharmaceutical industry in the

Mid-Atlantic region (1996). Divergence does not appear to be the only significant pattern in

the data, however.

            To investigate the hypothesis that universities exerted a significant influence on the

birth of industrial research labs, we employ the number of PhDs awarded in a county as a

proxy for the extent to which local universities engage in relevant research.22 In Columns 1

and 2, we include the number of PhDs awarded in 1927 separately from the number of PhDs

awarded contemporaneously. In both cases, the contemporaneous number of PhDs is

positive and significant at the 1% level. The coefficients in these columns imply that,

holding observable county characteristics constant, an increase of 10% in the number of

Chemistry PhDs or overall Science PhDs is associated with a 4.0% and 3.2% increase in the

number of labs in the county, respectively. Consistent with the fact that there is a great deal

of autocorrelation in the geographic distribution of PhD graduates, the impact of

contemporaneous degrees awarded increases when the controls for initial conditions are

removed in Columns 3 and 4. Although we do not report them here, the results obtained

using county-level data in Table 3a are consistent with estimates we obtained using MSA-

level data. It is also worth noting that these results are not driven by those counties in which


22
     We also obtained data on the universities’ research expenditures for certain years. While this variable comes
     closer to the effect we are trying to estimate, it is not available for every university in every year. As a result,
     we use number of PhD degrees awarded, which is perhaps noisier but we would argue a reasonable proxy for
     the research effort of the university.


                                                                                                                     29
the largest firms (e.g., such as Abbott, Lilly, and Merck) reside. The key results in 3a are

robust to the exclusion of counties that include firms whose R&D employment falls into the

top 10 percent of the distribution. The results are also robust to the exclusion of all counties

in states in New England and the Mid-Atlantic area (i.e., MD, DE, PA, NJ, NY, CT, RI,

MA, VT, NH, and ME).

       While we would like to model the growth of pharmaceutical employment in addition

to the number of labs over this period, the NRC data on lab employment are less reliable.

For example, employment data may reflect total firm employment rather than lab-level

employment, and, for about 10% of the observations, no employment data are listed.

Although these data are more noisy, we estimate the correlates of county-level R&D

workers in Table 3b. The pattern of divergence evident in the laboratory models remains in

these models; however, the influence of lagged and contemporaneous PhD graduates is

statistically insignificant in models that include all of the laboratories in the data (Columns

1-3). The number of PhD graduates does enter in a statistically and economically significant

way, however, in certain models that include only the first laboratory listed for each firm.

(As a rule, the first laboratory listed is also the headquarters laboratory for the firm.) In

Columns 5, the number of contemporaneous Science PhDs enters positively and

significantly at the 1% level, although the initial number of county Science PhDs is

statistically insignificant. The coefficient on contemporaneous Science PhDs suggests that

10% higher Science PhD graduates is correlated with 90% more laboratory employment in

the county.     Neither 1927 nor contemporaneous Chemistry PhDs graduates enters

significantly when both are included in models of county R&D employment (in Column 4);

however, when the initial number of Chemistry PhDs is omitted (in Column 6), the




                                                                                             30
contemporaneous count is significant at the 1% level. Considering the noisiness of the lab-

level counts of R&D employment, we interpret these results as suggestive of a relationship

between proximate academic science and county R&D employment, at least in the case of

headquarters facilities.

           Table 4 contains the results of conditional fixed-effects Negative Binomial

regressions run on all years (1927, 1938, and 1946) and including a county-level fixed effect

to control for time-invariant characteristics of the county that may be associated with both

the location of R&D and academic science. The coefficients in Table 4 are thus identified

by changes over time in the number of PhDs granted and the extent of R&D located in a

county. They continue to exhibit a positive and significant association between academic

research in Chemistry and in science more broadly (with a slightly larger effect coming from

Chemistry) after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across counties.

           In this table, we also present estimates that use a distance-weighted count of PhDs

within a 500 mile radius of the county in which the lab is located.23 These distance-

weighted counts are calculated by summing up PhDs granted by all universities within 500

miles, weighted by the distance between the county and the lab. That is, we calculate

                      PHDs j
PhD _ wtit = ∑ j                 ,
                      1 + d ij

where PhD_wt for firm i is the number of PhDs nearby, weighted by the distance between

firm i and university j. Nearby PhDs would get a very high weight (very low inverse

weight), whereas PhD 500 miles away make almost no contribution to the count. We

calculate these variables and estimate the relationship between them and the R&D variables


23
     We thank Toby Stuart for suggesting a distance-weighted measure. We modeled our PhD count on the “IPO
     concentration” measure found in Stuart and Sorensen (2003).


                                                                                                       31
because of concerns about the arbitrary nature of county boundaries. The fact that M.I.T.,

located in Middlesex county, MA, is a stone’s throw from Boston and Suffolk county means

that when we use county boundaries to define the radius within which we expect spillovers

to take place, we will sometimes miss important potential relationships at the boundaries of

counties. We use the distance-weighted counts as a robustness check, and find that similar

results are obtained whether we use county boundaries or a continuous distance-weighted

measure to define the location of “nearby” academic science.

           It should be noted here that the data on research labs may not be exhaustive of all the

labs in existence for the early years during which it was collected. The Appendix to this

paper reproduces an excerpt from the introduction to the 1927 edition of the series. It

explains that members of the main scientific and engineering associations were consulted in

order to establish a list of firms known to have in-house research labs, and the published

information is based on surveys were sent to these firms. It is important to determine what

effect this sampling bias might have on the results, that is, whether the correlation between

labs and universities per county could be an artifact of the way the sample was constructed.

If, for example, regional branches of scientific and engineering associations tended to be

located near universities, they may have had more information about research labs in the

surrounding community. To guard against this possibility, we ran regressions that include a

dummy variable equal to 1 if there was a branch of the American Chemical Society (ACS)

located in county i in year t.24 In the event that a bias is introduced by the tendency of ACS

branches to locate near universities, this dummy will correct for that bias. Column 5 of

Table 3a shows that the coefficient in the on the number of chemistry PhDs is slightly

24
     These data were obtained from the Directory of Members of the American Chemical Society. Directories
     from 1924, 1930, and 1947 listed the locations of branch headquarters and the year in which they were
     chartered.


                                                                                                       32
reduced, but remains significant at the 5% level. Similar results are obtained for the other

specifications if the ACS branch dummy is included.



VI.        Mechanisms of university-industry interaction: Collaboration

           We look more closely at the role played by proximity to academic science in Table

5, in which the firm’s decision to collaborate with academic scientists is modeled as a

function of the extent of research undertaken at nearby universities. The number of PhDs in

science or chemistry awarded by local universities is positively and significantly associated

with the propensity of pharmaceutical firms to engage in collaborative research with

universities. Firms with larger numbers of researchers are significantly more likely to

engage in cooperative research, and older firms are slightly more likely to collaborate with

academic scientists.25 We also estimated specifications including the manufacturing or

population intensities of the county, and these variables were insignificantly associated with

the probability of collaboration.             To test the hypothesis that collaboration with local

academic scientists was more important for firms at different stages of the life cycle, we

include interaction effects of local chemistry research with age and size in columns 4 and 5.

The coefficient on the interaction of age and nearby PhDs in chemistry is insignificant at the

5% level. This is slightly surprising, considering our expectation that younger firms might

be relatively lacking in internal research capabilities and therefore more likely to benefit

from collaboration with local scientists. The effect of local academic chemistry research

does not appear to vary according to firm size, however, since the interaction of firm size

and chemistry PhDs is not significant at the 5% level.


25
     When the age variable is included, the number of observations falls because age is only observed in the 1946
     sample.


                                                                                                             33
VII.       Statistical evidence on the influence of private industry on university programs

           Our qualitative evidence suggests that the research needs of large firms played a role

in the evolution of at least a few universities. Our quantitative analysis offers mixed support

for this proposition. Table 6 reports the results of logit regressions at the level of the

university that examine the determinants of the adoption of a chemical engineering program

for the first time between 1937 and 1947. We use the full sample of universities and

colleges drawn from the publication American Colleges and Universities, excluding

religious seminaries, teacher’s colleges, and junior colleges. Data on engineering programs

in American universities are drawn from the United States Office of Education’s Bulletins.26

The dependent variable takes on the value 1 if the university established a department of

chemical engineering for the first time between 1937 and 1947, and 0 if not. Universities

that had already established programs by 1937 are omitted from the analysis. This variable

is regressed on a measure of pharmaceutical research in industry in the county in 1938, the

population and number of manufacturing establishments in the county in 1940 and 1939

respectively, and the growth of population, manufacturing, and industrial research in

pharmaceuticals during the period.27 The results show that universities located in counties

that were centers of research in the pharmaceutical industries in 1938 were significantly

more likely to establish a department of chemical engineering between that year and 1947,

even after controlling for the growth of the industry during that period. This appears to be

evidence of a feedback effect in which the presence nearby firms influenced the programs

offered by universities.           Such effects were not evident, however, when we looked at


26
     The Bulletins, part of the series “Accredited Higher Institutions” were published in 1938 and 1948.
27
     For universities in cities that fall in multiple counties, we use the average of these variables.


                                                                                                           34
universities that began granting Ph.D.s in Chemistry during this period. We were also

unable to find evidence of “anchor” effects in the data (Agrawal and Cockburn, 2003;

Feldman, 2003), in which especially large firms had a particularly large impact on the

growth of local university programs in sciences or chemistry.



VIII. Instrumental Variables Estimates

       Preceding sections of this paper document a statistically significant, positive

relationship between the number of pharmaceutical industrial research laboratories in a

county and university research in a county, after controlling for other variables likely to

influence the location decision of R&D labs and including a county-specific fixed effect.

These results imply that growth over time in the amount of university research (as measured

by the number of PhDs granted) in a county was associated with growth over time in

pharmaceutical R&D in a county. However, because university research is also likely to

have been stimulated by nearby industrial research (through consulting contracts, joint

research projects, demand for graduates, etc.), we cannot necessarily infer a causal

interpretation from this relationship. Indeed, the stories of Chemical Engineering at the

University of Delaware and the streptomycin royalties at Rutgers, together with the results

presented in Table 6, illustrate the possibility of “feedback effects” from firms to

universities during this period. As Geiger observes, “but if the universities were dedicated

to science, broadly speaking, by the beginning of the twentieth century, it was not yet

evident that science was or ought to be beholden to universities. Scientific investigation was

undertaken in government bureaus and in semi-independent laboratories… [E]ven by 1920




                                                                                           35
the research universities could not be assured of being the primary locus of basic research”

(Geiger, 1986).

       Panel estimates of the relationship between university and industrial research are

likely to be characterized by simultaneity – research universities attracted industrial

laboratories, and the research conducted in these laboratories affected nearby academic

departments. In this section, we use instrumental variables to correct for this simultaneity

bias. The instruments are the amount of money obtained as the proceeds of the sale of land

and scrip granted to the state under the Morrill Act of 1862, and a dummy variable equal to

1 if a university in the county was founded before 1800.

       The Morrill Act established the “land-grant” colleges by giving the states public

lands that could be sold and to finance the colleges. A state received 30,000 acres for each

member of its congressional delegation, and since the smallest states had at least two

senators and one representative, the minimum land grant consisted of 90,000 acres. The

Hatch Act of 1887 provided funding for agricultural experiment stations, and a second

Morrill Act in 1890 extended the land grant provisions to southern states.

       While the amount of land granted under the Morrill Act was proportional to the size

of the state, the sale price per acre obtained by states varied considerably, and for somewhat

aleatory reasons. Nevins (1963) writes that:

       “A great deal of obscurity yet surrounds the precise disposition made by some states of their
       share of the Morrill grant…Many university historians tend to pass over the disposition of
       the grants hastily…partly because the story has occasional elements of folly and rascality
       that make it embarrassing. A number of states let the land scrip slip through their fingers;
       fingers loosed by negligent officers, pried apart by speculators, or even greased by
       corruptionists” (p. 29).

Rhode Island was granted 120,000 acres, and asked Rev. Horace T. Love (president of

Brown University) to select the land for sale. He went west in the summer of 1863, and




                                                                                                 36
came back “to report that the task was impossibly heavy, for it involved choosing lands,

paying taxes, negotiating sales, and defending titles” and a committee of five was appointed

by Love to take charge. The committee then sold the land to Love in 1865 for $50,000 (the

lowest amount received by any state, and the third lowest per acre), accepting payment over

five years with no interest. Nevins is “not astonished to learn that the sale aroused much

criticism.” In Pennsylvania, “Heavy pressure had come from an unholy partnership of land

speculators, anxious to obtain a bargain, and officers of the state college, anxious to get

funds for a new start” Other states in which the sale of Morrill lands was bungled include

New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Connecticut (all quotes from Nevins, 1963, p. 29-31).

           In contrast, states like New York managed to turn the grants into more significant

endowments. Faced with a glut of land scrip and depressed land prices following the Act,

Ezra Cornell purchased New York’s scrip and held it until prices rose. When Cornell

returned the land and profits to the university in 1905, the value had risen almost seven-fold,

to $5,460,038. California, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Nebraska, also obtained

higher prices per acre for their scrip. The appendix lists the acreage granted and amount

obtained at sale, by land grant institution.28

           The price per acre obtained for Morrill Act land grants had a long-run impact on

university finances. The states that obtained the most for their scrip are the ones that are

even today home to the better-funded public universities. However, because the price per

acre obtained by the states varied substantially for reasons unrelated to the state’s

attractiveness to industrial research labs seventy years hence, it constitutes a valid

instrument.



28
     These data come from the U.S. Office of Education’s Biennial of Higher Education, 1928.


                                                                                               37
       The instruments vary by county – they equal zero for all counties not containing a

public university. There may be some concern that states placed universities in counties

with heavy manufacturing concentration, and that for this reason the land grant instrument is

correlated with the errors. While it is true that states had a mandate to serve agricultural and

manufacturing interests through public universities, we feel that this concern is misplaced

because any influence the location of manufacturing in the mid- to late-nineteenth century

may have had on the location of public universities is controlled for through the inclusion in

the regression of the number of manufacturing establishments in the county.

       Table 7a presents results of a two-stage least squares (2SLS) model in which the

endogenous variable is log of the number of PhDs granted in a county, and the instruments

are the original sale price received by states for land and scrip obtained through the Morrill

Act and the dummy for universities founded before 1800. Two sets of regressions results

are included, one with the log of the number of labs on the left hand side, and another with

the log of R&D employment. We control for manufacturing, population, and year and

region fixed effects (county or state fixed effects could not be included due to collinearity

with the instruments).    The relationship between university research in a county and

pharmaceutical R&D is positive and significant at the 5% level after instrumenting, whether

research is proxied by Chemistry PhDs or Science PhDs. The first-stage F-statistic (from

the regression of the endogenous variable on the instruments) is 64.4 for chemistry and 76.3

for science. These values are well above the “rule-of-thumb” F-statistic of 10 proposed by

Staiger and Stock (1997) as a test for weak instruments.

       To be consistent with the rest of the estimates in the paper, which use the Negative

Binomial model to account for the discrete, non-negative nature of the dependent variable,




                                                                                             38
Table 7b presents non-linear two-stage least squares estimates obtained using the

Generalized Method of Moments (GMM).29 The GMM estimates remain positive and

significant at the 5% level when the left-hand-side variable is the number of labs. However,

when we estimate the causal effect of local academic science on R&D employment in the

county, the effect is not significant. We also tried estimating the IV models with distance-

weighted PhDs on the right-hand-side, and obtained similar results – a positive, significant

effect of science or chemistry PhDs when the dependent variable is the number of labs, but a

positive, insignificant effect when the dependent variable is lab employment.                      The

instruments are also equally valid when we use distance-weighted PhDs.

          How do the effects compare to the un-instrumented effects displayed in Table 4? In

the fixed-effects Poisson estimates, the elasticity of the number of labs with respect to the

number of Chemistry PhDs is 0.450, implying that a 10% increase in the number of

Chemistry PhDs awarded in a county is associated with a 4.5% increase in the number of

pharmaceutical research laboratories nearby, controlling for county-specific fixed effects.

After instrumenting, the elasticity of labs with respect to Chemistry PhDs found in the

GMM estimates in Table 7b is 0.325. The elasticity with respect to science PhDs sees a

similar reduction from 0.342 to 0.224.



IX.       Discussion

          The 1920s, 30s, and 40s saw the diffusion of an organizational innovation in the

form of the in-house R&D laboratory in the United States. Also during this period, the

modern American research university developed and collaborative linkages emerged

between industrial and academic researchers.           We argue that universities played an

important role in the emergence of industrial research situated within the boundaries of the

firm, and we present evidence that R&D labs located near universities benefited from

increased access to academic scientists and graduates. The results described in this paper

characterize the relationship between universities and the pharmaceutical industry between

1927 and 1946. They demonstrate that industrial and academic research were co-located,

and that proximity to university research was associated with a greater likelihood that firms

adopt industrial research facilities and collaborate with academic scientists.

       Our qualitative and quantitative analyses provide evidence consistent with the

possibility of feedback effects, according to which university programs were affected by the

presence of pharmaceutical industry activity. Specifically, our empirical results suggest that

universities located near larger numbers of industrial research labs in chemistry and

pharmaceuticals as of 1938 were more likely to establish new programs of chemical

engineering by 1946.

       In an attempt to identify the causal effect of academic science on the growth of

industrial research, we employ an instrumental variables approach to correct for simultaneity

bias in our estimates of the impact of university research on the birth of industrial research

laboratories. In sum, our analyses suggest that while the presence of industrial facilities

helped shape the direction of university research programs, there was a significant, positive,

and causal effect running from university research to the growth of industrial research

laboratories in the first half of the twentieth century in the United States.

Appendix A: Introduction from the 1927 National Research Council survey

“The continued demand for information regarding industrial research laboratories has made
it seem advisable to issue a second revision of the list originally published in Number 2 and
revised in Number 16 of the Bulletin of the National Research Council. The original
publication, compiled in 1920 by Mr. Alfred D. Flinn, Secretary of the Engineering
Foundation, listed about 300 industrial laboratories. The first revision prepared in August
1921, by Miss Ruth Cobb of the Research Information Service, listed 526 laboratories. The
present revision contains data for 1,000 laboratories.
        As in the earlier lists, all information given in this publication has been obtained
directly by correspondence and statements are based upon information supplied by
laboratories….In preparing the mailing list of new companies to which questionnaires
should be sent, the Research Information Service sought the cooperation of the secretaries of
the local divisions of the American Chemical Society, the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, the American Society of Civil Engineers and the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers; most of the secretaries supplied a list of the industrial laboratories in
their community…”
