                   STRUCTURAL/FRICTIONAL AND DEMAND-DEFICIENT
                       UNEMPLOYMENT IN LOCAL LABOR MARKETS


                                    ABSTRACT


     This paper uses data on unemployment rates and job vacancy rates to
measure structural/frictional and demand-deficient components of unemployment

rate differences   across local labor markets.   Data on occupational and indus-

trial distributions   of uneaployed workers and vacant jobs, as well as on

local wages, recent sales growth, Unemployment    Insurance,   and demographics

are then used to help account for these components of unemployment across

local areas.

I.   Introduction

          Economists frequently categorize unemployment into frictionaL,

structural and demand-deficient components.             Frictional    unemployment generally

refers to the normal movement of individuals into and out of jobs while

structural unemployment refers to particular difficulties in this process,

caused by "mismatches" of skill, locations, etc.                Demand—deficient

                                        to a shortage of jobs relative to
unemployment, on the other hand, refers

workers    -
               i.e.,   an excess of Labor supply over labor demand           -at given wages.


Such an excess can result from cyclical factors and possibly from secular ones

as well, such as persistent non-market-clearing            wages)

          cJhile these categories     are fairly distinct conceptually, our ability             to


                 them empirically has been less successful.           At least part of this
distinguish

difficulty lies in our uncertainty over how             these   components    should he

measured.      Analyses of aggregate movements over time have centered on

calculations of the "non—accelerating inflation rate of unemployment'                     (NAIRU),

though    our ability to measure this rate from time-series data when the rate

itself has been changing over time has been limited.2                Note recently, Lilien

(1982) has      focused on   the variance   irt   employment growth across       industries as a

measure of structural unemployment induced by sectoral shifts.                   This

                                                                     others.
interpretation has been challenged by Abraham and Katz (1986), among

          A more direct measure of job availability and therefore of demand—

deficiencies      is the job vacancy rate, which has been widely analyzed La Great

Britain and other        OEO   countries.   But since these data are not regularly

collected by the federal government           in the U.S., they have not been used very

extensively here in sorting out types of unemployment.                Analyses of aggregate

movements over time have sometimes used the Conference Board's Help-Wanted

Index as a proxy for the trend in the aggregate—vacancy               rate (e.g., Abraham

and Katz (1986), Abraham (1987)).           Aside from these studies, only Abraham
                                            2




(1963) has used actual survey data on job vacancies        to decompose unemployment

in the U.S. into its structural/frictional and demand—deficient components.

       In this study I use data on unemployment rates and vacancy rates          to

sort out structural/frictional and demand—deficient components of unemployment

differences across local labor markets.         A fairly large literature already

exists on local and regional unemployment rates which stresses "equilibrium"

differences between markets (e.g., Hall (1970), Reza (1978), :lurphy end Hofler

(1985)).     These studies stress local differences in wages, amenities,      transfer

payments/Unemployment    Insurance, and population demographics.      Alternatively,

studies focusing on "disequilibrium" differences (e.g., Marston (1985), Topel

(1986), stress local demand shocks which may require migration across areas in

order to re-establish equilibrium.       Others have focused on different regional

sensitivities    to aggregate cyclical fluctuations     (e.g., Brown (1978), Rones

(1986)) in analyzing    disequilibrium differences.     While   the "disequilibrium"


components    of unemployment clearly center on relative demand differences

across areas,    the "equilibrium"   components generally contain both demand-based

(due to wages) and frictional/structural elements (due to wages and other

factors mentioned above),3

       In this study I will use a cross-sectional analogue of the aggregate

"Beveridge Curve" (i.e., the unemployment rate-vacancy rate relationship)           to

estimate the structural/frictional     and demand-deficient     components of local

umemployment rate differentials.       I will them use data on the occupations and

industries of unemployed workers and job vacancies,        local wages, UI payments,

industries,   sales growth, and demographics in     trying to explain these
components.     This latter part of the analysis should help link this study to
the "equilibrium - disequilibrium" literatures on this topic. Comparisons of
results for different years will also shed light on how these relationships
change over the aggregate business     cycle.

       The vacancy data used for this analysis are computed from the

                                                                   and a
Employment Opportunity Pilot Project (Eon) Survey of Firms in 1980

followup survey (by Gallup, Inc.) in 1982.       These firms (about 5200 in 1980

and 3400 in 1982) are located in 28 local areas which were sites for the EOPP

labor market experiments of 1979 and 1980.       Of these areas, thirteen are

SMSA's and the rest are groups of counties.          The sites are heavily

concentrated   in the South and Hidweat,     though they cover a broad range of

industrial and demographic characteristics.          The list of sites appears in the

tables of the Appendix at the end of the paper.          Within sites, large and/or

low-wage firma were over-sampled.       However, sampling weights appear in the

data to correct for this.

       Vacancy   ratea   at   the level of the firm   have   been used to calculate
site-level rates.     These have been merged with published census data on

unemployment   rates for the same local labor markets.         The EOPP data are also

used for the calculation of area wage premia, while the census data are used

for occupational,    industrial and demographic data here.         FinalLy, state-wide

data on UI benefits from Department of Labor publications are merged with the

various site-level data as well.

It.   The Model and the Data

        The relationahip between unemployment rates and vacancy rates has been

studied extensively      in the   "Beveridge Curve" framework, which relates the two

            rates aa they move over the business cycle.          This relationship was
aggregate

first examined empirically by Dow and Dicka—Miraaux (1958) for Britain, and

theoretical formulations were developed by Molt and David (1966), Molt (1970)

and Hansen (1970).       More recent contributions    within the search framework

include those of Jackman et. al.       (1984) and Pisaarides     (1985).

        The standard theoretical treatment of this relatiooahip specifies a

steady-state movement of individuals into and out of unemployment that leaves
                                                      4




total unemployment unchanged -              i.e.,    inflows equal outflows.      Inflows into

unemployment      represent exogenously determined separation (or turnover)

probabilities         per period while outflows represent job accession

probabilities.         The latter will, in turn, reflect the stocks of unemployed

individuals and vacant jobs, their chances of contacting each other, and the

chances that offers will be made and accepted.                    More formally this can be

written as:

I)               tE

where 5, U, and V are stocks of employed workers, unemployed workers, and

vacant jobs respectively;           s     and       are worker and firm search intensities;       t


is the turnover rate out of employment; and b, x, and y are parameters of a
Cobb—Douglas production function of job matches (i.e., offers and acceptances)

for   a set of workers and vacant jobs.               Returns    to scale in matching   thus

reflect the sum of x and y.4

         Solving for the unemployment rate u we obtain

                        bsL

where v      is the   vacancy    rate.5     It is    clear that a tradeoff exists between
unemployment and vacancy           rates since:
                 du     -

                 dv                                 dlnv    —




Changes in the        level of labor       demand    relative to labor supply are captured       by

this tradeoff since

where   LD   and L5    represent the stocks of labor            demand end   supply
respectively. Changes in search intensity, the matching technology or
turnover, on the other hand, will shift the unemployment-vacancy locus inward
or outward. Shifts in the locus thus represemt changes in frictional and/or
structural      unemployment while movements along the locus capture demand-induced

unemployment changes (of a cyclical or more general nature).

         Jhile      this framework is generally used to analyze aggregate movements
over time,     it   can      also   be used   to consider a cross—section of local labor

markets.      If    we   hypothesize that a      common   matching function (characterized by
the   parameters x and         y) exists across local markets, then       we can   analyze

unemploynent        and vacancy rate differences across these markets.             As Roper and

Jackman (1937) have shown, the distribution of rates across these markets will

help to determine            the position of the aggregate Beveridge Curve.        Thus,

                                                      in the function) will
greater dispersion across sites (or greater convexity

lead to outward shifts in the aggregate curve, as shown in Figure 1.                    Greater

                                                                   and
dispersion reflects a greater geographic imbalance in unemployment

vacancies across sites, which would imply greater "structural" unemployment in

the aggregate.           Similarly,     the changes in unemployment and vacancies of these

local markets over the business cycle will determine the movement of the two

rates    along the aggregate curve as well, as shown in Figure 2.
          An empirical representation of such an unemployment vacancy-

reLationship in          a   cross-section of Local labor markets is:

t; and
latter might include the determinants of search intensity and the turnover
rate as well as the match technology in that market; i.e., anything which
helps    determine       frictional and/or structural        unemployment in that market.6

Such varfables should include measures of skills in the population, which

might determine the productivity of the matching technology; demographic
characteristics (e.g., age and sex), which might determine turnover; and
transfer payments            or Unemployment Insurance that might affect search

intensity.7

           Another         1eterminarit of the match              technology for each lo:al. arket is

the degree of balance between                   the occupational and industrial                  distributions          of

between the skills in which workers have invested and those needed for

available jobs.             Following Roper and Jackman, we estimate                       the degree of

           In                        would measure the variation in

to atructural/frictional factors. Simple and partial R2's should thus enable
us to measure these components.

           We    can    also    add   variables       to   'quation (5) which might heip to explain
differences across              local markets in           relative Labor demand - e.g., area                   wages,

industries,          and/or sales growth.              These variables        will hopefully shed some

light on        the sources of these demand differences arid                      perhaps       on their

                                            nature.        Wages and industries         might     also     contribute
equilibrium/disequilibrium

to   the   frictional          and structural         components      of   unemployment,        since    high

                                                     of job search while
average wages might themselves induce larger periods

industries might proxy                for   skill requirements on the demand side of the labor

market.         Finally,       we can   estimate these relationships               for different years to
see how      the     components of unemployment differences change with the aggregate

cyclical        environment.
          k   few additional comments are in order concerning the estimation of

this cross-sectional          relationship.     For one thing, the empirical functionaL

form suggested by       the    Cobb—Douglas function is the double log (see Equation

3), of which the rectangular hyperbola is a special case.                In our estimation

below, we will consider several functional forms and check them for goodness

of fit.

          Furthermore,    the model presented above assumes         that all markets are     in
a   steady-state with constant unemployment and vacancy rates.               While the non-

steady-state       dynamics of aggregate markets have been studied and even
estimated     on   occasion, there is little which can be done to estimate suci
dynamics      in a cross-section.8         Consequently   we will maintain the assumption

that all markets are in their steady state, though the empirical implications

of this being untrue will be considered.9

          Finally, we note that the vacancy rate and perhaps even some of the

shift    variables    (e.g., local wages and the age and education           of labor force)

in Equation (5) are endogenous.              This equation does not have a particular

casual interpretation;         rather, it represents a locus of steady-state points

determined     by a combination of demand and structural           factors whose effects we

are trying to measure.          Given this non—causal      interpretation,   the endogeneity

of some independent variables          does not pose a severe problem.

          We now move on to consider in greater detail the data with which

Equation (5) above will be estimated.              As mentioned   before, we aggregate

vacancy rates at the firm          level    in the EOPP data to obtain   market—level
rates.     Vacancies are defined as all jobs which are available             for immediate

occupancy.      Vacancy rates are defined as fractions of all jobs in these firms,

whether filled or vacant.           lowever, vacancies in 1980 were gauged by the

survey for non-managerial         and non-professional employees only.         These

employees are therefore omitted from the base group for that year as well.
                                           &




        The unemployment rates as well as demographic and industrial data for

each site were obtained      from the City and County Data Book (1983), based on

data from the 1980 Census.      County—level data were weighted by population         size

in each case to obtain the appropriate     variables for each site.      The

demographic variables which were used are the median age of the population,

the fractions of the population aged 25 or more with high school and college

degrees, and the fraction of the labor force that is female.          The fractions of

total employment found in manufacturing        and in services for each market are

also obtained from this source, whereas the fractions of unemployed workers in

each occupation and industry (used for construction of the 1k) were found in

the 1980 Census of Population      for each stataj0

          The Unemployment   Insurance measure used is the ratio of average weekly

benefits    to weekly wages, published state—wide by the Department       of Labor.11

Unemployment     rates for 1982 are published annual rates, using statewide

averages    for non-SMSA's)-2

          Finally, certain variables for each site are calculated       froe the EU??


survey.     The wage premia are the sample— and firm-size—weighted      means of

residuals from a Log wage equation using the EU?? data.         The wages used are


starting wages for the Last worker hired at each firm before the L980 survey,

while the controls are the age, education,        prior experience   and occupation    of


the worker hired.      The sales growth measures are weighted means of the Log of

(I   + percentage    sales growth) for the firms at each site between L979 and

1981.13

III.    Estiasted Results

          In   Table I we find a listing of all of the sites, along with their

unemployment and vacancy rates in 1980.         The results show that unemployment

rates exceed vacancy rates in every local labor market in 1980.           On the other

hand, substantial variation      exists across sites in the ratio of vacancy rates

to unemployment           rates.       If we interpret       this ratio as the fraction of

unemployment within each site that we                 cart    attribute   to structural      and

frictional factors             while     the remainder is attributable        to deficient demand),

we see that this fraction ranges from as much as .583 (in Cincinnati)                               to as

little as .046 (in Toledo).                 We must, however, note that an excess of

unemployed workers over vacant jobs does not by itself signify a suboptimal

market, since the cost of unemployment                   to individuals nay be less than the

costs of vacancies             to   firmsj4

          In Table 2, Part A we present summary statistics on unemployment                           rates

and vacancy rates for 1980 and 1982.                  Two different unemployment            rates are

presented.        The first is based on the published               rate for each relevent county

from the 1980 census, while the second represents the annual averages for

SMSA's and states (in place of non—SMSA's) for 1980 and 1982.                           The former wilL

be used below for most of the estimation                     in 1980, while   the latter will be

used only for comparisons of unemployment-vacancy                     relationships over different

points in the business cycle.

          These    results      show mean unemploynent rates of about           77.    in   1980 and   107.


in 1982, which 4re approximately                 the annual averages for each of those

years.     193O thus represents a moderately                  healthy aggregate economy, while

1982 represents          the    trough of a major recession.         Mean vacancy rates range

from about 1.5% in 1980 to about 1.2% in 1982.                      Unemployment      rates therefore

exceed    vacancy       rates   by    a substantial amount regardless of the economy's
position in       the   business cycle.
         However, we do observe the               inverse movements of the      two rates      as    the


aggregate    demand for labor changes over the                 cycle. This is especially clear
when we    consider the rates            within the subsample of SMSA's, which are based on

Large samples       and   are       presumably   measured with    less error than those of the
total    sample.    The aggregate economy, and individual                 local markets,      thus

appear to be moving along their respective '3everidge Curves'
demand declines.

        In Table 2, Part B we consider estimates of simple unemployment rate—

vacancy rate equations across sites.        The first set of equations presents

results using the Census—based       unemployment      rates for each site in 1980, while

the   second set presents results using the published SMSA and statewide data

for 1980 and 1982.      The equations are   estimated      ising weighted least Squares

to correct     for potential heteroscedasticity,       where the weights are the square

root of labor force size for each site.           Both unemployment rates and vacancy

rates appear in log form, ahich generally          provided the best fits (though

qudratic outperformed linear in all cases)J5

        The results of Table 2 show that differences           in vacancy rates account

for substantial fractions of the       total variation      in unemployment    rates across

local markets      (as measured by R2).   In Panel A, we see that the vacancy rate

accounts      for tbout 30% of the total variation       in unemployment.     Within the

sample of SMSA's this fraction rises to about 57%.             Estimated elasticities of

                                                            -.23 to -.34.                  If
unemployment with respect to vacancies also rise from about

                                                                these results
vacancy rates are measured with less error among the S)ISA's,16

imply that labor demand differences       (relative to labor supply) might account

for as much as half or more of the unemployment            rate differences across local

labor markets.

         The evidence of measurement      error in vacancy rates among smaller sites

led   us to   also consider the   possible use    of instruments for that variable.

Two—stage least-square estimation of this equation was therefore attempted
here. Using all of the Xkt variables as well as wage premia and industrial
                                                                    in
employment as instruments, the two-stage estimates were comparable
magnitude to the      OLS   estimates for the   SMSA   sample, though their precision      and


explanatory power were lower (coefficient              -.301, standard error    .102,
                                             Li


R2   = .249).   A simple E{ausman   test on the significsnce       of the instrumented


vacancy rate led us to drop it from the subsequent anslysisJ7

         The better fit achieved from nonlinear        functional forms relative to

linear ones also suggests that major shifts in labor demand scross markets

could have implications for sggregate        unemployment rates, since these rates

may rise more when demand declines       than they fall when demand rises.        Since

demand shifts across areas may have risen in frequency during the 1970's, the

convexity   of the estimated unemployment-vacancy       relationships might have

contributed     to the observed shifting   out of the aggregate "Severidge Curve"

during that decade.       (See Abraham (1987), Holzer (1988).)

         The comparison    of unemployment—vacancy    equations between 1980 and 1982

in the second set of equations shows a weaker effect for 1980 than appeared in

the first set, when only site—specific        unemployment    rates were used.

Nonetheless,    we find a substantial rise in the magnitude         of the demand effect

between L980 and 1982.      About 47% of     the unemployment variation is accounted

for by vacancies    in the total sample, and over 67% is accounted for within the

SNSA sample.     These fractions are more than twice the magnitudes          observed for

1980.    The coefficients on the vacancy variables       rise by comparable

magnitudes.

         These results indicate that relative        lAbor demand becomes a more

crucial determinant of unemployment        rate differences    across local markets when

the aggregate    economy enters a cyclical downturn.         The larger estimated

effects are also consistent with a movememt of the aggregate economy to a new

position along a comvex Beveridge Curve, as predicted by the model above and

as indicated in Figure 2.      Of course, the rise in the estimated coefficiemt on

vacancies   indicates    that the logarithic form may not be the correct one here,

                                                              18
though it provides      the best available approximation.

         hile   the estimates of Table 2 provide a glimpse at the importance of

demand differences    in explaining unemployment, we need to control for factors

that determine structural and frictional unemployment            as weii.1     Several

estimates are presented     in Table 3.     Among   the   control variables we include

our indices of occupational and industrial imbalance between unemployed

workers and vacant jobs.      Other conttol variables are chosen to reflect the

                                                              most important
demographic factors and transfer programs which should be the

determinants of job turnover and search durations.             They are also nost

frequently mentioned as oteritial causes of the outward shifts in Beveridge

and Phillips Curves    in   the 1970s.20     The demographic     varLsbles   include the

median age of the labor      force   and fraction which     is female; while   the program

variables   is the Unemployment      Insurance benefit to sage ratio.        We also

include the fractions of the labor force with high school and college degrees,

since education     may be a proxy for skills and "matching"        success in a local

labor market.     tta1ly, we include geographic dummy variables (for               South   and


SMSA) in some equations      to capture unmeasured effects of location and region

of   residence as frictional and structural characteristics.

         Several specifications are presented        in Table 3, since the sample size

is relatively    small and independent variation across the list of regressors                   is

not particularly high.      Thus we generally include the geographic variables

                                                          education and UI
separately, since they are highLy correlated with college

ratios.21    Some   specifications    exclude median age, since younger people are

most likely to migrate in response to demand factors captured by the

unemployment-vacancy     coefficient.     The frictional and structural variables


appear   both with and with     t    the vacancy   rate, so that their effects       on

unemployment when     controlling for labor demand can be        gauged.     But   the final
specification     (column 7) does Include all of these regressors.

tIOrE: Dependent varl,ble and weights as in Table 28. 811 independent i,rIhles are defined In text.
       Several findings emerge from Table 3.            The significsntly       tower


unemployment    rate of the South which we observe         in column I is largely

accounted   for by their higher vacancy rate (column 4) and slso by certain

other factors, such as lower UI beoefit ratios.            This latter variable has a

               positive effect on unemployment        before controlling       for vacancies
significant

and s marginally significant        effect after controlling     for them.      The benefits


of s college-educated     labor force in lowering unemployment        also appear

substantial, even after controlling for vacancies.             Both vartahles thus appear

to be capturIng    frictional and/or structural        effects on unemployment,         and are

consistent with findings in        the   literature   (see Footnote 7).

       On the other hand, neither of our indices of imbalance between

unemployed workers and vacant jobs contributes significantly              to


unemployment.     Of the two measures, only the index for industrial imbalance

has the correct sign.     These results are consistent with evidence from other

countries   (e.g., Britain in Roper and Jackman, Germany          in franz).

       As for the effects of labor force age and gender on unemployment,                  we

find that the fraction of females in the labor force has a positive but

generally not significsot effect.           Age, on the other hand, has a significant

positive effect without the vacancy control and s marginal positive effect

even with the control.         Since younger workers     (especially teens) sre well

known to have higher rates of frictional unemployment,             this is perhaps


surprising.     The age effect might therefore reflect the greater mobility and

                                 in response to shifting      labor market opportunities,
training of young workers

thereby lowering frictional/structural          unemployment within a market.           However,


the age effect    ny   also at least partly reflect endogenous migration responses

across markets     in response    to demand-based     unemployment differences.         This

last interpretation     is supported      by the relatively   sharp decline in the

              of the vacancy    coefficient when age is included.         But even without
magnitude
                                                  14



controlling     for age,    the inclusion   of demographics           and UI variables    reduces

the magnitude     of the vacancy effect by over a third.

        Finally, we note the ability of these equations                   to explain over half of

the total variation        in unemployment across all sites.              Calculations    of partial

R2's suggest that nore than half of the explained variation is accounted for

by the frictional/structural          variables    of Table     322
        While    these estimates      give us soae insight into the determinants                of

frictional and structural        unemployment differentials,             they give us little

understanding     of the forces driving the relative demand differencea across

local markets.      In Table 4 we consider         the   effects of three potential

determinants     of relative demand differences:           I)   Wage levels;      2) Industries;

and   3) Recent shifts in product demand.

        As noted    ahove, gage Level       differentials       can    create "equilbrium"
differences in     unemployment    across local areas,          though wages may themselves

respond to high levels of unamploymant caused by demand shifts.23                        Industrial

differences     can proxy for different       cyclical sensitivities,          wages, shocks to

product demand or technoLogy (both of which effect labor demand), as well as

differences     in skill requirements or other frictional                and structural

factors.24      Demand shifts, measured by differences across markets in average

sales growth, are most likely to reflect short—run                    "disequilibrium"    causes of

demand-based                     25
                 unemployment.

        Once again, high correlations among regressors and small sample sizes

cause us to estimate several different             specifications        of equations    containing

these variables.      We therefore enter them separately                in equations with       and

without the vacancy rate.26

        Columns 1—3 of Table 4 show fairly significant,                   positive effects of

wages (as in Hall (1970, 1972)) and manufacturing                 employment and negative

effects of average sales growth on unemployment rates.                     Controlling    for

vacancies    in column 4-6 reduces the magnitude of the wage coefficient by over

a third and the manufacturing      coefficient almost entirely,   though the sales

growth effect is reduced by less.       These findings suggest that lower relative

demand accounts for part of the wage effect and almost all of the

manufacturing    effect on unemployment.

          A comparison of the vacancy coefficients of this table with thuae of

Table 2, Panel A also shows that including wages or industry has little effect

on the vacancy coefficient while including sales growth reducea that

coefficient by about a third.       It therefore appears as though recent demand

shifts play a much greater role in explaining        relative demand effects on

unemployment    than do wage differences or industrial     compositions across local

labor markets.       These shifts presumably lead   to wage and price   adjustments

within markets as well as migration between markets that should help to

equalibrate    those markets in the longer run.27

IV•    CONCLUS ION

       In this study I use data on unemployment rates and vacancy rates to
estimate the structural/frictional and demand—deficient conponents of local
unemployment    rate differentials. I then use data on demographics,        UI   benefit
ratios,   wages, industries and sales growth across these local markets in

trying to account for these components.

          The results of the paper show that demand deficiencies account for a

substantial fraction of unemployment       rate differentials.   In 1980 this

fraction might be as high as half or more for SMSA's, though the exact

magnitude    is unclear.   The fraction also appeared to rise substantially        during

the major cyclical downturn of 1982.       Within local markets, unemployment rates

exceed vacancy rates by substantial amounts,        though the ratios of the latter

to    the former vary widely across markets.

            The demand coniponent of unemployment partially accounts for the higher

unemployment         of high wage areas and almost totally accounts              for that of

manufacturing         areas.        But wages and manufacturing account for very Little of

the total demand component of unemployment.                     Recent shifts in product demand,

measured by differences across areas                 in sales growth,      appear to play a greater

role in explaining the demand component of unemployment                      in the short-run.

            As for    the   frictional/structural       component, we find that UI benefit-to-

wage ratios and fractions of the labor force with college degrees are major

positive and         negative determinants of this component respectively.                  While the

fraction of females in the labor force                 had   virtually no effect,       the median age

of    the   labor force contributed positively to               unemployment.    Some    part of      the

age effect, though not all, appeared to reflect a migration                      of young workers

in response to differential.                Finally,   indices of occupational and industrial

imbalance between unemployed workers and vacant jobs had no significant

effects on measured unemployment rates.

            We must keep       in   mind some caveats of this study when reviewing the

results.       Measurement          error seems   to plague the vacancy      rate, especially in
the   non-SMSA   markets.           Small   sample sizes and     high correlations      among

regressors limited our              ability to    disentangle    some   of these effects.       The

exogeneity      of certain regressors is also questionable.

            Still, the results suggest that many factors contribute                  to unemployment

rate differences across areas.                Policy attempts      to reduce these differences


must consider a broad range of these factors if they are to be successful.

1This characterization   of business cycles as demand-side phe-tniena abstracts

      from other recent explanations of fluctuations,            such as the literature

      on real business cycles (e.g., Long and Ploaser               (1983)) Evidence of the

      persistence   of non-market—clearing          wage differences across industries

      appears   in Krueger and Summers        (1986) but is disputed in Mur2hy snd

      Topel   (1987).

2For a recent analysis which questions the existence            of   a unique NAIRU see

      Blanchard and Summers (1986).

3Wages differences can create changes in labor demand by movements along               local

      demand curves, assuming uncovered sectors cannot absorb the labor

      displaced in the covered section (Mincer, 1.976).              High wages can also
      lead to queues for jobs or longer durations of search unemployment,

      thereby raising frictional/structural            unemployment.    Early avidence on

      the persiatenceof high wages and unemployment            for certain SHEA's is

      found in the papers noted above by Hail.

4Thia model essentially follows that of Holt and Jackman et. al.               Their models

      are generalizations    of earlier ones (e.g., Lipaey (1960)) in which

          =     = x = y=    I.         Thus increasing returns are suggested in these

      earlier models while       the    later ones consider the •oaaibtlity of constant

      (or decreasing) returns.           More general functions are also considered       in

      Jackman et. ml. and Franz (1986).

5Unemployment and vacancy rates are defined as u =                  and v
                                                              U/K
      respectively.

6Equation 2) Implies that the structural parameters            x and y (and therefore

      returns to school) of the matching function could be estimated if

      turnover rates and search intensities could be measured.               Using firnwide
                                                            1.3

      attempted          to estimate these parameters.                 Jfortunate1y, the estimates

      were     extremely unstable art!              re therefore abandoned.
7Evidence that Unemployment Insurance                       affects search intensity directly can be

      found        in Barron and      Mellow        (1979). Effects of Unemployment Insurance on
      reservation wages            and unemployment               duration are observed in Moffitt and
      Nicholson          (1982) and Ehrenberg and Oaxaca (1976), among others.

      Demographic          effects on turnover rates are found in Marston (1976).                          Age,

      sex, and education effects on unemployment are also                              recen.tly   discussed

      in Summers (1987).

8Dynatnics can      be    considered    if Equation (1)              is modified   to be

                    tE -                              Many theoretical        models    (e.g.,   Jackman
       di)
                           b(sLU?(sFV)'         .


      at.    al,    Pissarides)       suggest        that    these    dynamics involve a r:ounter—

      clockwise movement between steady-state points on the Beveridge Curve.

      Empirical estimates of model parameters                          in a dynamic context can be

      found        for Britain in recent papers by Duffy (1983) or Nannah (1984).

9The possibility that             observed unemployment              and vacancy rates are non-steady-

      state        is   enhanced in    local labor markets              by   the prospects of migration
      across areas in response to demand and supply shocks. Given the high
      rank correlations in unemployment rates over time for local areas (Uall,

      1970), the  ability of migration                      to rapidly eliminate        unemployment

      differentials seems fairly low.

10occupational and industrial distributions of unemployment are calculated as
      the differences in distributions for the experienced labor force and the

     employed. The former are available only for the categories of rural and
      non-rural within each state. Consequently each index is calculated
      twice        per site:       once using statewide unemployment data, and once using

      rural data for non-SMSA's                 and non-rural          data for SNSA's within each

        state.   aesults for each are reported below for the second version,

        though they were extremely comparable.

11See Unemployment Insurance Financial      Data, United States Department     of

        Labor, Employment    and Training Report No. 394 (1983).

12Annual rates for both states and SMSA'a are published        in the appropriate

        issues of Employmentand Earnings.        Comparisons between 1980 and 1992

        rates are only made using rates that are similarly constructed for the

        two years.

13The 1982 survey asked, "Adjusting for price increases, approximately what

        was the percentage change in your unit sales [between 1979 and 1981]?"

14See   the discussIon by lincer in the NBER volume on vacancies (1966),

15Adjusted R2 was highest for the logarithic form in all cases except when

        using    the mix of SNSA and statewide rates for 1980, where     the quadratic

        form gave the best fit.     In all cases   the quadratic   term was positive

        and at least marginally significant, thus providing a better fit than

        did the linear form.

16The magnitude of measurement error can be gauged by using the reciprocal             of

        the coefficient   from a reverse regression to estimate the upper bound         to


        the true coefficient estimate.    Doing so gives upper bounds of -.765 for

        the   total sample and —.605 for the SMSA sample.     Given that the directly

        estimated coefficients are lower hounds which are -.234 and -.345

        respectively, we see a wider range and thus potentially more error

        within the total sample.

17An unemployment equation containing both the original and instrumented

        versions of the vacancy rate produced coefficients and standard errors

        of -.166 and .101 on the original as cell as -.135 and .141 on the

        instrumented rate.

18The significantly higher slope (though the intercepts are almost identical)

        for   1982   is unlikely represent a shift in the curve, since only two
                                          to

        years separate the cross-sections. The likelihood that a single
        ionLinear functional form exists for these two estiaiates which is not
        well-measured here           therefore is high.           Alternatively,    certain markets in

        one   or both of these years might reflect non-steady-state movements
        between    points on stable Beveridge Curves for those particular
        narkets.
'9The   significantly       different estimated coefficients across the two years, as

        well as the evidence of measurement error in the vacancy rate cited

        above, also precluded              the   use of    first difference   estimators here    and

        below in dealing with problems of omitted variables.                       The exacerbation

        of measurement error problems in first-difference or fixed—effect models

        is discussed       in Freeman (1984).              First—difference   estimates were

        substantially       lower in magnitude and explanatory power than were the OLS

        estimates    of    either year.
20See Abraham      (1987) for a recent discussion                 of these shifts in the U.S.     and

        Jackman et.       al.   (1984) for one in Britain.

21The labor force—weighted correlation between South and the Unemployment

        Insurance    ratio is -.76, while                that between UI ratio and college

        education is       .52.

22When the vacancy rate            i-i   considered       the first variable entered, the partial

        R2 Chased on column 5 of Table                   3) for   the frictional/structural

        variables    is approximately             .30, which      is comparable   to the simple R2 for

        vacancies    in Table       2B.        When the frictional/structural       variables are

        entered first (using column                2   of Table 3), the partial K2     for   vacancies

        is reduced r,       .13.

        effects on wage increases across areas.

       and Pencavel (1970) for quit differentials      •sccoss   industries.

25The interpretation      of average sales growth differences as demand shifts

       across markets, as weLl as their effects on unemployment, are discussed

       at great length in Holzer (1988).

26These equations were also estimated with and without the inclusion of

       demographic and Uneoployment     Insurance variables.     Most resuLts were

       fairly similar, although employment      in the service industry showed a

       significant positive effect on unemployment when the extra controls were

       included.      Once again, high correlations between Unemployment       tn.surtnce,

       college education and industry made precise estimates of effects quite

       difficult to achieve.
