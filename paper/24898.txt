                                          ABSTRACT

We use data on Indian stock portfolios to show that return heterogeneity is the primary
contributor to increasing inequality of wealth held in risky assets by Indian individual investors.
Return heterogeneity increases equity wealth inequality through two main channels, both of
which are related to the prevalence of undiversified accounts that own relatively few stocks.
First, some undiversified portfolios randomly do well, while others randomly do poorly. Second,
larger accounts diversify more effectively and thereby earn higher average log returns even
though their average simple returns are no higher than those of smaller accounts.

1         Introduction
New methods for imputing the wealth distribution have provided evidence that wealth in-
equality is increasing both in the US and globally (Alvaredo et al. 2018, Cagetti and De
Nardi 2008, Saez and Zucman 2016).              Wealth inequality results in part from income in-
equality, but it may also be driven by bequests and by unequal returns earned on …nancial
investments, particularly if returns are higher for those who are already wealthier.2 This
paper uses detailed administrative data on the equity portfolios of Indian stock market in-
vestors to show that heterogeneous investment returns account for 84% of the increase in
inequality of wealth held in equities between 2002 and 2011.3
        India is a large country with a rapidly growing middle class that is starting to use risky
…nancial markets for the …rst time.           During our sample period, Indians primarily invest
directly in stocks rather than through mutual funds or diversi…ed retirement savings vehicles
(Badarinza, Balasubramaniam, and Ramadorai 2017). In these respects India has much in
common with other developing countries, but di¤ers from developed countries (Badarinza,
Campbell, and Ramadorai 2016).             We …nd that returns on directly held stocks generate
slower growth of account value for small investors than for larger investors, because small
Indian investors are poorly diversi…ed.4 This illustrates that low-cost diversi…cation vehicles
can bene…t small investors and reduce the growth of inequality in emerging markets.
        Investment returns multiply initial wealth; equivalently, log returns have an additive

    2
      Piketty (2014, Ch. 12) emphasizes the last factor when he writes: “Many economic models assume that
the return on capital is the same for all owners, no matter how large or small their fortunes. This is far
from certain, however: it is perfectly possible that wealthier people obtain higher average returns than less
wealthy people.”
    3
      Although directly held equity wealth is only one component of total wealth, it is plausible that log
equity wealth and log total wealth are positively correlated in India as elsewhere. Data from the All India
Debt and Investment Survey, conducted as part of the Indian National Sample Survey in 2012, con…rm a
correlation of about 0.3 and an elasticity of total wealth with respect to equity account size of about 0.15
among stockholding households. We report details of this analysis in our online appendix.
    4
      Comparable results are not available for the US because of data limitations, but several papers have
documented return heterogeneity in Norway (Fagereng et al. 2016) and Sweden (Calvet, Campbell, and
Sodini 2007 and Bach, Calvet, and Sodini, BCS 2015). Because Swedish investors are relatively well
diversi…ed through mutual funds, the major contributor to return heterogeneity in Sweden is the willingness
of richer investors to earn higher returns by taking more equity risk. This phenomenon does not contribute
to our results because we observe only equity portfolios and not holdings of safe assets.



                                                     1
e¤ect on initial log wealth. What matters for the evolution of wealth inequality is therefore
heterogeneity in log returns and the correlation of log returns with initial log wealth. The
…nance literature has long recognized that the portfolio with the highest average log return
will tend to have a growing share of wealth over time in the absence of in‡ows and out‡ows.5
However, the literature on inequality has not always made the distinction between simple
returns and log returns, a distinction that we show to be important for understanding the
e¤ect of return heterogeneity on wealth inequality.
    The average log return on a risky portfolio is always less than the average simple return by
Jensen’s inequality. If the portfolio return is lognormally distributed, the di¤erence between
the two is one-half the variance of the log return.6 Importantly, this implies that investors
can earn a higher average log return not only by earning a higher average simple return, but
also by diversifying more e¤ectively, thereby lowering portfolio variance with an unchanged
average simple return. As a stark example, in a market with many stocks whose returns
are identically distributed and imperfectly correlated, all portfolios have the same average
simple return, but better diversi…ed portfolios that hold more stocks have lower variances
and higher average log returns.
    This analysis implies that heterogeneous returns can contribute to wealth inequality
through two channels. First, undiversi…ed risktaking causes random cross-sectional variation
in realized log returns: in each period, some undiversi…ed investors get lucky while others are
unlucky, and this causes wealth levels to diverge. Second, average log returns can vary across
investors who pursue di¤erent investment strategies.              The second channel is particularly
important if average log returns are correlated with initial wealth levels. Within this channel,
cross-sectional variation in average log returns may re‡ect both variation in average simple
returns— resulting from heterogeneity in investors’willingness to take risk, their ability to
identify compensated risk exposures, or their stock-picking skill— and variation in the wedge

   5
     This “growth-optimal” portfolio will be chosen by a rational investor with log utility. It outperforms
any other portfolio with increasing probability as the investment horizon increases (Markowitz 1976).
   6
     If returns are not lognormally distributed, then the di¤erence between average simple return and average
log return is the entropy of the return, a more general measure of dispersion that involves higher moments
as well as variance. Campbell (2018, p.100) provides a textbook exposition.



                                                     2
between average simple returns and average log returns caused by portfolio variance.
        We …nd that these two channels are roughly equally important in India. Heterogeneous
log returns contribute to inequality in account size both through the random realizations
of underdiversi…ed portfolio returns, and through higher average log returns that larger
investors earn on their equity investments.               Crucially, this is not because larger Indian
investors have higher average simple returns. In fact, the opposite is true in our sample,
because smaller investors have higher loadings on compensated risk factors including the
market, small-stock, and value factors.7           Rather, larger investors are better diversi…ed so
their idiosyncratic risk is lower, creating a smaller wedge between average simple and average
log returns.



2         Data
Measuring investment returns is a challenging task that requires even more data than mea-
suring wealth inequality. The latter requires snapshots of portfolio values at points in time,
while the former requires in addition either detailed knowledge of portfolio composition and
of individual asset returns during the intervals between snapshots, or a complete time series
of portfolio in‡ows and out‡ows that can be used to impute returns.                       In this paper we
work with data on directly held Indian equities, whose ownership is electronically recorded
and linked to over ten million equity accounts held by Indian individual investors. These
data enable us to accurately measure the returns that investors earn in the public equity
market and hence quantify the contribution of heterogeneous returns on directly held stocks
to inequality in the size of equity accounts. We create a random sample of 200,000 accounts
and measure inequality using the cross-sectional variance of log account size (the log market
value of equities held) which relates cleanly to the properties of log returns discussed above.
        Our data on Indian equity accounts come from India’s National Securities Depository

    7
    There is suggestive evidence that wealthier investors have stock-picking skill relative to the standard
four-factor asset pricing model, due to Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997), that we use to model
compensated risk. However, this is not su¢ cient to o¤set the lower factor risk loadings in wealthier investors’
portfolios.


                                                      3
Limited (NSDL), with the approval of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
NSDL is the larger of two securities depositories in India, with a roughly 80% market share
of total assets tracked and a 60% market share by number of accounts. During our sample
period almost all equities held and almost all transactions were recorded electronically.
   These data do have a few limitations that should be noted.        First, we have little in-
formation about account holders beyond a type classi…cation, which we use to separate
Indian individual investors from others including bene…cial owners, domestic …nancial and
non-…nancial institutions, foreign investors, and government accounts.
   Second, we do not observe individual investors’holdings of mutual funds. This is not a
major omission because during our sample period the fraction of equity market capitalization
held by mutual funds was modest in India, always less than 5%. In addition, roughly 60% of
mutual funds in India are held by corporations. Campbell, Ramadorai, and Ranish (CRR,
2014) estimate that individuals’indirect equity holdings through mutual funds and related
products were between 6% and 19% of total household equity holdings over the sample
period. They also note that a 2009 SEBI survey found that about 65% of Indian households
owning individual stocks did not own any bonds or mutual funds.
   Third, we do not observe data on the derivatives transactions of Indian investors, includ-
ing their participation in single-stock futures markets. However, while single-stock futures
volume is considerable in India, larger in fact than equity index futures volume (Martins,
Singh, and Bhattacharya 2012, Vashishtha and Kumar 2010), it is likely concentrated in a
small minority of accounts and unimportant for the majority of Indian investors.
   A single investor can hold multiple accounts on NSDL; however, we link these together
using each investor’s Permanent Account Number (PAN), a unique taxpayer identi…er. PAN
aggregation reduces the total number of individual accounts in our database from about 13.7
million to 11.6 million.
   The fraction of Indian equity market capitalization that is held in NSDL accounts grows
from just above 50% in 2002 to about 70% in 2011. The share of this held in individual
accounts declines from about 20% to about 10%, re‡ecting changes in NSDL coverage of
institutions as well as an increase in institutional investment. The number of individuals

                                              4
holding stock in NSDL accounts grows from 2.28 to 6.25 million, that is, by about 175%.8
       We obtain monthly data on stock returns from Prowess, Datastream, and Compustat
Global. In addition, we impute price returns from our NSDL data. We use only those
returns that we are able to validate through comparison between at least two of the data
sources. (We follow a similar approach to validating stocks’book-market ratios and market
capitalization.) In addition, we both attempt to manually …ll otherwise missing returns for
the few instances where a stock with a missing return comprises at least 1% of the average
individual’s stock portfolio, and manually validate the 25 largest and smallest percentage
returns. Overall, we use returns that on average cover slightly more than 95% of an individual
account’s stock holdings.9 The online appendix provides further details on data sources.


2.1       Summary statistics

Our results are estimated from a sample of 200,000 accounts selected randomly from accounts
that held stock at any time during our sample period. Table 1 presents summary statistics on
this sample, reporting the time-series average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation
for a series of cross-sectional statistics calculated at the end of each month from March 2002
to May 2011. The number of stockholding accounts in the sample varies from about 39,000
to about 108,000, with an average of 74,000. The time-series average account entry rate is
2.8% per month, and the exit rate 1.9% per month, but the entrance rate in particular is
highly variable over time as IPOs and high returns attracted many Indian investors to begin
participating in the stock market during the mid-2000s.10
       The cross-sectional mean log account size varied during the period from 10.32 to 11.53,

   8
     Because of account exit, the number of individuals holding stock at any point in time is always consid-
erably smaller than the total number of individual stockholders in our sample.
   9
     We compute account-level returns using only those stocks for which we have validated returns. In our
variance decomposition, changes in value due to missing returns are captured by the “net in‡ows”component
provided that at least some returns are available for the account. In about 2.5% of account-months, we are
missing returns for all stocks held. These account months are excluded from our risk and return analyses,
and contribute to the “entrance and exit” component of our variance decomposition.
  10
     Some accounts enter and exit multiple times as investors hold stocks, divest them, and subsequently
acquire stocks again. Table 1 reports the average “…rst-time” entrance rate as 2.0%, implying that the
average re-entrance rate is 0.8%.



                                                     5
corresponding to about 30,000 and 100,000 rupees respectively, or $660 and $2,211 using the
sample average exchange rate of 46 rupees per dollar. On average across all months, the
cross-sectional mean growth rate of account size was about 1.7% per month, very similar to
the cross-sectional mean log return of 1.4% on investments in these accounts. The di¤erence
between these two numbers, the average contribution of net in‡ows to mean account growth,
was small at 29 basis points.
       The main focus of our paper is on changes over time in account size inequality. Table
1 reports that the cross-sectional standard deviation of log account size increased from 1.85
to 2.38 during our sample period, corresponding to variances of 3.4 and 5.7 respectively. At
the beginning of our sample, a one-standard deviation increase in log account size multiplied
account size by 6.4, whereas at the end it multiplied account size by 10.8. Figure 1 reports
the probability density function (panel A) and cumulative distribution function (panel B) of
account size in the …rst and last months of our sample. The increase in variance is easily
visible, as is a spike in the probability density (a steep section of the CDF) around $70 in
the last month of the sample. This is the result of IPO subscriptions which were allocated
in standard amounts to many small accounts that hold undiversi…ed single-IPO positions.
Converting account sizes to US dollars, the 10th percentile of account size fell during our
sample period from $71 to $60, while the 90th percentile increased from $7,274 to $19,258.
       The remainder of the paper asks what forces contribute to this increasing inequality in
account size.     We will show that the dominant in‡uence on the evolution of account size
inequality is the heterogeneity of investment returns. This is true despite the high cross-
sectional volatility of net in‡ows reported in Table 1.11 While net in‡ows are volatile, they
are also negatively correlated with log account size, which greatly reduces their in‡uence on
the evolution of inequality.

  11
    The time-series average of the cross-sectional standard deviation of net in‡ows is 40.5%, almost as
large as the cross-sectional standard deviation of account growth at 41.1%. The time-series average of the
cross-sectional standard deviation of log returns is smaller at 9.1%.

3     Risk and Return by Account Size
In this section we examine variation in portfolio characteristics by account size.    In each
month we divide accounts into deciles by their value at the end of the previous month,
equally weight accounts within each decile, and report summary statistics by decile.
    Panel A of Table 2 reports arithmetic average excess returns by decile, from the smallest
at the left to the largest at the right.    The far right hand column of the table reports
the di¤erence in excess returns between the largest and the smallest decile accounts. The
smallest accounts earn an excess return of 2.99% per month in this sample period, while
the largest earn only 1.70% per month. The di¤erence in excess returns between the two
extreme portfolios is   1:29%, but the estimate is noisy with a standard error of 0.78%. The
large standard error re‡ects our short sample period of less than ten years, the volatility of
Indian stock returns, and systematic di¤erences in the investment styles of large and small
investors.
    Table 2 uses a standard four-factor model, due to Fama and French (1993) and extended
by Carhart (1997), to measure size patterns in investment styles.      The table shows that
the smallest account returns have a beta with the market index of 1.21, while the largest
have a beta of 1.00, and the di¤erence of    0:21 has a standard error of 0.05. The smallest
accounts load strongly on the size or SMB (small minus big) factor, with a loading of 0.57
as compared to 0.06 for the largest accounts; the di¤erence of     0:51 has a standard error
of 0.05. The smallest accounts load strongly on the value or HML (high minus low book-
to-market) factor, with a loading of 0.45 as compared to    0:07 for the largest accounts; the
di¤erence of   0:51 has a standard error of 0.16.    All three of these factors have positive
average returns, both in India in our sample period and globally over much longer periods of
time. Hence, these three factor loadings contribute to the higher average returns earned by
smaller Indian investors. However, the smallest accounts have a negative loading of      0:36
on Carhart’s (1997) momentum or MOM factor, while the largest accounts have a much
smaller negative loading of   0:07; the di¤erence of 0.29 has a standard error of 0.07. Since
momentum also has a positive average return, this is the one factor loading that should


                                              7
deliver higher average returns to larger accounts.
   As a reality check, Panel B of Table 2 relates these factor loadings to the average char-
acteristics of the stocks held by di¤erent sizes of accounts. The patterns in factor loadings
show up clearly in stock characteristics: the smallest accounts hold stocks with higher pre-
dicted betas, lower market capitalization (extreme among the smallest accounts), higher
book-to-market ratios, and lower realized returns over the previous year excluding the pre-
vious month.
   The market, size, and value tilts reported in Table 2 for small Indian investors are similar
to those reported in Barber and Odean (2000, Table II) for a sample of US retail investors.
However, the e¤ects of account size on these tilts di¤er from those reported by BCS (2015)
for the cross-section of Swedish investors. BCS …nd that in Sweden, wealthier investors have
higher loadings on market, size, and value factors than poorer investors do. One reason for
the di¤erence in results is likely that poorer Swedish investors tend to hold mutual funds with
minimal style tilts. We are unaware of evidence on cross-sectional variation in momentum
tilts among retail investors, but Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (2008) report that retail investors
as a group tend to be contrarians which is consistent with our …ndings.
   Panel A of Table 2 also reports alphas from the four-factor model, that is, the components
of average excess returns not explained by factor loadings and average excess returns to the
factors.   The smallest accounts have a negative alpha of       0:17% per month, while the
largest accounts have a positive alpha of 0.40% per month. These point estimates suggest
that larger Indian investors have stock-picking skill relative to the four-factor Fama-French
(1993) and Carhart (1997) model. However, the alpha spread of 0.57% has a large standard
error of 0.46%, again unsurprising given our relatively short sample period.
   We have emphasized that average log returns depend not only on average simple returns,
but also on diversi…cation. Panel B of Table 2 reports the average number of stocks held in
each decile of account size. This increases strongly from 1.6 in the smallest decile to 28.9 in
the largest decile, so large Indian equity accounts are far better diversi…ed than small ones.
   One would expect this size pattern in diversi…cation to show up in the volatility of account
returns and the wedge between average simple and average log returns, and we examine this

                                              8
in Table 3. The …rst row of Table 3 repeats the average excess simple return from the …rst
row of Table 2. The second row of Table 3 reports the average excess log return. Unlike
the average excess simple return, the average excess log return is increasing in account value,
0.72% per month for the smallest accounts and 1.10% per month for the largest accounts,
although the di¤erence of 0.38% has a standard error of 0.69%.
   The di¤erence between average simple and log returns is almost exactly equal to one-half
the variance of log returns, as can be veri…ed using the third row of Table 3 which reports
the standard deviation of portfolio returns.       Small Indian investors hold highly volatile
portfolios, with an average standard deviation of 23.7% per month (equivalent to 82% per
year). The portfolios of the largest Indian investors have a much lower standard deviation
of 11.0% per month (38% per year), and the di¤erence of         12:7% has a standard error of
only 0.9%.   Thus, the better diversi…cation of large investors more than o¤sets their low
average simple returns, enabling large investors to earn higher average log returns than small
investors.
   The fourth row of Table 3 takes the ratio of the average excess simple return to standard
deviation to calculate the Sharpe ratio. This is lower for the smallest accounts at 0.13 than
for the largest accounts at 0.15, although the di¤erence of 0.03 has a standard error of 0.04.


3.1    Correcting for luck

One reason why small Indian investors enjoyed high average simple returns during our sample
period is that their style tilts performed spectacularly well. The average excess return on
the Indian market was 1.46% per month in this period, while in global data from November
1990 through November 2017, the average excess return on a global index was only 0.53% per
month. Similarly, the average returns on SMB and HML were 0.91% per month and 2.49%
per month in India during our sample, but only 0.06% and 0.33% per month in the longer run
global data. The fourth factor, MOM, delivered 0.64% per month in India, which is barely
above the longer run global average of 0.60%, but this factor was favored by larger rather
than by smaller investors. In other words, it is possible that small investors were lucky in



                                               9
this short sample period, and enjoyed higher returns than would normally be expected.
    As a simple way to correct for this, the lower panels of Table 3 present counterfactual
average excess simple returns, average excess log returns, and Sharpe ratios that would have
been realized in our sample period if the four factors had delivered their long-run global
average excess returns. This may be a more reasonable estimate of the returns that could
have been expected on Indian equity portfolios ex ante.          The middle panel preserves the
alpha estimates from our primary analysis, and the bottom panel sets alpha to zero for
all Indian investors.   In the middle panel, average excess simple returns are increasing in
account value and in the bottom panel they are almost ‡at. In either case, average excess
log returns and Sharpe ratios are increasing in account size.             The di¤erence in average
excess log returns between the largest and smallest accounts is 2.15% in the …rst case, with
a standard error of 0.46%, and 1.57% in the second case, with a standard error of 0.20%.



4     Decomposition of the Increase in Account Size In-
      equality
In this section we ask how the patterns of risk and return we have documented a¤ect the
evolution of inequality in the account sizes of Indian equity investors.          We use a simple
accounting framework, an extension of one proposed by Campbell (2016).
    Denote the market value of investor i ’s equity account at time t by Vit , and the gross
return from t to t + 1 on the account’s time t investments by (1 + Ri;t+1 ). For any account
that exists in our data at both time t and time t + 1, we can write

                                        0

where Vi;t+1 = Vit (1 + Ri;t+1 ) denotes the value of the account at time t + 1 if the stocks held
at time t are held over the full month with no other account activity, and Fi;t+1 captures


                                                10
the e¤ect of intramonthly portfolio rebalancing, in‡ows, and out‡ows. In the simplest case
where there is no trading in the portfolio except at the end of each month, and where in‡ows
arrive immediately before account value is measured, Fi;t+1 is the net in‡ow at time t + 1.
    Taking logs, we have
                                      vi;t+1 = vit + ri;t+1 + fi;t+1 ;                                   (2)

                                                                                 0
where vit = log(Vit ), ri;t+1 = log(1 + Ri;t+1 ), and fi;t+1 = log(1 + Fi;t+1 =Vi;t+1 ).
    At each point in time we can calculate the cross-sectional variances and covariances of
log account size, returns, and net in‡ows. We use the notation Vart and Covt to denote
these cross-sectional second moments.            Then from equation (2), but allowing for account
entry and exit to a¤ect the cross-sectional distribution of account size, we have


                     Vart (vi;t+1 )   Vart (vit ) = Vart (ri;t+1 ) + 2Covt (vit ; ri;t+1 )

                                                 + Vart (fi;t+1 ) + 2Covt (vit; ; fi;t+1 )

                                                 + 2Covt (ri;t+1; ; fi;t+1 ) + xi;t+1 :                  (3)


The …rst two terms on the right hand side of equation (3) are the contribution of log return
inequality to the change in log account size inequality; the next two terms are the contribution
of net in‡ow inequality; the …fth term is an interaction e¤ect between the two; and the last
term xi;t+1 is a residual that captures the e¤ects of account entry and exit. If we con…ned
attention to accounts that exist both at time t and at time t + 1, then xi;t+1 would be zero.
    Panel A of Table 4 presents the time-series average contributions of these terms to the
change in the cross-sectional variance of log account size, which averages 0.0197 per month
in our data. The contribution of log return inequality is 84% of this; the contribution of
‡ow inequality is 40%; the interaction e¤ect is             23%; and the e¤ect of account entry and
exit is a modest      1% of the total.12 Thus, the dominant contributor to the increase in the

   12
      It may be surprising that the ‡ow contribution is so modest when the cross-sectional volatility of ‡ows
is so large in Table 1. The explanation is that the covariance between log account size and ‡ows is strongly
negative, and it almost exactly cancels the contribution from the variance of ‡ows. In other words, while
‡ows are volatile, small accounts tend to have in‡ows while larger accounts have out‡ows (to fund spending
or acquisition of other assets), and this limits the contribution of ‡ows to the evolution of account size


                                                      11
inequality of account size in our data is indeed the heterogeneity in log investment returns.
    Panel B looks separately at the two components of log return inequality (the …rst two
terms on the right hand side of (3)). The cross-sectional variance of log return and its cross-
sectional covariance with log account value are roughly equally important, contributing 54%
and 46% of the log return inequality e¤ect.
    Panels C and D look more closely at the covariance term.         We have used accounts’
market values to measure their size even though returns a¤ect subsequent market values.
One might be concerned that large accounts earn higher average log returns because there is
momentum in underlying stock returns or persistent cross-sectional variation in investment
skill or diversi…cation, and so high log returns in the past explain both current account
size and future average log returns. To address this concern, in Panel C we break account
size into a “book value” component that re‡ects only past contributions and proportional
out‡ows, accumulated at a money market interest rate, and the residual which re‡ects past
realized account returns.   We …nd that the book value covariance is 70% of the total, so
the endogeneity of log account size— while not negligible— is a secondary e¤ect. We report
details of this calculation in the appendix.
    In Panel D we once again highlight the di¤erence between average log return and average
simple return. We show that the covariance between log account size and average simple
return is negative, but outweighed by the positive covariance between log account size and
the wedge between average log return and average simple return. This result con…rms the
patterns reported in Table 3.


4.1      Decomposition of the return contribution

We can go further in characterizing the contribution of log return inequality to account size
inequality. Consider a model of the conditional expected log return on account i, where the
expectation is formed at time t and applies to returns that are realized at time t + 1. Write

inequality.




                                               12
this conditional expected log return as           it .   Then


                                           ri;t+1 =      it   + "i;t+1 ;                                                  (4)


where "i;t+1 is the unexpected return on account i at time t + 1.
     The contribution of log return inequality to account size inequality can be decomposed
as


         Vart (ri;t+1 ) + 2Covt (vit ; ri;t+1 ) = Vart (      it )   + Vart ("i;t+1 ) + 2Covt (          it ; "i;t+1 )

                                                + 2Covt (vit ;         it )   + 2Covt (vit ; "i;t+1 ):                    (5)


The …rst term on the right hand side of equation (5) is the cross-sectional variance of expected
log returns, the result of heterogeneous investment strategies that o¤er di¤erent average log
returns. The second term is the cross-sectional variance of unexpected log returns, the result
of underdiversi…cation. The third term is the covariance between expected and unexpected
log returns; this can be nonzero in any cross-section, but should be zero if one takes a
time-series average of equation (5) with a long enough sample period and if                                 it   is a rational
expectation of log return. The fourth term is the covariance between log account size and
expected log return; this captures the tendency of larger/richer accounts to invest more
e¤ectively and earn higher log returns. The …fth term is the covariance between log account
size and unexpected log return; this can be nonzero in any cross-section, if investment
strategies favored by wealthy accounts do better or worse than average, but should average
to zero in a long sample period if        it   is a rational expectation.
     Panel E of Table 4 presents an empirical implementation of this decomposition.                                       We
consider three alternative models of conditional expected log returns.                                   In model 1, the
expected log return is simply the sample average return on accounts in the given size decile.
In model 2, it is the counterfactual average return that would have been realized, if style
portfolios had delivered their long-run global average returns rather than the extremely high
returns realized in India during this period. However, model 2 uses our empirical estimates


                                                         13
of four-factor alphas for Indian investors. Model 3 also uses long-run global average factor
returns but sets the four-factor alphas to zero. These three models correspond to the three
panels of Table 3.
    In all three models, the cross-sectional variance of expected log returns has a negligible
e¤ect on the evolution of account size inequality, while the cross-sectional variance of un-
expected log returns and the covariance between log account size and realized log return
contribute roughly equally as shown earlier in Panel B of Table 4.
    Where the models di¤er is in the breakdown of the covariance term into the covariance of
log account size with expected log return and the covariance with unexpected log return. In
model 1, sample average size decile returns are used and so the covariance with unexpected
log return is close to zero (but not exactly zero because of small di¤erences in average returns
across accounts within each size decile).    Thus in model 1 the systematic ability of large
investors to earn a higher average log return accounts for about half of the observed increase
in equity wealth inequality.
    In models 2 and 3, by contrast, long-run global average factor returns are used. Given
the style tilts documented in Table 2, this implies that the covariance between log account
size and expected log return is even larger and the covariance between log account size
and unexpected log return is negative. According to these models, large investors have an
even greater systematic ability to earn higher average log returns; this ability would have
further increased equity wealth inequality in the Indian data, if it were not for the fact
that smaller Indian investors “got lucky”by betting on factors that happened to outperform
during this short sample period. Depending on the assumption about alpha, the e¤ect of
smaller investors’luck was to dampen the increase in inequality by 36% to 75% of the total
observed increase in inequality in this period.



5     Robustness
In the online appendix, we show that our results are robust to several variations in our
empirical methodology.     Other measures of account size inequality also trend upwards in


                                              14
our sample period. Focusing on the right tail of the size distribution, we examine deciles
within the top 5% of accounts and …nd fairly ‡at patterns of risk and return within this
group. We control for account age and …nd similar results for cohort-balanced size deciles,
each of which contains the same age distribution of accounts at each point in time.          We
exclude micro-cap stocks whose returns may be biased upwards by survivorship bias or bid-
ask bounce (Blume and Stambaugh 1983), and exclude accounts that hold predominantly
IPO stocks, and again …nd similar results.
    Finally, we distinguish two types of account entry and exit. Accounts can enter or exit
either because they start or cease to hold stocks, or because the stocks they hold start or cease
to have at least one measured return. We show that entry and exit driven by stockholdings
increases equity wealth inequality, while entry and exit driven by the availability of returns
data decreases it. The two e¤ects o¤set each other to create the modest        1% contribution
of account entry and exit reported in Panel A of Table 4.



6     Conclusion
We have studied wealth held in equity accounts in India, a large developing country that is
important for the evolution of global wealth inequality. We have shown that heterogeneous
risky log investment returns have important e¤ects on the cross-sectional distribution of
account size: large accounts result not only from large contributions, but also from high
log returns. The e¤ect of log return heterogeneity accounts for 84% of the increase in the
cross-sectional variance of log account size during our sample period from March 2002 to
May 2011.
    Return heterogeneity increases the inequality of account size through two main channels,
both of which are related to the prevalence of undiversi…ed accounts that own relatively
few stocks. The …rst is that some undiversi…ed portfolios randomly do well, while others
do poorly.    The second is that larger accounts tend to earn higher average log returns.
They do so not by earning higher average simple returns, but by limiting uncompensated
idiosyncratic risk which lowers the average log return for any given average simple return.


                                               15
    Our paper partially supports Piketty’s (2014) concern that the rich get richer by earning
high investment returns— subject to the distinction, central in …nance theory, between simple
and log returns.    Our results also highlight the importance for developing countries of
investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and exchange traded funds, that are already
common in developed countries and that give small investors an a¤ordable way to diversify
risk.

Table 2: Return Factor Loadings by Account Value Deciles
Each column of this table presents statistics from the period March 2002 through May 2011. Panel A presents coefficients from regressions of monthly cross-sectional average excess returns on
(lagged) account-value sorted accounts on four Fama French risk factors. Panel B shows the average number of stocks held for the account-value decile as well as the characteristics of the
stockholdings of the decile. For the regressions in Panel A, account returns are based on the portfolio held at the end of the previous month and assume that the account does not trade during
the month. Excess returns are constructed by subtracting the three-month Indian Treasury Bill rate. Risk factors are constructed from Indian equity data following the methodology described on
Ken French's website. The stock characteristics in Panel B are time-series means of cross-sectional dollar-weighted median characteristic values. This measurement is robust to extreme outlier
characteristics. Estimated beta comes from a regression of realized beta on two past years of realized beta as well as size, value, and momentum deciles and industry dummies. Standard errors
are presented in parentheses throughout.

Table 3: Risk and Returns by Account Value Deciles
This table presents average monthly risk and return measures over the period March 2002 through May 2011 by account value deciles. These deciles are defined by the value
of stock holdings at the end of the previous month. Account returns are constructed on the basis of these portfolios under the assumption that the account does not trade during
the following month. Excess returns are constructed by subtracting the three-month Indian Treasury Bill rate, and are further adjusted across the three panels. Panel A reports
in-sample realized excess returns. Panel B subtracts the sample-specific part of mean factor returns, taking long-run global factor returns from Ken French's website (over the
period November 1990 through November 2017) and using the estimated risk factor loadings in Table 2. Panel C further subtracts the average part of the return associated
with the estimated in-sample four-factor alpha reported in Table 2. Since these variations adjust only mean returns, excess return volatility is unaffected. Bootstrap standard
errors are reported in parentheses, and reflect uncertainty about in-sample and global risk factor prices and in-sample factor loadings.

Table 4: Decomposition of Inequality Growth (Change in the Variance of Log Account Value)
This table presents time-series averages of terms from cross-sectional variance decompositions. Panel A uses the identity v i,t+1 =v it +r i,t+1 +f i,t+1 to decompose the
average monthly change in variance of log account value over the period March 2002 through May 2011 into the share due to the variance of log account returns (r i,t+1 ),
net flows (f i,t+1 ), and their covariances with each other and the previous log account value v it . The remaining portion of the realized change in variance of account
value, x i,t+1 , is due to the entrance and exit of accounts. Panel B decomposes the contribution of heterogeneous returns into components related to [A] undiversification
in general and [B] the covariance of log account value and returns. Panel C decomposes the log account value and log returns covariance component into parts related to
[1] the related to the log book value of the account b it (the account value under the counterfactual of three-month Indian treasury returns, and withdrawals set as the
same proportion of account value as actual withdrawals) and [2] a remainder representing cumulative additional returns. Panel D alternatively decomposes the log
account value and returns covariance component into parts related to [a] log mean (raw) returns and [b] the difference between log returns and log mean raw returns.
Panel E splits log returns into an expected and idiosyncratic component, r i,t+1 =μ it +ε i,t+1 , and uses these to further decompose the contribution of heterogeneous returns.
Expected log returns are modeled in three ways. In model 1, expected log returns equal the mean realized log return of the given account value decile. Model 2 subtracts
the part of returns due to in-sample factor prices from a Fama French four-factor model, while model 3 further subtracts the in-sample alpha (both as in Table 3).
