This paper covers a continuous and longer time period than previously possible to examine
human and market capital because of research by Christian (2017). This paper focuses on the
presentation and analysis of trends in human capital by gender. During 1975-2012 there were
significant changes in participation by women, the wage gender gap, and educational attainment
and time in household production by both women and men. Both the market and nonmarket
sectors will be covered as well as multifactor productivity with and without human capital. (A
previous paper (Fraumeni, et al. 2017) described the national income accounting system which
underlies both this paper and the much earlier paper by Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989).) New
insights will be gained by looking in detail at the 1975-2012 time period.

        Accumulation of Human and Market Capital in the United States, 1975-2012:
                                            An Analysis by Gender
Since the mid-seventies in the United States, there has been significant increases in female labor
force participation including early-on during child-bearing ages, substantial change in total and
by gender human capital arising from higher levels of both male and female educational
attainment, a narrowing wage gender gap, and reallocation of time by both males and females.
Including an analysis of human capital by gender points to many of the underlying causes of
trends in economic growth; including human capital in national accounts is also critical to
understanding any trends in economic growth. For example, when contributions to gross private
domestic product with and without human capital, are examined, the 1995-2000 sub period looks
less remarkable because investment in human capital is less important than in the previous sub
period, while in the 2007-2009 sub period the impact of increases in investment in tertiary
education by both males and females, among other factors, leads to healthier economic growth
than would be expected during recession affected years. This paper, although presenting
national accounts, emphasizes human capital factors by gender as these impact longer-term
trends across sub periods.
Part I of this paper outlines human capital and national accounts methodology. Part II describes
the underlying factors by gender. Part III presents national level accounts with and without
human capital. Part IV looks at components of human capital by gender over time. Part V
concludes.
Part I: Methodology
        A: Human Capital
The human capital model employed in this paper is based on the model of Jorgenson and
Fraumeni (1989, 1992). The Jorgenson-Fraumeni approach is often referred to as a lifetime-
income approach, in which the human capital associated with a person is equal to his or her
current and future lifetime earnings in present discounted value. The stock of human capital is
equal to the sum of lifetime earnings across all persons in a population. Events that add to the
stock of human capital (births, education, and immigration) are considered human capital
investment, while events that subtract from the stock of human capital (deaths, aging,
emigration) are considered human capital depreciation. Jorgenson and Fraumeni's (1989, 1992)
measures of human capital include not only a market component based on lifetime earnings in
market work, but also a nonmarket component based on time spent in nonmarket work, defined
as time outside of market work, schooling, and personal maintenance, valued at an hourly
opportunity cost equal to market wage adjusted for the marginal tax rate.
The specific human capital measures employed in this paper, which measure human capital in
the United States from 1975 to 2012, are the same measures as in Christian (2017). In the
nominal human capital measures, per capita human capital in year y for a person of sex s, age a,
and years of education e is equal to
        iy,s,a,e = yiy,s,a,e + (1+)-1(1+g)sry,s,a+1[senry,s,a,eiy,s,a+1,e+1 + (1 - senry,s,a,e)iy,s,a+1,e] (22.1)
where
        s = sex (male or female);
        a = age (0 to 79);
        e = years of education (0 to 18);
       iy,s,a,e = per capita lifetime income in year y of persons of sex s, age a, and years of
education e;
       yiy,s,a,e = per capita yearly income in year y of persons of sex s, age a, and years of
education e;
        sry,s,a = survival rate in year y of persons of sex s from age a-1 to age a;
         = discount rate;
        g = real income growth rate;
       senry,s,a,e = school enrollment rate in year y of persons of sex s, age a, and years of
education e.
This approach measures lifetime income in a way that takes into account the probabilities of
survival and of school attendance, both in the present and in the future. The primary source of
data for measuring yearly income yiy,s,a,e is the March demographic supplement of the Current
Population Survey (CPS); that for measuring the school enrollment rate senry,s,a,e is the October
school enrollment supplement of the CPS; and that for measuring the survival rate sry,s,a is the
life tables of the Centers for Disease Control. It is assumed that school enrollment only takes
place between ages 5 through 34 (at other ages, senry,s,a,e = 0), and that income is only earned at
ages 14 and older (at earlier ages, yiy,s,a,e = 0). As in Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989), the real
income growth rate g is assumed to be 2 percent, while the discount rate  is assumed to be 4
percent.
An exception to equation (1) is persons aged 80 and older. For these persons, per capita human
capital is equal to
        iy,s,80+,e = [1 - (1+)-1(1+g)sry,s,81+]-1yiy,s,80+,e                                 (22.2)
This is the sum of an infinite series, and is equal to expected lifetime income given a yearly
income yiy,s,80+,e that increases at an annual rate of g, a constant rate of survival sry,s,81+, and a
discount rate .
To compute per capita human capital at a given age a, sex s, and level of education e, one begins
by first computing per capita human capital for persons aged 80 and older using equation (2),
and then working backwards to ages 79, 78, etc., all the way to age a by applying equation (1).
To compute the stock of human capital, one computes the sum of per capita human capital times
population across all combinations of age, sex, and education:
        hcy = sae (pcounty,s,a,e × iy,s,a,e)                                             (22.3)
where
        pcounty,s,a,e = population in year y of persons of sex s, age a, and years of education e.
The change in the stock of human capital from one year to next can be broken out into net
investment and revaluation as follows:
        hcy+1 - hcy = invnet(y) + revaly                                                                 (22.4)
where
        invnet(y) = sae [(pcounty+1,s,a,e - pcounty,s,a,e) × iy,s,a,e]                              (22.5)
and
        revaly = sae [pcounty+1,s,a,e × (iy+1,s,a,e - iy,s,a,e)]                                    (22.6)
Net investment in human capital is the effect on human capital of changes, from one year to the
next, in the size and distribution of the population by age, sex, and education, weighted using
lifetime earnings from the earlier of the two years. Revaluation is the change in the nominal
value of lifetime earnings--the "price" of human capital--from one year to the next, weighted
using the size and distribution of the population in the later of the two years.
In the measures used in this paper, net investment is not only measured as a whole, but also
broken down into five components: investment from births; investment from education, net of
aging while in school; depreciation from aging of persons not enrolled in school; depreciation
from deaths; and residual net investment. These are equal to:
        invbirths(y) = spcounty,s,0,0 × iy,s,0,0]                                                     (22.7)
        depdeaths(y) = - sae [pcounty,s,a,e(1 - sry,s,a+1) × iy,s,a,e]                              (22.8)
        inved(y) = sae [pcounty,s,a,esry,s,a+1senry,s,a,e × (iy,s,a+1,e+1 - iy,s,a,e)]              (22.9)
        = sae [(pcounty,s,a-1,e-1sry,s,asenry,s,a-1,e-1 - pcounty,s,a,esry,s,a+1senry,s,a,e)× iy,s,a,e]
        depaging(y) = - sae [pcounty,s,a,esry,s,a+1(1 - senry,s,a,e) × (iy,s,a+1,e - iy,s,a,e)]    (22.10)
         = - sae [(pcounty,s,a-1,esry,s,a(1 - senry,s,a-1,e) - pcounty,s,a,esry,s,a+1(1 - senry,s,a,e)) × iy,s,a,e]
        invresid(y) = invnet(y) - invbirths(y) - inved(y) + depdeaths(y) + depaging(y)                  (22.11)
Of the above components of net investment, two are substantive departures from the original
Jorgenson-Fraumeni approach and deserve further discussion.
The first of these, investment in education, net of aging, is the combined effect of having both
increased one year in age and one year in education while in school. This is different from the
approach of the original Jorgenson-Fraumeni papers, which measured the effect on human
capital from education alone. The effects of education and aging are combined here to avoid
making the assumption that the future schooling outcomes of persons not currently enrolled in
school (who, among children of school age, are falling "off track" of typical educational
progress) are the same as what the future schooling outcomes of persons currently enrolled in
school would be in a counterfactual in which they were not currently enrolled in school. This
assumption can lead to very high measures of gross educational investment, which are not robust
to alternative assumptions (see Christian, 2010, for more discussion). It is useful to note that,
because investment in education is measured net of aging, measures of depreciation from aging
only include persons not enrolled in school.
The second of these, residual net investment, is the combined effect of net migration into and out
of the United States and of measurement error. Net migration is included in residual net
investment because, unlike births, deaths, education, and population, it is not measured in such a
way as to be easily incorporated into the human capital account. Measurement error exists
because the measures of births, deaths, education, and population used in the paper are not
perfectly integrated, which means that there will be some differences in measured population
from one year to the next that are not explained by births, deaths, aging, education, or migration.
When we measure gross investment, we include residual net investment, as well as investment
from births and education:
       invgross(y) = invbirths(y) + inved(y) + invresid(y)                            (22.12)
As in the original Jorgenson-Fraumeni accounts, both market and nonmarket components of
human capital are measured. To measure these separate components, we begin by measuring
market yearly income and nonmarket yearly income separately. Market yearly income is
measured using average wage, salary, and self-employment income by year, age, sex, and
education, using data from the March CPS. To measure nonmarket yearly income, we first
compute per capita hours in nonmarket production, equal to per capita hours spent outside of
market work, school (set to 1300 hours per year times the school enrollment rate), or personal
maintenance (set to 10 hours per day) by age, sex, and education. This is multiplied by the
hourly opportunity cost of not participating in market work, which is equal to the wage times 1
minus the marginal tax rate. We compute wages and hours in market work by age, sex, and
education using the March CPS; school enrollment rates by age, sex, and education from the
October CPS; and marginal tax rates using the Internet version of TAXSIM (Feenberg and
Coutts, 1993). Combining market and nonmarket yearly income produces total yearly income:
       yiy,s,a,e (total) = yiy,s,a,e (market) + yiy,s,a,e (nonmarket)                 (22.13)
We compute market, nonmarket, and total lifetime income by alternatively using market,
nonmarket, or total yearly income as the measure of yearly income yiy,s,a,e in equations (1) and
(2). Similarly, we compute market, nonmarket, and total human capital stock and investment by
alternatively using market, nonmarket, or total lifetime income as the measure of lifetime income
iy,s,a,e in equations (3) through (12).
We compute real measures of the human capital stock by producing a chained Fisher volume
index in which volume is population by age, sex, and education and weight is lifetime income by
age, sex, and education. This is computed separately for market human capital, nonmarket
human capital, and total human capital, using market lifetime income, nonmarket lifetime
income, and total lifetime income as a weight. The real human capital stock in a given year y is
equal to the nominal human capital stock in the base year times the ratio of the value of the
Fisher volume index in year y to the value of the Fisher volume index in the base year:
         hcy (real) = hcbase × (Fy / Fbase)                                                            (22.14)
where Fy and Fbase are values of the Fisher volume index in year y and in the base year. Real
investment from births and education and depreciation from deaths and aging are similarly
computed using a Fisher volume index that uses lifetime income as a weight and the terms
multiplied by lifetime income on the right-hand sides of (7) through (10) as the disaggregated
volume.
Real net investment is computed by subtracting the real stock of human capital from a one-year
lead of the real stock:
         invnet(y) (real) = hcy+1 (real) - hcy (real)                                                  (22.15)
Real residual net investment is computed as the residual left over from real net investment after
subtracting real investment from births and education and adding real depreciation from deaths
and aging of individuals not enrolled in school.
         B. National Accounts
The national accounts methodology for all five national accounts is described in detail in
Fraumeni et al. (2017).1 In this paper, a 2009 production account is shown in Table 22.1.2


As in the “new architecture” accounts (Jorgenson and Landefeld, 2006, 2009), the core
production account of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) national and income and
product accounts (NIPA) is modified in a number of ways, but the estimates presented in this
table, aside from the human capital components, are all but one from the U.S. BEA NIPA (U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis, various dates) In the product account to allow for integration
with productivity accounts, property-type taxes are included, but some other types of taxes, such
as primarily sales taxes, are not included. Imputations for market capital services (see line 16 of
the product account) add into gross private domestic product (GPDP) several capital services that
are not in U.S. BEA NIPA Gross Domestic Product (GDP). These include those for consumer
durables and real estate held by institutions and producer durable equipment held by institutions.
The other imputation included in line 16 of the product account is the difference between the
value of household real estate capital services real estate imputed in the “new architecture”
accounts and that included in U.S. BEA NIPA GDP. These modifications are relatively minor in

  The five accounts are 1) production, 2) full (expanded) private national labor and gross national property income,
3) full (expanded) gross private national receipts and expenditures, 4) full (expanded) gross private national capital
accumulation, and 5) full (expanded) private national wealth. Tables in the main body of Fraumeni, Christian, and
Samuels (2017) outline the accounts; Appendix B of that paper presents the underlying data for 1948-84 and 1998-
2009 for that previous version of the accounts.

  2009 is the base year for the national income and product accounts of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA). Table 22.1 comes from p. S396 of Fraumeni, Christian, and Samuels (2017), except for the human capital
components: lines 18-21 of the entries under “product” and line 5 of the factor entries under “factor outlay.” These
human capital components were computed by Christian for this paper.

magnitude of GPDP.

 Notes: Totals may differ slightly from the sums due to rounding. Table numbers refer to the National Income and Product Accounts (U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis, various dates).
*Christensen and Jorgenson developed what is called the U.S. Worksheets, which modified NIPA GDP and factor outlay as outlined above.
The worksheets have never been published, but the earliest published production account using them appears on p. 23 of Christensen
and Jorgenson (1970).
In the production account, human capital components appear both in product and factor outlay.
Expanded consumption includes market consumption as well as time in household production
and leisure.3 Time in household production and leisure, which is valued at the market wage,
excludes time in school and time in sleep and maintenance. Expanded (gross) investment
includes market investment as well as investment in births, education, and the residual. Human
capital components are part of labor factor outlay. In table 22.1, expanded labor factor outlay is
equal to the sum of all components except for line 3: property outlay. Human capital labor factor
outlay combines time in household production and leisure and human capital investment. As
there are no human capital property factor outlay components, property outlay includes only
market property outlay.
Net investment does not appear in the production account, but its components are of interest.
Net investment is equal to investment (gross) which appears in the production account, minus
depreciation due to aging of individuals not enrolled in school and deaths.
In nominal values, this period’s human capital stock is equal to the stock in the previous period
plus this period’s net investment and the previous period’s revaluation. Because some
underlying estimates in the complete Christian (2017) data base, such as residual net investment,
are negative, all real net investment estimates are constructed using additive aggregation.4 In
2009 dollars, this period’s human capital stock is equal to the stock in the previous period plus
this period’s net investment.
Part II: Underlying Trends by Gender
As noted in the introduction, the period from the mid-seventies to 2012 is a period of significant
changes impacting on human capital.
Between 1970 and 2010, there were relatively minor changes in the male civilian labor force
rates by age, but significant changes in the female civilian labor force rates by age.5 As figure
22.1 shows, between 1970 and 1980, the shape of the civilian female labor force participation
rate by age profile changed significantly, from one in which the impact of child-bearing could
clearly be seen to one in which this was no longer true. The apex of civilian female labor force
participation rate by age profile rose by over 10 percentage points between 1970 and 1980 and
again between 1980 and 1990, to end up at around 75 percent, before the whole profile showed
minor changes between 1990, 2000, and 2010. As figure 22.2 shows, the apex of the male

  The adjective “expanded” refers to constructs that include both human and market components. In previous
published versions of this research (Jorgenson and Fraumeni, 1989; Fraumeni, Christian, and Samuels, 2017) the
adjective “full” was used instead of the adjective “expanded.” In addition, the adjective “nonhuman” was frequently
used when referring to market (nonhuman) components.
4
  However, contributions by gender to human components by market, nonmarket, and household production and
leisure are constructed with a Törnqvist index as the totals for these categories are all positive numbers (for example,
see Figure 22.8).

Over the period 1975 to 2010, average educational attainment for both males and females aged
15 and over increased substantially.6 The difference between genders is at most .4 years of
school; the average for both began in 1975 at about 11.5 years and ended at something just over
13 years in 2010. However, a comparison of average number of years of school by gender for
those aged 25-34 versus 55-64 is striking. Until 1995 as figure 22.3 shows, the difference
between years of school for the younger versus the older individuals is at least 1.5 years.
Beginning in 1995 the difference decreases substantially for both genders, most notably starting
in 2000 there is no appreciable difference between younger and older males. In fact, in 2005 and
2010, years of school of younger males is slightly less than for older males. In contrast, the
number of years of school of younger females continues to be greater than for older females. By
2010, the years of school of younger females is greater than either that of younger or older
males. It is expected that the female pipeline will lead to a higher 15 and over average for
females than males as younger females age. This development is clearly in part a function of a
larger percentage of 18 to 24 year old females than males enrolled in post-secondary degree
granting institutions beginning in 1991 (figure 22.4).7

Between 1975 and 2012 the labor income gender gap narrowed.8 The average income of a full-
time year-round female worker as a percent of males rose from 56.2 percent in 1975 to 72.5
percent in 2012. The increase in the percent is not monotonic, notably it declined in 1999, 2000,
and 2008. The percent peaked at 72.9 percent in 2007, subsequently hovering at around 72
percent from 2010 to 2012.
At the same time that females’ average wages as a percent of males’ rose, the allocation of time
between market work and time in household production and leisure changed.9 As a share of time
excluding sleep and maintenance, in 1975 males on average spent a larger share of their time in
school than females; the probability that a male was enrolled in school is greater than that for a
female. By 2012, this share of time is almost equal for males and females because the
probability that a female is enrolled in school caught up to that of males. Of greater interest are
the changes in shares of time in market work and household production and leisure excluding
time in school over this time period. It is not surprising that as a larger percentage of females
moved into the labor force, they substituted market work time for household production and
leisure time, to the tune of about .05 percentage point in the shares (see table 22.2). Males
substituted household production and leisure time for market work time, but they reallocated
their time on average to a much lesser degree as the change amounted to only .006 percentage
point in the shares.

Part III: National Level Accounts
Including human capital in any analysis is key to understanding economic growth. Figures 22.5
and 22.6 show the growth accounting components with and without human capital.10 On the
output side, the contributions to economic growth are those from consumption and investment.
On the input side, the contributions to economic growth are those from capital, labor, and change
in multifactor productivity growth. Figure 22.6 includes the expanded GPDP components, while
figure 22.5 does not. As table 22.1 shows, the expanded GPDP human capital components,
which include investment in education, net of aging, time in household production and leisure,
and the residual, are very large relative to GPDP. Growth in human capital components depends
upon population growth by category, and increasing levels of education and wage growth as
reflected in lifetime income weights. These all grow slowly compared to GDP. According to the
World Bank, U.S. population growth from 1975-2012 averaged 1.04 percent per year.11 Human
capital estimates in this paper assume a real labor income growth rate of 2 percent per year. The
progress in raising the average number of years in school for the population 15 and over (Barro
and Lee, 2016) is notable, the increase per year averages at most .4 percent per year from 1975-
2010. The average rate of growth in real GDP is 2.9 percent per year from 1975-2012.12
Individuals are more highly educated on average, but population growth is slow. Accordingly for
the whole period 1975 to 2012, it is not surprising that the rate of growth of GPDP excluding
human capital is almost double that of expanded GPDP including human capital (see table 22.3);
in addition, the 1976 to 2012 contribution of multifactor productivity change excluding human
capital is about three times that in the accounts including human capital.13

   As the quantities of human capital investment and time in household production and leisure on the output side
appear as nonmarket labor input on the input side, human capital components do not contribute to multifactor
productivity.

In all sub periods starting with 1996 or later there are notable differences in the contributions
with and without human capital as well changes in the relative growth rate of GPDP across sub
periods.14 15 Between 1995 and 2000 and 2000 and 2006, the quantity of human capital
investment either rose slightly or fell. As figure 22.3 shows, 1995 is the year in which the
average years of school of 25 to 34 year olds compared to 55 to 64 year olds for both genders
narrowed. In subsequent years, as previously noted, there is almost no difference in years of
school for the younger and older males. The sub period 1996-2000 is a remarkable time for the
impact of computers on economic growth, but not for human capital investment.16 When human
capital is included, there is little difference between this and previous sub periods. In 2001-2006,
the contribution of investment including human capital is only one-tenth of consumption
including time in household production and leisure.
During the 2007 through 2009 Great Recession years, tertiary enrollment and time use by both
men and women differs compared to other sub periods.17 Changes in tertiary enrollment
percentages and time use shares by either gender are small or nonexistent in the prior and the
later sub period. From 2006 to 2009, the percentages of individuals aged 18 to 24 enrolled in a
post-secondary degree-granting institution increased substantially and the share of time devoted
to work dropped by almost the identical amount that the share of time in household production
and leisure increased as the share of time devoted to school stayed almost constant. From 2006
to 2009, the percent of 18-24 year-old males enrolled in a post-secondary degree-granting
institution increased by 4.3 percentage points from 34.1 to 38.4 percent; for females the
comparable figures are 3.6 percentage points from 40.6 to 44.2 percent.18 Over the same period,
considering time devoted to household production and leisure and market work, the male share

   Contributions are calculated as a weighted rate of growth of quantities in logs, where the weights are the average
share of this period’s and last period’s nominal values. The multifactor productivity change contribution is the
exception as it is the rate of growth of the quantity of output minus the contributions of all inputs.

   Human capital investment in education occurs when individuals are in school.

   The official dates for the “Great Recession” from the National Bureau of Economic Research Business Cycle
Dating Committee are December 2007 (peak) to June 2009 (trough). Annual growth rates in real GDP declined
substantially from 2004 through 2007, accordingly it is not surprising that time use and enrollments are impacted
beginning in 2007. U.S. BEA NIPA real GDP annual growth rates are: 3.8 percent in 2004, 3.3 percent in 2005, 2.7
percent in 2006, and 1.8 percent in 2007.

of time devoted to household production and leisure (market work) rose (decreased) by 2.4
percentage points; for females the comparable figure is .8 percentage points.
From 2007-9, as shown in the output side of the contributions charts, the contributions of both
consumption and investment are larger in absolute value terms when human capital is excluded,
however output growth is positive only when human capital is included. The increase in tertiary
enrollment is a positive investment in education, net of aging, contribution to economic growth
as is the increase in consumption from a larger share of time devoted to household production
and leisure. In addition, from 2006-9, in spite of the recession beginning in late 2007, the
quantity of market consumption increases, while the quantity of market investment as expected
decreases substantially.
During the same period, the fact that human labor input is so large relative to market labor input,
ranging from about 80 to 83 percent of total nominal labor input, changes the growth picture
substantially. Human labor input is set equal to human capital investment, including the residual,
plus time in household production and leisure. First, the positive contribution of human labor
input outweighs the negative contribution of market labor input. Second, although in both charts
capital input is all market capital input, because the share of market capital input is much smaller
in the chart including human capital given the large magnitude of human labor input, the
contribution of capital to output is substantially less than in the chart without human capital. The
contribution of multifactor productivity change is negative both with and without human capital,
but it is substantially less negative when the positive influence of human labor input is factored
into the analysis. The contribution of multifactor productivity change is negative both with and
without human capital, with the contribution of multifactor productivity change without human
capital being more than four times more negative than that with human capital.
In the next sub period: 2010-12, market investment recovers; the quantity of market investment
increasing by about 25 percent between 2009 and 2012, but the quantity of human investment
declines by over 4 percent in the same time period. On net, expanded labor input decreases, and
capital input (which is all market) increases, and the contribution of multifactor productivity
growth to growth in expanded GPDP is almost a full percentage point less than the contribution
of multifactor productivity growth to growth in GPDP, excluding human capital.
For comparison, tables 22.3 and 22.4 and figure 22.7 include estimates with only market human
capital. Time in household production and leisure is excluded from the market human capital
estimates. In addition, the magnitudes of the market human capital estimates are lower than
those which include nonmarket human capital. The largest absolute difference between market
and total human capital is for investment in human capital from births because the difference in
lifetime income is accumulated over more years than for individuals of specific ages (table 22.4
However, total input or output contributions from market human capital are greater than those
which include nonmarket human capital (table 22.3). This is because the total human capital
expanded GPDP components are a far larger percentage of adjusted GPDP than those for market
human capital (table 22.4). As the first paragraph of this section explained, expanded
components normally have a lower rate of growth than NIPA or adjusted GDP.

The overall level and individual components of the contributions vary significantly between the
two constructs as figures 22.6 and 22.7 illustrate. Except in the sub period 2007-9, total
contributions are largest for the account without human capital, followed by market human
capital only, then total human capital (table 22.3). Typically, the share of contribution of labor
input to input growth and the share of contribution of consumption to output growth is less with
market human capital only than with total human capital, as nonmarket labor input and time in
household production and leisure are excluded in the market human capital only version. The
exceptions occur in a 2001-2012 sub period when one or more contribution is negative.
Multifactor productivity for market human capital only is always greater than for multifactor
productivity when nonmarket human capital is included, except during the last sub period 2009-
12. As this paper illustrates, time periods starting after 2000 exhibit different features than those
for the earlier sub periods.

Part IV: Human Capital Components by Gender
Delving into the components of human capital investment and stock and allocation of time by
gender reveals additional trends over time. Gross investment is the sum of births, education, net
of aging, and residual components (equation 22.12). Net investment subtracts depreciation due
to aging of individuals not enrolled and deaths. Both investment and stock can be separated into
market and nonmarket components. The nonmarket component includes human capital
investment and time in household production and leisure. As residual net investment and some
elements of detailed investment by gender, age, and education can be negative, contributions
cannot be calculated for human capital gross or net investment except by market human and
nonmarket human components.
In most cases between 1975 and 2012, male nominal investment shares and stock shares of totals
for the country generally trend downward and female nominal shares generally trend upward. In
all cases, the pace of the share changes slowed sometime in the nineties and the percent change
between 1975 and 2012 is larger for females than for males. It is not surprising that the biggest
percent change in any share at 15.8 percent is for female investment in births (see table 22.5),
however the female percent changes for investment in education, net of aging, depreciation due
to deaths, and human capital stock are all between 13.4 and 14.0 percent. No female share of
total for the country is at or above 50 percent, but all but one are close to 45 percent or above by
2012. All female shares begin in the range of about 35 to 40 percent. The largest decrease in the
male percent share is for investment in births, foretelling future changes in human capital stocks.

Table 22.2 demonstrated that women are spending less of their time in household production and
leisure, but the nominal share of household production and leisure, relative to market and
nonmarket human capital investment nominal shares, has increased (see table 22.6). This occurs
as a result of wages paid to women rising by more than enough to compensate for the reduction
in time. In table 22.6, three-way and two-way nominal shares are both presented. Although the
share of male nonmarket human capital is essentially unchanging between 1975 and 2012, it is in
part because there is a reallocation of time between market work and time in household
production and leisure as table 22.2 shows.19 In both two-way and three-way comparisons, the
female market and nonmarket human capital investment nominal shares remain substantially
below those for men compared to the time in household production and leisure nominal share. In
addition, in both comparisons, the female nominal share of time in household production and
leisure remains substantially above those for men.

Examining real net investment components: investment in births and education, net of aging,
residual, and aging from individuals not enrolled in school and death depreciation, underscores
gender and sub period differences. In absolute value terms, the size of the real net investment
components are significantly different between the first major sub period: 1975-2000, and the
second: 2001-2012. Figure 22.8 shows that the positive and negative components for both
genders become significantly larger.20 21 The increasing levels of education, particularly tertiary
education, influence both investment in education, net of aging, and investment in births, the
latter as the expectation of higher future enrollments increases newborns expected lifetime
income. In 2000, although the average years of school of males aged 25-34 is almost the same as

19
   The nominal value of time in household production and leisure only depends on time spent today and the current
market wage. Since market and nonmarket human capital are lifetime income constructs, there are a number of
factors which affect their nominal value, such as expected future education, number of working years, and survival
rate. The real income growth rate is 2 percent for all future years.
20
   The sum of the real net investment percent shares sum to 100, but in figure 22.8 the percent shares are divided by
100 to fit them within the bars. Accordingly, the percent shares in figure 22.8 sum to 1.0.
21
   Contributions cannot be computed by these components of real net investment as residual investment is negative
in a number of years. For the same reason, net investment is computed with additive aggregation.
the average years of school of males aged 55-64, the average years of school for those younger is
substantially greater than it is in 1995 (figure 22.3). Female average years of school for those
aged 25-34 continued to increase over the second major sub period. As individuals age, their
lifetime income decreases as they have fewer years before they die. Baby boomers births, those
born between mid-1946 and mid-1964, which created a demographic bulge, by 2001 are between
37 and 55 years of age, and by 2012 are between 48 and 66 years of age.22 Accordingly, it is not
surprising that the male share of real net investment for both aging for individuals not enrolled in
school and death depreciation becomes more negative in each of the sub periods 2001-2006,
2007-9, and 2010-12. Although the female share of net investment for aging for individuals not
enrolled in school and death depreciation does not become more negative in each of the three sub
periods, these shares are significantly more negative than those for the first major sub period. In
general, depreciation from aging for individuals not enrolled in school is greater for more highly
educated individuals than for less highly educated individuals. Women live longer than males on
average and are becoming more highly educated, but even in 2010 older males are more highly
educated on average than older females (figure 22.3).

Another way to examine gender differences is to consider contributions of the expanded GDP
components: market human capital net investment, nonmarket human capital net investment and
time in household production and leisure net investment to human components by gender as
shown in figure 22.9.23 24 In all but the earliest lowest level sub period: 1976-1995, for both
genders, there are at least some negative contributions, but the time in household production and
leisure contribution is always positive. As the time that men spend in household production and
leisure is going up, it is expected that the contribution of this component will be positive. The
fairly consistent downward trend in female time in household production and leisure per capita
ends in 2000, yet female total time in household production and leisure increases in all years as
population growth more than offsets the decrease in time per capita. In the 2007-2009 sub period
the contribution of male time in household production and leisure is substantially larger than it is
for other years. In the same sub period, the female contribution is larger than in any other sub
period. In both cases, the cause is a reallocation time away from market work time to time in
household production and leisure during the U.S. Great Recession as already described.
Beginning in 1996-2000, for both genders, the contribution of market and nonmarket net
investment in human capital is negative or very small, except in 2007-2009. Investment in
education, net of aging, which occurs only when individuals are in school, is one of two positive
additions to net investment in human capital. As previously described, 2007-2009 is a sub period
in which the percentage of individuals 18-24 who enrolled in tertiary education increased
substantially. However, between 2009 and 2010, this enrollment leveled off, before decreasing
between 2011 and 2012. From 1975 to 1990, births increased in every year but two.25
Subsequently births declined from 1990 through 1997, then increased in most years, but then
declined again from 2007 through 2012.26 The impact of the decrease in births starting in 2007
is most felt in nonmarket net investment in human capital. It is not surprising that births
decreased during the recession because of the uncertainty the recession created. In 2010-2012,
the rate of growth of the quantity of net investment is a negative 1.1 percent for males and a
negative 4.1 percent for females. In this sub period, the share of real net investment for both
depreciation from ageing for individuals not enrolled in school and death are significantly larger
than for any other sub period, reflecting the aging of the baby boomers.

   These contributions can be presented as nonmarket labor outlay is estimated with a Törnqvist index from the
aggregate quantities of market and nonmarket human capital investment and time in household production by
gender, which are always positive.
24
   The investment in human capital, residual, is included in the respective net investment totals.

The final figure shows the contribution to human capital stock by gender (see figure 22.10).
Growth in human capital stock slows during the later sub periods beginning in 2000, primarily
for demographic reasons. During this time population growth is slowing and baby boomers are
aging. Even during the earlier sub period: 1975-2000, when population growth is higher,
population growth still averages only 1.1 percent.27 Accordingly, contributions to human capital
stock are all fairly small. Investment in education, net of aging, is still an important source of
growth in the stock, but the pace of increases in educational attainment, particularly among those
25-34, has slowed. Female labor force participation and the ratio of females to male wages
stagnates by the end of this second major period. It is notable that female human capital stock
contributions exceeds that of males in each of the sub periods beginning in 1996. There are clear
differences between the first major sub period: 1975-2000 and the second: 2001-2012. Between
1975 to 2000 and 2001 to 2012, the male market contributions dropped by .15 percentage points
and the male nonmarket contribution dropped by .11 percentage points. Between the same two
periods, the female market contribution dropped only .04 percentage points and the female
nonmarket contribution by just .09 percentage points. In addition, the share of male market
contributions in total male contributions fell by over 16 percentage points; the female market
share of contributions to human capital stock also dropped, but only by just over 2 percentage
points. As figure 22.6 previously demonstrated, there are clear differences between the earlier
major sub period and the second.

Part V: Conclusion
This paper has documented that there have been significant changes in human capital in the
United States over the period 1975-2012. Analysis by gender points out that although changes in
male human capital occur, the changes in female human capital arising from significant
underlying trends in labor force participation, educational attainment, relative wages, and time
use are even greater. In addition, the first major sub period: 1975-2000, typically looks quite
different than the second major sub period: 2001-2012. The future is more likely to look like
the second major time period: 2001-2012, than the first: 1975-2000, as the underlying trends
have not continued to more recent years. Without an analysis including human capital and an
analysis by gender, important elements of past, present, and potential future economic growth in
the United States would be missed.
