                       Height and Per Capita Income



                                ABSTRACT



     As an aid to interpreting the results of height-by-age studies
this paper investigates the relationship between average height and
per capita income. The relationships among income, nutrition,
medical    care, and   height at the individual level suggest that average
height    is nonlinearly related to per capita income and that the

distribution of income is an impo±tant determinant of average height.

Empirical analysis rests on 56 height studies and per capita income

estimates for 20 developed or developing countries.

                                Introduction

The recent spate of papers analyzing height—by-age data has left some

economists and historians uneasy about the methodology employed and the

meaning of the results.' Although the papers typically include a discus-

sion of human growth and its determinants, scholars unfamiliar with this

literature have difficulty assessing the behavioral significance of cross-

sectional differences or time profiles of height. One solution to this

problem has been to conduct or to propose height-by-age studies of various

populations with the objective of establishing a benchmark of performance

against which other populations can be compared. Height differences

among U.S. whites, slaves, and some Europeans during the nineteenth century,

for example, reveal that U.S. whites undoubtably had environmental advantages.

     The advantages enjoyed by U.S. whites may be explained by diet, caloric

intake relative to physical exertion, the disease environment, public health

measures, etc. Any discussion along these lines must also address the possible

role of genetic factors. While efforts in this direction are essential for

understanding the details of these societies, interpreting the results in

these terms probably requires a greater commitment to the literature of human

biology than most economists and historians are willing to make.

    As an aid to interpreting the results of height—by—age studies, it would

be helpful to compare and contrast height with other measures of well—being.

This paper investigates the relationship between height and per capita income.

Height is an index of nutrition and health that depends largely on income.

The connections among height, nutrition, and health, and among nutrition,

health, and income are considered separately. Empirical analysis rests on

56 height studies and per capita income estimates for 20 countries.

                       Nutrition, Health; and Height

    Human growth from birth to maturity follows a well—defined pattern.2

The change in height, or velocity, is greatest during infancy, falls sharply,

and then ordinarily declines into the pre-adolescent years. During adoles-

cence velocity rises sharply to a peak that equals approximately one-half of

the velocity during infancy, then falls sharply and reaches zero at maturity.

In girls the adolescent growth spurt begins about two years earlier, and the

magnitude of the spurt is smaller than in boys. Girls and boys are about

the same height prior to the spurt.

     The height of an individual reflects the interaction of genetic and

environmental influences during the period of growth. According to Eveleth

and Tanner:

     Such interaction may be complex. Two genotypes which pro-

     duce the same adult height under optimal environmental cir-

     cumstances may produce different heights under circumstances

     of privation. Thus two children who would be the same height

     in a well—off community may not only be smaller under poor

     economic conditions, but onemay be significantly smaller

     than the other.... If a particular environmental stimulus is

     lacking at a time when it is essential for the child (times

     known as 'sensititive periods') then the child's development may

     be shunted as it were, from one line to another'3

     Although genes are important determinants of the heights of individuals,

studies involving genetically similar and dissimilar populations under vari-

ous environmental conditions suggest that differences in average height

across most populations are largely attributable to environmental factors.

Using data from various social classes and several developed and developing co-

untries, Habicht et al., argue that heiqht (and weic'ht) standards chosen to rep—
                                       3

 resent optimal pre-school growth can be drawn from studies of well-off

 children, regardless of race or ethicity, because "any racial or ethnic

effect on mean preschool growth is small compared with environmental effects.4 In

a review of studies covering populations in Europe, New Guinea, and Mexico, Malcolm

concludes that "although the overall pattern such as the sex difference, the

adolescent spurt and the general shape of the curves, is genetically det-

ermined, the differences between populations are almost entirely the product

of the environment."5 Although differences in average heights across many

populations are related primarily to environment, comparisons involving

Japanese adults are an exception that may have a substantial genetic basis;

well-off Japanese reach, an average, the 15th height centile of well-off

Britains.6

     Physical growth is correlated with many environmental variables, but

in the final analysis most of them operate through nutrition and disease.7

Malnutrition combined with illness may produce a synergistic effect.8

Poorly nourished children are more susceptible to infection and infection

reduces the body's absorption of nutrients. The mortality rate from measles,

for example, is several times higher in malnourished compared to well nourished

children.

     The sensitivity of growth to malnutrition or illness depends on the age

at which they occur. For a given degree of deprivation, the effects may be

proportional to the velocity of growth under optimal conditions)0 Thus

young children and adolescents are particularly sensitive to environmental

insults. At the end of a period of slow growth, normal height may be

restored by catch-up growth. If the treatment following slow growth is

insufficient for catch—up growth, normal adult height may be approached by

an extension of the growing period. Prolonged and severe deprivation
                                      4


produces stunting, that is, a reduction in adult size.'1

    Wartime famines demonstrate the effects of deprivation on growth.

The heights of German children of a given age declined by one to three

inches when their food consumption was restricted during World War

Adolescent heights also declined in Japan and the Soviet Union during

World War u)3

                       Income, Nutrition, and Health

     Caloric intake is a reasonably reliable indicator of nutrition.'4

Calories are a measure of the potential energy available for maintenance

of bodily functions and growth, and caloric consumption is correlated

with the intake of protein, mineral , and vitamin nutrients.

     Income is the most important determinant of diet)5 Extremely poor

families may spend two—thirds or more of their income on food, but a high

proportion of a very low income purchases few calories. Malnutrition

associated with extreme poverty is known to have a major impact on height.

Once calorie requirements are satisfied, additional expenditures on food

purchase largely variety, palatability, and convenience. An income level

that is low by current European or North Merican standards is sufficient

to purchase enough calories to prevent retarded growth and stunting)6

     Impoverished families can afford little medical care, and additional

income may have an important affect on health through control of infectious

diseases. While tropical climates have acquired a bad reputation for diseases,

King argues that poor health in developing countries is largely a consequence

of poverty rather than climate)7 There is a group of diseases which are

spread bynectors that need a warm climate, but poverty is responsible for the

lack of doctors, nurses, drugs, and equipment that combats these and other

diseases. Private expenditures per capita on health care are necessarily small

in developing countries and government expenditures per capita may be less than

11100 of those in industrialized countries.'8
                                       S


     Within industrialized countries height rises with income or Socio-

economic class.19 The differences in height may be related to expenditures

on health care. Expenditures on health services rise with income and there

is a positive relationship between health services and health.20

     Height is also a function of the disease environment. This variable is

not measured easily, but one might argue that the expectation of life at birth

is a suitable prOxy that is independent of per capita income. In the data of

this study the correlation between the expectation of life at birth and the

log of per capita income is about .88, and consequently estimates of their

separate effects on height are unreliable. Although the regressions discussed

below include only the log of per capita income, the estimated coefficient of

this variable reflects the effect of both income and health.

                                   The Data

     The most comprehensive data on human growth are published in Eveleth

and Tanner, Worldwide Variation in Human Growth. This book summarizes and

interprets the results of numerous growth studies primarily undertaken during

the 1960s and 1970s. Tables in the appendix give the same type of information

for each study, including country, the qroups of people or place, date of

publication, height by year of age up to age 18 (heights are not available

for some ages), and adult height.21 The tables include several national

studies of height as well as studies of numerous smaller groups such as rural,

urban, student, military, poor, and rich residents. Studies of relatively

small groups such as tribes are excluded from this analysis on the basis that

little information is available about their per capita income relative to the

national average.
                                     6



     Extensive data on per capita income since 1950 for market—oriented

economies are available in Summers et al (l980).22 Per capita income

estimates for centrally planned economies were interpolated from World

Bank data.23 jam   is the source of data on income distribution.24 Unfo-

rtunately the match between height studies and income distribution studies

is not very complete; the overlap permits analysis of 56 height studies

in 20 countries.

                                  Analysis

     It is difficult to specify a priori the functional form of the

relationship between height and per capita income, although it is argued

below that it is probably nonlinear. At the individual level, extreme

poverty results in malnutrition, retarded growth, and stunting. Higher

incomes permit the purchase of a better diet, and height increases cor-

respondingly. Once income is high enough to satisfy caloric requirements,

there is little, if any, height gain available from changes in diet

related to higher incomes. Height may continue to increase with income,

however, because more or better medical care services are purchased. Con-

sumption patterns change with income so that more and more of a person's

genetic potential is realized; once the potential is reached environmental

variables have no more effect. The limits to the process are apparent from

the fact that people who grew up in very wealthy families are not physical

giants.

     If the relationship between height and income is non—linear at the indi-

vidual level, then the relationship at the aggregate of country level de-

pends on the distribution of income. Average height may differ for a given

per capita income depending, for example, on the fraction of people with

insufficient income to purchase adequate calories. Since the gain in height
                                      7

at the individual level increases at a decreasing rate as a function of

income, one would expect average height at the country level to rise,

for a given per capita income, with the degree of equality of:the income

distribution (assuming that there are people who have not reached their

genetic potential). Food prices, the composition of the diet, knowledge

and standards of personal hygiene, public health measures that control

disease, the disease environment, as well as the amount of physical

exertion required to earn a given income, and intergenerational factors

(the length of time that a given per capita income has been sustained) may

all affect a country's average height at a given level of per capita income;

social and cultural values such as the pattern of food distribution within

the family, methods of preparation, and tastes and preferences for foods may

also be relevant.25

     One should proceed with considerable caution, then, to estimate and

interpret the relationship between per capita income and average height

at the aggregate level. Despite the large number of factors that may

influence average height at a given level of per capita income, there is a

high correlation between these variables.26 The functional form ofthe re-

lationship was explored by regressing average height on various polynominals

in per capita income and the log of per capita income. There is a sub-

stantial improvement in fit by going from the linear to the quadratic formu-

lation, and a slight improvement by going from the quadratic to the cubic.

Because the semilog form fits approximately as well as the cubic and the

semilog is simpler, results are reported for the semilog formulation. Table 1

shows that the simple correlations between average height and the log of per

capita income are as high as .90. Data on per capita income are most compatible

with data obtained from national height studies; hence Table 1 includes only
                                       8

those countries for which national height studies are available.27

     The analysis can be expanded to include height studies of various

subsets of a country's population by employing a regression framework.

Adolescents and adults are examined separately because the independent

variables may have different effects on the heights of these groups. The

independent variables available, in addition to the log of per capita

income, include a Gini coefficient, dumy variables representing "poor",

"rich", urban, rural, university student, and military residents.28 The

urban, rural, and student variables may 'operate as proxies for income

because a relatively high proportion of the poor are located in rural areas,29

and university, students tend to come from high income families. The anti-

cipated effect of military employment is ambiguous; some countries have

minimum height standards, universal service is required in others and the

bulk of the personnel in many countries is drawn from lower socio-econornic

classes.

     The height studies involve populations of Europeans, Africans, Asians,

Indo—Mediterraneans, and people with European ancestory or African ancestory.3°

In view of the emphasis given to environmental as opposed to genetic deter-

minants of average height by human biologists, the dummy variables that

represent these classifications may capture largely environmental effects (other

than income) such as food prices, health care measures, the disease environment,

cultural factors, etc.

     The heights of children aged 10 through 14 are particularly sensitive

to environmental influences. Children within this age group are included in

the regression by introducing dummy variables for ages 11 through 14. The

dummy variable representing sex has a genetic basis.
                                         9


        While it is safe to argue that causation runs
                                                            one way from per capita
 income to the heights of children, per capita income and adult height are

 determined jointly. Height is an index of health and nutrition, and the

 health and nutrition of workers are known to affect output.31          Healthy

workers have greater physical vigor, fewer days lost from work, and longer

working lives. By using two stage least squares it is not necessary to

specify the complete model involving adult height and per capita income;

exogenous variables excluded from the height equations must be employed,

though, to identify the height equation. Any reasonable model of per capita

income determination would probably tnclude the value of the capital stock

per worker, a measure of human capital per worker, and the percentage of the

population of working age. Reliable estimates of the capital stock per

worker are available for only a few countries, and therefore the other exogenous

variables are used to identify the height equation. The adult literacy rate

is used as a measure of human capital. The adult literacy rate and the

percentage of the population of working age are available from the World

Bank.

        The estimated equations are given in Table 2. The income variable, the

Gini coefficient variable, and the rural     ,   poor,   and rich variables have the

expected signs.32 The negative sign of the urban variable may reflect large

migration from rural to urban areas; many urban areas also have large numbers

of poor people.33 Minimum height standards may dominate the effects of the

military variable. The coefficient of the female variable is positive among

adolescents probably because girls begin the growth spurt earlier than boys.

The ethnic variables may capture possible genetic differences, but in view

of the important role attributed to environment by human biologiests, envir-

onmental factors may underlie the results. Among adults the ethnic variables

have no statistically significant effect, but among children all ethnic

variables are negative and four out five are are statistically significant.
                                      10

This finding may reflect that fact that children are relatively sensitive

to the environment; some deprivation in childhood may be overcome by an

extension of the growing period. Our understanding of environmental

consequences would be improved by analysis of individual level data.

     Some relationships between height and per capita income that are

implied by the regressions in Table 2 are shown in Table 3.   It should be

recalled that the log of per capita income is highly correlated with the

expectation of life at birth, and therefore the coefficient of the log

of per capita income reflects both income and health. The estimated rela-

tionships apply to people with European ancestors; the Gini coefficient was

evaluated at the sample mean. Height is particularily sensitive to income

at low income levels. hnong boys age 12, for example, height increases by

6.7 centimeters as per capita income increases from $150 to $1,000, whereas

the gain is 5.7 centimeters as per capita income increases from $1,000 to

$5,000.

     The relationships in Tables 2 and 3 should be interpreted with

considerable caution. Average height should not be used to infer per

capita income because per capita income is only one determinant of average

height. The relationships given in Table 3 change as a function of the

income distribution, place of residence, and ethnic group. The coefficients

in Table 2 show that average height is particularly sensitive to the income

distribution; an increase of 0.1 in the Gini coefficient reduces average

adult height more than 3 centimeters. Analyses of fluctuations or

differences in the heights of populations should consider the possible

role of the income distribution, or the distribution of variables such as

nutrition that determine height.

      The equations shown in Table 2 are based on mid—twentieth
                                                                  century
 data, and it is likely that different coefficients would be obtained from

 data for earlier time periods. Improved medical
                                                   technology probably shifted
the relationship between average height and per capita income. Knowledge

of the germ theory of disease, for example, enabled individuals to improve

health, and therefore increase height, with no change in income.

     The difficulties of using the regression coefficients based on cross-

sectional data to interpret historical time series are illustrated by the

li. S. case. Troops who fought in the American Revolution were nearly as

tall as World War II U.S. troops,34 yet per capita income was several

times higher during the later period. A change in the distribution of

income towards greater inequality may explain a portion of the apparent

contradiction.35 Despite the fact that per capita income was low during

the mid 1700s there may have been sufficient income for most people to

achieve or nearly achieve their genetic potential. The coefficient in

Table 2 implies that a reduction in the Gini coefficient of 0.2, for example,

increases average adult height by more than 7 centimeters.36   In addition,

fertile land was abundant in the United States and the American diet of

the mid l700s was probably better than that in developing countries today,

even though measured income was low in late Colonial America and is low in

developing countries today.

                            Concluding Remarks

    The average height of a population is a measure of economic welfare

that is sensitive to the consumption of basic necessities, particularily

food and medical care. Consequently, height data can be used to analyze

questions traditionally posed with income data. Height studies that are

underway for various countries reveal trends and fluctuations in living

standards. Analysis of the timing and amplitude of fluctuations and

trends may help to identify causes of changes in living standards. The

distribution of height, the standard deviation of height, and differences

in average height across social and economic classes are measures of

the distribution of well-being that are useful in this area of research.

     The distribution of income is an important determinant of average height.

Miong individuals height increases at a decreasing rate as a function of

income, and a more equal distribution of income at the aggregate level

increases average height. Studies of differences or changes in average

height should consider the possible effects of differences or changes in

the income distribution.

21. Income or health may have improved in some countries such that cohort

     effects may become relevant for studies involving adults; per capita

     income or health conditions may have been relatively lower during the

     growing years for older adults in the sample. Fortunately, the tables

     in the appendix usually report the age range of the study, and the

     subjects in most studies could be described as young adults. The age

     range in two Egyptian studies was 19—68, which is an exception.

     However, the Egyptian studies and the few studies in which the age

     range is not reported do not produce outliers; in each case the predicted

     height is within one standard error of the estimate of the observed height.

22. The method of comparative evaluation is an issue in the use of per capita

     income data for various countries. This issue is discussed in Simon

    Kuznets, Modern Economic Growth: Rate, Structure, and Spread (New Haven,
                                        16

      1966), pp. 359—399.   It would be desirable to have data based on detailed

      price and output comparisons, as suggested in Robert Summers, Irving B.

      Kravis, and Alan Heston, "International Comparions of Real Product and

      its Composition, 1950-1977," The Review of Income and Wealth 26 (March

      1980), 19—66, but the number of countries for which data are available

      is insufficient for the type of analysis undertaken here.

25. Cultural food practices are discussed in Caliendo, pp. 227-257.

26. Attained height is a function of income during the years of height

      growth, and a more elaborate model would include several lagged

      values of per capita income. In view of the large differences in per

      capita income across countries, lagged values would probably add little

      to the analysis; their inclusion does not justify the additional complexity.

27. If all height studies, including those for only urban, rural, poor,

      military, etc., are included in the analysis, the correlations are

      about .15 to .30 lower. The correlations reported for age 12.. are

      representative of those for adolescents of other ages. The most abundant

      adolescent height data are for age 12. Per capita income is measured

      as of the year that the height study was published.

28. There are no studies involving "poor" or "rich" adults or involving

      "student" or "military" adolescents.          .

30.   Due .to a lack of income distribution data, there are no observations

      for adult Africans.           .

32. One cannot rule out the possibility that the Gini coefficient is an indicator

    for other variables. It has been argued, for example, that income tends

    to become more evenly distributed during the course of economic growth.

    See Simon Kuznets, "Economic Growth and Income Inequality," American

    Economic Review 45 (March 1955), 1—28. The correlation between the log

    of per capita income and the Gini coefficient is only about —.17 in the

    data of this study.
