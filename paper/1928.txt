            An Assessment of the Benefits of Air Pollution Control:
                            The Case of Inf ant Death



                                    ABSTRACT



         This paper contains estimates of the impacts of air pollutants on

    race—specific neonatal mortality rates based on data for heavily popu—

    lated counties of the U.S. in 1977. Unlike previous research in this

    area, these estimates are obtained from a well specified behavioral

    model of the production of health, which is estimated with the

    appropriate simultaneous equations techniques. The results suggest

    that sulfur dioxide is the dominant air pollutant in newborn survival

    outcomes. There is also evidence that an increase in sulfur dioxide

    raises the neonatal mortality rate by raising the percentage of low—

    birth weight births. Based on marginal—willingness—to—pay com-

    putations, we estimate that the benefits of a 10 percent reduction in

    sulfur dioxide levels range between $54 million and $1.09 billion in

    1977 dollars.

                              I. Introduction
                                                                           -



   The controversy surrounding the work of Lave and Seskin (1970, 1973,

1977) on the negative effect of air pollution on aggregate mortality has
continued unabated for well over a decade. The debate has sharpened the

focus of succeeding research by calling attention to such issues as

simultaneity (Gerking and Schulze 1981; Crocker et al. 1979), confounding

(Schwing and MacDonald 1976; Lave and Chappie 1982), functional form (Smith

1976), and the impact of priors on model specification (Atkinson, Crocker,

and Murdock 1985). Moreover, efforts to place a monetary value on the

benefits of reduced pollution have also evolved. Emphasis on lost produc-

tivity (Lave and Seskin 1977) has given way to the theoretically more

appealing measure of willingness to pay (Rosen 1981; Gerking 1983). Cross—

sectional mortality studies are not a substitute for micro—level data based

on individually monitored exposure. Nevertheless, a well—structured ecolo-

gical study can provide evidence of potentially causal relationships bet-

ween pollution and mortality. In addition, aggregate studies remain a

practical means of "observing large numbers of people and environments in

less than 'real time.'" (Lave and Chappie 1982, p. 348).

   This paper is an attempt to incorporate many of the insights from past

studies of pollution and mortality in order to measure the impact of air

pollution on race—specific neonatal mortality rates (deaths within the first

27 days of life per thousand live births) across heavily populated counties
                                  —2--


in the U.S. In 1977. Our study differs from previous research in the

pollution area in that it is the first one that simultaneously (1) adopts a

behavioral model of the production and demand for health, (2) employs a

health indicator (neonatal mortality) that has a well documented relation

to a set of medical and nonmedical inputs,' (3) recognizes that the inputs

are endogenous variables and therefore uses the proper econometric tech-

niques to obtain the best available estimates from which willingness—to—pay

figures can most justifiably be approximated, (4) uses more recent data

than Lave and Seskin (1977) and Crocker et al. (1979), and (5) performs an

ecological analysis on a larger sample than has previously been attempted.

Since the data are more recent they are more relevant to present policy

discussions. Moreover, the recent automation of the Environmental

Protection Agency's Storage and Retrieval of Aerometric Data (SAROAD)

system has improved the accuracy with which data on the pollutants are

collected and measured.

    The advantages of focusing on neonatal mortality in research on the

health effects of air pollution are also worth stressing. The infant mor-

tality rate (deaths of infants within the fIrst 364 days of life per

thousand live births) is approximately equal to the mortality rate of 55 to

64 year olds and much higher than age—specific death rates of persons bet-

ween the ages of 1 and 54. The neonatal mortality rate is twice as large

as the postneonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants between the ages of

28 and 364 days per thousand live births). Moreover, accidents, which

clearly are not related to pollution, are an important cause of post—

neonatal deaths.. Expectant mothers are unlikely to move during their
                                   —3—

pregnancies. Thus, studies of the relationship between pollution and

neonatal mortality are not subject to the criticism that adults who die in

one location may have been exposed to pollutants at other locations during

their lifetimes.

    In spite of the differences between our research and prior work in this

area, previous research provides a basis for applying our framework to

study the impacts of air pollution on infant health. Lave and Seskin

(1973) fit dose—response functions in which the neonatal mortality rate

(not race—specific) for 117 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs)

in 1960 or 1961 is the dependent variable. These rates are positively

related to total suspended particulate and sulfate concentrations in their

ordinary least squares multiple regressions in 1960, and they are positi-

vely related to particulate concentrations in 1961. The 1960 sulfate

effect and the 1961 particulate effect are statistically significant. Lave

and Seskin (1977) use the same data set to study the effects of air pollu-

tion on total infant mortality (deaths of infants within the first 364 days

if life), race—adjusted infant unrtality, and race—specific infant mor-

tality. In general, the particulate regression coefficient is positive and

statistically significant, while the sulfate coefficient is positive and

insignificant. Futhermore, in a smaller sample of SMSAs, in which addi-

tional pollutants were also examined, sulfur dioxide evidences a statisti-

cally significant association with infant mortality. Crocker et al.

(1979), in a sample of 60 u.s. cities in 1970, report a positive and signi-

ficant effect of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the air on deaths from

early infant diseases (not race—specific), most of which occur within the
                                      —4—

first 27 days of life. The particulate coefficient in their regression is

positive and not significant, and the nitrogen dioxide coefficient is nega-

tive and not significant. Mendelsohn and Orcutt (1978) find that nitrates

and particulates have a statistically significant effect on white male

infant mortality rates but no effect on female rates across 404 county

groups in 1970. These results are not consistent with their primary

finding that sulfates are positively related to mortality among adults and

that the effect increases with age.


                        II. Analytical Framework

    Following Grossman and Jacobowitz (1981), Rosenzweig and Schultz (1981,

1982, 1983a, 1983b), Corman and Grossman (1985), Corman, Joyce, and

Grossman (1985), and Joyce (1985), we assume that the parents' utility

function depends on their own consumption, the number of births, and the

survival probability of each of their offspring (assumed to be the same for

each infant in a given family). Both the number of births and the survival

probability are endogenous variables.   In particular, the survival probabi—

lity production function depends upon such endogenous inputs as the quan-

tity and quality of medical care, maternal cigarette smoking, the use of

abortion services, and the use of family planning services.2 In addition,

the production function is affected by the reproductive efficiency of the

mother, including the unobserved biologically endowed probability that her

infant will survive the first month of life, and other aspects of her effi-

ciency in household production. Finally, the production function depends

on the quality of the environment as reflected by the levels of various
              3
pollutants.
                                     —5—


    Maximization of the parents' utility function subject to production and
resource constraints generates a demand function for survival in which the

survival probability or its complement, the neonatal mortality rate, is

related to input prices (whose direct and indirect cost components are

negatively related to input availability), efficiency, income, environmen-

tal quality, and tastes. The interaction between the survival demand and

production function determines demand functions for medical care and other

endogenous inputs. These demand functions depend on the same set of

variables as the demand function for survival. Environmental quality is a

relevant argument in the input demand functions because high levels of

pollution may, for example, induce individuals to obtain larger quantities

of preventive or curative medical care or to smoke less.

    The   preceding ideas are formalized in a structural equations model that
incorporates the relationship between neonatal mortality and its two most
proximate determinants — low birth weight and prematurity.     En particular,
there   is an overwhelming amount of evidence that low birth weight (less

than or equal to 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds) is the most important endoge—

nous risk factor in neonatal survival outcomes (for example, Harris 1982;

Lewit 1983; Institute of Medicine 1985). There also is a considerable

amount of evidence that prematurity, reflected by gestational ages of 36

weeks or less, is the most important and most proximate endogenous risk

factor in birth weight outcomes (for example, Taffel 1980; Rosenzweig and

Schultz 1981, 1982, 1983b; Harris 1982; Lewit 1983). The system of

equations is designed to obtain estimates of the direct and indirect

(through low birth weight) effects of five basic health inputs and air
                                        —6--


pollution on neonatal mortality. These inputs are prenatal medical care,

perinatal and neonatal care, the use of abortion services, the use of

contraceptive services, and maternal cigarette smoking. The equations in

the model have meaningful interpretations both at the family level and at

the county level. The latter is the unit to which the empirical analysis

in this paper pertains.

    The basic model consists of the following nine equations:

               1 — it
                         f1(n,   m, a, c, q, b, e)            (1)

                   b =
                         f2(m, a, c, q, s, g, e)              (2)

                   g =                                        (3)
                         f3(m, a, c, q, r, e)
                   r =
                         f4(a,   c, x, e)                     (4)

                   n     f5(p, y, q, x, e)                    (5)

                   in    f6(p, y, q, x, e)                    (6)

                   a     f7(p, y, q, x, e)                    (7)

                   c     f8(p, y, q, x, e)                    (8)

                   s =
                         f9(p,   y, q, x, e) .                (9)
Equations (1), (2), (3), and (4) are production functions, while equations

(5)—(9) are input demand functions. In equation (1) the probability that

an infant dies within the first month of life or the neonatal mortality

rate at the county level (1—IT, where ii     is   the survival probability) is

shown as a vector of perinatal and neonatal care inputs (n), a vector of

prenatal medical inputs (m), the use of abortion services (a), the use of

contraceptive services (c), environmental quality (q, which rises as the

level of air pollution falls), the probability that the infant is born

light (b), and the infant's biological endowment (e).4 In equation (2) the
                                             —7


probability of a light (2,500 grams or less) birth or the fraction of light

births in a county is a function of the variables in equation (1) except

neonatal care and also depends on maternal cigarette smoking (s) and the

probability that the birth is premature (g, which represents the probabi-

lity that gestational age is less than 37 weeks). In equation (3) the pro-

bability of a premature birth or the county—level fraction of such births

is related to the variables in equation (2) except cigarette smoking and

also an endogenous risk factor in prematurity such as mother's age at birth

(r).5 In equation (4) the endogenous risk factor is expressed as a func-

tion of its determinants, including an observed exogenous risk variable (x,

a measure of which is specified in Section III). In equations (5)—(9) the

inputs depend on a vectot of price and availability measures (p), socioeco-

nomic characteristics that reflect command over resources and tastes (y),

the exogenous risk measure, environmental quality, and the biological

endowment. Each of the- nine equations contains an unspecified disturbance

term (u1, 1=1,..., 9) that is uncorrelated with               In addition each

is1
      is   uncorrelated with the set of right—hand side variables in the

equation that contains it.

      The four production functions are structural equations because they

show relationships among endogenous variables. Substitution of the input

demand functions and equations (3) and (4) into (1) and (2) yields demand

functions for survival and birth weight:

                  1 —       = f10(p,   y, q, x, e)   (to)

                        b     f11(p, y, q, x, e) .   (11)
These are reduced form equations because only exogenous variables appear on
                                        —8--


their right—hand sides. Together with the input demand functions, they

constitute the reduced form of the model.

    Given our interest in obtaining marginal—willingness—to—pay measures

(see below), we focus on the estimation of the structural neonatal mor-

tality rate production function (1) and the quasi—structural mortality pro-

duction function obtained by substituting equations (2), (3), ankd (4) into

equation (1):

            1 —   it = f12(n,   m, a, c, q, s, x, e).    (12)

This procedure enables us to calculate the direct and indirect (through low

birth weight) effects of the basic health inputs and environmental quality

on neonatal mortality.

    If the infant's biological endowment (a) were an observed variable,

unbiased estimates of the production function could be obtained by ordinary

least squares. Since this is not the case, the endowment must be treated

as one component of the disturbance term in each equation. Hence, our

model generates a recursive system of equations whose disturbance terms may

be correlated. In particular, although the researcher has no information

about the endowment, the mother and her physician have at least some infor-

mation about it. This information is likely to lead mothers with poor

endowed birth outcomes and their physicians to try to offset these unfa-

vorable prospects by choosing a different mix      of   inputs than other mothers

(Rosenzweig and Schultz 1981, 1982, 1983a, 1983b; Harris 1982).

    To be specific, mothers with poor endowments have incentives to seek

prenatal care earlier in their pregnancies than other women, and their phy-

sicians are likely to obtain larger amounts of neonatal care for them. In
                                   —9—

addition, such women are more likely to smoke less, to abort their pregnan-

cies, or to use contraceptive services. Under these circumstances, ordi-

nary least squares estimates of the parameters of the production function

are biased and inconsistent because the inputs are correlated with the

disturbance term, which reflects in part the endowment. In particular, the

effects of the inputs on favorable infant health outcomes are understated.6

    To circumvent the above problem, production functions are obtained by

two—stage least squares. In the first stage of this procedure, the input

demand functions and the reduced form birth weight equation are fitted with

explanatory variables that are uncorrelated with the endowment by assump-

tion. In the second stage the predicted values of the inputs and low birth

weight rather than the actual values are used as regressors.

    It should be noted that the biases that arise when equation (12) is

estimated by ordinary least squares are likely to be more severe than the

biases that arise when equation (1) is estimated in a similar manner. This

is because equation (1) includes birth weight, which may be a very useful

proxy for the infantts endowed probability of survival. Put differently,

it is possible that the endowment has no effect or a smaller effect on

neonatal mortality with low birth weight held constant. We explore this

proposition in empirical tests discussed in Sections III and IV.

    Certain restrictions oust be imposed to insure that each equation in

the system satisfies rank and order conditions for identification. The

most important restrictions are: (1) neonatal care has no impact on low

birth weight; (2) cigarette smoking affects neonatal nurtality only through

its effect on low birth weight; (3) prematurity affects mortality only
                                          — 10 —




through low birth weight; and (4) cigarette smoking has no effect on prema-
turity. With regard to the first restriction, decisions to use neonatal

care services are made after birth, and low birth weight causes more use of

these services.7 For the other assumptions, there is considerable sup-

porting evidence.8

    To allocate scarce resources among competing goals, policy makers

require information about the dollar values of the potential health bene-

fits associated with improvements in environmental quality (reductions in

pollution). The benefits of a small (incremental) reduction in pollution

is given by marginal willingness to pay, defined as the amount of income

that nvst be taken from an individual to leave him as well off as pre-

viously (to hold his level of utility constant) when the level of pollution

declines. Marginal willingness to pay can be obtained directly from the

health production function and is independent of the demand function

(Freeman 1979; Rosen 1981; Gerking 1983; Harrington and Portney 1983).       It

is given by the marginal product of environmental quality in the production

function multiplied by the ratio of the price of an endogenous health input

such as prenatal medical care utilization to the marginal product of that

input. The ratio just mentioned coincides with the marginal cost of pro-

ducing health.

    In the context of our model, the marginal willingness to pay (dy,

defined to be positive) for an increase in environmental quality of dq is

                     dy =                                       (13)
                            nq(p/it)dq.
here a subscript denotes a partial derivative, flq   is   the marginal product

of environmental quality (the increase in the survival probability caused
                                         — 11. —




by a snail increase in environmental quality), and            is the marginal pro-

duct of prenatal care. In equilibrium the ratio of the price of an input

used    solely to produce infant health to its marginal product is the same
for all inputs. Therefore, if        p' is   the price of neonatal care and it is
its marginal product, an alternative estimate of marginal willingness to
pay    is given by

                       dy =                                        (14)
                              7rq(P'JTt)d.
      Marginal—willingness—to—pay measures based on equations (13) and (14)

are presented in Section IV.9 Particularly in the case of prenatal care,

the quasi—structural production function is the most relevant one to         use in
the   computations. This is because prenatal care has its main        effect on
neonatal   mortality via low birth weight (for example, Corman, Joyce, and
                  10
Grossman 1985).

      Note that in a somewhat more general model where other aspects of

health in addition to the survival of neonates enters the utility function,

the formula for marginal willingness to pay given by equation (13) or (14)

would be the correct theoretical construct if and only if environmental

quality, prenatal care, and neonatal care affected neonatal mortality out-

comes alone. However, if environniental quality affects the health of

children, adolescents, and adults and other aspects of their well being

such as cognitive development, then we understate willingness to pay.

Finally, if medical care also affects those outcomes, which is plausible

since   they are known to depend on birth weight and health in the first year
of   life (for example, Edwards and Grossman 197.9; Shakotko, Edwards, and

Grossman 1981), the direction of the bias is indeterminant. These caveats

should be kept in mind when the estimates are presented.

                    III.   Empirical Implementation

A. Measurement of Variables

    The neonatal mortality rate production functions are estimated with a

data set that pertains to the 677 most populated counties of the United

States. These are counties with a population of at least 50,000 persons in

1970.11 We have constructed this data base from a variety of sources and

have described it in detail in Corman and Grossman (1985), Corman, Joyce,

and Grossman (1985), and Joyce, Grossman, and Goldman (1986). Table 1 con-

tains definitions, means, and standard deviations of the variables used in

this study.

    The mortality production functions focus on the neonatal mortality rate

as opposed to the postneonatal mortality rate or the total infant death

rate. This strategy is adopted because most neonatal deaths are caused by

congenital anomalities, prematurity, and complications of delivery. These

conditions are more sensitive to improved prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal

care than are the infectious diseases and accidents that contribute to

postneonatal mortality. Moreover, accidents clearly are not related to

pollution, and expectant mothers are unlikely to move during their pregnan-

cies.

    Separate regressions are fitted for white and black outcomes. Black

infant health levels are much lower than white levels. For example, in

1977 the black neonatal mortality rate was roughly twice as large as the

white rate. In a non—race—specific regression, one would enter the percen-

tage of black births to control for race differences. But this variable

would be highly correlated with the use of prenatal care and other inputs.

samples for each race defined in the text. The number of counties in each subsample

By fitting race—specific regressions, unlticollinearity is reduced, and the

coefficients of the inputs and the pollutants are allowed to vary between

races. Moreover, in preliminary regressions we tested and rejected the

hypothesis that slope coefficients but not intercepts are the same for whi-

tes and blacks.

    Counties are our units of observation rather than Standard Metropolitan

Statisitical Areas (SMSAs) or states because counties tend to be more homo-

geneous with respect to key variables such as income, schooling, medical

resources, and pollution. Some counties are so sparsely populated,

however,    that people may   receive   medical care outside the county. Also,
small counties, with few      births,   experience large fluctuations in birth
rates    simply due to random movements. The problems with county data are

reduced by including only counties with a population of at least 50,000

persons In 1970. A county nust also have at least 5,000 blacks for inclu-

sion in the black data base. There are 677 counties in the white sample

and 357 counties in the black sample. The counties in the white data set

accounted for approximately 80 percent of the white population of the U.S.

in 1970, and the counties in the black data set accounted for a similar

percentage of the black population of the U.S. in that year. In addition

to selecting large counties, we attenuate random elements by employing a

three—year average of the race—specific neonatal mortality rate for the

period   1976—1978 as the dependent variable.
    The air pollution variables were taken from the Environmental
Protection   ency's Storage and Retrieval of Aerometric Data (SAROAD).

This is an automated data processing system used by EPA for the storage of
                                    — 16 —




data   concerning concentrations of the six criteria air pollutants in the

atmosphere: carbon monoxide, lead, sulfur dioxide, total suspended par—

ticulates, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. These are pollutants for which

National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been established as

part of the Clean Air Act. All major cities and one—third of all counties

have at least one monitoring station, although a number of stations are not

operative, and many others do not monitor all the pollutants. In prelimi-

nary regressions (not shown in Section IV), ozone never had a positive and

statistically significant coefficient. Therefore, it was discarded from

the set of pollutants.

    The raw data in SAROAD take the form of hourly concentrations of carbon

monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and weekly concentrations of

lead and total suspended particulates.12 To obtain county—specific estima-

tes of pollution the following algorithm was used. Counties in the data

base were divided into census tracts or minor civil divisions in counties

with no census tracts. Exposure measures for these smaller units by pollu-

tant and year were computed as weighted (by the number of readings) avera-

ges of the monitor averages. Then county averages were obtained as

weighted averages of the tract or the division averages, where the weight

was the population density (population per square mile in 1980) of each

tract or division in a given county. Finally, the pollutant—specific four—

year average for the county was calculated as a simple average of the four

annual averages.'3 If data were missing for one or two years, a three— or

two—year average was computed. If an annual average was available for a
                                           14
single year alone, that figure was used.

      Complete data on the five pollutants are available for 102 of the 677

counties in the white sample and for 86 of the 357 counties in the black

sample. Instead of limiting our production functions to these two sub—

samples, we define six subsamples for each race. The first five include

counties in which a given pollutant measure is available, regardless of

whether data on the other four pollutants are present. Each of the five

subsamples is used to estimate a production function in which the pollutant

at issue alone and the health inputs are included as regressors. The sixth

subsample includes counties with data on all pollutants and is used to fit

a production function in which the five pollutants are entered as explana-

tory variables. It is worth noting that the means and standard deviations

of the neonatal mortality rate and the health inputs are very similar in

the seven samples for each race (the total sample and the six subsamples).

      The five basic inputs used in the production of infant health are

neonatal intensive use, prenatal care use, the abortion rate, the use of

family planning clinics by teenagers, and adult per capita smoking. Except

for   smoking, all the inputs should be negatively related to the measures of
infant health described above.'5 Low birth weight, the endogenous risk fac-
tor in   the structural neonatal mortality rate production function [equation

(1)] is given by a three—year average of the percentage of births of 2,500

grains or less centered on 1977. The final explanatory variable represents

the exogenous risk factor (x) in the quasi—structural production function

[equation (12)]. For this variable, we use the number of women who are

either teens or in their forties as a fraction of all women of childbearing

age in 1975. These are the age groups considered most at risk for negative

birth outcomes.

 B.   Estimation and Functional Form

      The neonatal mortality equations (1) and (12) are fitted using a two—

 stage least squares procedure for the reasons discussed in Section II.

 Specifically, the unobserved health endowment, which is captured in the

error ten of the production function, is believed to be correlated with

 the use of the health inputs. Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982) refer to this

problem as population "heterogeneity." Such 'heterogeneity" causes ordi-

nary least squares (OLS) estimates to be biased and inconsistent. If

income and input availability measures are uncorrelated with the health

endowment, however, these variables can serve as instruments in a two—stage

least squares (TSLS) estimation procedure.

      We test for the significance of the correlation between the production

function residuals and the health inputs, using Wu's T2 statistic (Wu 1973)

as described by Nakamura and Nakamura (1981). If the null hypothesis of

zero correlation between the error term and the regressors is not rejected,

then OLS is an appropriate technique. For this reason, we perform OLS as

well as the two—stage least squares technique on equations (1) and (12).

A comparison of Wu statistics for equations (1) and (12) allows us to exa-

mine whether birth weight is a reasonable proxy for the health endowment.

      In the first stage of our two—stage estimation procedure, birth weight,

prenatal care, neonatal intensive care, abortion, and organized family

planning use are predicted on the basis of the pollutants, female

schooling, female poverty levels, the fraction of high—risk women, neonatal

intensive care availability, abortion availability, organized family

planning availability, maternal and infant care project availability, corn—
                                          — 19 —




munity health center availability, and the Medicaid program. With the
exception of the pollutants, these right—hand side variables are similar to

those used in Corman and Grossman's (1985) reduced form estimates.

Predicted values of the five endogenous variables are then entered into the

neonatal mortality equations. We do not estimate values for the smoking

variable in a first stage because the smoking variable was already esti-

mated on the basis of income, price, education, age, sex and race, as

described in Joyce, Grossman, and Goldman (1986). Our procedure is based

on the reasonable assumption that prenatal and neonatal input availability

measures have zero coefficients in the cigarette demand function.'6

    Since the neonatal survival probability Cr) ranges between zero and

one, we specify the production function as a logistic equation:

         it   = [1   +
                         exp(—a—1ln q—2ln m—S31n n—4ln
                                                                 w)].             (15)


Here q is environmental quality, m is prenatal ndical care, n is neonatal

intensive care, w is a vector of additional explanatory variables, ln

stands for natural logarithm, and the disturbance term is suppressed. By

solving for the logarithm of the odds of survival relative to death

              one transforms the logistic function into a linear equation:

                                                   m +           n +
         ln[ic/(1—it)1 =     a + S1ln q +   2ln          1331n         41n   w,    (16)

which is called the logit function. The logit coefficient ,                       for   example,

shows the percentage change in the odds of survival for a one percent

change in the quality of the environment. Given that the production func-

tion is logistic, the marginal—willingnesstOPay measure [see equations

(13) and (14)] becomes17
                                    =                                              (17)
         dy =    p(1/2)(mIq)dq          p'(1/3)(n/q)dq,
                                      — 20 —



where p is the price of prenatal care and p' is the price of neonatal

intensive care. According to equation (17), marginal willingness to pay

falls as the quality of the environment rises or as the level of pollution

falls. Moreover, willingness to pay rises as prenatal care or neonatal

intensive care rises. These extremely appealing theoretical properties are

the result of the assumption that the logit function is linear in the

logarithms of in, q, and n, and justify this assumption.'8 In addition, if

interactions among pollutants are ignored, it is logical to define the

level of pollution (z) as

           Z =   q.                                                           (18)

Since we take ln[(l—n)/it] as the dependent variable, the final form of the

equation to be fitted is:

                                                                n —
           ln[(1—ir)/ir] = —a ÷ S1ln z —
                                                                      E4ln w. (19)

                                           S21n          631n
Note that the marginal willingness to pay for a percentage increase in

environmental quality (dln q) is exactly the same as the marginal

willingness to pay for a percentage reduction in pollution (din z):

    dy =              dln q =              dln z = —p'(S11S3)n dln z. (20)
           p(S1/2)m             —p(1I2)m
    Equation (19) is estimated with all explanatory variables except the

percentage of teenagers who use organized family planning services and the

fraction of high—risk women in natural logarithms. The former variable is

entered in arithmetic form because it equals zero in certain counties,

while the latter is entered in arithmetic form because it is not an endoge—

nous health input. The logit coefficients of prenatal care, abortion,

family planning, and neonatal intensive care are expected to be negative,

and the coefficients of the pollutants, cigarette smoking, low birth

weight, and high—risk women are expected to be positive. Maddala (1983)

shows that a weighted least squares procedure should be employed to fit a

logit model to grouped data. The weights are given by

where B is the number of race—specific births in the th county. Results

obtained with such alternative function forms as the linear and log—linear

models do not differ in a qualitative sense from those presented in Section

v. 19

                               IV. Results

    Ordinary least squares (OLS) and two—stage least squares (TSLS) estima-

tes of the white and black logit neonatal mortality rate production func-

tions are contained in Tables 2 and 3. Panel A in each table pertains to

the full white and black samples. No pollution measures are included in

the four regressions in panel A. The first two regressions (2—1, 2—2, 3—1,

and 3—2) exclude the endogenous risk factor of low birth weight while the

ensuing two (2—3, 2—4, 3—3 and 3—4) include the percentage of low—birth

weight births as an explanatory variable. Panel B of Tables 2 and 3 per-

taIns to the white and black sulfur dioxide samples. We present detailed

results for the sulfur dioxide èainple because, unlike the other four pollu-

tants, sulfur dioxide has a consistently negative and statistically signi-

ficant impact on newborn survival. As shown below, this is true regardless

of whether sulfur dioxide is the sole pollutant or one of five in the

production function. As with Panel A, Panel B contains OLS and TSLS esti-

mates of the production functions with and without the endogenous risk fac-

tor. Finally, Panel C of Tables 2 and 3 presents the production function

estimates with all five pollutants. Panel C follows the same format as

                               Notes to Table 2


    aLn stands for natural logarithm. Asymptotic t—ratios in parentheses.
The critical asymptotic t—ratios at the 5 percent level are 1.64 for a one—
tailed test and 1.96 for a two—tailed test. In this table and the others
that contain regression results, the F—ratio associated with each
regression is significant at the 1 percent level unless otherwise indi-
cated. An asterisk (*) next to a variable means it is race specific. Each
pollution measure is the natural logarithm of the county—specific geometric
mean.

Panels A and B.

    An overview of the results in Panel A of Tables 2 and 3 indicates that

all the health inputs have the anticipated signs. In particular, in the

specifications that omit the percentage of low—birth weight births, the

logit coefficients of teenage family planning use, abortion, prenatal care,

and neonatal intensive care are negative, while the logit coefficient of

cigarette smoking is positive. In the case of whites, 14 out of the 18

coefficients are significant at the 5 percent level, With respect to the

blacks, 13 of 18 coefficients have t—ratios greater than one. In most

cases the magnitudes and significance levels of the input coefficients do

not vary dramatically among the three samples (Panels A, B, and C). A

Chow test was used to determine whether the neonatal mortality regressions

in the samples that contain pollutants differed from the regressions in the

non—pollution samples. The null hypothesis of no difference was never

rejected when comparing the four sulfur dioxide regressions with the

regressions from counties that have no sulfur dioxide monitors. When the

same test was performed with the five pollutant sample, the null hypothesis

of no difference was rejected in two out of the four cases at the 5 percent
         20
level.

    A comparison of the TSLS and OLS estimates reveals that the TSLS coef-

ficients of prenatal care, abortion, and family planning are substantially

larger than the corresponding OLS coefficients. These findings reflect

decisions by women with unobserved poor endowed birth outcomes to initiate

care earlier in their pregnancies than other women. In addition, such

women are more likely to abort their pregnancies and use organized family

planning services. The existence of these relationships biases OLS estima-
tes of the production function parameters of prenatalcare, abortion, and

family planning toward zero. Furthermore, the result that this difference

is greater for blacks underscores the argument by Rosenzweig and Schultz

(1983a) that OLS and other direct correlational estimates of prenatal

care's effect on early infant deaths may be seriously underestimating its

true impact on infant health.

    Based on the Wu test, the null hypothesis of zero correlation between

the health inputs and the disturbance term is rejected at the 5 percent

level in the full—sample, white regressions (2—1, 2—3). In the case of

blacks, the null hypothesis is rejected at the 10 percent level in

regression (3—1). In the smaller samples which contain data on pollutants,

the null hypothesis can only be rejected once (regression 3—7). It is

noteworthy that in the full sample the Wu statistic falls whea birth weight

is held constant. Similar results were obtained by Rosenzweig and Schultz

(1982, 1983b), Corman, Joyce, and Grossman (1985) and Joyce (1985). This

suggests that in the estimation of infant health production functions the

relevant intermediate birth outcome may be an effective proxy for endowed

health. Based on this result and the previous work just cited, we empha-

size the TSLS estimates in specifications that exclude the percentage of

low—birth weight births and the OLS estimates in the equations that include

this risk factor.

    The results from including sulfur dioxide as an exogenous determinant

of neonatal mortality are presented in Panel B of Tables 2 and 3. In all

eight specifications the coefficient of sulfur dioxide is significant at
                                   — 27   —



the 5 percent level or better. Each of the other four pollutants was also
treated as an exogenous determinant of neonatal mortality. Table 4 pre-

sents the coefficients and t—ratios of each pollutant estimated by OLS as

well as TSLS for both the white and black samples. These results reveal

that carbon monoxide and total suspended particulates have the most con-

sistently negative impact on early infant survival. However, when all five

pollutants are employed as regressors, sulfur dioxide is the only signifi-

cant predictor of neonatal mortality (Panel C, Tables 2 and 3).

    The environmental quality effects in Panel C of Tables 2 and 3 are our

most refined estimates because they include the full set of pollutants.

The conclusion that sulfur dioxide is the dominant pollutant should be

interpreted with some caution due to the intercorrelation among the five

measures. Nevertheless, this result is consistent with the regressions

that consider each pollutant one at a time, for the logit coefficients of

sulfur dioxide are the only ones that are always significant at conven-

tional levels. Note that the positive and significant sulfur dioxide coef-

ficients in regressions (2—10), (2—11), and (3—10) are not artifacts of

the negative coefficients of some of the other pollutants. In specifica-

tions not shown, we deleted the pollutants with negative coefficients in

Panel C. The magnitude and significance of sulfur dioxide was unaltered.

    There is also evidence that sulfur dioxide impacts on early infant

deaths by raising the percentage of low—birth weight births. Comparing

regressions 2—6 with 2—7 and 3—6 with 3—7, one sees that the inclusion of

low birth weight lowers the white sulfur dioxide coefficient by 21 percent

and lowers the black sulfur dioxide coefficient by 39 percent. The same

comparison in the five pollutant sample reveals an even greater decline

(regressions 2—10 with 2—11 and 3—10 with 3—11). Nevertheless, since the

decrease in the magnitude of the sulfur dioxide coefficient is less than

fifty percent, the direct effect of this pollutant on neonatal mortality is

greater than its indirect effect through low birth weight in every case but

one.

       In sum, the significance of our results is underscored by model which

generated them. By including measures of prenatal care and neonatal care

as well as abortion, we have controlled for three health inputs that have a

well—documented relationship to neonatal mortality. Moreover, these same

inputs have experienced dramatic increases in use during the 1970's, a

period during which the decline in neonatal mortality accelerated substan-

tially. Stated in Bayesian terms, we posses strong priors for the inclu-

sion of these inputs (Atkinson, Crocker, and Murdock 1985). Furthermore,

by examining the impact of pollution on mortality holding the percentage of

low—birth weight births constant, we have effectively controlled for the

major socioeconomic risk factors (such as births to teenagers and unmarried

mothers) that operate through birth weight. In other words, the possibi-

lity that the association between sulfur dioxide and early infant deaths

represents a spurious relationship due to the omission of other health

inputs or risk factors is unlikely.

    We conclude this paper by calculating the marginal willingness to pay

for declines in sulfur dioxide levels that result in increases in neonatal

survival rates. The computations are based on equation (20). Two alter-

native estimates are presented. In the first the marginal cost of
                                     — 30 —




improving infant health outcomes is given by the ratio of the price of pre—
natal care to its marginal product. In the second marginal cost is given

by the ratio of the price of neonatal intensive care to its marginal pro-

duct. For reasons spelled out in Section II and the preceding portion of

this section, both computations are based on the TSLS estimates of the

quasi—structural production function. The logit coefficients are taken

from the sulfur dioxide sample rather than from the five pollutant sample

because the former is larger than the latter and because its input coef-

ficients do not differ significantly from those of the full sample.

      When prenatal care is used to measure the marginal cost of improving

the probability of infant survival, five pieces of information are required

to obtain marginal willingness to pay. These are the logit coefficient of

environmental quality (), the logit coefficient of prenatal care

the specified level of prenatal care (in), the percentage increase in

environmental quality divided by 100   (dln   q) or the percentage decline in

pollution (—dln z) divided by 100, and the price of prenatal care (p). For

whites, i equals .038, and       equals .516. For blacks, f equals .049,

and      equals .162. The specified value of prenatal care is the mean in

the sulfur dioxide sample: .784 in the case of whites and .599 in the case

of blacks. Since the marginal—willingness—to—pay formula pertains to small

changes, a 10 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide concentrations for each

race is considered (dln q =   .1).
      If all expectant mothers began prenatal care in the first or second

trimester of pregnancy, the price or cost of starting care in the first

trimester approximately equals the total cost of three physician visits.
                                     — 31 —



 In   turn total cost is given by the direct (money) cost of the visits (the

payment to the physician) and the indirect cost (transportation cost plus

the sum of travel and waiting time multiplied by the opportunity cost of

time). Most physicians charge more for an initial visit than for a follow—

up visit. Fee information provided by the American Medical Association

(1984) reveals that obstetricians/gynecologists, who are the primary

suppliers of prenatal care, follow this pricing policy. Since a woman who

begins care in the second trimester uvst have an initial visit, we multiply

the price of a follow—up office visit to an obstetrician/gynecologist —

$17 in 1977 —— by three visits to obtain a direct cost component of $51.21

      Colle and Grossman (1978) estimate the indirect cost of a pediatric

care visit at $3 in 1970. This is the sum of round—trip travel time and

waiting time multiplied by the hourly wage rate of a mother who works or

the potential hourly wage of a mother who does not work.22 Based on trends

in the hourly wage rate between 1970 and 1977, the comparable figure for

the latter year amounts to $5 per visit. Since Colle and Grossman ignore

transportation cost, we expand the indirect cost per visit to $7 based on

data given by Goldman and Grossman (1978). When multiplied by three

visits, this gives an indirect cost of $21. Consequently,the cost of

beginning prenatal care in the first trimester rather than in the second

trimester is $72 in 1977 dollars.

      Along the same lines, the cost of beginning care in the first trimester

rather than the third trimester amounts to the total cost of six follow—up

visits: $144 in 1977 dollars. The cost of beginning care in the first tri-

mester rather than obtaining no care at all involves the total cost of an
                                    — 32 —



initial   visit and eleven follow—up visits. The AMA data indicate that the

direct cost of an initial visit was $29 in 1977. Therefore, cost of this

option comes to $276.

    For each race, the total cost of beginning care in the first trimester

is defined as a weighted average of the cost of each of the three options.

The weight applied to, for example, the first option is the race—specific

number of births in which prenatal care began in the second trimester

divided by the race—specific number of births with no prenatal care in the

first trimester. This gives a total cost of $94 for whites and $100 for

blacks.

    In the model outlined in Section II, parents in a given family allocate

the same quantity of resources to each birth. Therefore, the figures just

given are multiplied by the race—specific total fertility rates in 1977 ——

1.7 children for white women and 2.3 children for black women.23 This

yields a price of prenatal care equal to $160 for whites and $230 for

blacks. To the extent that prenatal care is financed by private health

insurance and Medicaid, the private price or marginal cost is overesti-

mated, although the social marginal cost is not. Under reasonable con-

ditions, this implies that social marginal willingness on pay exceeds

private marginal willingness to pay.24 We focus on the former measure.

   Based on the above data, the social marginal willingness to pay of a

typical white woman between the ages of 15 and 44 or her husband comes to

$1 and the corresponding figure for a typical black woman between the ages

of 15 and 44 comes to $4. In 1977 there were 34 million white woman in

childbearing ages in the 677 countries in our data base and 5 million black
                                  — 33 —




women,   Collectively, these women or their families would have been willing

to pay $54 million (social marginal willingness to pay). in 1977 dollars for

the improved neonatal survival prospects associated with a 10 percent

reduction in sulfur dioxide concentrations.

    When neonatal intensive care is used to measure the marginal cost of

raising the probability of infant survival, the logit coefficients of

neonatal intensive care (.147 for whites and .093 for blacks) replace those

of prenatal care in the computation of willingness to pay. The specified

levels of neonatal intensive care are .646 white patient days per birth and

1.591 black patient days per birth. Budetti et al. (1981) report that the

cost per case in a Level II or III neonatal intensive care unit was $8,000

in 1978 and that the average length of stay in such a unit was 13 days.

Based on trends in the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index

between 1977 and 1978, the cost per patient day in a neonatal intensive

care unit was $568 in 1977. Multiplying by the race—specific fertility

rates, one obtains a price of neonatal intensive care of $966 for whites

and $1,306 for blacks.25

    The above data generate nuch larger values of social marginal

willingness to pay than those based on prenatal care. To be specific, the

social marginal willingness to pay of a typical white woman comes to $16

and that of a typical black woman comes to $110. The collective marginal—

willingness—to—pay—figure of $1.09 billion is approximately 20 times larger

than the $54 million sum associated with prenatal care.

    The divergence between the two estimates of marginal willingness to pay

suggests that the same infant survival probability could be produced at
                                   — 34 —


lower cost by spending less on neonatal intensive care and more on prenatal
care. This does not necessarily mean that pregnant women or their physi—

cians are selecting a non—optimal input mix. Given that neonatal intensive

care is financed to a very large extent by private health insurers, the

Federal government, and other third parties, the present input mix may well

be optimal (cost minimizing) front a private point of view. Of course, it

may also be the case that the differential impacts of neonatal care and

prenatal care on health outcomes beyond the first month of life justify the

current allocation of resources.

    We want to emphasize that the main contribution of this paper is not

that we have obtained an upper—bound estimate of the benefits of a 10 per-

cent reduction in sulfur dioxide levels of $1.09 billion in 1977 dollars

and a lower—bound estimate of $54 million. Instead, the main contribution

is that these estimates are obtained from a well specified behavioral model

of the production of health, which has been estimated with the appropriate

simultaneous equations techniques. They stand in sharp contrast to

existing figures that apply extraneous estimates of the value of life or

the earnings foregone by premature death to dose—response functions

obtained by ordinary least squares.

    2The amount of time worked by the mother during pregnancy and her use

of alcohol are excluded from the theoretical model because of lack of data.

Rosenzweig and Schultz (1981, 1982, 1983b) exclude the number of months the

mother worked while pregnant from their final estimates of infant health

production functions because its coefficient was insignificant in prelimi-

nary regressions. In a recent report on low birth weight, the Institute of

Medicine (1985) concludes that the association between maternal alcohol use

and unfavorable birth- outcomes is ouch less uniform than that -between

maternal cigarette smoking and these outcomes. Heavy alcohol consumption

during pregnancy raises the risk of delivering a baby with fetal alcohol

syndrome. The empirical evidence is less clear, however, with respect to

the effects of moderate or light alcohol use.

     3Following the literature on the estimation of dose—response functions

 by economists and epidemiologists, we treat pollution as exogenous. In a

 more complete model this variable would have an endogenous component

 because the amount of exposure to multimedia pollutants and the ingestion

of these pollutants depend on decisions with regard to location, diet, and

occupation. In addition, at a more aggregate level, state and local

governments in areas with high initial mortality and morbidity rates and

high pollution levels may allocate resources to reducing these levels.

Note that there exist theoretical and empirical micro—epidemiological stu-

dies in which pollution is viewed as endogenous (for example, Spengler et

al. 1981; Duan 1982), but these studies do not contain estimates of dose—

response functions.

    4Note that an increase in e is associated with a more favorable

endowment.

    5other endogenous risk factors in the prematurity production function

include parity and legitimacy status of the birth. These factors are not

incorporated into the model because we do not estimate the prematurity pro-

duction function, as explained below. Clearly, we do not ignore the risk

indicators just cited because they are caused to a large extent by abortion

and contraceptive services at the county level.

    6th the case of cigarette smoking, the detrimental impact of this input

is understated in absolute value.

    7Given the advanced state of perinatal science, infants requiring

neonatal intensive care services may be identified prior to birth. Even in

this situation low birth weight still causes neonatal intensive care, and
                                                F—3

causality from use to birth weight can be ruled out.

      8The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1980) summarizes

numerous studies supporting restriction (2). Restriction (3) is consistent

with research of the Institute of Medicine (1985) and Harris (1982).

Restriction (4) is supported by ltosenzweig and Schultz (1982, 1983b). In

part prematurity is excluded from equation (1) because gestational age is

difficult to measure and was not reported on the birth certificates of a

number of states during the period of our empirical analysis. If equation

(1) is viewed as the one that is obtained by replacing g and r by their

determinants, then cigarette smoking must be excluded from the prematurity

equation. This is necessary for the quasi—structural mortality and birth

weight production functions to satisfy the rank condition. These equations
          -


are

              1   —   it = d(n,   in,   a, c, q, b, x, e)
                      b = b(m, a, c, q, s, x, e)

If s enters the equation for 1 —             it, the   rank condition is satisfied for the

birth weight production function but              is   violated for the mortality produc-

tion function. Empirical estimates of the above mortality function (not

shown) do not differ from the ones presented in Section IV, which exclude

x.

      9lnputs that affect arguments in the utility function besides infant

survival cannot be used to compute willingness to pay (Rosen 1981).

Therefore, abortion use, family planning use, and maternal cigarette

smoking are not employed.

     '°Conceptually, neonatal care has no causal impact on birth weight.
                                     F—4

Therefore, if birth weight is an ideal measure of the endowment, there are

two equivalent estimates of the neonatal care coefficient. One is obtained

from the structural production function fitted by ordinary least squares.

The second is obtained from the quasi—structural production function fitted

by two—stage least squares. In the latter case the use of instrumental

variables corrects for the correlation between neonatal care use and the

disturbance term, while in the former case the inclusion of low birth

weight accomplishes the same goal.

   110ne county with a population of at least 50,000 persons in 1970 was

eliminated from the sample because it was the only such county charac-

terized as an isolated rural county with no incorporated place with a popu—

lation of at least 2,500 persons in 1970. In addition, the District of

Columbia was excluded because of difficulty in defining its relevant market

area. In particular, many nonresidents use its sophisticated neonatal

intensive care hospitals, and these facilities are not likely to be widely

available to its relatively large black population. A second reason for

excluding the District of Columbia is that Stanley K. Henshaw, who estima—

tes resident abortion rates for the Alan Guttmacher Institute, informed us

that figures for the District of Columbia are very unreliable.

   '2Certain monitors in SAROAD, called source monitors, are located very

near to factories and other large sources of industrial pollution.

Exposure readings from these monitors are misleading indicators of the

environmental quality of a typical resident of the county in question.

Consequently, source monitors were not used in the development of pollution

measures at the county level. There are no zeros in the SAROAD   data.
                                   F—5

Instead, each pollutant has a minimum detectible level. If readings fall

below this point, then the observation is given the value of its particular

minimum detectible level.

   13We experimented with a second algorithm that did not divide counties

into census tracts or minor civil divisions and did not employ population

density as a weighting factor. In this algorithm county averages were

obtained directly as weighted (by the number of readings) averages of the

monitor averages. Our results were unaltered. For a more detailed

discussion, see Joyce, Grossman, and Goldman (1986).

   '4Two types of averages resulted from the algorithm: an arithmetic

average and a logarithmic average (the antilogarithm of which gives the

geometric mean). In addition the logarithmic standard deviation was

obtained. Since pollution measures typically have a log—normal distribu-

tion (for example, Tanner, D'Ottavia, and Gorber 1978), the logarithmic

mean plus two standard deviations was used to test and reject the hypothe-

sis that the maximum pollution level is a more important determinant of

neonatal mortality than the mean level. The logarithmic means are employed

in the production functions employed in Section IV, but the estimated

effects are similar to those obtained with the logarithms of the arithmetic

means. The arithmetic means of the pollutants are presented in Table 1 to

underscore the close correspondence between the estimated pollution levels

in our data base and published figures for the U.S. as a whole during the

period from 1975 through 1978 (for example, Bureau of the Census 1983,

Table 355).

   '5We focus on teenage family planning use because neonatal death rates
                                        F—6

 associated with births to teenage mothers are substantially higher than

 births to women beyond the age pf 20 (for example, Joyce 1985). Moreover,

 Forrest (1980) finds that the use of organized family planning services by

 teenagers has a sizable negative effect on teenage birth rates. It follows

 that the use of family planning services by teenagers may have a larger

impact on neonatal mortality than the use of these services by older women.

    '6Although cigarette consumption is labeled as an endogenous variable in

Section IV, it should be noted that the same variable is used in OLS and

two—stage estimation procedures.

   17The marginal products of environmental quality and medical care are

   18Put differently, the assumption guarantees that an isoquant between   in



and q or between n and q us convex to the origin,

   '91n preliminary regressions we experimented with measures pertaining

to population density, climate, and the percentage of employed persons who

work in manufacturing industries. The inclusion of these regressors had

very minor impacts on the coefficients of the pollutants and the health

inputs. Therefore, they are excluded from the regressions in Section IV.

   20The two cases in which the null hypothesis was rejected were the white

specification including low birth weight and the black specification

excluding low birth weight. The F—statistics were 2.16 (6,665 df) and

2.79 (7,343 df), respectively.

    21The reader is cautioned that obstetricians typically charge pregnant

 women a flat fee for prenatal visits and the delivery of the child, rather

 than a fee for each prenatal visit. This suggests that the AHA fee data

 pertain to visits to obstetricians/gynecologists for services other than

 prenatal care. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the real

 resource cost of a prenatal care visit is similar to the cost of a gyneco-

 logical visit. It also is reasonable to assume that an obstetrician will

charge a lower flat fee to a woman who begins prenatal care after the first

 trimester.

   22The potential wage is estimated from a race—specific regression of

the natural logarithm of the hourly wage rate of working mothers on

mother's years of formal schooling, mother's years of experience in the

labor market, years of experience squared, and the number of children in the

family. Colle and Grossman present separate indirect cost estimates for

whites and blacks, but the two figures are very similar.

   23The total fertility rate is the number of children a woman would

have in her lifetime if, at each year of age, she experienced the birth

rate occurring in the specified year. The total fertility rate of blacks

indicated in the text actually pertains to nonwhites.

   24Price is multiplied by the quantity of prenatal care in the

marginal—willingness—to—pay formula (20). Therefore, social marginal

willingness to pay exceeds private marginal willingness to pay if the price

elasticity of demand for prenatal care is less than one in absolute value.

While there are no estimates of thisparameter, Ghez and Grossman (1980)

summarize a number of studies in which the price elasticity of demand for
                                   F —8


physician visits by adults or children is less than one. Note that social

marginal willingness to pay is not necessarily overstated if social inargi—

nal cost is multiplied by the observed quantity of prenatal care in

equation (20). This depends on whether the observed quantity exceeds,

equals, or falls short of the socially optimal quantity. For a detailed

discussion of the latter concept, see Ghez and Grossman (1980).

   25The indirect cost component of neonatal intensive care is ignored. To

be sure, a mother with an infant in a neonatal intensive care unit will

spend much more time in the hospital than otherwise. But she probably

would not have returned to her usual activities even if her infant had not

been hospitalized. It should be noted, however, that the psychic cost of

the hospitalization clearly is substantial.
