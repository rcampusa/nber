                                            ABSTRACT

Real estate is an important driver of the Chinese economy, which itself is vital for global growth.
However, data limitations make it challenging to evaluate competing claims about the state of Chinese
housing markets. This paper brings new data and analysis to the study of supply and demand
conditions in nearly three dozen major cities. We first document the most accurate measures of land
values, construction costs, and overall house prices. We then create and investigate a number of
supply and demand metrics to see if price growth reasonably can be interpreted as reflecting local
market fundamentals. Key results include the following:

(1) Real house price growth has been high, averaging 10% per annum since 2004. However, there
is substantial heterogeneity across markets, ranging from 3% (Jinan) to 20% (Beijing). House price
growth is driven by rising land values, not by construction costs. Real land values have risen by
over15% per annum on average. In Beijing, the increase has been by a remarkable 27.5% per year
(or by 1,036%) since 2004.

(2) There is variation about the strong positive trend in house price and land value growth. Land
values fell by nearly one-third at the beginning of the global financial crisis, but more than fully
recovered amidst the 2009-2010 Chinese stimulus. More recent growth has been much more modest,
with some markets beginning to decline. Quantities of land sales by local governments to private
residential developers have dropped sharply over the past two years. The most recent data show
transactions volumes down by half or more. This should lead to a reduced supply of new housing
units in coming years.

(3) Market-level analysis of short- and longer-run changes in supply-demand balances finds important
variation across markets. In the major East region markets of Beijing, Hangzhou, Shanghai and
Shenzhen which have experienced very high rates of real price growth, we estimate that the growth
in households demanding housing units has outpaced new construction since the turn of the century.
However, there are a dozen large markets, primarily in the interior of the country, in which new
housing production has outpaced household growth by at least 30% and another eight in which it did
so by at least 10%. Regression results show that a one standard deviation increase in local market
housing inventory is associated with a 0.45 standard deviation lower rate of real house price growth
the following year.

(4) There are no official data on residential vacancy rates in China, but some researchers have
reported very high figures (17%+). We develop a new series at the provincial level which yields a
much lower vacancy rate on average, but it has been rising—from 5% in 2009 to 7% in 2013.

(5) The risk of housing even in markets such as Beijing which show no evidence of oversupply, is best
evidenced by price-to-rent ratios. They are well above 50 in the capital city. Poterba’s (1984)user
cost model suggests these levels can be justified only if owners have sufficiently high expectations of
future capital gains. Even a modest one percentage point drop in expected appreciation (or increase
in interest rates) would result in a drop in prices of about one-third, absent an offsetting increase in
rents.

    I.      Introduction

         China’s large share in global growth makes our understanding of the risks and

opportunities in its housing markets of first order importance. Housing is not broken out

separately in the Chinese national income accounts, but the real estate sector is quite large: it

comprised 5.9% of Chinese output in 2013, while the construction sector contributed another

6.9%.1 Unfortunately, it is extremely challenging to evaluate competing claims about conditions

in Chinese housing markets, with data limitations being a key reason why. Private housing

markets did not exist before the reforms of the late 1990s, so there is only a short time series over

which variation in prices and quantities across markets can be examined (e.g., Wang (2011);

Chen and Han (2014)). That is compounded by worries about the quality of official data on

house prices. For example, there is no official constant quality price index reported based on

large, representative samples of micro-level housing transactions.

         The best data on house and land value appreciation comes from constant quality price

series developed by academic researchers (Deng, Gyourko and Wu (2014); Wu, Deng and Liu

(2014); Guo et al (2014); Fang et al (2015)). These series show much higher appreciation rates

in aggregate, as well as greater short-term volatility, than official series reported by the

government. Real constant-quality growth in overall house prices has averaged about 10% per

annum on a compounded basis over the past decade. However, there is substantial heterogeneity

across markets, ranging from a low of less than 3% per annum (Jinan) to a high of nearly 20%

per annum (Beijing).

         Overall house price growth has been driven by appreciation in local land markets, not by

construction costs. The latter are flat to very modestly increasing in most markets. Real land

                                                                                                          3
prices have been appreciating at an average annual compound rate of over 15% since 2004

across 35 large cities. Once again, there is substantial variation across cities, with real price

growth escalating at 27.5% per annum in Beijing since 2004. Compound annual land prices

growth has averaged just over 7% in Dalian and Wuhan, but even that rate implies a doubling of

real land prices since 2004.

       We also track changes in quantities, not just prices. Series on the number of land parcels

sold by local governments to private residential developers and on the amount of newly-built

space sold each year show wide variation across years. The negative impact of the global

financial crisis on transactions volumes in housing markets is clearly visible in these data, as is

the positive impact of the Chinese financial stimulus in 2009-2010. More recent data from 2014

show a sharp decline in trading volumes. Land parcel sales at the end of the year were down 60%

from levels transacted two years ago. This takes transaction volumes back to levels not seen

since the global financial crisis. Whether changes in transactions volume lead changes in prices,

as happened in the United States, remains to be seen. In addition, the reduced volume is likely to

have a major impact on the health of local public finance in China, as many cities rely heavily on

land sales to fund their activities and to service debt (e.g., Ambrose, Deng and Wu (2015); Fan,

et. al. (2015); Tao (2015)).

       Real house and land price appreciation have been quite high by U.S. standards, but it

bears emphasizing how different are Chinese economic and housing market conditions. The

high Chinese appreciation starts from a low price level in a country that still is urbanizing. Its

overall economic growth also has been high over the past decade: 7%-10% per annum, which is

about the level of real house price growth on average. Some markets such as Beijing have




                                                                                                      4
appreciated at far higher rates, but that just highlights the need to look at underlying supply and

demand fundamentals to better gauge the sustainability of prices.

       We look at a number of metrics in this regard in Section III. In aggregate, there have

been big increases in the quantity of floor space completed in major markets over time. Among

35 large cities we track in the analyis reported below, the amount jumped about 50% after the

2009-2010 stimulus period and stayed at an elevated level. Substantial demand is needed to

justify a supply increase that large. In fact, trend demand is strong in China, as its urban

population has also grown about 50% between its 2000 and 2010 censuses.

       Other measures are examined at the local market level. The first is annual supply of new

space as a share of local market size. There is noteworthy heterogeneity across markets in this

metric. The quantity of new supply is not increasing relative to market size in the strongest

appreciating eastern markets such as Beijing and Shanghai. However, we do see rising supply in

a variety of other major cities including Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Xian. In

2014, private developers in Tianjin delivered new supply equal to 9% of the 2010 stock.

Another measure examined is the amount of inventory held by private developers as a share of

yearly sales volume in the market. There is no upward trend in this series for Beijing either, but

that for Shanghai (and various other markets) is strongly positive.

       Longer-run calculations of changes in the supply-demand balance also are reported. In

aggregate, we find no overbuilding for the nation in the following sense: our estimate of the net

increase in households living in urban areas exceeds net new housing units by about 10%

between 2001-2012. While there is no evidence of aggregate overbuilding, there is substantial

local heterogeneity, just as there was in price appreciation. Growth in the supply of dwelling

space has far outpaced household growth by at least 30% in twelve major markets and did so by



                                                                                                      5
at least 10% in another eight. The dozen cities with the largest imbalances of new housing units

supplied relative to growth in the number of households needing living space since 2001 include

Chengdu, Guiyang, Harbin, Hohhot, Lanzhou, Nanchang, Qingdao, Shenyang, Wuhan,

Yinchuan and Zhengzhou. However, the major eastern markets including Beijing, Hangzhou,

Shanghai and Shenzhen have seen growth in households outpace net new construction since the

turn of the century.

        There are no official data on vacancy rates among owner-occupied housing units in China.

Other researchers have reported very high rates in the high teens or above. We develope a new

series at the provincial level using what we believe to be the highest quality data currently

available. This series shows a much lower vacancy rate on average, but it has been rising in

recent years—from 5% in 2009 to 7% in 2013.

        The final two metrics examined are price-to-rent and price-to-income ratios. Housing

units tend to trade at very large multiples of rent in China. Individual market ratios range from

the low 20’s to above 50 in Beijing. While high compared to U.S. data, there typically is no

upward trend in these series. Poterba’s (1984) user cost framework suggests these levels can

justified if owners have sufficiently high expectations of future capital gains. The price

appreciation needed to justify purchasing in Beijing is well within the range of recent experience

in that market, but the same cannot be said for a number of other cities. Even in Beijing, this

analysis should not be interpreted as indicating its housing market is not risky. In fact, these data

imply high risk in markets where the user costs of owning are in the 2%-3% range (so that price-

to-rent ratios are well over 33). Small drops in expectations of future appreciation (or

commensurate rises in interest rates) imply a large negative adjustment in price levels, absent

offsetting increases in rents.



                                                                                                    6
         Price-to-income data highlight another risk for housing markets that look solid in terms

of supply-demand fundamentals. These ratios also are very high by U.S. standards (8 is typical

and Beijing’s ratio always is well over 10), but they are consistent with standard Chinese

underwriting, which presumes continued high income growth in urban areas. Of course, that is

the embedded risk. If for any reason that growth does not materialize, housing will be

unaffordable in most places, and in the most expensive east region markets in particular.

         Section IV concludes our analysis by empirically investigating whether changes in some

of these market fundamentals can account for variation in house prices over time within a market.

They can, as we document that the magnitude of the inventory overhang in a market at the end of

this year is an economically and statistically significant predictor of price change the next year.

A one standard deviation higher normalized housing inventory in a market is associated with a

0.45 standard deviation lower rate of house price growth the following year (ceteris paribus).

Thus, oversupplied local markets are likely to suffer price declines (or lower growth) than

markets with better underlying fundamentals.

         The plan of the paper is as follows. The next section discusses and analyzes the two

primary official series on house prices and contrasts them with a land price measure we have

introduced and an unofficial constant quality house price series in development. Section III then

investigates a number of other metrics that can be used to gauge housing market conditions.

Section IV examines whether these measures can explain the variation in price changes across

markets. There is a brief conclusion.



   II.      Prices and Quantities in Chinese Housing Markets

         Official House Price Series



                                                                                                      7
        The National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) reports two series on house prices.

One called “Price Indices for Real Estate in 35/70 Large and Medium-sized Cities” tracks prices

measured at the housing complex level within city. An average transaction price is calculated for

each sampled housing complex at a monthly frequency, and then compared with that for the

same (or comparable) complex in the preceding month. The NBSC then calculates a monthly

house price growth rate at the city level as the weighted average of the growth rates of all

sampled complexes in the corresponding month.

        This series originally covered 35 major markets and expanded to 70 in July of 2005.

Unfortunately, it is not reported consistently over time because the NBSC adjusted its data

and/or computational strategies at the beginning of 2011 in ways not fully detailed for the public.

While results are not strictly comparable before and after that time, splicing together the June

2005-December 2010 and January 2011-December 2014 periods finds real aggregate house price

growth is reported to be only 16.7% at the national level, for an implied compound annual

growth rate of 1.6%. Many observers do not find this pattern consistent with the reality of

Chinese housing markets on average, and we agree.2

        A second government-provided series is the “Average Selling Price of Newly-Built

Residential Buildings” (“Average Price Indices”, hereafter). Since the mid-1990s, real estate

developers in China are required to report a variety of business indicators to the government

statistics agency, including the total volume (in floor area) of newly-built housing units sold

within each sampling period and the aggregate sales price of these units. Dividing the total price

paid by total floor area of the transacted units, weighted average house prices per square meter

  For example, reports from the Financial Times (“Fears of China Property Bubble Grow”, Mar 10, 2010), China
Daily (“Doubts over Increase in Property Price”, Feb 27, 2010) and Wall Street Journal (“China Underestimated
House Price Growth in Beijing, Shanghai”, Jan 28, 2013) show their concerns on the low growth rates suggested by
this index.

                                                                                                               8
are calculated and reported at the city, province, and national level, respectively. To be more

precise, if ten units with 100 square meters each were sold in a market for an aggregate amount

of one million yuan, the reported price would be 1,000 yuan per square meter.

       Reported house price growth is much higher in this series and there is substantial

variation across markets. Table 1 lists aggregate and implied real compound appreciation rates

between 2004 and 2014 from this series for 35 major markets that will be the focus of much of

the analysis in this paper. The map in Figure 1 shows that this set includes many non-Tier 1

cities that are spread throughout China’s regions. The value of newly-built housing in these

markets equals nearly one-half of the value of all new homes in China. The interquartile range

of aggregate real price growth across these 35 cities runs from 95.8% to 162.2%. Thus, three-

quarters of these major markets are estimated to have experienced close to or substantially more

than a doubling of real prices since 2004. Implied per annum real appreciation rates over the

past decade range from a low of 3.9% (Yinchuan) to a high of 14.3% (Xiamen) in these data.



       Construction Costs

       The price of newly built housing reflects the sum of the price of land and improvements

(i.e., the physical housing units), in addition to the developer’s profit. To gauge whether

construction costs have been escalating sharply in China, we constructed a basket of

representative construction cost items including building materials prices, construction worker

wages, and expenses for construction machinery. Those costs are from the NBSC based on

surveys conducted by local statistical agents. The average increase in real construction costs

across our 35 markets from 2004-2013 is only 8.1% in aggregate, or 0.9% per annum on a

compounded basis. The largest increase is 17% in Xian and real costs actually fell by 1% over



                                                                                                   9
the decade in Beijing. Thus, construction cost increases cannot account for the large increases in

real house prices depicted in the Average Price Indices series.



       Land Price Data

       Modest increases in real construction costs imply that house price growth must have been

driven primarily by land price growth in China. The only currently available official data on

land prices in China come from the “China Urban Land Price Dynamic Monitor” system

reported by the Ministry of Land and Resource of China. It tracks parcel values in over 100

major cities. Its land price indexes are appraisal-based, and are not derived from actual market

transactions. In each city, representative land parcels are selected as “monitoring points” by

technicians employed by local land authorities. For example, there are 257 such land parcels in

Beijing. Of that total, 98 are for residential usage. Local land appraisals are conducted each

quarter for every parcel. City, regional, and national-level average land prices and price indexes

are then computed. This land price series tends to be quite smooth over time, and does not show

markedly high appreciation in land values on average. For example, real growth of the aggregate

residential-usage land price index at the national level between 2004 and 2014 was 54.2%, for a

4.4% per annum implied compound growth rate.

       This stands in sharp contrast to another land price index that we developed in previous

research (Deng, Gyourko and Wu, 2014). This “Chinese Residential Land Price Index” (CRLPI)

is a constant-quality, residential land price index based on sales of long-term leasehold estates to

private developers in the same set of 35 large cities listed in Table 1. China is one of the only

countries in the world for which it is possible to frequently observe transactions involving vacant

residential land. This is because the Chinese government retains ownership of all urban land.



                                                                                                    10
Since 1988, private developers have been able to purchase use rights from the government for up

to 70 years on residential properties. Developers make a single, upfront payment to the relevant

local public entity. Our series treats that payment as the transactions price of the land parcel, but

it clearly is for a lengthy (but finite-lived) leasehold estate.

           This series begins in the first quarter of 2004 and presently runs through the fourth

quarter of 2014. Table 2 reports the number of cities covered each year, along with the number

of land parcels sold. This land price index adjusts average transactions prices for various

differences in site quality via a hedonic model that is estimated at the city level for a dozen large

markets at an annual frequency, at the regional level on a semi-annual basis, and the 35 city

aggregate level on a quarterly basis. Each land parcel is equally weighted.3

           Figure 2’s plot of this aggregate series depicts extremely high real land price growth

across these markets over the past 44 quarters. Real prices have appreciated by 357% since

2004(1), for an implied real average annual compounded appreciation rate of 15.2% (3.6% on a

quarterly basis; see Table 3). There is variation about this very strong decade-long trend, with

real land values dropping by about one-third between 2007(3)-2009(1) as the global financial

crisis occurred. That this was followed by a more than doubling of real prices during the

massive Chinese stimulus period in 2009 provides an indication of how important government

policy likely is for this sector. Real land price growth then was flat during most of 2011 and

2012 before escalating again in 2013. In 2014(3), there is a decline of 6.8%, which takes the

series back to its 2013(3) level, but the index rebounded by 10.7% in the last quarter of 2014.

           This aggregate series masks sometimes substantial heterogeneity at more local levels.

This is not so evident in the regional data plotted in Figure 3. There is a strong common trend

across land markets in all three regions, although the most recent data show a downturn in the

    Deng, Gyourko and Wu (2014) describe the underlying data sources and index construction in detail.

                                                                                                         11
West and Middle regions, but not the East. Real, constant quality land price growth ranges from

231% in the West region to 326% in the Middle region (see Table 4).

         More variation is visible across the 12 large cities for which annual indexes are reported

in Figure 4. The first two columns of Table 5 show that real land price growth has been strong in

each of these cities between 2004-2014, with only three being below 10% on an average annual

compound basis (7.2% in Dalian; 7.3% in Wuhan; 8.6% in Xian). Real price growth in Beijing

has averaged an astounding 27.5% per year since 2004, for an aggregate increase of over 1,000

percent. No other city approaches this magnitude, but four other markets have real average

annual compound appreciation rates over 15% (Shanghai, Chongqing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou).

The remaining four experienced still strong price growth of between 10%-15% per year

(Hangzhou, Changsha, Nanjing and Chengdu).4



         Discussion

         The middle set of columns in Table 5 incorporate the government’s Average Price

Indices data. Land price appreciation is greater than reported house price growth in most, but not

all, of these major markets. In Beijing, Changsha, Chongqing, Nanjing, Tianjin and Shanghai,

aggregate land price growth is more than 100 percentage points higher than the government’s

Average Price Indices.

         Reconciling our high land price appreciation rates with the government’s house price

appreciation estimates requires that land constitute a relatively small share of overall house value.

We doubt that is reasonable, especially in markets such as Beijing. A simple comparison would

start with the following identity, which states that overall house price is the weighted sum of the

 The CRLPI for Beijing reports real land price appreciation that is 900 percentage points higher than the
government’s appraisal-based series. No other gap is as wide, but the differences in aggregate appreciation typically
are wide—300+ percentage points in other cities such as Chengdu, Hangzhou and Shanghai.

                                                                                                                  12
value of the land and the building improvements, with developers earning a standard profit on

that sum. More specifically,

(Pl + Pb)*Devp = HP                                                                        (1)

where Pl and Pb are the prices of land and building improvements, respectively; Devp is the

developer’s profit margin, and HP is the overall house price. If we presume that only the price

of land and building improvements changes, the growth rate of house price (gHP) can be

calculated as equation (2):

(sl*gPl) + (sb*gPb) = gHP                                                                  (2)

where gPl and gPb are the price growth rates of land and building improvements, respective; sl

and sb are the share of land and building improvements in overall house value, respectively.

       Equation (2) allows us to experiment with different land and building shares to see

whether our land price series is consistent with the government’s house price series. If land has a

50% share in overall house value in Beijing, equation (2) implies either that our land price

growth measure is biased upward or the government’s house price growth is biased downward.

Using the 1036% real land price growth from Table 5 and a 1% decrease in construction costs

yields the following:

(0.5*1036%) + (0.5*-1%) = 518% >> 226%                                                     (2’)

The implied house price growth is 518%, which is far greater than the 226% reported by the

government’s Average Price of Newly-Built Housing series. In contrast, if one thought land

share in Beijing was only 20%, the equation becomes 207%, which would be close to the

government’s house price series.

       One noteworthy effort to improve the quality of house price measurement is Wu, Deng

and Liu (2014). They estimate a hedonic model to create a constant-quality house price index



                                                                                                  13
based directly on micro transactions data of all newly-built housing units in the 35 major city

sample we are using. While Wu, Deng and Liu’s (2014) data stopped in 2010, Table 6 lists the

aggregate and implied real compound annual appreciation rates based on constant-quality prices

between 2006 and 2014. In general, it suggests a higher appreciation rate than the Average Price

Index reports for most, but not all, 35 markets. For example, the series for Beijing finds total

real house price growth of about 385% between 2006(1)-2014(4), which implies a real average

compound appreciation rate of 19.8% (4.6% on a quarterly basis). This is about 8 percentage

points above the rate measured in the Average Price Indices. Using this higher figure for gHP, a

land share of about 72% results in overall annual house price growth of 19.8% based on equation

(2). While not available to the public, we work below with updated constant quality house price

data from Wu, Deng and Liu (2014). We view its index construction as superior because it is

directly based on micro-level transactions data, with an additional effort made to adjust for

changing trait quality over time. Those data show very high real house price appreciation rates,

with an average of about 10% per annum for 35 major markets over the past decade (Table 6).

There is wide variation in growth across markets, ranging from 2.8% (Jinan, column 2, Table 6)

to 19.8% (Beijing, column 2, Table 6).5


        Quantities: Transactions Volumes

        Short time series on land parcel sales and the square meters of newly-built housing sold

are available. The land parcel sales data are from the 35 markets tracked in the CRLPI and are

plotted in Figure 5. There is considerable volatility in these data. It shows a doubling in the

quantity of land parcel purchases from around 200 to 400 per quarter in the cities covered by the


5
 Very recent work by Fang, et. al. (2015) based on mortgage data from a large lender uses a hybrid approach that
builds price indexes from 2003-2013 based on sequential sales of new homes within the same housing development.
They also find high average real price appreciation and substantial variation across markets.

                                                                                                             14
CRLPI from the beginning of 2005 through the end of 2006. Transactions volume fluctuated

around that higher level until the global financial crisis hit China in 2008. By the beginning of

2009, the number of parcels sold had fallen back just below 200. The stimulus period in 2009-

2010 then saw a dramatic rebound, with sales escalating well above 500 in the fourth quarter of

2009. There are strong seasonal effects in these sales data, and the series fluctuates fairly widely

between 350 and 550 per quarter until the third quarter of 2012, after which we see a sharp spike

to 700, before volumes fall back down to the 500 level. There have been fewer than 400

purchases in each quarter of 2014. In the last quarter of 2014, there were only 277 sales, 56% of

the sales volume from a year earlier in 2013(4) and only 40% of the number sold two years

earlier in 2012(4).

       Figure 6 plots the year-over-year growth in total square meters of newly-built housing

units that are sold, as provided by National Bureau of Statistics of China. This series starts in

2007(1), with the latest data available from the last quarter of 2014. It also exhibits a sharp spike

in sales volume leading up to the financial crisis, followed by a dramatic decline. The impact of

the beginning of the stimulus period in 2009 is clearly visible, as is the mean reversion after that.

The sharp rise in transactions in 2012 is evident. Growth in transactions volumes of newly-built

units has been declining since the beginning of 2013, and all four quarters in 2014 show absolute

declines in year-over-year growth.

       The short-term volatility in Chinese housing market transactions quantities is markedly

different from the U.S. data, which is depicted in Figure 7. Transactions volumes do fluctuate

widely over the housing cycle in America, but they do so more smoothly over quarterly or even

annual periods. Some of the difference may be due to the Chinese government intervening in the

housing and mortgage markets much more frequently and forcefully than does the U.S.



                                                                                                    15
government. That is an area urgently in need of more research.6 This figure also shows that

change in trading volumes led price changes by about 12-18 months, both at the peak and trough

of the cycle. Only time will tell if this pattern holds in the Chinese data, too, but if it does, the

recent declines in trading volumes in land parcels and square footage of new unit sales are

foreboding.



      III.      Thinking About Risk: Can Chinese Price Growth Possibly Be Explained by
                Fundamentals?

             Prices reflect the intersection of supply and demand, so one cannot tell all that much

simply by looking at their levels or rates of growth. Moreover, the very high growth rates of

Chinese house prices need to be kept in perspective. For example, the 1995-2005 U.S. housing

boom saw real prices increase by about 50% at the national level, with so-called ‘bubble

markets’ such as Las Vegas, Phoenix and Miami escalating by from 100% in Las Vegas to 130%

in Miami over the same time span. Those certainly are far lower than what we believe to be

credible data shows for many major Chinese housing markets. However, it is critical to

recognize that prices started from different levels at the beginning of each country’s boom, with

the appreciation in China coming off a very low base. Differences in economic growth across

the two countries also are large. From 2004-2013, Chinese GDP grew in real terms at an average

compound real rate of 10.2% or by over 160% in aggregate. That is roughly four times the 42%

real aggregate growth during the U.S. housing boom years from 1995-2005. And, as we show

just below, real income growth also has been much higher in China, particularly in its urban

markets.

    See Du and Zhang (2015), Cao, Huang and Lai (2015) for example for some recent research on this topic.

                                                                                                             16
       While it is challenging to execute a convincing econometric analysis on such a short time

series, there are a number of other metrics by which one can judge the risk that Chinese housing

markets are substantially overpriced. Developing those measures and interpreting them is the

purpose of this section. We start with what we consider the most intuitive: measuring whether

growth in the quantity of housing supplied has outpaced demand as reflected in the number of

households needing a place.



       Supply and Demand: Units and Households

       It is well known that demand-side fundamentals tend to be quite strong in most Chinese

housing markets. Even without rapid national population growth, an on-going, massive rural-to-

urban migration underpins strong demand for housing units in Chinese cities. According to the

two latest National Population Censuses by NBSC, the urban population in China increased

from 458.8 million (36.9% of total population) in 2000 to 670.0 million (50.3% of total

population) in 2010, for an average compound growth rate of about 3.9%. Urban household

income also has grown substantially as the Chinese economy has prospered over the past couple

of decades. The average annual compound real growth rate of per capita disposable income for

urban households reached 9.2% between 2004 and 2013 according to NBSC. The importance of

these demand factors are also highlighted in recent research (Chen, Guo and Wu (2011); Fang,

et. al. (2015); Garriga, Wang and Tang (2014); Huang, Leung and Qu (2015); Wang and Zhang

(2014)).

       Less is known about the supply side of the housing market, but some research suggests

that high and rising prices are due at least in part to some type of natural constraint or restrictive

behavior by local governments (e.g., Wang, Chan and Xu (2012); Wu, Feng and Li (2014)).



                                                                                                    17
Figure 8 begins our documentation of supply side conditions with its plot of the ratio of new

housing supply as a share of the 2010 stock in the 12 major markets for which land price growth

was reported above.7 The first panel shows that residential space is not rising as a share of

overall market size in Beijing and Shanghai, but is in Tianjin and Chongqing. In 2014 alone,

developers in Tianjin delivered new space equal to over 9% of the 2010 stock; in Chongqing,

the analogous figure is nearly 6%.8 The other panels of Figure 8 document rising trends in other

markets such as Xian, Chengdu, and Guangzhou.

        Figure 9 gauges supply in another way for these same markets, this time with unsold

inventory held by developers as a share of yearly sales volume in the same market.9 A value of

0.5 implies that unsold inventories equal six months of average sales volumes in the same

market. Consider the series for Beijing in the first panel. There are sharp spikes in unsold

inventories relative to sales volume in 2008 during the global financial crisis and in 2010 and

2011 amidst the national stimulus program. Inventory relative to transactions volume was low in

2012 and 2013, but increased in 2014. This ratio has been trending up in Shanghai since 2007.

Inventories in Shanghai now equal about 24 months of sales volumes. Other markets such as

Dalian, Changsha, and Xian recently have seen multiple years of similarly high levels of unsold

inventory relative to overall market sales volume.

        Table 7 provides another perspective that confirms inventory levels have been rising not

just absolutely, but relative to the scale of activity in the market. It reports data on a balanced

7
  In this measure, the numerator is the annual volume (in floor area) of newly-built housing completion as reported
by local statistics agency. The denominator, the housing stock in 2010, is calculated based on the per capita living
space of urban households and urban population in 2010, both reported in the National Population Census. Ratios
for all 35 major markets discussed above are available upon request. These dozen cities capture most of the local
variation across the 35 cities.
8
  To help put these numbers in perspective, it may be useful to know that housing permits in Phoenix, one of the
U.S. ‘bubble markets’, did not quite reach 6% at the height of its boom.
9
  The numerator is the inventory (in floor area) of newly-built housing units held by developers at the end of the
year. The denominator is the transaction volume (in floor area) of newly-built housing units sold during this year.
Both are reported by local housing authorities.

                                                                                                                18
panel of 119 property development firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.

The first column reports average turnover rate as reflected by the mean sales-to-asset ratio for

these firms. Under Chinese accounting rules, a housing developer’s inventory includes all land

parcels purchased and housing units under construction, including those already presold to

households. We adjust that number to exclude all advance payments from presold units and

report it in the second column. Normalized inventory, which standardizes by the level of assets,

is reported in the final column. Absolute and relative inventory levels clearly have risen over

time, with a higher plateau roughly double that experienced in 2004 being reached following the

stimulus period. Those high inventory levels have been maintained over time.

       Figure 10 helps us understand the rapid increase of housing inventory held by developers

during recent years. Floor space in aggregate housing starts in the 35 major cities fluctuated

between 200 and 300 million square meters before 2009, but then jumped by about 50% to over

450 million square meters in 2010 following the stimulus. It has remained around this level

since then. One needs more than modest growth in demand to keep pace with a surge in supply

that large. For many cities, that growth did materialize, but not in others. In those places,

inventory started to increase when the huge volume of housing starts were converted to effective

supply in the market.

        We also investigated longer-run changes in quantities in our 35 major markets. More

specifically, the increase in the number of households is compared to the number of units

supplied during the same interval. It is surprisingly difficult to estimate these quantities for

Chinese cities for a number of reasons (e.g., urban boundaries change, the housing units of some

local households are torn down so they need a unit even though they did not migrate into the

city, etc.). They require a number of assumptions to be made. Appendix 1 describes them and



                                                                                                   19
the entire estimation process in detail. While we obviously made what we consider the best

choices, readers are encouraged to review that section carefully.

       Table 8 reports our results. The top row of the table is for the entire nation. In aggregate,

during the decade between 2001 and 2010 growth in the number of households needed a housing

unit exceeded the increase in the supply of units by nearly 14%. However, there was an

oversupply of units relative to households of about 10% in 2011 and 2012, which resulted in

supply falling short of our estimate of demand by about 10% over the full 2001-2012 period.

Once again, that aggregate average masks important heterogeneity across markets. This is

highlighted by contrasting the cases of Beijing and Chongqing, the two cities with the 1st and 2nd

highest land price appreciation rates and the 1st and 3rd highest house price growth rates. Our

calculations suggest that the number of new units supplied in the capital city has been sufficient

to satisfy only 80% of our estimate of the growth in households living in Beijing since 2000.

This stands in stark contrast to the situation in Chongqing. In that city, additions to net new

supply appear to have been almost 90% more than the increase in households. Other markets in

which we estimate that net new supply has exceeded the net increase in households by at least 30

percent include Chengdu, Guiyang, Harbin, Hohhot, Lanzhou, Nanchang, Qingdao, Shenyang,

Wuhan, Yinchuan, and Zhengzhou. Another eight saw net new supply exceed net new demand

by from 10%-30% (Changsha, Fuzhou, Kunming, Nanjing, Nanning, Shijiazhuang Taiyuan, and

Tianjin). That means 15 markets did not see supply outpace demand this century (by more than

10%, a magnitude that we consider well within the range of estimation error). This group

includes many of the largest markets in the East region of China such as Beijing, Guangzhou,

Shanghai, and Shenzhen, as well as other coastal markets such as Hangzhou and Xiamen.




                                                                                                  20
        Residential Vacancy

        If quantity supplied really has outpaced the growth in the quantity of units demanded in a

market, then the vacancy rate should have increased. Measurement of residential vacancy is of

great interest in China, but data limitations once again make it very hard to document

convincingly. There has been no official housing survey that could provide a reliable estimate

since the first National Urban Housing Census in 1985.10 This has led some researchers to

conduct independent surveys on urban households. Perhaps the most well-known is the China

Household Finance Survey (CHFS) at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (Gan,

2012). For their latest report in 2013, they surveyed 28,000 households around the country, with

each household sampled providing the total number of dwelling units it owned, as well as the

number of units leased out. Presuming that a household occupies only one unit at a time, the

number of vacant units owned by the household can be calculated. Aggregating across

households, they reported a very high nationwide vacancy rate of 22.4% in 2013.11

        Other researchers have imputed a vacancy rate indirectly from macro-level statistics. For

example, researchers from China International Capital Corporation (CICC), a leading investment

bank, started with the data from the National Population Census in 2010.12 This source reports

the breakdown of urban households by the number of bedrooms they were: 1) occupying; or 2)

owning and leaving vacant. After making some assumptions on the average number of




10
   Sporadic region-level surveys exist such as the housing census conducted in 2007 by the Beijing local
government, but in most cases official statistics were not published and no micro data were released.
11
   The results are reported in “The Vacancy Rate of Urban Housing and Trend in the Housing Market” (in Chinese)
released in June 2014 on the official website of CHFS (www.chfs.swufe.edu.cn).
12
   The results are reported in “Are Vacancy Rates too High in China” (in Chinese) released on June 19 th, 2014 by
CICC (www.cicc.com).

                                                                                                               21
bedrooms per unit, the CICC imputed a housing unit-level vacancy rate of 18.3% for the nation

in 2010.13 A recent update at the end of 2013 indicates a slightly lower level of 17.7%.

        We would expect vacancy rates that high to have exerted a material dampening effect on

house price appreciation that one does not see in the data in most markets. Hence, we make an

independent measurement using existing data (not a new survey) that allows us to compute

vacancy rates at the provincial level. More specifically, we use micro data from the Urban

Household Survey (UHS), an official survey designed by the NBSC that is conducted annually

by local statistics bureaus. Annual sample sizes of about 50,000 households are available.

Households are surveyed in each city according to population size (e.g., there are 2,100

households surveyed in Beijing). Within each city, households are randomly sampled using

stratified three-stage (neighborhood, housing complex, and household) PPS random sampling.

More specifically, each household reports the total number of dwelling units it owns, and

identifies its main residence as well as the occupancy status of all other units it owns as either

“occasionally occupied”, “leased out”, or “other”. To be conservative, we consider

“occasionally occupied” and “other” units as vacant.

        By law, it is the obligation of any household sampled to participate in the survey and to

provide accurate information. Thus, survey data quality is perceived to be high.14 With support

from the China Data Center at Tsinghua University, we were able to obtain the micro-level data

in nine provinces between 2002 and 2009, including that for Beijing which is a provincial-level

city. Figure 11’s plot shows much lower vacancy rates, with the level across all nine provinces


13
   For example, they assumed that for households with three bedrooms, 99% had 1 unit and 1% had 2 units; for
households with four bedrooms, 20% had 1 unit, 75% had 2 units, and 5% had 3 units; for households with five
bedrooms, 20% had 1 unit, 72% had 2 units, and 8% had 3 units; and so on. These assumptions were based on
information on the breakdown of dwelling units by the number of bedrooms from the same census. They also
assumed that a single household could occupy one unit at a time.
14
   For example, certain official statistics such as household disposal income and household expenditures on
consumption reported are calculated using UHS data.

                                                                                                         22
increasing gradually from 3.9% in 2002 to 5.2% in 2009. There is noteworthy heterogeneity in

vacancy conditions across provinces, too. In 2009 for example, the vacancy rate was highest in

the eastern province of Zhejiang (7.9%), followed by Guangdong (5.5%) and Liaoning (5.3%).

Beijing’s vacancy rate was 5.1%, with the western province of Gansu having the lowest rate at

1.3%.

        More recent vacancy rates can be imputed using our supply-demand change results if we

are willing to use the 9-province aggregate to proxy for the nation. Based on the National

Population Census, we can impute that the total number of urban households nationally was

197.95 million in 2009. Using the 5.2% vacancy rate reported just above implies there were

10.86 million vacant units in urban areas that year (197.95 / (1-5.2%) * 5.2% ≈ 10.86),

presuming one household occupies one unit. Based on the same procedures discussed in the

previous sub-section, there was a net increase of 35.56 million households needing housing units

during the four years between 2010 and 2013; on the supply side, the number of housing units

increased by 41.31 million over the same time period. If all the 5.75 million units of excess

supply were left vacant, then the vacancy rate increased to 7.0% by the end of 2013

((10.86+5.75) / (208.81+41.31-12.98) ≈ 0.070).

        Both the level and the change need to be interpreted with care because Chinese economic

conditions are fundamentally different from those in the U.S. and most other developed

countries. As an emerging market experiencing rapid growth, the annual flow supply comprises

a substantial share of the housing stock in China. For example, there were about 15.13 million

housing units completed in 2013, which amounts to 5.7% of the total stock of about 265.74

million units at the end of that year in urban markets. In most cases, it would take the purchaser

of a newly-built unit several months to furnish the unit before moving in. In addition, the share



                                                                                                 23
of uneconomic or dilapidated housing units is likely to be relatively high in China. The National

Population Census in 2010 reports that 8.7% of the urban housing units were completed before

1979. That is before the reform era, which suggests that many of these units do not meet current

quality standards demanded by urban households. Thus, many of them are likely to be left

vacant. Factors such as these suggest the natural vacancy rate probably is higher in China than in

developed markets such as the United States. That said, it is difficult to believe that the natural

vacancy rate doubled over the past four years, so the recent jump in vacancies is mostly likely

due to oversupply.



           Other Metrics: Price-to-Rent and Price-to-Income Ratios

           Other metrics such as the price-to-rent and price-to-income ratio can be computed for

Chinese markets. Price-to-rent ratios for the same 12 major markets are plotted in Figure 12

dating back to the third quarter of 2009.15 The underlying data are averages of district-level

prices (in the numerator) and rents (in the denominator), both of which are reported by a data

vendor (www.cityre.cn) based on their collection of micro-level listing prices or rental prices

information in the corresponding cities.

           There is a very wide range of ratios, running from the low 20s to just over 50 in the latest

data from the last quarter of 2014. These are high values compared to the U.S. Recent decennial

census data for July 2011 reports ratios from the mid-teens to the mid-40s for the thirty largest

cities in the United States. Sixteen of those 30 areas have price-to-rent ratios below 20; another

     Data for all 35 major markets are available upon request.

                                                                                                     24
eight are between 20 and 30, with five cities in the thirties (New York City, Los Angeles, San

Jose, Seattle, and Washington, DC), and only one above 40 (San Francisco at 44.1).16

         Figure 12 shows little evidence of rising trends for this ratio, with Guangzhou being the

exception. Its price-to-rent ratio has increased from just below 30 to just over 40 since 2009.

Other markets such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Wuhan and Dalian show flat trends, while

there are significant declines in Hangzhou, Chengdu, and Xian. The latter cities are evidence

that price-to-rent ratios can compress at least somewhat without prices themselves dropping at

all. Beijing has the highest ratio (along with Shanghai) on average. It has been above 50 since

2013(1).

         Poterba’s (1984) user cost model of the rent-versus-own decision can be used in

conjunction with price-to-rent data and information on the costs of occupying a housing unit to

impute the breakeven price appreciation necessary for a new buyer to be indifferent between

owning and renting each year. In the Chinese context, the user cost equation is given by

UC = r + m + β – πe,                                                                                        (3)

where UC represents the all-in costs of owning your housing unit for a given period of time, one

year typically. Those costs are captured on the right-hand side of equation (3) by the capital cost

(r), maintenance and depreciation cost (m), risk premium associated with housing investment (β),

and the expected housing appreciation (πe), with no property taxes in almost all localities. This

formula is further simplified from the standard Poterba equation because there is no deductibility

of mortgage interest in China.

         Following Wu, Gyourko and Deng (2012), we use the 5-year deposit rate as the capital

cost, presume maintenance and depreciation amount to 2.5% of house value annually, and

impose a 2% risk premium. The first column in Table 9 lists the expected price appreciation

needed for a buyer to be indifferent between owning and renting the unit given the other

assumptions noted just above. The implied expected appreciation rates range from 4.5%

(Xining) to 7.3% (Beijing) as of 2014(4).

       Comparing the figures in columns 1 and 2 of Table 9 shows that in eleven cities the

breakeven appreciation rate exceeds the average per annum compound rate realized over the

previous nine years (Chengdu, Dalian, Haikou, Hangzhou, Hefei, Jinan, Nanchang, Ningbo,

Taiyuan, Yinchuan, and Wuhan). Implied expectations seem to be more reasonable in other

cities in the sense that they are within the range of recent experience in most markets. Of course,

these results paint too optimistic a picture if we are underestimating on-going user costs of

ownership. For example, if we use a 5-year loan rate in lieu of the deposit rate, then costs are

about 150-200 basis points higher. In that case, another nine markets would have required price

growth expectations above recent average appreciation. They include some of the largest

markets in China: Harbin, Guiyan, Qingdao, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Xian.

       There are no reasonable assumptions that do not leave the implied breakeven rate for

Beijing well below its extremely high recent rates of price appreciation. However, that does not

suggest that housing market price risk in the nation’s capital is low. The contrary is the case, in

fact, and the reason is because the market’s price-to-rent ratio itself is so high. To better

understand this, consider the potential outcome if expected appreciation in Beijing were for any

reason to fall by only one percentage point from 7.3% to 6.3%. In that case, the equilibrium user

cost would increase from 1.9% to 2.9%, implying a drop of price-to-rent ratio from 52.6

(1/0.019≈52.6) to 34.5 (1/0.029≈34.5), all else constant. Absent an offsetting increase in rents,

this implies about a one-third drop in prices. Only modest drops in expected price growth (or



                                                                                                    26
rises in interest rates) are needed to generate potentially large price declines because they involve

large percentage changes in (abnormally low) user costs. Large price declines need not occur, of

course, if there are countervailing changes such as rising rents, and we see such cases in markets

such as Hangzhou in Figure 12, where a falling price-to-rent ratio is associated with relatively

flat prices and rapidly rising rents

        Figure 13 presents analogous information on the price-to-income ratio.17 Caution is in

order when interpreting these data, as there is substantial ‘gray’ income in China which biases up

measured ratios (Wang and Woo, 2011; Deng, Wei and Wu, 2015). Changes in these ratios

probably are more informative over time, as we have no reason to suspect large, high-frequency

changes in reporting of income. With that caveat in mind, these figures show that price-to-

income ratios are extraordinarily high in China. Five is a low number, with Beijing’s being well

over 10. Mortgage underwriting in the U.S. and many other developed countries considers

anything above 3 to be potentially problematic. That said, conditions in China are quite

different. Commercial banks typically consider 50% as the upper bound for the ratio of monthly

debt service to monthly disposable income. Given a typical current mortgage with a 30 year

term, a 30% down payment and a 6.55% interest rate, the maximum implied price-to-income

ratio is about 9.4. Thus, price-to-income ratios in all markets but Beijing and Shanghai are

consistent with current underwriting practices. That does not mean debt service is not high

relative to income in China. It is. However, it is likely that other factors such as expected




17
  In the calculation, we use the average newly-built housing price and the average per capita disposable income,
both reported by local statistics agency (either median house price or median income is available in China now).
We then calculate the ratio between the price of a housing unit of 90 square meters in size and a household with
three members (i.e., assuming that the per capita living space is 30 square meters).

                                                                                                                   27
growth in urban incomes are perceived to make affordability less burdensome.18 Of course, this

highlights how important future income growth is to the health of China’s housing markets.



     IV.      House Price Changes and Market Fundamentals: 35 Major Markets

           In this section, we estimate simple regression models to determine whether supply and

demand fundamentals like those discussed above can help explain house price variation over

time across Chinese cities.19 In doing so, we construct a panel data model using annual data

between 2006 and 2013 for the 35 major cities listed above. Our price series is an update of the

log change in real constant-quality prices from Wu, Deng and Liu (2014).

           We begin with Table 10’s summary results describing how much of real city-level house

price growth can be explained by common versus city-specific factors. Column 1 reports the

findings of a specification that regresses log real price change on year fixed effects. There is a

strong common component in price growth, as year dummies can explain almost 40 percent of

the variation in annual housing price growth. This is consistent with shifts in the macroeconomic

environment, market sentiment, and/or the central government’s housing market intervention

policies playing an important role in all local housing markets. In contrast, column 2’s results

show that the explanatory power of city dummies is a much lower 12%. The adjusted-R2 is so

low that we cannot reject the null that city fixed effects are jointly equal to zero. The final

column in Table 10 shows that these two factors are largely orthogonal to one another. When

both sets of fixed effects are included on the right-hand side, the R2 is 50%.



18
   Fang, et. al. (2015) report results consistent with this conclusion. In their study of 120 cities, they find that
households from the lower end of the income distribution still are able to access financing and purchase homes, even
in cities with high house price appreciation.
19
   See Ahuja et al (2010), Ren, Xiong and Yuan (2012), Zhang, Hua and Zhao (2012), Dreger and Zhang (2013),
Chow and Niu (2014) for some other recent attempts on modeling housing price dynamics in major Chinese cities.

                                                                                                                 28
           We next investigate the role of relative supply-demand conditions. The first column of

Table 11 adds controls for the ratio of unsold inventory held by developers to total sales in the

relevant market during the previous year and for the ratio of presale permits to total sales in the

previous year.20 Both are negative and statistically significantly different from zero. However,

only the inventory variable remains statistically significant when we add controls for the

previous year’s price level and rate of price growth. One possible reason is that developers could

be adjusting the volume of new housing supply based on current housing prices or price changes.

For example, during a downturn in the market, developers could choose to postpone some new

projects and reduce new housing supply, which would at least partially reduce the magnitude of

price drops. The impact of the inventory-to-sales variable declines modestly, but remains highly

statistically significant.

           Interestingly, price growth this year is significantly lower if the price level was higher

last year (column 2 of Table 11). Thus, more expensive markets tend to mean revert in the sense

their rate of appreciation will be lower. Column 3 of Table 11 then adds a number of other

“fundamental” factors to the specification. On the demand side, two reflect exogenous demand

shocks. Expected non-farm employment growth in the city is created using the method

developed by Bartik (1991). This variable, epgrowthi,t, is calculated as the weighted average of

national industrial sector employment growth rates, where the weights reflect each city’s share of

that industry’s aggregate employment. More specifically,

                                                                                              (4)




20
     Both variables are calculated based on data provided by local housing authorities.

                                                                                                        29
where et is the national employment level in all non-farm industries, ei,j,t is city i’s employment

in industry j in year t,     i,j,t   is the national employment level in industry j outside of city i, and the

j subscript indexes the 18 non-farm employment sectors in China.21

         A similar approach is taken to create another variable intended to reflect exogenous

shocks in exports. That variable, exportgrowthi,t, is calculated as:

                                                                     ,                                                (5)

where exporti,t is city i’s export in year t, gdpi,t is city i’s GDP in year t, and                      i,t   is the

national-level export outside of city i in year t.

         A credit conditions control is created in an analogous way. The growth in loans,

loangrowthi,t, is defined as

                                                                                                                      (6)

where loani,t is city i’s total outstanding loan balance at the end of year t, and                     i,t   is the

national-level loan balance outside of city i in year t.

         We also experiment with a couple of supply side variables. One is the change in

construction costs. The second is the annual residential-usage land supply volume from the

CRLPI to reflect the effect of land supply.22

         The findings from this expanded specification show that only the export variable

consistently is statistically significant. A one standard deviation increase in expected export

growth is associated with a 0.15 standard deviation higher rate of local house price appreciation.

That is not nothing and signifies that a positive demand shock does lead to higher house price



21
   Unless otherwise stated, the data used in the rest of this section are provided by National Bureau of Statistics of
China and local housing authorities.
22
   We never include land prices from the CRLPI because of the obvious endogeneity problems.

                                                                                                                            30
appreciation. However, the R2 does not increase much from that reported in the first two

columns.

        More importantly economically is the fact that the inventory overhang variable remains

statistically and economically significant. Its coefficient implies that a one standard deviation

increase in normalized housing inventory would lead to a 0.45 standard deviation lower rate of

real house price growth. Thus, supply overhangs as proxied for by rising unsold inventories

relative to overall sales activity are associated with economically-meaningful lower rates of price

growth the following year. This correlation remains strong even controlling for time and

location fixed effects, as well as various other controls.



   V.      Conclusion

        It is routine for people to ask whether Chinese housing is a ‘bubble’. This paper does not

attempt to answer that question, but does take on the challenge of assessing the riskiness of

Chinese housing markets. That turns out to be substantially more difficult than the typical

economist might believe. The first reason is that the data needed for any such analysis is limited.

Hence, more accurate measurement of house prices themselves is the first answer to the question

of ‘what we need to know’ in order to sensibly assess Chinese housing market risk. The official

government price series are of lower quality than those created by private researchers, but data

quality is improving and should continue to do so. Unfortunately, a very short time series for

analysis cannot be improved upon by additional public or private research support. Only the

passage of time will do in that respect.

        In the meantime, insight into market risk still can be gleaned from a careful analysis of

supply and demand conditions. We looked at a number of metrics and came to the following



                                                                                                    31
conclusions: (1) there is substantial heterogeneity in the volume of supply-demand imbalances

across markets, both over time and in the shorter run; (2) high price level and price appreciation

rate markets such as Beijing and others on the east coast do not look to be oversupplied by our

metrics; there are a number (much more than a handful) of markets, primarily off the coast,

where oversupply looks to be substantial by one or more measures; even absent a negative

economic shock, these markets look very risky, as we would expect weak housing market

fundamentals to lead to weak or negative price growth no matter what; empirically, we report a

correlation showing that a one standard deviation higher inventory overhang in a local market is

associated with nearly a one-half standard deviation lower future growth rate of real prices; (3)

even markets such as Beijing with strong measured fundamentals should be considered risky

because housing units there trade at very high multiples of rent; it only takes a modest

downward shift in expectations (or a commensurate increase in interest rates) to generate sharp

asset value declines when a market is ‘priced to perfection’; naturally, a true negative shock in

terms of a policy intervention or a further downshift in economic growth would compound the

problem.

       There are other factors that affect risk which are beyond the scope of this already lengthy

paper. Debt is one example. Negative equity appears to have played a critical factor in the U.S.

housing bust, but there appears to be substantial equity in the Chinese residential housing system.

If there is hidden leverage in the system, that would be problematic, but we leave that possibility

to other research.

Appendix 1: Calculation of the Ratio between Changes in Housing Demand and Supply

           Demand Side Indicator
           The demand side indicator measures the number of family households needing new
housing units in the city during the decade between 2001 and 2010. It is important to note that
the definition of “family household” in China is not consistent with that in other countries like
U.S. In China, all the three following cases would be counted as one family household in the
National Population Census (NPC): (1) if one family occupies one dwelling unit, it would be
counted as one family household; (2) if two or more families share one dwelling unit, but each of
them occupies at least one bedroom, each of them would be treated as one family household; (3)
if one person occupies one dwelling unit (or one room in the unit) alone, he/she would also be
counted as one family household.
           The demand side indicator is calculated as the sum of two components: (1) net increase
in family households living in the urban area and (2) urban family households previously living
in units that were demolished.
(1)        Net increase of family households living in the urban area
           The first component measures the net increase of family households living in the urban
area of the city between 2000 and 2010, which may come from either the formation of new
families, or immigration of households from other cities or from rural areas (of the same or other
cities).
           The number of urban family households are directly available in the NPCs in both 2000
and 2010: from the 2000 NPC, we obtain the total number of family households living in the
urban area of the city on Nov 1st, 2000, both with and without local “hukou” (residence
registration); similarly, the corresponding figure for Nov 1st, 2010 is available in the 2010 NPC.
Based on these two numbers we calculate the net increase in the number of family households
during the decade. In the city of Beijing for example, there were 3,231,319 households living in
its urban area as reported in the 2000 NPC, and 5,803,085 in 2010, implying a net increase of
2,571,766 (5,803,085 - 3,231,319 = 2,571,766) households.
           One potential problem here is that the boundary of the “urban area” in a city is not
necessarily consistent between 2000 and 2010. Due to the continuous urbanization, some
villages at the city edge might be defined as a “rural area” in the 2000 NPC, but then urbanized

                                                                                                    36
during the decade and so redefined as an “urban area” in the 2010 NPC. Such a redefinition
would lead to an increase in urban households, but some households in these “villages” might
actually live in exactly the same units in 2000 and 2010. Therefore, it might result in an upward
bias in the demand side indicator.
       We try to correct for this bias based on data of households reported as living in a rural
area. Using Beijing as an example, in the 2000 NPC there were 2,533,459 persons with local
hukou living in its rural area. Without any population migration or redefinition of urban area,
these 2,533,459 persons ought to increase to 2,573,766 in 2010, given the natural growth rate of
1.591% in Beijing during the decade; however, the actual population living in the rural area of
Beijing reported in the 2010 NPC was 1,908,652, which implies that there were 665,114
(2,573,766 - 1,908,652 = 665,114) persons which were either re-defined as living in the urban
area, or moved to the urban area of Beijing, or moved out of the city. According to the NPC data,
during the decade there were 209,910 persons who previously lived in the rural area of Beijing
but moved to other cities or the urban area of Beijing, which implies that 455,204 (665,114 –
209,910 = 455,204) persons were re-defined as living in the urban area. Presuming three people
per household, this works out to 150,481 households. Therefore, the actual number of increase
in urban households is 2,421,285 (2,571,766 – 150,481 = 2,421,285).
(2)    Urban family households with previous dwelling units demolished
       The second component measures the number of family households living in the urban
area (as of the 2000 NPC) whose dwelling units were demolished in the urban regeneration
process over the decade. These households need to purchase or rent a new unit and thus also
contribute to the demand for new housing supply. Unfortunately, for almost all cities this
number is not directly available, but can only be imputed indirectly. The procedures are as
follows, and again we take Beijing as the example (Table A-1).
       1)      In both the 2000 and 2010 NPCs, about 10% of the family households were
sampled to provide additional information, including the building age of their current dwelling
units. We use this information to calculate the demolition rate for each building age category.
For example, there were 4,096,844 family households in Beijing (both urban and rural area) in
2000, of which 402,717 households were sampled to provide additional information. Of these
402,717 households, 18,425 reported that their current dwelling units were built before 1949,
which implies that there were about 187,438 (18,425 / 402,717 * 4,096,844 ≈ 187,438) family

                                                                                                   37
households in Beijing with dwelling units built before 1949. Using the same methodology, we
compute that there were only 7,913 such households in 2010. This suggests that there were
106,752 dwelling units of pre-1949 vintage demolished during the decade, or a demolition rate of
56.95% (106,752 / 187,438 ≈ 0.5695).
       2)      Analogous demolition rates are calculated for other vintages. For the vintages of
“1990-1999” and “after 2000”, we assume that the demolition rates are 1% and 0%, respectively,
according to a report by Institute of Real Estate Studies, Tsinghua University.
       3)      In the 2010 NPC the building age category information is also available for
family households living in the urban area. With the assumption that the demolition rate did not
significantly differ between urban and rural areas, we can use that figure to impute the number of
households with units demolished in each category. For example, in 2010 there were 76,584
urban family households with dwelling units built before 1949, and according to the above
calculation the demolition rate was 56.95%. This implies that there were 101,327 (76,584 / (1 –
56.95%) * 56.95% ≈ 101,327) households in this category with units demolished during the
decade.
       In total, we estimate that housing units of 393,159 urban households in Beijing were
demolished during the decade.
(3)    Aggregated number
       Based on these calculations, the aggregated demand for new housing units in Beijing is
2.81 million units.




       Supply Side Indicator
       The supply side indicator measures the number of housing units completed and available
for family households in the city during the decade. There are two components included here:
(1) units developed by firms or institutions; and (2) units built by households themselves.
(1)    Units developed by firms or institutions
       We start with the total floor area of housing completed. In Beijing, there were 209.69
million sq.m. of housing completed between Nov 1st, 2000 and Oct 30th, 2010, including private
housing developed by housing developers, public housing developed by governments,



                                                                                                38
institutional housing developed by universities or other institutions, etc., but excluding any
informal housing or units built by households themselves.
       However, not all the 209.69 million sq.m. are available for the family households.
Besides the family households, there is also another group of “non-family” households reported
in the NPCs. These so-called “non-family households” refer to those living in one room but are
legally unrelated. Mainly, they include three groups: (1) those who rent and live in dormitories
provided by universities, high schools, factories, construction sites, or other institutions; (2) those
who rent and share one room; (3) unmarried couples.
       We deduct their demand from the 209.69 million sq.m. In Beijing, there were totally
1,443,186 persons defined as non-family households in the 2000 NPC. Based on the building
code for institutional housing in 2000, we assume that the per capita living space for them is 6.5
sq.m. in 2000, and thus they need about 9.38 million sq.m. of housing in aggregate. By 2010, the
population of this group increased to 2,892,968 persons and the standard for per capita living
space also increased to 7.0 sq.m., and so they need about 20.25 million sq.m. of housing.
Therefore, their housing demand increased by 10.87 (20.25 – 9.38 = 10.87) million sq.m. during
the decade. Presuming that demand was fully satisfied implies 198.60 (209.47 – 10.87 = 198.60)
million sq.m. of new housing supply available for family households.
       Finally, we need to covert the floor area to units. According to the 2010 NPC (10%
sample survey), in Beijing there were 240,996 urban household respondents whose current units
were built after 2000, and the total floor area was 19.69 million sq.m., implying an average unit
size of 81.73 sq.m. This helps us to get the final result of about 2.43 (198.60 / 81.73 ≈ 2.43)
million units completed and available for family households during the decade.
(2)    Units built by households
       According to the sample survey mentioned above, in 2000 there were 512,298 urban
households in Beijing who built their own units. In addition, there were 150,481 rural
households re-defined as urban households, and we assume each household occupied one
housing unit. Given the average demolition rate of 11.08% mentioned above, the number would
decrease to 589,374 ((512,298+150,481) * (1-11.08%) ≈ 589,374) in 2010. The corresponding
number reported in the 2010 NPC was 429,589 in 2010. Thus, in Beijing we believe that the
sector of self-built housing units did not contribute to the flow supply during the decade, but it



                                                                                                     39
does not necessarily apply to other cities. In particular, this sector is usually more important in
less developed cities.
(3)    Aggregate number
       Based on the above calculation, we can get the aggregated supply for new housing units.
For Beijing, the result is 2.43 million units.


       Supply-Demand Ratio
       Based on the above results we can compare the supply-demand ratio. In Beijing, we get
the result of 82.88% (2.43 / 2.81 ≈ 0.8288).


       Updating the Calculation to Post-2010 Years
       We also update the supply-demand ratio calculation to 2011 and 2012. Without the
detailed data provided by a NPC, we have to make several assumptions as described below.
       (1)     For the component of “net increase of family households living in the urban area”,
we adopt the estimate of urban population at the end of each year (i.e., 2011 and 2012) provided
by the relevant local statistic agency, and assume that the average urban household size kept
changing in the same direction and at the same speed as between 2001 and 2010.
       (2)     For the component of “urban family households with previous dwelling units
demolished”, we apply the demolition rate for each building age category calculated based on the
period 2001-2010 to the housing stock in 2010, and assume that the volume of demolition would
be evenly distributed between 2011 and 2020.
       (3)     For the component of “units developed by firms or institutions”, we adopt the
volume of annual housing completion reported by the relevant local statistic agency, and assume
that both the percentage for non-family households and the average housing unit size were
consistent with the corresponding numbers in 2001-2010.
       (4)     For the component of “units built by households”, we assume that its ratio against
units developed by firms or institutions kept stable, as between 2001 and 2010.
