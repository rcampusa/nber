                                         ABSTRACT

Do nudge interventions that have generated positive impacts at a local level maintain efficacy
when scaled state or nationwide? What specific mechanisms explain the positive impacts of
promising smaller-scale nudges? We investigate, through two randomized controlled trials, the
impact of a national and state-level campaign to encourage students to apply for financial aid for
college. The campaigns collectively reached over 800,000 students, with multiple treatment arms
to investigate different potential mechanisms. We find no impacts on financial aid receipt or
college enrollment overall or for any student subgroups. We find no evidence that different
approaches to message framing, delivery, or timing, or access to one-on-one advising affected
campaign efficacy. We discuss why nudge strategies that work locally may be hard to scale
effectively.

I. Introduction
        Some of the most promising evidence on the potential efficacy of nudges in public policy
comes from efforts to improve low-income students' access to financial aid in the U.S.
postsecondary system. Researchers have long recognized that complexities associated with the
Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) can deter college-ready students from enrolling
or succeeding in higher education (Dynarski and Scott-Clayton, 2006; King, 2004). Among the
largest school districts, 35-50 percent of high school seniors do not complete the FAFSA prior to
graduation. 1 In 2012, for every nine college students who received a Pell grant, there was one
student who would have received such funding but who did not submit a FAFSA (Bird, 2016).
        Numerous recent studies suggest that nudge campaigns are a low cost but effective way to
increase FAFSA completion rates by helping students navigate the complex submission process.
Table 1 presents a comprehensive overview of nudge and informational intervention studies in
higher education, including their sample, location, and partner organization. 2 Nudges in these
studies frequently consist of one-way communication, sending information or connecting students
to resources to help them navigate college and financial aid processes. In some cases, nudge
campaigns also offer two-way communication, providing students with "light touch" counseling
as they make college application, enrollment, and financing decisions. These interventions appeal
to behavioral economic models in which students may be inattentive to relevant information or
deadlines. They also appeal to neoclassical models of economic behavior because they provide
students information about potential higher education investments.
        Nearly all existing evidence of positive impacts from nudges in higher education comes
from relatively small-scale studies done in partnership with a local organization serving hundreds
or thousands of students. These include individual school districts, colleges, and local non-profits
in various locations across the United States and internationally. The median study in Table 1 has
6,233 students. Many view these types of interventions as promising because it seems possible to

  We include studies of nudge and informational interventions that focus on helping high school and current
college students navigate college decisions. With few exceptions, all studies are randomized controlled trials.
We exclude studies that involve informational interventions in earlier grades that focus on shaping students'
college expectations and/or persistence in primary and secondary education. We also exclude studies that
involve more intensive college coaching or mentoring interventions given the higher cost typically associated
with these types of outreach, though we acknowledge the distinction between nudge interventions that offer
two-way communication with an advisor and coaching interventions is not always clear.


                                                       2
scale them at low cost. Such scaling could involve partnership with a single statewide or
nationwide organization connected to many students, which we refer to here as "global" scale up.
Alternatively, "local" scale up could occur through coordinating efforts of multiple smaller
organizations that are more local in nature than statewide or nationwide ones. We currently have,
however, limited evidence on whether such interventions maintain such efficacy at scale and what
effective pathways to scale might be (i.e., global versus local scale up). Additionally, we have little
evidence regarding the specific mechanisms that explains these interventions' efficacy.
       In this paper, we provide some of the first evidence on these issues through a global scale
up of FAFSA nudges studied in previous research with much smaller samples. We run the largest
FAFSA nudge campaigns to date by partnering with one nationwide organization and one
statewide organization to send information about FAFSA filing to high school and college
students. The experimental sample comprises 800,000 students across both partners. The first
intervention targeted all lower-income and first-generation high school seniors who had registered
with the Common Application, a national portal through which students can apply to up to 20 of
800+ participating colleges with a single application. Treated students received messages
encouraging them to complete the FAFSA early to maximize the financial aid they received. We
randomly varied the messages along multiple dimensions, including their: behavioral framing;
delivery channel (mail, e-mail, or text message); offer of one-on-one advising assistance; and a
social nudge to encourage peers to complete the FAFSA as well.
       The second intervention targeted all students in a Large State ("Large State") who had
applied to college through a state-sponsored portal that allows applications to all the state's public
four-year colleges, as well as to some private institutions and community colleges. Treated
students received text messages informing them of two important changes in federal financial aid
policy: the ability to file the FAFSA starting October (rather than January) of the year prior to
college enrollment and the ability to use income tax returns their families had already filed in the
financial aid application process. These messages also varied along multiple dimensions, including
their timing and the use of infographics to increase visual salience. We experimentally varied many
aspects of the intervention and targeted different populations.
       We consistently find no effect these messages on student enrollment or financial aid
outcomes. This null finding is consistent across samples, content, timing, visual presentation, and
offers of personalized help. Large sample sizes allow us to rule out very small effects of these



                                                  3
interventions. We believe the design of our experiments and these precise null results contribute
in three ways to the existing research literature.
        First, and most broadly, our work shows that recent concerns about scaling up randomized
controlled trials in developing countries are also relevant in the context of developed countries.
Development economists have recently highlighted promising pilot programs that fail to replicate
at scale. This can occur for a number of reasons including poor fidelity to the treatment, site
selection bias, and context dependence (Allcott, 2015; Bold et al., 2018; Banerjee et al., 2008;
Banerjee et al., 2017). Global scale up of nudges in higher education may also face substantial
barriers to success, for reasons we discuss further below.
        Second, nearly all prior financial aid nudge campaign studies have reached students by
partnering with individual high schools, colleges, or local college-focused non-profits. Many of
those smaller scale studies demonstrated that messages sent to students at critical financial aid
junctures can at low cost generate substantial improvements in college enrollment (Castleman and
Page, 2015; Castleman and Page, 2016a; ideas42, 2016; Page, Castleman, and Meyer, 2018). 3
Very few studies have done scaled up outreach using a global scale approach. Those that have
looked at a large scale such as states or national organizations have, consistent with our results,
found little or no effects. When effects are detected, they are often much smaller than those found
in early work or apply only to a narrow set of students (Hyman, 2018; Gurantz et al., 2019;
Bergman et al., 2019).
        While our research takes a similar global approach to scale as these recent studies, we
extend our understanding of the efficacy of nudge interventions at scale in several ways. Like
Bergman et al. 2019, we focus on the impact of financial aid nudges for a broader segment of the
academic distribution of potential college students. Other recent studies pursuing a global approach
to scale focus on a more narrow, higher-achieving student population. Our study more closely
adheres to the behaviorally-informed design--both in terms of content framing and delivery--of
prior evidence-based studies. Other recent large-scale studies rely more heavily on delivery
methods (e.g., mail or email) that may be less effective at reaching students or they contained
dense information that may have required substantially greater cognitive load for students to



3
 Other similar studies have considered nudges designed to increase academic performance through studying with
mixed success (Oreopoulos et al. (2018a), Oreopoulos et al. (2018b) Dobronyi et al. (2018)). One on one coaching
seems to be the most effective but least scalable method to improve success (Oreopoulos & Petronijevic 2018)


                                                        4
understand. Finally, our intervention focused on a discrete and consequential action: applying for
financial aid. As a result, the intervention focused on concrete, near-term calls to action for
students, whereas other recent studies rely on students completing numerous college planning tasks
or depend on students to be motivated by benefits (in the case of tax credits for higher education)
that they would not realize for numerous months.
       Third, our results help answer important open questions about the mechanisms that drive
prior campaigns' efficacy. Many of these prior campaigns provided one-on-one advising available
to all students who responded to messages they received, or use some form of financial incentive
to encourage student engagement with informational materials and/or with advising (Carrell and
Sacerdote, 2017; Castleman and Page, 2015; Castleman and Page, 2016a; Hoxby and Turner,
2013). Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle how much of the impact observed in past research
stems from simplified information, ongoing reminders, reduced barriers to professional advising,
or from eliminating near-term costs (e.g., application fee waivers), or how much the positive
results were a function of some other study-specific context or population. We designed our
experiment to mimic many of these intervention features. We offered college advising to students,
varied the content and delivery method of information, and sent numerous reminders. We find that
none of these variations ultimately mattered for student outcomes, suggesting that some other
distinguishing feature(s) between prior studies and our interventions accounts for positive effects
in the more localized interventions in this area.
       We note three hypotheses that might explain our null results given the past successes of
very similar, smaller scale campaigns. First, unlike this paper, most prior work involved a local
partner with closer connections to and knowledge of treated students. Local partners may know
something important about their students and such students may react differently to messages from
partners they feel are specifically invested in them or their communities. Second and relatedly, the
global scale-up in this study implied messaging content was more generic and less personalized to
students than in prior interventions, perhaps resulting in lower salience for students. Third, current
cohorts of students may have better information about FAFSA completion than did previous
cohorts, so that there exist fewer students for whom nudge campaigns would make a difference on
the margin.
       Though we cannot distinguish between these hypotheses, our work suggests fruitful areas
for further research on the difficulties of scaling nudge campaigns and demonstrates the potential



                                                    5
pitfall for "global" approaches to scaling nudge campaigns. At the very least, our work suggests
that future attempts to scale up such campaigns should proceed cautiously and with attention paid
to these hypotheses.


II. Intervention Design
Common Application Experiment. Our outreach consisted of two campaigns: a fall campaign, in
which students received two email messages encouraging them to consider college affordability
when deciding where to apply, and a multi-modal (email, text message, and postal) winter
campaign encouraging students to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) as early in the calendar year as possible to maximize their financial aid. The fall email
campaign reached students who had registered with the Common Application by October 12, 2015
("Fall cohort"). The winter campaign targeted the Fall cohort as well as the additional students
who registered with the Common Application by December 18, 2016 ("Winter cohort"). Students
in the Fall cohort received their first email message between October 26 and October 30, 2015.
The Common Application sent a follow-up e-mail message between November 11 and November
16, 2015. The Common Application sent the first winter email during the week of January 11,
2016 and a second email the week of February 1, 2016. For students who entered in the Fall cohort,
these were in practice their third or fourth emails.
        The Common Application sent a generic introductory text message the week of January
10, 2016 to all students assigned to a texting condition, simply informing them that they would
receive a set of messages over the following weeks and encouraging them to save the number
associated with the text so that it would be recognized by their phone. Text messages tailored to
assigned experimental treatments were then sent the weeks of January 17, January 24, January 31,
February 7, and February 14. Roughly 87 percent of our experimental samples were assigned to
receive text messages--this includes all students assigned to the experimental variations, as well
as 50 percent of students in the control condition who received basic text messages. 4 Roughly one-
third of students also received a three-page postal mailer in mid-January.



4
 Not all text messages were delivered, for one of two reasons: (1) the number the student provided was not a
valid cell-phone number; and (2) an unanticipated issue with cell-phone carrier "spam" filters blocking text
message delivery, which resulted in approximately 28 percent of scheduled messages not being delivered. We
discuss this further in Appendix B.


                                                      6
Large State Experiment. The Large State intervention targeted several cohorts of students,
including rising freshmen, current college students, students who had previously applied but not
enrolled, and students who left college with substantial credits but no degree. We focus on the
rising freshman sample for comparability to the Common Application experiment. The other
samples yield similar results with no effect on student outcomes in any of the samples, and the
message variations were generally similar across groups. The rising freshman sample consists of
students who graduated from high school in summer 2016 and applied to college using the state
application portal for fall 2016. 5
         The state agency we partnered with sent an introductory text message, similar to the one
used in the Common Application experiment, on October 11, 2016 to all students assigned to a
texting condition. Text messages for each treatment condition were then sent on the following
dates: October 18, October 25, November 1, November 8, and November 22, 2016. 6 The agency
sent a final text message on January 10, 2017 reminding students about steps they could take to
apply for financial aid.


Experimental variations
         In the Common Application and Large State experiments we tested multiple mechanisms
that could affect campaign efficacy (we describe the specific randomization procedure to assign
students to different experimental conditions in more detail below).
Common Application
     ·   Variations in access to one-on-one advising. Several prior studies demonstrate that
         providing students with one-on-one college or financial advising can lead to substantially
         improved postsecondary outcomes (Avery, 2013; Barr and Castleman, 2017; Carrell and
         Sacerdote, 2017; Castleman and Goodman, 2018; Castleman, Page, and Schooley, 2015).
         By contrast, information-only interventions to improve access to financial aid or college

5
  The application portal also sent text messages to students who applied prior Fall 2016 but who had not enrolled in
school in the previous three years--this is the "Applied Not Enroll" Group in the tables. The Applied Not Enroll
Group had 110,000 treated students and 207,193 control students. Currently enrolled students in college who had
previously used the application portal are referred to as "Enrolled" in the table. The currently enrolled group had
149,736 treated students and 367,006 control students. The last group, "Leavers" were students who had attempted
60 credits at a university or 30 credits at a community college who left without obtaining a degree. For leavers there
were 20,671 treated students and 10,727 students in the control group.
6
  For current students, we also varied treatment timing with some students receiving messages beginning in mid-
September 2016 ("early start"), just prior to the start of FAFSA filing, and others receiving messages starting
October 11, 2016 ("on time start"), after FAFSA filing began.


                                                          7
    have generally had limited or no effect (Bergman, et al., 2019; Bettinger et al., 2016;
    Hyman 2018). We therefore randomly varied whether students received information-only
    outreach or nudges that invited students to connect to an advisor for support with FAFSA
    completion.
·   Variations in content framing. Behavioral science theory and empirical evidence
    demonstrate that the way content is framed can influence how salient it is to individuals
    and whether the information drives behavior change. For instance, foundational research
    in behavioral economics demonstrated that people tend to prefer certain benefits over
    potential gains (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Students from low-income families tend
    to overestimate their net cost of college, suggesting they may not have a precise
    understanding of the financial aid for which they are eligible (Avery and Kane, 2004;
    Grodsky and Jones, 2007). This suggests that making the financial benefits associated with
    FAFSA completion more salient--particularly relative to the amount of time necessary to
    complete the FAFSA--may motivate some students on the margin of FAFSA completion
    to invest the time necessary to apply for financial aid. Based on this hypothesis, we
    developed a "Financial Benefits" content variation. Other behavioral science research
    shows that individuals' identities have strong effects on their attitudes and behaviors
    (Baumeister 1987). Individuals have a vested interest in preserving positive perceptions
    of themselves, and thus, are likely to behave in a manner consistent with positive past
    behaviors (Swann, Jr. and Ely 1984,) showing a robust "self-consistency bias." If students
    embrace an externally-activated identity (such as a nudge that reinforces the motivation
    they have shown by starting their college applications), they are more likely to take actions
    that are framed as identity-consistent. Based on this hypothesis, we developed an
    "Identity/Norms" content variation.      Finally, researchers demonstrate that providing
    people with concrete planning prompts and guidance can increase follow through on
    various actions, from voting to getting a flu vaccination (Nickerson and Rogers, 2010;
    Milkman et al., 2012). Especially for adolescents, who are more likely to struggle with
    organization, planning, and time management (Casey and Somerville, 2011), guiding
    students to form concrete implementation intentions for when, how, and with whom they
    will complete FAFSA may further contribute to increased filing rates. Based on this
    hypothesis, we developed a "Planning" content variation.



                                             8
    ·    Variations in message delivery. Foundational behavioral science research also
         demonstrated that the channels through which people receive information can affect how
         they respond to it (Leventhal, 1963). We varied whether students received outreach
         through postal letters, emails, and/or text messages to investigate whether delivery channel
         affected campaign impacts. 7
Large state
    ·   Variation in information presentation (infographics versus text). Visual imagery can more
        effectively capture attention and make information more salient. We varied whether
        students received infographics with information about how to apply for financial aid or
        received texts containing the same information but without the infographics to investigate
        whether visual images can prompt students to take action.
    ·   Variation in timing of messages. For some of the student samples in the Large State
        experiment, we varied the timing of messages, with some students receiving messages
        several weeks before the FAFSA could be filed and others receiving messages around the
        time FAFSA filing became available (FAFSA filing began October 1). Students in the
        "early" treatment condition received messages beginning in mid-September (FAFSA could
        be filed starting October 1); students in the "on-time" treatment condition received
        messages beginning in early to mid-October. This variation allowed us to examine whether
        students benefit from having additional time to prepare to undertake important tasks or if
        "just in time" messaging is more effective. We do not, however, have this source of
        variation for the rising freshman sample.
    ·   Variations in motivational framing. We developed a motivational framing for the current
        college student sample similar to the one described above for the Common Application
        sample.


We provide additional detail on intervention content for both experiments in Appendix B and
intervention materials can be found in Appendix C.


7
  We also tested a school-level experimental variation in which a subset of students were randomly assigned to
encourage other students at their school to complete FAFSA. As with the other intervention arms we find no
impact of the social nudge on students' postsecondary outcomes. Because of the different structure of the
randomization and given the breadth of variations we already cover in the paper we do not present results from
the social nudge in this paper but can provide them upon request.


                                                      9
III. Research Design
Randomization Procedure
Common Application
        We randomly assigned students to one of the experimental conditions described above in
two phases. In October 2015, we identified students who had by that time registered with the
Common Application and who met at least one of the three following "low socio-economic status"
(low-SES) criteria 8:
    1. Indicated on their application that they qualified for a need-based application fee waiver
    2. Indicated that they were the first in their family to go to college
    3. Indicated that they intended to apply for need-based financial aid AND attended a high
        school where at least 40 percent of students qualified for free or reduced price lunch 9

For the Fall cohort, we excluded students with a reported SAT score of at least 1230 for the math
and verbal sections or a reported ACT score of at least 28 (n=36,632) because these students were
receiving a different and concurrent intervention from the Common Application focused on
college applications. The resulting sample size for the Fall cohort was 187,482 students. To
perform the randomization for the Fall cohort, we first randomly selected 2,000 students to receive
the additional offer of one-on-one advising. 10 We did so by randomly selecting 2,000 schools to
designate as "advising schools", and then randomly selecting one student per advising school to
receive advising. To ensure that students selected for the advising condition were representative
of this population of low-SES Common Applicants, we set the probability for whether a high
school was randomly selected directly proportional to the proportion of low-SES Common
Applicants attending that high school. That is, a high school with 100 low-SES Common
Applicants would be more likely to be chosen as an advising school, compared to a high school
with 50 low-SES Common Applicants. For each student assigned to advising, we then randomly

  We excluded from our sample 18,602 low-SES students attending high schools participating in a similar
messaging intervention.

  Using high-school level data from NCES's Common Core of Data (CCD), we calculated percent of
students who qualified for free or reduced priced lunch during the 2013-14 academic year. We were able
to match this information from CCD to the Common Application data for 95.3% of public school students
(90.4% of public schools).

   This relatively small sample size for the Advising experimental condition was due to the high resource
nature of the one-on-one advising offered.

Benefit, Advising + Identity/Norms, and Advising + Planning). Finally, we randomly assigned the
remaining 185,482 students to the other four experimental conditions (Control, Financial Benefit,
Identity/Norms, Planning) in equal proportions. We performed this randomization within high
school in order to increase the precision of our estimates by controlling for school level differences
in student outcomes.
       We conducted the second phase of the randomization in mid-December 2015 for winter
emails, text messages, and postal mailers. We included all students from the October cohort in the
winter campaign, with the exception of 259 students who terminated their accounts with Common
Application prior to the December randomization. Also included in the winter campaign were low-
SES students who registered with Common Application between October and December, and the
low-SES high-achievers previously excluded from the October cohort. This process resulted in an
additional 267,020 students for the winter campaign. All students in the October cohort maintained
their student-level content variation assignment. For the December cohort, we randomly assigned
students to one of four content variations (Control, Financial Benefit, Identity/Norms, or Planning)
in equal proportions. Again, we performed this student-level randomization within high-school.
All students in the winter campaign received email messages. All treated students were also
eligible to receive text messages; over 99% of students provided cell phone numbers. Roughly
one-third of students were randomly assigned (within high-school and treatment variation) to
receive postal mailers.


Large State
       We randomized students who had completed high school and applied for college admission
in Fall 2016 into treatment and control groups. We will refer to this group as "rising freshman." In
total we assigned 70,000 students to receive text messages with 115,793 students not receiving
any text messages who constitute our control group. We stratified on whether students had applied
to four-year schools, two-year schools, or both. Due to data timing issues, we could not confirm
whether students enrolled in the fall prior to sending messages. Hence, some students who applied
to college and did not enroll are included in our treatment group. Randomization for the other
groups including Apply Not Enroll, Enrolled, and Leavers was similar. For enrolled students we
also stratified on student classification (e.g. freshman, sophomore, etc.).




                                                 11
Empirical strategy
   Our evaluation of the impact of the nudge campaign on college and financial aid outcomes
relies on college enrollment data provided by the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) as well
as administrative data from the Large State. The exact variables available differ slightly from each
source.
Common Application
   For the Common Application intervention, we use the following regression models to estimate
the impact of our treatments, either overall or by experimental conditions:


                           = 0 + 1  +  +                                                         (1)


 = 0 + 1  + 2  + 3  + 4  +  +                                                                    (2)


Here, Y is a given outcome for student i in high school s first treated in wave w (fall or winter of
senior year). In equation (1), AnyTreatment indicates whether the student was in any of the
experimental (non-control) conditions. In equation (2), Advising indicates whether the student was
assigned to receive one-on-one advising via text message. Plan, Norms and Financial indicate
which content treatment arm to which the student was assigned. Note that, because students in the
advising conditions were also assigned to one of the three content variations, Advising is not
mutually exclusive from Plan, Norms, or Financial. The omitted category is the control condition.
All regressions include high school by treatment wave fixed effects given,  , that the
randomization was conducted within such strata. We cluster standard errors by high school to
account for potentially unobserved correlations in the error terms across high school classmates.
We show separately that controlling for further demographics has little impact on our estimates
due to the randomization.


Common Application outcome sample construction
          Due to the cost of NSC matches, we were not able to receive college enrollment outcome
data for all students in our sample. We selected a subset of the full sample to receive NSC matches
with which to perform our outcome evaluation in January 2018, which allow us to observe
enrollment and college choice outcomes for the three semesters (Fall 2016, Spring 2017, and Fall



                                                12
2017) following the students' expected year of high school graduation. We selected 271,365
students for the NSC sample by the following method:
   1. In order to take full advantage of the within high school randomization procedure, we first
       identified all high schools at which all the following experimental variations were
       represented by at least one student:
           a. Control condition
           b. Control condition + basic text messages
           c. Financial Benefit, no postal mailer
           d. Financial Benefit + postal mailer
           e. Identity/Norms, no postal mailer
           f. Identify/Norms + postal mailer
           g. Planning, no postal mailer
           h. Planning + postal mailer
           i. Advising, any content variation (if an advising school)
   2. Among these high schools where there was at least one student in each of the nine
       variations, we first selected all advising high schools to contribute to the NSC sample. We
       gave preference to advising schools when constructing our NSC sample in order to
       maximize the statistical power to detect effects of the advising intervention, which was
       offered to only one student per advising high school. This process led to a total of 1,714
       advising high schools, and a total of 130,151 individual students, for the NSC sample.
   3. Among non-advising high schools, we then randomly selected individual high schools to
       contribute to the NSC sample until the full 271,365 students were identified. This made a
       total of 3,681 non-advising high schools, and a total of 141,214 students for the NSC
       sample. Only roughly half of students from the last high school selected entered the NSC
       sample, due to space constraints.
This sampling procedure does give preference to high schools with more students in the full
experimental sample--that is, high schools with some combination of larger enrollment counts, a
larger proportion of lower-SES students, and a larger proportion of students who are Common
Application users. However, when we compare the full experimental sample and the NSC sample
on observable student characteristics, the two samples are quite similar (see Table 2). For instance,
both samples are approximately 60 percent female, 65 percent first in their family to go to college,



                                                 13
and 43 percent used a means-tested fee waiver to submit applications through the Common
Application.


Large State
     Our empirical strategy is very similar for the Large State intervention. We run regressions of
the form:
                                  = 0 + 1  +   +                                                            (3)


     Where  is an outcome for student  ,  is an indicator for a student being assigned
any treatment,  is a vector of student controls including indicators for parent education, self-
reported family income, age at application, gender, and race. We sometimes separate 
into indicators to test if messages that contained infographics had a different effect from text-based
content or early versus on-time information. All regressions also control for the level of
stratification which is what school types a student applied to. Robust standard errors are presented.
We use administrative data from Large State to measure financial aid and enrollment outcomes.
These administrative data contain data from the universe of public higher education institutions in
the state. As we show in Table 3, the sample of rising first year students in Large State (the primary
sample we focus on in our analyses) is over 50 percent female, just over 30 percent of students'
mothers have a high school diploma or less, and 28 percent of the sample reports annual family
income below $80,000. 11


Results
We first present evidence of baseline equivalence and then present results on college enrollment
and persistence as well as financial aid receipt for the overall samples. Next, we discuss whether
the effects vary by student characteristics or variations in treatment. Consistently, we find no effect
of treatment.


Baseline equivalence


11
  We report slightly different measures of parental education level in the Large State than Common
Application based on the data available from each partner. Family income is missing for 47 percent of the
Large State sample.


                                                     14
We assess baseline equivalence by regressing student-level characteristics on indicators of
treatment; in the case of the Common Application, we also include high school by cohort fixed-
effects in these regression models, as this was the level of randomization. Tables 4 and 5 display
the results for the Common Application and Large State interventions, respectively. For the
Common Application, we present the results of these baseline equivalence tests for both the full
experimental sample and the NSC evaluation sample. Overall, we find that the sample is well
balanced on baseline covariates. There is one marginally significant difference in the Large State
sample in terms of age at application, which is to be expected given the number of tests. However,
the magnitude of this difference is extremely small. We also test baseline equivalence across
treatment variations, and find similar evidence of equivalence. 12


Financial aid, college enrollment, and persistence
In Tables 6 and 7 we present evidence of the Common Application (Table 6) and Large State
financial aid nudge campaign (Table 7) impacts on students' college enrollment, enrollment
quality, and persistence. In the Large State intervention, we are also able to report on the impact
of the intervention on a measure of students' FAFSA filing and financial aid receipt. These are
particularly useful because the intervention was specifically targeted to affect student's FAFSA
filing and financial aid packages.
     As we show in Table 6, students in the Common Application sample enroll in college at high
rates overall. Eighty-two percent of the control group enrolled in college in Fall 2016 and 73
percent enrolled at four-year institutions. The financial aid nudges had a precisely estimated zero
impact on overall enrollment or enrollment by institution level. Given the size of our sample we
can rule out impacts greater than half a percentage point. Persistence rates are similarly high among
the sample; 74 percent of students remained continuously enrolled into their second year of
college. We estimate precise zero impacts on continuous enrollment and can again rule out impacts
greater than half a percentage point. We also find little evidence that treatment of Common
Application students affected college application patterns or other measures of quality of college
students enrolled in (Appendix Table A2). 13

13
  In Appendix Table A1 we show that the Common Application nudge campaign also did not affect a range of
application outcomes, such as whether students applied to any colleges, the number of applications they submitted,
and the quality of institutions to which students applied. In Appendix Table A2 we consider a broader set of


                                                        15
    In Table 7 we present impacts on college enrollment for the Large State intervention. We do
not find impacts on our proxy for filing a FAFSA, Pell receipt, or loan amounts. We observe
enrollment outcomes in the spring semester following the intervention and then in the following
fall (2017-2018 academic year). We also observe a measure for whether students filed a FAFSA 14
for the academic year following the intervention, how much students received in Pell Grant
assistance, and how much students borrowed in loans. Relative to the Common Application
sample, overall enrollment rates for the Large State sample are lower. Fifty-four percent of students
enrolled in college in the first spring after the intervention and 49 percent enrolled in the first fall
after the intervention. We find no effect on enrollment overall in spring 2017 or at four-year
institutions, for which we can rule out impacts larger than one percentage point. The intervention
led to a modest 1.1 percentage point increase in enrollment at two-year institutions that is
statistically significant at the 10 percent level in the first spring. The effect on two-year enrollment
disappears in the next semester.
    We find no impact of the Large State intervention on enrollment in the first fall after the
intervention and we can rule out overall enrollment impacts greater than 1.3 percentage points. It
is not surprising that there are no effects on student enrollment given that the outreach was
designed to affect financial aid outcomes but did not actually change student's FAFSA filing or
financial aid packages. In Appendix Table A3 we show, similar to the Common Application
experiment, that the Large State intervention did not affect the quality of the institution attended. 15
A sizeable share of students engaged with the content--over 40 percent of the treated sample
responded to the text messages. This suggests that a lack of information about FAFSA completion
does not explain the null effects we observe--many students interacted with the information they
received.




enrollment quality measures for the Common Application sample. We find evidence that the intervention led to a
very small positive and significant increase, in the range of 0.5 percentage points, in the share of treated students
attending public institutions and institutions with net prices below $15,000/year. However, these impacts are too
small to be practically significant and we do not find evidence of impact on other quality measures, such as the mean
graduation rate, admission rate, or median SAT scores at institutions students attended.
14
   We do not observe FAFSA filing directly. Instead we know if students filed the FAFSA, received merit aid, or
filed the state-specific form for financial aid if they were enrolled. Because we find no effect on enrollment,
interpretation of this estimate is that among enrolled students, there was no change in the probability of filing the
FAFSA/state-specific form or receipt of merit aid.
15
   We report different institutional quality measures in the Common App and Large State experiments based
on data available from each partner.


                                                         16
Subgroup impacts
       While we find no effects overall, this could mask important heterogeneity in which students
are affected by treatment. For instance, students in the fall and winter versions of the Common
Application experiment could vary in their probability of enrolling due to differences in their
underlying characteristics or the timing of the information. In Appendix Table A4 we show that
the effect of the Common Application intervention did not vary by whether we enrolled students
in the outreach in the fall or winter of their senior year in high school.
       These types of interventions could also have heterogenous effects by measures of student
background. We consider heterogeneity by whether a student was a first-generation college
student, applied using a fee waiver, was female, had a high SAT score, or came from a high school
with high or low fractions of free and reduced-price lunch. In Appendix Table A5 (Common
Application) we largely estimate null impacts for each subgroup, and for the few subgroups for
whom we obtain significant (yet small in terms of magnitude) results, we do not find consistent
patterns of impacts across outcomes. In no case do the subgroup estimates rise above one
percentage point in magnitude. Appendix Table A6 similarly shows no difference in the impact of
the Large State intervention across subgroups including first generation in college, gender, and
low-income students.
       In Table 8 we show results of the Large State interventions for the other cohorts of students
with whom we intervened--current college students, students who had applied but not enrolled in
college, and students who earned substantial credits but withdrew prior to a degree. We find no
impacts of the intervention for any of these students.
       One advantage of our study is that we can look at many different subgroups, many of which
include groups of students who have been found to benefit in previous interventions. We find that
irrespective of time in the college application/enrollment process and student characteristics, our
interventions had no impact.


Treatment variations
       In Tables 9, 10, and 11 we present estimates of whether the impact of the Common
Application and Large State interventions varied based on the treatment variations we tested. In
Table 9 we investigate whether impacts of the Common Application intervention on college
enrollment and enrollment quality varied by how we framed the financial aid nudge content.



                                                  17
Overall, we do not find meaningful differences in outcomes across content frames. There are some
outcomes for which the financial benefit or planning content frame estimates are statistically
significant, but in almost all cases the magnitude of these impacts relative to the control mean is
less than one percent. Relative to the information-only content frame treatment arms, the point
estimates on the advising intervention are slightly larger and because this intervention arm only
had ~2,000 students, the confidence intervals are wider. For instance, we cannot rule out impacts
in the 2-3 percentage point range for advising on whether students enrolled in college in the first
fall after the intervention. Even these impacts would still be modest, but in line with the impacts
of other text-supported advising interventions (e.g., Castleman and Page, 2017).
       In Table 10 we present evidence that compares receiving the information as text or as an
infographic relative to no information. We find no difference in whether students enrolled or the
sector that they enrolled in. We also find no effects on financial aid outcomes based on how we
present information to students. For students who were enrolled at four-year institutions, we varied
whether students received the information early or late; these results are presented in Panel B of
Table 10. There was no effect on overall enrollment but perhaps a shift from two-year enrollment
to four-year enrollment. It also appears that early text messages may have had a very modest effect
on our proxy for filing a FAFSA but this result is marginally statistically significant.
       In Table 11 we test whether impacts of the Common Application intervention varied based
on how we delivered content to students. We do not find consistent differences in impact across
delivery method, and in no case do the impacts associated with a particular delivery method or
combination of methods exceed a percentage point in magnitude.


Discussion
       Despite substantial and growing interest in behavioral science interventions in education
at various levels of government, we currently have little evidence about whether nudge
interventions that have generated positive impacts on postsecondary outcomes at a local level can
be scaled and maintain efficacy. We also have little evidence about the specific mechanisms
underlying the positive impacts of promising smaller-scale nudges. Organizations, policymakers,
and researchers seeking to scale nudge interventions can do so via two primary pathways: one is a
global approach, partnering with a state or national organization to reach out to large numbers of




                                                 18
students, while another is a local approach that consists of partnering with many local
organizations.
       Leveraging both statewide and nationwide large-scale experiments with a collective
sample of over 800,000 students, we find no effect of a global approach to scaling financial aid
nudges on students' financial aid receipt, college enrollment, or college persistence. Our study
contributes to a small body of recent research that demonstrates that large-scale information and
nudge interventions have little effect on students' college or financial aid outcomes (Bergman, et
al. 2019; Bettinger et al., 2012; Gurantz et al. 2019; Hyman 2018).
       A natural question is why these interventions failed to improve postsecondary outcomes
when smaller scale interventions led to increased college enrollment and persistence? Given the
nature of our experiments we can rule out several hypotheses. First, our lack of positive impacts
was not due to the delivery method. Students were randomly assigned to different combinations
of physical mailers, text messages, and emails, and none of the combinations of channels had any
effect. Second, we do not find evidence that nudges at scale are effective for a wide range of
specific student populations who are at various stages of the college-going and completion process.
Many previous nudge interventions, including large-scale campaigns, have focused on college-
intending or high-achieving students (e.g., Castleman and Page, 2015, 2016a; Gurantz et al., 2019;
Hoxby & Turner, 2013; Hyman, Forthcoming), as shown in the descriptions of sample populations
from prior studies in Table 1. Our experiments included students with high baseline college-going
rates (Common Application) and low baseline college-going rates (Large State intervention). Prior
experiments have also demonstrated that low-touch interventions can lead to improved
postsecondary outcomes for students earlier in the college application process (e.g., Hoxby and
Turner, 2013) as well as for students much later in the process (e.g., Carrell and Sacerdote, 2017;
Castleman and Page, 2015). In the Large State intervention we targeted groups of students at
various stages of college-going and completion: rising freshmen, currently enrolled students,
students who applied but did not enroll in college, and students who completed substantial credits
but who withdrew prior to a degree. We find no impact for any of these populations.
       Third, we find little evidence to support that the way content is framed affects whether
financial aid nudges are effective. We did not test every possible version of behaviorally informed
content, but we find no difference in aid receipt or enrollment based on several different
approaches to frame intervention content. One channel we cannot rule out as definitively is the



                                                19
importance of making one-on-one advising available to students. While we do not find significant
positive effects of offering students in the Common Application sample the opportunity to connect
via text with an advisor, our confidence intervals include impacts (2-3 pp) of a similar magnitude
that more local interventions have found from text-based nudge approaches. Additionally, the
take-up rate of the offer of advising was much smaller in our Common Application intervention
compared with prior efforts, with only 11.6 percent of students ever responding to a text message
(Table A6). Take up could be lower for a number of reasons but it seems likely that the more
distant relationship between the Common Application and students as compared to earlier studies
may have played a role. The possibility that large-scale nudging with the option of two-way
advising could have a positive impact is broadly consistent with the body of research on nudge
interventions in postsecondary education summarized in Table 1: campaigns that offer two-way
interaction tend to be more likely to influence students' college decisions than those that facilitate
one-on-one connections to a counselor, advisor, or mentor. Yet from a feasibility perspective, it
would be challenging for a large organization like the Common Application to staff a sufficient
number of advisors to provide meaningful two-way advising to hundreds of thousands of students.
          Having ruled out several potential explanations for why the large-scale nudges were not
effective, we offer several possibilities for why interventions that worked at a local level may not
effectively scale up. First, if participants infer that an intervention is delivered broadly, the salience
and value of the campaign for any one recipient may be diluted. In the context of our study,
students presumably had a weaker connection to the Common Application and the Large State
partner than they presumably did to smaller, community-based organizations that were the
ostensible message sender in many prior interventions. Second, the messages were primarily
generic and one-way, one of the limitations of a global approach to scale, so students may very
quickly have concluded that they were receiving the same outreach as many other students. The
lack of a more direct relationship with the sender and the generic nature of outreach could both
explain our lack of impacts. A parallel large-scale texting campaign conducted by Avery et al. (in
progress) should lend interesting insight into this hypothesis, since their project features both a
national level intervention administered by an organization with whom students had a tenuous
connection and a school-level intervention administered by specific counselors at students' high
school.




                                                   20
       Despite the null effects in the aggregate, several implications emerge from our work. First,
our results suggest that a more effective path to scale may depend on increasing the number of
local institutions implementing evidence-based campaigns. While scaling interventions locally is
a costlier and more labor-intensive approach to scale, by maintaining a stronger connection to
students as recipients, the sustenance of positive impacts could justify greater costs. Advances in
data science and technology also hold promise to improve large-scale outreach efforts, in either
global or local scale up approaches. Chiefly, supplemental data could be leveraged to develop
microtargeted nudges, following practices used in other social marketing contexts (Metcalf et al.
2018). Similarly, data could be leveraged to provide higher degrees of personalization and ensure
that recipients recognize the relevance of the outreach they receive.
       Nudge interventions in higher education have the promise of affordable scalability. We test
whether the effects scale across a range of samples, settings, information framings, delivery
method, and one-on-one help using a global approach by partnering with statewide and nationwide
organizations to reach more than 800,000 students. We find no impact in any of these settings
despite having similar content and even similar researchers working on these projects. We cannot
isolate exactly why our interventions did not work, but it seems like the relationship between the
student and the source of the nudge matters. Future work may be able to test this explicitly and
advance our understanding of when nudges work.

Notes: We include studies of nudge and informational interventions that focus on helping high school and current college students navigate college decisions. Unless indicted by an asterisk, all
studies are randomized controlled trials. We exclude studies that involve informational interventions in earlier grades that focus on shaping students' college expectations and/or persistence in
primary and secondary education (e.g., Dinkleman and Martinez, 2014; Jensen, 2010; McGuigan, McNally, & Wyness, 2016; Nguyen, 2008). Studies are ordered by stage in the college-going
process (earliest to latest) and then with most recent studies listed first. See Castleman (2017), Castleman et al. (2017), French and Oreopoulos (2017), Lavecchia, Liu, and Oreopoulos (2014), and
Meyer and Rosinger (2019) for additional reviews and discussions of these and other studies).

Enrollment in Fall immediately after intervention (Fall 2016) or enrollment in following Fall (Fall 2017) enrollment
is defined as whether the student was enrolled as of October 1st, 2016 (2017). Continuous enrollment is defined as
enrollment in Fall 2016, Spring 2017, and Fall 2017. Spring 2017 enrollment is defined as whether the student was
enrolled as of March 1st, 2017. * p < 0.1 ** p < 0.05. *** p < 0.01

Messages were sent in Fall 2016, some outcomes are measured then, "1st Spring after
intervention ". "First Fall after intervention" refers to the Fall of 2017 which was the
first semester after the messages were sent. Different treatment arms are represented
including "content" which was text-based information and "media" which conveyed
the same information using graphics. "Early Treatment" was receiving the messages
before students could file the FAFSA while "Late Treatment" received messages just
after the filing window. * p < 0.1 ** p < 0.05. *** p < 0.1

Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are clustered at the high school x cohort level. We construct college application outcomes
using student x application level data provided by the Common App, which includes all applications submitted as of approximately June
2016. We merge in IPEDS data on net price, graduation rate, admission rate, and median SAT score of incoming course to construct
these measures. We also tested other cut-points for the college quality measures in columns (5)-(8) (e.g. net price below $20,000); we
also tested other college quality measures such as 3-year cohort default rate, instructional expenditures above certain amounts, net-price
for low-income students. We find the same pattern of results for these alternative measures. * p < 0.1 ** p < 0.05. *** p < 0.1

Notes: Each column show the results from a separate student-level regression of the specified outcome on an indicator for any
experimental treatment; an interaction between the treatment indicator and an indicator for the student characteristic of interest; high
school x cohort (Fall or Winter) fixed effects; and the student-level characteristics shown in Table 2. Heteroskedasticity robust standard

Notes: Each column show the results from a separate student-level regression of the
specified outcome on an indicator for any experimental treatment and treatment interacted
with a student characteristic of interest. We also control for indicators for parent
education, self-reported family income, gender, type of school applied to, and race as well
as age at application. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are in parenthesis. We
construct the enrollment and financial aid outcomes using administrative data from Large
State. Messages were sent in Fall 2016, some outcomes are measured then, "1st Spring
after intervention ". "First Fall after intervention" refers to the Fall of 2017 which was the
first semester after the messages were sent.. * p < 0.1 ** p < 0.05. *** p < 0.01

Notes: See Appendix A for an explanation of the issue with text delivery. Students were able to opt out of receiving subsequent messages at any time by
responding with a keyword such as "STOP". The percent of students who ever responded includes students who only ever responded to opt out. Conversation
length includes messages sent by both the student and the advisor (if in the Advising group), but does not include the original program messages.
