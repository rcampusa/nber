                                              ABSTRACT

We study a model where some agents have private information about risky asset returns and trade
to obtain capital gains, while others acquire the risky asset and hold it to maturity, forming expectations
of returns based on market prices. We show that under such a structure, in addition to fully revealing
rational expectations equilibria, there exists a continuum of equilibrium prices consistent with rational
expectations, where the the asset prices are subject to sunspot shocks. Such sunspot shocks can generate
persistent fluctuations in asset prices that look like a random walk in an efficient market.

1        Introduction
The e¢ cient markets hypothesis states that prices on traded assets re‡ect all publicly available
information. In their classic work Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) discussed a model where agents
can obtain private information about asset returns and can trade on the basis of that information.
If however the rational expectations equilibrium price reveals the information about the asset, and
if information collection is costly, then agents have no incentive to collect the information before
they observe the price and trade. But then prices no longer re‡ect the information about the asset,
and markets are no longer e¢ cient. Since then a large empirical and theoretical literature has
explored the informational e¢ ciency of markets under private information.1
        We study the possibility of multiple rational expectations sunspot equilibria driven by non-
fundamentals in asset markets with private information by introducing a simple time dimension
to markets where agents trade sequentially. In our simplest benchmark model short term traders

have noisy information about the return or dividend yield of the asset, but hold and trade the asset
before its return is realized at maturity. The returns to short-term traders consist of capital gains.
Investors, on the other hand, who may not have private information about the returns or dividend
yields, but can observe past and current prices, purchase and hold the asset for its …nal dividend
return. While we do not impose constraints on borrowing, asset holdings, or short-selling,2 we
exclude traders that have private information on dividends from holding the risky asset all the way
from its inception at time 0 to its maturity when terminal dividends are paid.3 We show that under
such a market structure, in addition to equilibria where equilibrium prices fully reveal asset returns
as in Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), there also exists a continuum of equilibria with prices driven by
sunspot shocks. These equilibria are fully consistent with rational expectations and they are not
randomizations over multiple fundamental equilibria. Furthermore the sunspot or sentiment shocks
generate persistent ‡uctuations in the price of the risky asset that look to the econometrician like
a random walk in an e¢ cient market driven by fundamentals.4
    In the next two sections we start with a simple three period model and derive results on the
fundamental and the sunspot equilibria of our model, and we discuss the intuition for our results.
In section 4 we study more general information and signal structures to show that our results
are robust to such generalizations. We relax the assumption that all short-term traders perfectly
observe the same sunspot and allow them to observe private sunspot or sentiment signals that are
correlated. We show that our results in the benchmark model carry over in this case. We then also
allow the long-term investors to receive private signals on the dividend and on sunspot shocks that
can be correlated with the signal of short term traders. We show that the sunspot or sentiment
driven equilibria are robust to this generalized information structure. In Section 5 we allow long
term investors to also trade in the initial period, and to obtain private signals on dividends and
sunspots, which again can be correlated with the signals of short term traders. We show that we
can still have a continuum of sunspot equilibria in this context, and that our results are not driven
by a market structure that excludes long-term investors from trading in period 0.
    In section 6 we introduce multiple assets and show that the co-movement of asset prices in
excess of co-movements in fundamentals can be explained by our sunspot equilibria. In section 7
we extend our model to multiple periods. We show that asset prices under the sunspot equilibria
exhibit random walk behavior even though the asset prices are not purely driven by fundamentals.
Finally to put our results in context, in Section 8 we brie‡y discuss, without attempting to be

beliefs about terminal returns, but where short-selling constraints rule out unbounded trades.

     This or similar kinds of market structures, involving short-term traders and longer term investors have been
widely used, for example in Cass and Shell (1983), Allen and Gorton (1993), Allen, Morris and Shin (2006), or in
Angeletos, Lorenzoni and Pavan (2010) where entrepreneurs sell their investments to traders. See our discussion in
Section 8.

comprehensive, some papers in the literature with models and results that are closely related to
ours.
   We should also emphasize that we have deliberately not introduced any noise traders or im-
perfectly observed stochastic asset supplies, often used in the literature on asset prices to prevent
prices from being perfectly revealing. Therefore the continuum of sunspot equilibria that we obtain
in our model are not related to noise traders in any way.


2       The Model
We start with a three period benchmark model with a continuum of short-term traders and long-
term investors. We index the short-term trader by j and the long-term investor by i. In period 0
there is a continuum of short-term traders of unit mass endowed with 1 unit of an asset, a Lucas
tree. This tree yields a dividend D in period 2. We assume that

                                                    log D = :                                                     (1)

                                                                          1 2                        2.
where     is drawn from a normal distribution with mean of                2     and variance of           Each trader
in period 0 is a short-term trader who receives utility in period 1 and therefore sells the asset in
period 1 before D is realized in period 2: This short-term trader, maybe because he is involved in
creating and structuring the asset, receives a signal sj

                                                    sj = + ej                                                     (2)

where ej has a normal distribution with mean of 0 and variance of                         2.   We assume that ej is
                                                                                          e

independent of . So the short-term trader j in period 0 solves

                                                max E[Cj1 jP0 ; sj ]                                              (3)
                                               xj0;Bj0


with the budget constraints
                                             P0 xj0 + Bj0 = P0 + w:                                               (4)

                                               Cj1 = P1 xj0 + Bj0:                                                (5)

where w is his endowment or labor income, xj0 is the quantity of the asset and Bj0 is a safe bond
that he carries over to period 1: We assume that there is no restriction on Bj0 . Therefore using the
budget constraint we can rewrite the short-term trader i’s problem as5

                                     max       E[P0 + w + (P1        P0 )xj0 jP0 ; sj ]                           (6)
                                xj0 2( 1;+1)

    5
    Note that we are not restricting the domains of xj0 2 ( 1; +1) and xi0 2 ( 1; +1) ; so in principle traders
and investors may choose unbounded trades in the risky asset. This of course will be impossible in equilibrium since
the asset supply x = 1: Alternatively we could constrain trades so xj0 ; xi0 2 ( Bl ; Bh ) ; Bl ; Bh > 0; with results
una¤ected for Bl ; Bh 1 for example.


                                                          3
    There is a continuum of investors of unit mass in period 1 who trade with the short-term traders.
Each of them is also endowed with w and enjoys consumption in period 2 when the dividend D is
realized. These investors solve a similar problem, but have no direct information about the dividend
of the Lucas tree, except through the prices they observe. Hence an investor i in period 1, solves

                                           max E[Ci2 jP0 ; P1 ]                                     (7)
                                           xi1;Bi1


with the budget constraints
                                            P1 xi1 + Bi1 = w                                        (8)

                                           Ci2 = Dxi1 + Bi1:                                        (9)

where w is his endowment, xi1 is their asset purchase, and Bi1 is his bond holdings carried over to
period 2: Similarly the objective function (7) can be written as

                                   max        E[w + (D        P1 )xi1 jP0 ; P1 ];                  (10)
                               xi1 2( 1;+1)


after substituting out Bi1 from the budget constraints.


3    Equilibrium

An equilibrium is a pair of price {P0 ; P1 } such that xj0 solves problem (6) and xi1 solves problem
(10), and markets clear. Formally we de…ne our equilibrium concept below.

De…nition 1 An equilibrium is an individual portfolio choices xj0 = x(P0 ; sj ) for the short-term
traders in period 0, xi1 = y(P0 ; P1 ) for the long-term investors in period 1, and two price functions
{P0 = P0 ( ); P1 = P1 ( )} that jointly satisfy market clearing and individual optimization,
                                       Z                  Z
                                           xj0 dj = 1 =        xi1 di;                             (11)


                                            P0 = E[P1 jP0 ; sj ]                                   (12)

for all sj = + ej , and
                                           P1 = E [DjP0 ; P1 ] ;                                   (13)

where expectations are Bayesian optimal.

    Equation (11) gives market clearing, (12) gives the …rst order conditions for an interior optimum
for the short term trader, and Equation (13), the …rst order condition for the long term investors,
says that the price that the long term investor is willing to pay is equal to their Bayesian updating of

                                                     4
the dividend. Under these interior …rst order conditions our risk-neutral agents are indi¤erent about
the amount of the asset they carry over, so for simplicity we may assume a symmetric equilibrium
with xi0 = x = 1; and xi1 = x = 1. Hence the market clearing condition (11) holds automatically.
In what follows, we only need to check equations (12) and (13) to verify an equilibrium.

Proposition 1 P0 = P1 = exp( ) is always an equilibrium.
Proof. The proof is straightforward. It is easy to check that both (12) and (13) are satis…ed.

   In this case, the market price fully reveals the fundamental values. Whatever their individual
signal, traders in period 0 will be happy to trade at P0 = exp( ); which reveals the dividend to
investors in period 1: Even though each trader j in period 0 gets a noisy private signal sj about ,
which may be high or low, these traders act as if they ignore their signal. In maximizing their utility
they only care about the price at which they can sell next period. If each short term trader believes
the price in the next period depends on , competition in period 0 will then drive the market price
exactly to exp( ). For a given market price, the expected payo¤ of holding one additional asset
will be E f[exp( )   P0 ] jP0 ; sj g. As long as log P0 6= , traders with low signals would want to
short the risky asset while other traders with high signals would want to go long on the risky asset.
An equilibrium can only be reached when the market price has e¢ ciently aggregated all private
information in such a way that idiosyncratic signals cannot provide any additional pro…ts based on
                                      R
private information: namely log P0 = sj dj = : Since price fully reveals the dividend, the long
term investors will be happy to pay log P1 =     in the next period.
   There is however a second equilibrium where the market price reveals no information about
dividends.

Proposition 2 P0 = P1 = 1 is always an equilibrium.
Proof. Both (12) and (13) are satis…ed. It is clear that with P0 = P1 = 1, investors in period 1
obtain no information about the dividend as the prices simply re‡ect the unconditional expectation
of the dividends in period 2.

   Again in the above equilibrium, the short-term traders "optimally" ignore their private signals.
If the short-term traders believe that the price in the next period is independent from , then their
private signal sj is no long relevant for their payo¤, and these signals become irrelevant.


3.1   Sentiment-Driven Equilibria

We now assume the traders in period 0 also receive some sentiment or sunspot shock z which they
believe will drive prices. We are assume that z has a standard normal distribution. We de…ne an



                                                  5
sentiment-driven equilibrium as follows.6

De…nition 2 An sentiment-driven equilibrium is given by optimal portfolio choices xj0 = x(P0 ; sj ; z)
for the short-term trader in period 0, xi1 = y(P0 ; P1 ) for the long-term investors in period 1, and
two price functions {P0 = P0 ( ; z); P1 = P1 ( ; z)} that jointly satisfy market clearing and individual
optimization,
                                              Z                        Z
                                                  xj0 dj = 1 =             xi1 di;                                          (14)

                                                  P0 = E[P1 jP0 ; sj ; z]                                                   (15)

for all sj = + ej and z, and
                                                  P1 = E [DjP0 ; P1 ] ;                                                     (16)

where expectations are Bayesian optimal.

    As in the section (3), equation (14) gives market clearing, (15) gives the …rst order conditions
for an interior optimum for the short term trader and Equation (16), the …rst order condition for
the long term investors, says that the price that the long term investor is willing to pay is equal to
their conditional expectation of the dividend.

                                                                                                                            1 2
Proposition 3 There exists an continuum of sentiment driven equilibria indexed by 0                                    z    4   ,
with xi0 = 1 = xj1 and the prices in two periods given by

                                          log P1 = log P0 =                 +   z z;                                        (17)

where

      The equilibria may be simply de…ned in the context of a Bayesian game where players are the short-term traders
j 2 J = [0; 1] and long-term investors i 2 I = [0; 1] , where each player is endowed with w > 0: Each short term
trader is also endowed with one unit of the risky asset x = 1. The action spaces can be taken as xj0 2 [ Bl ; Bh ] = B
for short-term traders and xj0 2 [ Bl ; Bh ] = B for the long-term investors where Bl ; Bh > 0; and where in the paper
we take Bl = Bh = 1: (Of course in equilibrium the aggregate asset supply must be x = 1 so unbounded trades
are impossible:) The states of the world S =       ; z; f"j gj2[0;1]   are realizations of   ; z; f"j gj2[0;1]   according to the

Proof. Note that since the prices are the same in both periods, (15) is satis…ed automatically. We
only need to check if equation (16) is satis…ed. Taking the log of equation (16) generates:

                          log P1 =       +       zz                                                         (19)

                                  = log Efexp( j               +           z z)g;

which follows from the property of the normal distribution. Comparing terms, coe¢ cients of                   +
 zz   yields
                                                       2
                                                 2 2           2

                                                       +       z

Solving equation (20) yields the expression of           in equation (18).
      In this case traders in period 0 get a common sunspot shock z. The investors in period 1; in
forming their expectation of D conditional on the prices, believe prices are a¤ected by the sunspot
z; as in equation 19. However now they have a signal extraction problem in distinguishing                   from
z. Their …rst order conditions will be satis…ed in equilibrium provided the variance of z lies within
the interval given in Proposition 3, generating a continuum of sunspot equilibria indexed by                  2.
                                                                                                              z
For example, a low z will induce pessimistic expectations for the period 0 trader, who will pay a
low price for the asset and expect a low price next period. The investor in period 1 will observe
the period 0 price and infer that in part, this must be due to a low dividend yield, which will lead
him to also pay a low price in period 1, thus con…rming the expectations of the period 0 trader.
Of course for this to be possible for every realization of the sunspot z; the variance of z that enters
the signal extraction problem of the investor in period 1 must lie in the interval given in the above
Proposition.
      We can understand the intuition behind the multiplicity by analogy to the Keynesian Beauty
Contest put in the context informational asymmetries and correlated signals. Note that the multi-
plicity of equilibria in our model does not hinge on the precision of signal sj . We may, for simplicity,
assume that sj = , so the short term investors are assumed to know the dividend for sure. The
price revealing equilibrium in this case would be log P0 = log P1 = . As in the Keynesian Beauty
Contest however, even though short-term traders’ own view of the true value of stock (the divi-
dend) is equal to , this does not matter to them. If the other short term traders think the price

                                                           7
is di¤erent from , a short term trader will still be willing to accept such a price as long as he
can sell it in the next period at the same price. So any price can support an equilibrium from the
short term trader’s point of view. However, a price can only be an equilibrium price if the long
term investors are willing to trade the asset at such a price. In order for a rational expectation
sunspot equilibrium to exist, the price has to re‡ect the fundamental dividend value               with noise
in such a way that the Bayesian updating of the fundamental dividend value                 exactly equals the
market price. This gives a restriction on the coe¢ cient         and the variance of noise in the price rule
(19). The role of sunspots then is to correlate and coordinate the behavior of short term traders
so the investors, knowing the variance of sunspots and fundamentals; can optimally update their
expectation of the dividends that they will collect in equilibrium.
    In our three-period model the assumption that short term traders can not participate in period 2
trades is important. If the short term traders are allowed to trade in period 2, then the multiplicity
of equilibrium will disappear. In such a case if the price log P0 = log P1 < , then the short term
trader will opt to go long on the asset in period 1. The purchase of each additional unit of the
risky asset will increase his utility by exp( )    P1 > 0. Competition will then bring the price to
log P0 = log P1 = . Likewise any price (in logs) that is above           will induce the short term trader
to short the asset, forcing log P0 = log P1 =     in equilibrium.
    For the same reason in a multi-period context with periods t = 0; :::T + 1; such as in Section
7, for sunspots to exist we have to rule out traders that can hold risky assets all the way from
period 0 to maturity at T + 1: If the market price at any t di¤ers from such traders’expectations
of the terminal dividend ; they will be able to arbitrage the di¤erence by buying or short-selling
the asset, unless we explicitly introduce borrowing or short-selling constraints to prevent arbitrage.
    In the following sections we will relax the informational assumptions of our model and generalize
it to multiple assets and periods.


4    Alternative Information Structures
We examine the robustness of our results to alternative information structures. We …rst relax the
assumption that all short-term traders perfectly observe the same sunspot. Instead, we assume
that they observe private sunspots or sentiments that are correlated. Thus their sentiments are
heterogenous but correlated. We show that our results in the benchmark model carry over in this
case. We then also allow the investors to receive some private signal on the dividend and on sunspot
shocks. We show that the sunspot or sentiment driven equilibria are robust to this generalized
information structure. For expositional convenience, we denote           0   and   1   as the information sets
of a particular short-term trader and the investor, respectively. The equilibrium conditions can
then be written as
                                           P0 = E[P1 j    0 ];                                           (21)

We can now proceed to study alternative of the information sets                                        0   and    1:



4.1        Heterogenous but Correlated Sentiments

If each short-term trader receives a noisy sentiment or sunspot shock z, then the information set
 0   for a particular trader becomes                          0   = fP0 ; + ej ; z + "j g, where "j are drawn from a normal
distribution with mean of 0 and variance of                                   2   and cov(ej ; "j ) = 0. Note again the the sentiment
                                                                              "

or sunspot shocks are correlated across traders due to the common component z: Furthermore
 1       = fP0 ; P1 g is the same as in our benchmark model of the previous section. In this case,
equilibrium prices still take the form described in equation (17). Namely there exist an continuum
of sunspot equilibria indexed by the sunspot’s variance as in Proposition 3. It is easy to check
that (21) holds for any realization of ej and "j , hence the short-term trader’s …rst order conditions
hold. Since the information set                   1   is the same as in the benchmark model, equation (22) will be
automatically satis…ed. The market "e¢ ciently" washes out the noise "j . The intuition is similar to
the fully revealing equilibrium in the benchmark model. The market clearing condition must make
the agents ignore their private signal. Otherwise agents with a high realization of                                             + ej or z + "j
would go long on the assets while agents with low signals would keep shorting them, destroying the
market equilibrium. An equilibrium can be reached only if no agent has an incentive either to short
the asset or go long on it based on his own private information. In equilibrium the prices must
include all private information, so that given the market price no agent can gain any informational
advantage based on his own signals.


4.2        The Investors and Market Signals on the Dividend and on Sunspots

We …rst relax assumption that only the short-term investor receives information about the dividend
through a private signal. We allow both the short term trader and the investor to receive private
information on the dividend . We change the information set to                                             0   = fP0 ;   0   + ej ; z + "j g and
 1   = fP0 ; P1 ;        1   + vi g. Here sj0 =       0   + ej is the private signal on the dividend received by a trader
j in the …rst period, and si1 =                1 + vi     is the signal of the investor i in the second period. We assume
that cov( 0 ; ) > 0 and cov( 1 ; ) > 0; but cov( 0 ;                                  1)   = 0. For example,      =      0   + (1     ) 1 , with
0<            < 1, but cov( 0 ;        1)   = 0 satis…es these assumptions. Without loss of generality we assume
     =    0   +   1.   In addition, we assume that                        0   ( 1 ) are drawn from normal distribution with mean
         1 2           1 2                                2           2

Proof. The proof is similar to proposition (3). Plugging the expression of log P0 and log P1 into
(21), we obtain
                                                                                                        1

                                                                                                        2

Since     1   is independent of      0;   we have E ( 1 j                   0)   + 21 var( 1 j                 0)   =       1 2
                                                                                                                            2  1
                                                                                                                                       +   1 2
                                                                                                                                           2  1
                                                                                                                                                  = 0. Therefore
equation (21) is satis…ed for any trader j in period 0. We now turn to equation (22). Notice that
by studying the prices in the two periods, the investor can now learn                                                       1    with certainty. Hence we
have

      In this case, the market e¢ ciently aggregates the private information of long term investors.
The price in period 1 has to incorporate all the private information of the long term investors,
otherwise some investors with high/low signals on the underlying dividend would attempt to pro…t
by shorting/longing the assets. However, the period 1 price only partially incorporates the private
information of the short term traders regarding the underlying dividend. These short-term traders
bene…t only from potential capital gains, and are risk neutral. As long as the expected return

is equal to the risk free rate, they will not care whether the prices are driven by sunspots or by
fundamentals and sunspot equilibria will continue to exist.
         We now further generalize the information structure by allowing the investors to also receive
signals on the sunspots and as well as the dividends observed by the short term traders. We
assume that             =       0   +d+   1   and z = z0 + + z1 . The information set of the short term trader is
 0       = fP0 ;   0   + d + ej ; z0 + + "j g while the information set of the long term investors becomes
 1       = fP0 ; P1 ;    1      + d + vi ; z 1 + +         i g.   In other words, the private of signals of the short term
traders and investors are correlated. In particular we are now allowing the investors, just like the
short-term traders, to observe a noisy sunspot signal correlated with the sunspot signals received
by short-term traders. Here d and                         are common information both for short term traders and long
term investors.             0   and z0 however are in the private information sets of the short-term traders, and
the investors can only learn about them from observing the market price. We assume z0 ,                                 and z1
are drawn from standard normal distributions and                                 i   are drawn from a normal distribution with
mean of 0 and variance of                     2.   The equilibrium conditions are again given by (21) and (22). We
                                                                                                                    1 2

The proof is very similar to the that of Proposition 4 and hence is omitted.8 A conclusion we
can draw is that the market is in general not fully e¢ cient in aggregating the information of the
short-term traders, even if the investors receive sunspot and dividend signals correlated with the
private signals of short-term traders. As long as the short-term traders as a whole have some private
information, there exists sunspot equilibria.


5         Alternative Market Structures
In our benchmark model, only short term traders are present in period 0 market. We …rst relax
that assumption. Suppose now that both short term traders and long term investors are present in
period 0, but only long term investors are present in period 1. The short term traders maximize
     8
     As d is commonly observed by both the investors and traders, its distribution does not matter. We can assume
for example that d N ( 21 2d ; 2d ) .



                                                                        11
their expected payo¤ in period 1 and the long term investors maximize their expected payo¤ in
period 2. Let   0   denote the information set of a particular short term trader j. The short term
trader’s utility maximization problem is given by

                                  max        E[(P1       P0 ) xj0 + P0 + wj            0 ]:
                              xj0 2( 1;+1)


and the …rst order condition is
                                              P0 = E[P1 j        0]                                                               (31)

   The long term investors trade in both periods. Let xi0 , and xi1 be the asset holding of the
long term trader in period 0 and 1 respectively and let Bi0 and Bi1 be the bond holding of such
investors in period 0 and 1 respectively. The long term investors try to maximize their consumption
in period 2. Then the budget constraints for investor i are

                                    P0 xi0 + Bi0 = w
                                    P1 xi1 + Bi1 = P1 xi0 + Bi0 ;
                                                  Ci2 = Dxi1 + Bi1 ;

The long term investor’s problem can be solved recursively. Let                    0   and           1   denote the information
set of a particular investor i in period 0 and 1, respectively. Note that                                0        1.   Given xi0 and
Bi0 , the utility maximization problem of the long term investor in period 1 then becomes:

                              max        E f[P1 xi0 + Bi0 + (D              P1 )xi1 ] j       1g :
                          xi1 2( 1;+1)


Applying the law of iterated expectations and substituting out Bi0 by the budget constraint, we
can write the period 0’s problem as

                                    max       E f[(P1         P0 ) xi0 + w] j      0g :
                               xi0 2( 1;+1)


The …rst order conditions for investor i are

                                             P1 = E[Dj            1 ];                                                            (32)

                                             P0 = E[P1 j           0 ];                                                           (33)
                                                     R                R                              R
The asset market clearing conditions require             xj0 dj +         xi0 di = 1 and                 xi1 di = 1. We discuss
several cases below.
   Case 1: In the …rst case, we assume that only the short term trader has private information
regarding D and the sunspots. Namely          0   = [P0 ; + ej ; z + "j ],        0    = P0 and               1   = [P0 ; P1 ]. In this
case, Proposition (3) applies. It is easy to verify that log P1 = log P0 =                           +       zz   satis…es equations
(31), (32) and (33).

                                                         12
        Case 2: In this case, both the short term traders and the investors receive private information
on the dividends and the sunspot in period 0. As in section 4.2, we assume that log D =                                           0 + 1 +d

and that z = z0 + + z1 . We also assume that                      0   and z0 are private information to the short term
traders, while d and            are common information for both short term traders and investors. In other
words, the information for the short term trader in period 0 is                                    0   = [P0 ;   0   + d + ej ; z0 + + "j ],
while the long term investor’s information sets in period 0 and 1 are                                            0   = fP0 ; d + vi ; +   ig

and           = fP1 ;                   9

                                              log P1 =            0   +    z z0   +d+         1;                                       (35)

where         is given by
                                                                  s
                                                            1          1          2
                                                                                  z

                                                            2          4           0



Notice the price functions are exactly the same as in the section (4). In both cases, under the
equilibrium prices both short term traders and long term investors are indi¤erent between holding
stocks or bonds in period 0, and the long term investors are indi¤erent between holding stocks
or bonds in period 1. We can then assume that 0                               xj0 = x                  1, xi0 = 1        x and xi1 = 1 in
a symmetric equilibrium. Our results are therefore robust to incorporating investors with private
information in the early stages of trading.


6        Multiple Assets and Price Co-Movements

It is widely known that the traditional asset pricing models cannot explain why asset prices have
a high covariance relative to the covariance of their fundamentals. (See Pindyck and Rotemberg,
1993; Barberis, Shleifer and Wurgler, 2005, and Veldkamp (2006).10 ) In this section, we show that
asset prices driven by the sentiment or sunspot shocks can exhibit high co-movements even if their
underlying fundamentals are uncorrelated. The model is similar to the benchmark model above,
but with multiple assets. For simplicity we consider two assets, a and b. The two assets yield …nal
dividends in period 2 given by:
                                                      log D2` =   ` ; for   ` = a; b:                                                  (37)
    9
      Other information partitions for the long term investors, for example: 0 = fP0 ; d; z1 + + i g and 1 =
fP1 ; 1 + i g [ 0 can support the same equilibrium. We can also allow noisy information in 1 , for example
  0 = fP0 ; d + vi ; + i g and  1 = fP1 ; 1 + vi z1 + i g; to support the same equilibrium prices.
   10
      Veldkamp (2006) constructs a model with markets for information to explain asset price co-movements which we
discuss in Section 8.



                                                                  13
                                                                                                                      1 2
We assume that      `;   ` = a; b are drawn from same normal distribution with mean                                   2     and variance
of   2.   To highlight the co-movement, we assume that cov( a ;                                b)   = 0. For simplicity we consider
representative agents in each period. The trader in period 0 solves

                                           X
                                 max               fE[P1` j a ;     b ; P0a ; P0b ]           P0` g x0` ;                           (38)
                                x0a ;x0b
                                           `=a;b


where x0a ,x0b are the asset holdings of the trader for asset a and b, respectively. Here P1` and P0`
are the asset `0 s price in period 0 and 1. The investor in period 1 solves

                                             X
                               max                   fE[D2` jP1a ; P1b ; P0a ; P0b ]                    P1` g x1` ;                 (39)
                           x1a 2( 1;+1);
                           x1b 2( 1;+1) `=a;b


where x1` are are the asset holding of investor in period 1 for asset a and b. The …rst order
conditions are:

                                       P0` = E[P1` j a ;                b ; P0a ; P0b ];                                            (40)

                                       P1` = E[D2` jP1a ; P1b ; P0a ; P0b ]:                                                        (41)

Since the agents are risk neutral, they will be indi¤erent in buying the asset or not. We will focus
on the symmetric equilibrium again, namely an equilibrium with x0` = 1; x1` = 1 for ` = a and b:

Proposition 5 There exists a fully revealing equilibrium with log P0` = log P1` =                                      `.

Proof. The proof is straightforward.

     Notice that in the fully revealing equilibrium the correlation of asset prices is zero and there is
no co-movement of asset prices.

Proposition 6 There exists a continuum of equilibria with prices fully synchronized among assets.
The asset prices take the form

                                                                                                    1      2

Proof. Asset prices do not change in period 0 and 1. Hence equation (40) is satis…ed automatically.
We only need to insure equation (41) holds. Due to symmetry, it is su¢ cient to prove (41) holds

     The intuition for asset price co-movements is straightforward. The same traders trade the two
assets and therefore the asset prices will be determined by the same information set. If prices are
driven not only by fundamentals but also by sentiments, then the sentiment shocks of the traders
will drive both asset prices.
     It is straightforward to extend the information structure to allow any degree of co-movement.
For example, we can assume that the total dividend of asset ` is given by                                                                               ` +d`           and the information
sets are          0   = f   a   + da ;       b   + db ; P0a ; P0b ; zg and                         1       = fda ; db ; P0a ; P0b ; P1a ; P2b g. Here d` is the
common information of the dividend observed by both short term traders and long term investors.
We assume that cov(da ; db ) = 0 and                                2   = cov(da ; da ). Hence the total dividend of these two assets
                                                                    d
are not correlated. Then we can construct equilibria with prices

                                                                                                                                            2
                                            log P0` = log P1` = (                          a   +       b)      +           zz   +               + d` :                                      (46)
                                                                                                                                        2

where        and            are given by proposition (6). If                                           2       > 0, then the asset prices do not co-move
                        z                                                                              d

perfectly with each other. When                                2= 2     approaches in…nity, the correlation between the asset prices
                                                               d

becomes zero. Therefore we can always set the value of                                                                     2   to …t the observed covariance of asset
                                                                                                                           d

prices. Notice that if                  2= 2         increases, then the covariance of asset prices declines. This could be
                                        d
the result of a reduction in the information acquisition cost facing uninformed long term investors.
Legal reform on disclosure requirements for example can also produce more information for the
uninformed investors. Fox, Durnew, Morck and Yeung (2003) show that the enactment of new
disclosure requirements in December 1980 caused a decline in co-movements, consistent with our
theory.

                                                                                           15
7      Multi-Period Assets
We now extend our model to multiple periods. We show that the sentiment-driven asset prices look
like an e¢ cient market in the following sense: if an econometrician studies the asset data generated
by the sunspot equilibria, they will …nd that the asset prices movements will be a random walk
and not reject the e¢ cient market hypothesis.
      Suppose an asset created in period 0 yields a return or dividend only in period T + 1. Between
period 0 and T       1, a continuum of short term traders can trade the asset each period. Short term
traders in each period hold the asset only for making capital gains. As in in section 3 where there
are only three periods, given prices private signals that traders receive do not matter, so we focus
on a representative trader in each period. The …nal dividend is given by

                                                                     T
                                                                                   !
                                                                     X
                                             log DT +1 =                       t
                                                                        t=0


                                                                                                         1 2
Again we assume that        t   is drawn from a normal distribution with mean of                         2     and variance of
 2.    So the unconditional mean of DT +1 is given by 1. Denote the information set of traders in
period t = 0; 1; ::T as    t;   and their asset holding from period t to t + 1 as xt . Their maximization
problem can be written as
                                           max             [E (Pt+1 j     t)       Pt ] xt ;                               (47)
                                       xt 2( 1;+1)


for t = 0; 1; ::T   1. Investors who purchase the asset in period T solve

                                         max           [E (DT +1 j        T)        PT ] xT :                              (48)
                                     xT 2( 1;+1)


We assume short term traders in period t know                 t,   which may be interpreted as trader t’s the private
information regarding the …nal dividend of the underlying asset. Since all the agents observe the
past and current price, their information              t   is given by         t   = f t ; zt g [ f[t =0 P g, where zt are i.i.d
draws from the standard normal distribution representing sentiment shocks of traders born period
t as in our benchmark model.
      An equilibrium is a set of prices function fPt gTt=0 such that xt = 1 solves (47) for                      = 0; 1; ::T   1
and xT = 1 solves (48), where equilibrium conditions for individual optimization are given by

                                     E (Pt+1 j    t)   = Pt ; for t = 0; 1; ::T                1                           (49)

and
                                                 E (DT +1 j        T)   = PT :                                             (50)



                                                              16
                       P
Proposition 7 Pt = exp( t =0                  ) for t = 0; 1; :::T is always an equilibrium.
Proof. The proof is straightforward. The information of the past prices reveal the history of

                                             X                                 X
                                      exp(           ) = Et exp(                         +     t+1 )
                                              =0                                   =0

                                                                         t

So (49) is satis…ed for          = 0; 1; :::T       1, where we have utilized that fact Et exp(                           t+1 )   = 1. Finally
by construction, equation (50) is automatically satis…ed.

     In the above equilibrium, the price will eventually converge to the true fundamental price. The
market is dynamically e¢ cient in the sense that all private information is revealed sequentially

shock zt that they receive. We assume that                      t,   zt are only observed by the traders at t. We have
the following Proposition regarding equilibrium price.

Proof. We …rst prove that (53) holds. For the investor in period T                                         1, equation (49) requires

                        T
                        X1
                             (    +    zz    ) = log E [exp (log PT ) j                  T 1]

                                                      X1
                                                =           (        +        zz   ) + log E [exp(         T )j T 1 ] :                   (55)

Notice E [exp(    T )j T 1 ]   = 1. So the above requirement is satis…ed. We then prove that equation
(49) holds for t = 0; 1; 2; ::T        2. Given the price structure, the information set                                                     t   is now equivalent
to ~ t = fzt g [ f t g [ f         +   zz       gt =0
                                                    1
                                                      . Equation (49) can then be re-written as

                                                log Pt = log E[exp (log Pt+1 ) j ~ t ]:                                                                              (56)

Plugging in the expression of log Pt+1 , we obtain

(49) holds for t = 0; 1; 2; ::T        2. Finally for the investor of period T , we have

                                                              PT = E [DT +1 j                    T];                                                                 (58)

where    T   is equivalent to ~ T = f           T,   zT g[f                     +       zz   gT=01 , learned from observing past prices. No-

we now simplify the above equation to obtain equation (53).

    As in our benchmark model, the asset price only e¢ ciently incorporate the investors’informa-
tion. Prices are also driven by the sentiment of the short term traders. Note that equation (52)
implies that the asset price follows a random walk in the sentiment-driven equilibria. Although the

                                                                                 18
e¢ cient market hypothesis and the random walk of asset prices are not identical concepts, most
tests of EMH focus on the predictability of asset prices: if the market is e¢ cient then rational
investors will immediately react to informational advantages so that the pro…t opportunities are
eliminated. As a result, information will be fully revealed by asset prices, and all subsequent price
changes will only re‡ect new information. In other words, future asset prices are unpredictable.
Here we show that market e¢ ciency and unpredictability are not equivalent. If an econometrician
studies the asset price driven by the sentiment shocks in our model, he will conclude that asset
prices are unpredictable. Yet, the sentiment shocks can generate permanent deviations of asset
prices from their fundamental value.


8         Some Related Literature
To put our results in context we now brie‡y discuss some papers based on informational asymmetries
or restricted participation that are related to ours.
         The sunspot equilibria that we have considered are not randomizations over multiple fundamen-
tal equilibria. Instead they are related to the early sunspot results of Cass and Shell (1983).11 As
in our model, Cass and Shell (1983) have a …nite overlapping generations economy with a unique
fundamental equilibrium. There are two periods, uniform endowments and the agents have sepa-
rable utility functions de…ned over the two commodities. The consumers in the initial period are
born before the commonly observed sunspot activity is revealed, and can trade with each other on
the market for securities with payo¤s contingent on the outcome of the extrinsic random variable
determined by sunspot activity. There are also consumers born in the second period, after the
sunspot is realized. Both generations of traders can then trade commodities on the spot market.
In addition to the unique certainty equilibrium, Cass and Shell (1983) show the existence of a
sunspot equilibrium with the relative commodity prices driven by extrinsic uncertainty. This ratio-
nal expectations equilibrium arises from state contingent trades based on sunspot probabilities that
create wealth e¤ects. This mechanism di¤ers from ours where a continuum of sunspot equilibria
arise under private signals from the signal extraction problem as agents optimally disentangle the
price signal into the fundamental and sunspot components.12
         Allen, Morris and Shin (2006) also study a model structure similar to ours, with an overlapping
generations of traders who each live for two periods. A new generation of traders of unit measure is
born at each date t. When the traders are young, they receive a noisy signal about the liquidation
value of the asset at terminal time T; and they trade the asset to build up a position in the asset,
but do not consume. In the next period when they are old, they unwind their asset position
    11
    See their appendix.
    12
    Peck and Shell (1991) also show the existence of sunspot equilibria in a …nite economy with a unique fundamental
equilibrium by allowing non-Walrasian trades prior to trading on the post- sunspot spot markets.



                                                        19
to acquire the consumption good, consume, and die. The asset supply each period is stochastic
and unobserved, which prevents the equilibrium prices to reveal the terminal liquidation value.
Allen, Morris and Shin (2006) show that the law of iterated expectations for average expectations
each period can fail, so that market prices may be systematically lower than average expectations.
This only happens if the traders are risk averse and their signals are imprecise. With risk-neutral
short-term traders, prices again become fully revealing. Unlike our model where short-term traders
condition their portfolio decisions on both fundamental and sunspot signals that gives rise to
correlated actions, in Allen, Morris and Shin (2006) agents condition their trades on fundamentals
alone, so the issue of multiple sunspot equilibrium does not arise.
       Our results are closely related to the Angeletos, Lorenzoni and Pavan (2010), who explore a
related market structure where entrepreneurs are receive noisy private signals about the ultimate
return to their investments. Entrepreneurs are also aware that they are collectively subject to corre-
lated sentiments of market optimism or pessimism about investment returns. These sentiments are
embodied in a second correlated noisy signal that introduces non-fundamental noise into entrepre-
neurs’investment decisions. The traders buy the assets from entrepreneurs without observing their
signals, but they do observe the aggregate level of investment. This observation induces a signal
extraction problem for the traders as aggregate investment is now driven by the fundamentals of
investment returns as well as non-fundamentals. Angeletos, Lorenzoni and Pavan (2010) show that
the resulting correlated market sentiments can introduce ampli…cation of the noise on fundamen-
tals as well as self-ful…lling multiple equilibria. In such equilibria traders are willing to purchase
assets at "speculative" prices consistent with price expectations of entrepreneurs that di¤er from
expectations on fundamentals. The correlation in entrepreneurial investment decisions is similar to
the correlated decisions of the short and long term traders in our model. They are induced by the
sunspot driven prices and give rise to sunspot equilibria distinct from the price-revealing Grossman-
Stiglitz equilibrium. An essential component of the multiplicity therefore stems from the correlated
actions induced by non-fundamentals, yielding additional "correlated equilibria" as discussed earlier
by Aumann (1987), Aumann Peck and Shell (1988) and Maskin and Tirole (1987).13
       Other recent papers in the literature have also explored the role of informational asymmetries
and costly information to generate price movements that diverge from fundamentals in order to
explain market data, without incorporating non-fundamentals into the information structures of
markets that generate multiple rational expectations equilibria and sunspot ‡uctuations.
       For example, in Albagli, Hellwig and Tsyvinski (2011), prices diverge from expected dividends
from the perspective of an outside observer. Their model has noise traders as well as risk neutral
  13
     Maskin and Tirole (1987) study a simple …nite two period endowment economy with a unique equilibrium that
can yield additional sunspot equilibria under correlated private signals, provided one of the goods is inferior. Such
inferiority is not present in the models we consider. Benhabib, Wang and Wen (2012) also use the idea of correlated
signals arising via sunspots in the context of s to induce a continuum of equilibria in a Keynesian macroeconomic
model.

informed and uninformed traders facing limits on their asset positions. Under risk neutrality and
heterogenous beliefs driven by private signals, market clearing prices are determined by the marginal
trader whose noisy private signal makes her indi¤erent between trading or not. Thus ‡uctuations in
demand coming from realizations of fundamentals, or from noise traders, alters the identity of the
marginal investor. This drives a wedge between prices and expected returns from the perspective
of an outsider, and generates excess price volatility relative to fundamentals. The equilibrium is
nevertheless unique since, unlike our model, price expectations and investment decisions are not
conditioned on non-fundamentals or sunspots.
    Our results on the co-movement of asset prices in excess of the fundamentals are also related to
those of Veldkamp (2006) who introduces multiple assets with correlated payo¤s and information
markets into the model of Grossman and Stiglitz (1980). The stochastic supplies of risky assets
are unobserved and prevents prices from being fully revealing, as would also be the case in the
presence of noise traders. Introducing information markets creates strategic complementarities in
information acquisition. Since information is produced with both …xed and variable costs, as more
agents purchase the same information, the average cost of information is reduced. In such an
economy with increasing returns to information production, information producers will supply and
investors will purchase the signals that yield information on multiple assets. The co-movement is
produced as investors use a common subset of signals to predict the price of di¤erent assets. Unlike
our model, in Veldkamp (2006) there are no short term traders and the information obtained by
traders pertains only to fundamentals, so additional equilibria that can emerge when trader’s price
expectations can also depend on non-fundamental sunspots do not arise.


9     Conclusion
We study a market where sequential short term traders have private information and earn capital
gains by trading a risky asset before it yields dividends, while uninformed investors purchase the
asset for its dividend yield, forming expectations based on observed prices. In a rational expectation
equilibrium, prices based on fundamentals can reveal the information of private traders. However
we show that there are also rational expectations equilibria driven by sunspots. We show that our
results on sunspot equilibria are robust to a wide range of on informational assumptions and market
structures. If an econometrician studies the asset data generated by these sunspot equilibria, they
will …nd that the asset prices follow a random walk that look as if they are generated by an e¢ cient
market re‡ecting fundamental values.
    Our sentiment-driven asset prices under informational frictions are closely related to the recent
literature that examine sentiment-driven business cycles (see, for example, Angeletos and La’O
(2012) and Benhabib, Wang and Wen (2012)). The recent …nancial crisis suggests that asset

price movements can have considerable impact on macroeconomic ‡uctuations. Future work may
more closely explore the connections between sentiment-driven asset prices and macroeconomic
‡uctuations.
