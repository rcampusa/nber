                                             ABSTRACT

The controversies surrounding gun control policies have recently moved to the forefront of public’s
attention in the United States and elsewhere. Since 2005, eighteen states in the United States have
passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal
right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the
implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation
of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital
Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides and firearm injuries. We identify
the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states over
time. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in
the number of homicides among whites, especially white males. According to our estimates, between
28 and 33 additional white males are killed each month as a result of these laws. We find no consistent
evidence to suggest that these laws increase homicides among blacks. Auxiliary analysis using data
from the Supplemental Homicide Reports indicates that our results are not driven by the killings of
assailants. We also find that the stand your ground laws are not related to non-homicide deaths, which
should not respond to gun laws. Finally, we analyze data from the Health Care Utilization Project
to show that these laws are also associated with a significant increase in emergency room visits and
hospital discharges related to firearm inflicted injuries. Taken together, these findings raise serious
doubts against the argument that Stand Your Ground laws make public safer.

I. Introduction

         A number of shooting tragedies have reignited the debate on gun rights and gun

control policies in the United States and Europe recently.                      One particular incident

occurred on February 26, 2012 when a seventeen year old was fatally shot by a

community watch coordinator for a gated community in Sanford, Florida in the United

States.1 Based on preliminary physical evidence and the testimony provided by the

teenager’s shooter that he had acted in self-defense, the police department did not pursue

criminal prosecution against him, at least initially, under the Florida’s statute on

justifiable use of force.2 The circumstances that triggered the shooting and the initial

decision not to charge Zimmerman have prompted tremendous media coverage and

public attention and moved a wave of self-defense statutes recently introduced by states

to the forefront of jurisprudence and policy debates. These new statutes, which are also

known as Stand Your Ground (SYG) laws, allow individuals to use force, including lethal

force, in self-defense when there is reasonable belief of a threat, without having any duty

to retreat first. 3

         Historically, the right to defend one’s home against intruders without a duty to

retreat is well-protected by the principle of “Castle Doctrine” in the United States.

1
  Other high profile recent examples include the massacre at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
  University in the U.S. in 2007 that killed 32 people, the Norway massacre in 2011 that claimed 77 lives,
  and most recently, the movie theatre shooting in Colorado, United States in 2012, which killed 12
  individuals.
2
  Although many of the facts surrounding the case are still unknown to the public, at the time of his death
Trayvon did not have a weapon, but instead he was carrying a bag of candy and an iced tea back home.
George Zimmerman was eventually arrested and charged with second-degree murder and is currently
awaiting trial.
3
  According to Statute 776.013, which took effect on October 1, 2005, “(3) A person who is not engaged in
an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to
retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or
she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself
or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.” See

                                                      3
Rooted in the notion that “a man’s home is his castle”, this principle, recognized by

common law, held an exception to the duty to retreat first when an individual faced an

attack in his home.4 The key difference in this new wave of laws is that they have

extended the Castle Doctrine to apply to places outside the home, such as a vehicle,

workplace, or anywhere else an individual has a legal right to be, and thus have

diminished or eliminated the long-standing duty to retreat. Since Florida introduced its

SYG law in 2005, another seventeen states have passed some version of a SYG law that

contains language granting immunity from criminal prosecution to individuals using

defensive or deadly force to venues beyond homes.5

         With a strong backing by the National Rifle Association (NRA), proponents of the

SYG laws argue that they would have a deterrent effect on crime. They also contend that

law-abiding citizens must be able to protect themselves from intruders and attackers

without having to worry about criminal or civil penalties before taking action in self-

defense. Reflected in this argument is a diminished sense of confidence in the criminal

justice system’s ability to protect victims and the perceived discrepancy in the judicial

system that emphasizes the due process rights of defendants over the rights of victims

(Jansen and Nugent-Borakove, 2007).6 It has also been suggested that increased concerns

about public safety in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. in September 2001

  These states include Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,
Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and
West Virginia. See Table 1 for more information.

  Following the passage of Florida’s law, the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) - the lobbying arm of the
NRA - wrote “Without doubt, Florida's recently enacted "Castle Doctrine" law is good law, casting a
common-sense light onto the debate over the right of self-defense. It reverses the pendulum that for too
long has swung in the direction of protecting the rights of criminals over the rights of their victims.” (NRA-
ILA, 2006).

and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 have played a role in the spread of SYG laws (Jansen and

Nugent-Borakove, 2007).

       Opponents, on the other hand, claim that these laws give too much freedom to

private citizens to use deadly force, almost making them a license to kill rather than a

protective measure (Megale, 2010; Kleindienst, 2005). It has been argued that these laws

are open to abuses by those engaged in illegal activities or those with criminal records

and may lead to an increased number of people carrying guns and willing to use them

(Formby, 2006; Weaver, 2008; Jansen and Nugent-Borakove, 2007). Along similar lines,

it has been suggested that these laws could embolden individuals to stand their ground

rather than simply walk away and could lead to individuals resorting to the use of deadly

weapons even during situations posing no imminent danger (Weaver, 2008; Florida Stand

Your Ground Task Force, 2012). Another concern raised by critics over the expansion of

the “no duty to retreat” to public areas is the amplified risk to innocent bystanders and

public safety personnel and the possibility of increased violence due to retaliation (Jansen

and Nugent-Borakove, 2007; Rios, 2012).

       In the wake of recent attention received by the SYG laws, a number of state

legislatures have reacted by introducing bills to limit the application of these laws, while

others are keeping alive bills to pass similar laws. Therefore, there is an immediate need

to provide credible evidence on the overall impact of these laws on public safety in order

to better inform the current and upcoming legislative debates as well as the public

opinion. Our analysis constitutes a significant attempt towards this goal.




                                             5
          Another motivating factor for the need for such analysis is a rise in the number of

justified homicides nationally since 2005 (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2010).7

According to data from the Uniform Crime Reports, the total number of justifiable

homicides has steadily increased from 196 in 2005 to 278 in 2010.8 This is in contrast to

the total number of overall killings, which has continued to decline during the same

period.     However, it is not straightforward how to interpret the rise in justifiable

homicides. On the one hand, it might be that more civilians are killing each other and

claiming self-defense (Palazzolo and Barry, 2012).                In other words, the increase in

justifiable homicide might reflect deaths that would not have occurred otherwise. This

might support the concerns raised by the critics over the SYG laws. On the other hand, it

might also be a mechanical shift as the new laws now result in more deaths being labeled

as justifiable homicides. Nevertheless, the coincidence in trend for justifiable homicides

and the expansion of the new SYG laws is suggestive of a possible causal link, which

deserves closer investigation. Unfortunately, the official data sources from the Federal

Bureau of Investigation do not allow detailed information on the nature of circumstance

in each incident. While the Supplemental Homicide Reports provide a breakdown of

justifiable and non-justifiable homicides, these data have been shown to be problematic

due to underreporting and differences in interpretation and administrative practices in the

timing of reporting across jurisdictions (Kleck, 1998). Despite these problems, we will

  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, justifiable homicide is defined as and limited to the
killing of a felon by a peace officer in the line of duty or the killing of a felon during commission of a
felony by a private citizen.

  The corresponding figures are 238 for 2006, 257 for 2007, 265 for 2008, and 266 for 2009. It is notable
that this upward trend is solely due to an increase in the homicides committed with firearms and not
accounted for by other dangerous weapons and knives or cutting instruments.

show results from auxiliary analyses that examine the extent to which the SYG law is

associated with justifiable versus non-justifiable homicides.

         In this paper, we examine the impact of the recently introduced SYG laws on

homicides due to firearm assaults using data from the U.S. Vital Statistics. In order to

identify the causal impact of these laws, we employ a difference-in-difference

methodology by exploiting the variation across states over time in the effective date of

these laws. It is important to note that our focus is on states that have passed SYG laws

with an explicit language extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any

place where a person has a legal right to be.9 Since the majority of these new laws were

passed in a window of a three year period between 2005 and 2007, it is difficult to

leverage variation with annual data to identify the law’s impact. Because we use data

from the Vital Statistics, which provides data on the date, location, and cause of all deaths

in the U.S., we are able to conduct our analysis at the monthly level to leverage additional

variation. These data are considered to be the most reliable source of information on

homicides. We find that the SYG laws increase firearm related homicides among whites,

especially white males. Our results indicate that between 28 and 33 additional white

males are killed each month as a result of these laws, accounting for about 8 to 9 percent

of all the white male murder victims in 2010. We find no evidence to indicate that these

laws cause an increase in homicides among blacks. We also show that the SYG laws are


9
  There have been a few states that passed versions of SYG laws that did not extend the no duty to retreat
principle to apply to public places. These are not included in our treatment states. In our opinion, it is the
provision of “no duty to retreat at any place a person has a legal right to be” that is the controversial aspect
of these laws and also the one that has received much of the attention recently. In fact, the other provisions
like no duty to retreat at home, also known as the Castle Doctrine, have been part of the common law for
decades almost everywhere and individuals have rarely been prosecuted for using deadly force in self-
defense in their homes. Nevertheless, we conducted a robustness analysis to determine whether any of our
results are confounded by the impact of these other provisions. As discussed later in the paper, our results
are not influenced by these other provisions.

                                                       7
associated with an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to firearm

related injuries. Our results further indicate that it is indeed the most controversial aspect

of these laws, i.e., the provision that extends no duty to retreat to any place a person has a

legal right to be, that causes the increase in homicides. Our results are also robust to a

number of specifications and unlikely to be driven entirely by the killings of assailants.

Overall, these findings raise serious doubts about the claim that SYG laws make America

safer.

           The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides

information on the publicity generated by SYG laws and reviews the existing evidence on

the impact of these laws. Section III discusses the data used in the analyses. Section IV

describes our empirical approach. Section V presents our main results along with a

discussion of robustness analyses, and Section VI offers a set of conclusions.



II. Background

           Despite the tremendous publicity generated by the SYG laws and the significant

ramifications that these laws may have on public health and safety, to date there has been

little investigation of the potential impact of these laws on outcomes, such as crime rates

and victimization. Most of what is currently known on the potential consequences of

these laws are descriptive and come from media reports. For example, according to the

Tampa Bay Times, “justifiable homicides” in Florida steadily increased from an annual

average of 34 during the first half of the 2000s to 105 in 2009 (Montgomery and Jenkins,

2010).10 In fact, the Tampa Bay Times has identified about 200 SYG cases and their

outcomes through media reports, court records and interviews with prosecutors and
10
     The figures stood at 31, 43, 33, 102, 93, and 105 in years from 2004 to 2009, respectively.

                                                        8
defense attorneys in Florida (Hundley et al., 2012).                The newspaper’s report of the

investigation of these cases indicates that in about 70 percent of the cases where the SYG

law was invoked to avoid prosecution, individuals have gone free. The report also cites

numerous examples which support the perception that these laws encourage individuals

to be aggressive even in situations where retreat is possible.11                     Furthermore, an

independent review panel, which examined Florida’s SYG law, cites documentation of

the law’s application to excuse killings in neighborhoods, bar brawls, gang shootouts, and

road-rage incidents (Florida Stand Your Ground Task Force, 2012).

        Contrary to these concerns, there are also others who argue that the colorful

examples highlighted in the media draw a misleading picture of the actual impact of these

laws and that the laws have largely been successful in protecting citizens against

wrongful attacks and intrusions.12

        While there is an abundance of anecdotal evidence on the impact of the SYG law

on crime, there is very little credible investigation of the subject to determine whether

these laws represent good policy for public safety.13 One exception is a recent working

paper by Cheng and Hoekstra (2012), which examines the impact of the recent wave of


11
   For example, the report states that “During an argument at a 2009 party in Fort Myers, Omar Bonilla
fired his gun into the ground and beat Demarro Battle, then went inside and gave the gun to a friend. If
Battle feared for his life, he had time to flee. Instead, he got a gun from his car and returned to shoot
Bonilla three times, including once in the back. Battle was not charged in the slaying.”
12
   There have also been examples cited in support of the desirable impact of these laws. For example, a
woman with a known history of prostitution killed a client with his own gun when he had threatened to kill
her. The murder charge against the woman, who could have been prosecuted under the old law, was
dropped because of Florida’s newly enacted SYG law (Lake, 2006).
13
   Although there has been little empirical investigation of the SYG laws, there is a wealth of research
examining the effects of prevalence of gun ownership and gun laws on crime and victimization. The
findings from this research are mixed. On the one hand, a large number of studies find evidence to support
that gun prevalence to increase crime and victimization (Cook and Ludwig, 2003, 2006; Duggan, 2001;
Mocan and Tekin, 2006; Wells and Horney, 2002; MacDonald and Parker, 2001). On the other hand, there
are also a number of studies documenting that gun ownership and less restrictive regulations lead to less
crime and victimization through deterrence (Lott and Mustard, 1997; Lott, 2000; Lott and Whitley, 2001;
and Mustard, 2001).

                                                    9
self-defense laws on crime and homicides using data from the FBI Uniform Crime

Reports (UCR). The study finds no evidence that these laws have any deterrence effect on

crimes such as burglary, robbery, and aggravated assault, but increase murder.     While

Cheng and Hoekstra (2012) is a useful attempt to shed light into the impact of self-

defense laws on crime and victimization, our study differs from that in a number of

important ways. First, we focus on the impact of SYG laws that extended the right to

self-defense with no-duty to retreat in venues outside homes, while the primary focus of

Cheng and Hoekstra (2012) is the self-defense laws with a broader scope. Second, we

examine the impact of the SYG laws separately by gender and race. On the one hand,

there is evidence to suggest that the application of these laws may have a

disproportionally larger impact on minorities (Hundley et al, 2012; Jansen and Nugent-

Borakove, 2007). On the other hand, the proportion of whites owning guns is

substantially larger than those of blacks, suggesting that the laws may also have a larger

impact on whites (Project America, 2008). As it turns out, race and gender specific

heterogeneity in the impact of SYG laws is in fact highly important and ignoring it would

produce an incomplete picture of the consequences of the SYG laws. Third, we use data

on firearm related homicides from the U.S. Vital Statistics in our main analysis, while

Cheng and Hoekstra (2012) use data from the UCR. The discrepancies in homicides

between the UCR and the Vital Statistics are well-documented (Harris et al., 2002; Loftin

et al., 2008; Wiersema et al. 2000; Decker and Pyrooz, 2010). For example, Loftin et al.

(2008) find large differences between the UCR data and Vital Statistics data, with

substantial undercount in the UCR estimates of the number of homicides. Note that

undercounting may particularly be an important issue if the extent of it differs between



                                           10
states with SYG laws and those that do not have these laws. Vital Statistics is often

considered the gold standard of U.S. mortality measurement (Harris et al., 2002). Fourth,

we employ data on hospitalizations and emergency room visits to consider the effect of

the SYG law on injuries. This analysis is highly complementary to the analysis of

homicides because for every homicide, there are many more injuries that show up in

emergency rooms and result in hospitalizations. Fifth, we focus on monthly homicides

while Cheng and Hoekstra (2012) use annual data in their analysis. It makes sense that

Cheng and Hoekstra (2012) conduct their analyses with annual data since the monthly

data from the UCR records are particularly problematic.                    For example, incomplete

reporting is a major problem with the UCR at the monthly level. A large fraction of

jurisdictions does not reliably provide data on a monthly basis, but rather most

jurisdictions provide aggregates in one particular month, typically December.                         The

records of justifiable killings provided by the UCR may also be problematic. Kleck

(1988) discusses a number of reasons why the FBI’s total counts of justifiable homicides

represent only a minority of all civilian defensive homicides. For instance, there are

examples of cases labeled by police as justifiable homicides, but they are not reported as

such to the FBI because of the unwillingness by the police to spend much time recording

homicides where the prosecution of the murderer was not expected to be pursued.14

        An analysis with annual data is not the most ideal in this case because, with the

exception of three states, all Castle Doctrine laws were passed in a period of three years

between 2006 and 2008. In particular, 12 states passed these laws in 2006 and two states


14
  Another limitation of the UCR data is that federal law enforcement agencies in certain jurisdictions do
not participate in the UCR program. Thus, homicides occurring in places like prisons, national parks and
Indian reservations, which are not reported by state or local law enforcement agencies, will not show up in
the UCR system (Rokaw et al., 1990), but will appear in the Vital Statistics.

                                                    11
passed them in 2007. The number of states that passed a SYG law in 2005 and 2008 is

only one. Clustering of laws around such a narrow time window would reduce variation

over time in the spread of these laws, which can be important for identification in a

difference-in-difference framework. Given monthly frequency of our data, we are able to

utilize variation in homicides across months within a year. This also helps us capture

seasonality in the homicides.



III. Data

        Our primary data source is firearm related homicide victimization between 2000

and 2010 drawn from the U.S. Vital Statistics. These data are made available from the

National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through a contractual agreement. The Vital

Statistics records each instance of death based on information from death certificates filed

with the vital statistics offices of each state and the District of Columbia. Each record

contains pertinent demographic information as well as the locality, date, and cause of

death. The cause of death is then recoded by the NCHS based on the Tenth Revision of

the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10). For our purposes, we focus on

firearm related homicides committed by private citizens.15 The individual records are

aggregated to the state and month in which they occur. In order to construct homicide

rates, we obtained population data from the U.S. Census' Intercensus County Population

Estimates for each state and each year.

        Our main explanatory variable is SYG defined as a binary variable that takes on

the value of one if a state has a SYG law in effect in a particular month of the year and


15
   We exclude justifiable killings committed by police or other law enforcement officers and suicides by
firearms from our analysis.

                                                  12
zero otherwise.        The month the SYG law has become effective is determined by

information provided by the state legislature of each state in which a SYG law has been

enacted.16 In the month the law became effective, we coded the SYG as the proportion of

days within the particular month in which the law was in effect as the treatment

variable.17 The first state to pass a SYG law that has extended the right to self-defense

with no-duty to retreat in venues outside homes is Florida. By the end of 2010, a total of

18 states had similar laws in their criminal code. Figure 1 displays the rapid increase in

the spread of these laws during the second half of the 2000s.18 A complete list of these

states and the exact dates that their SYG laws have become effective are listed in Table

1.19 Note that a number of states have expanded their Castle Doctrine laws without

extending the no duty to retreat to public places.20 These states are listed in column 3 of

Table 1. In our interpretation, the expansion of no duty to retreat in public venues is the

most dramatic aspect of these laws with the most significant ramifications. However, we

also recognize that these other provisions may confound our findings if they have

significant impacts on homicides. In the results section, we present evidence from a


16
   For some states, the effective date is the day the legislation is signed into law by the governor, while for
others, it is stipulated in the text of the legislation or set as a specific day of the year on which all passed
laws become effective.
17
   We tested the robustness of our results to alternative ways of constructing the treatment variable. For
example, we coded SYG as 1 and then 0 in the month it became effective and our results remained the
same in each case.
18
   Utah had a law that allowed the right of self-defense outside the home since 1994.
19
   We interpret Indiana’s SYG law as one that removes duty to retreat in any place someone has a legal
right to be. Note that this differs from the interpretation in Cheng and Hoekstra (2012). Indiana’s law states
that “if the person reasonably believes that force is necessary to prevent serious bodily injury to the person
or a third person or the commission of a forcible felony. No person in this state shall be placed in legal
jeopardy of any kind whatsoever for protecting the person or a third person by reasonable means
necessary.” (see http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2006/PDF/HE/HE1028.1.pdf). There are no limits as to
where the forcible felony should occur and presumably can be construed to mean anywhere. Given the
uncertainty about the language in Indiana's law, we estimated our models after recodifying Indiana as a
non-SYG state. Our results remained very similar. These results are available from the authors upon
request.
20
   These expansions typically curtail civil liabilities for justified killings or establish a presumption of
reasonableness.

robustness analysis, which indicates that our results are not influenced by the presence of

these other provisions and in fact it is the SYG provision that is driving our findings.

       We control for several characteristics of states in our analysis. These include the

racial composition of state (i.e., percentage black, white, and Hispanic), the age

distribution of state population (i.e., percentage aged 15-19, 20-24, 25-34), and the

proportion of state population living in urban areas. Data on age distribution of state

population, racial and ethnic composition, and urbanization are obtained from the Bureau

of the Census.    Next, we supplement our models with data on the number of law

enforcement agencies and the number of state prisoners obtained from the annual Justice

Expenditure and Employment Abstract of the Bureau of Justice statistics. Finally, we

control for the state’s unemployment rate, the poverty rate, and the political party that

controls the governorship in the state. These measures are compiled from the University

of Kentucky’s Center for Poverty Research.

       Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations for our control variables. The

first column shows the descriptive statistics for the full sample. The descriptive statistics

for the subsample of states that has never passed a SYG law are shown in column 2 and

for those states that have passed a SYG law at some point during the analysis period are

shown in column 3. Finally, columns 4 and 5 show descriptive statistics for all state-

month-year observations without a SYG law and with a SYG law in effect, respectively.

The average monthly homicide counts are 16.8 in non-SYG states and 24.2 in SYG

states. The homicide rate is also higher among SYG states with 0.375 deaths per month

per 100,000 residents deaths compared to non-SYG states, which have an average

homicide rate of 0.292 per month per 100,000 residents. Of the 6,732 state-month-year



                                             14
observations, 729 (10.8 percent) are zeros due to no homicides committed during those

months. The largest homicide count is observed in California, a non-SYG state, with 198

deaths in September 2002. The largest number of homicides among our SYG states was

observed in Texas in May 2009 with 106 homicides. If we consider homicide rates per

population rather than homicide counts, then the largest homicide rate was observed in

District of Columbia, again a non-SYG state, in July 2002 with 2.27 homicides per

100,000 residents. Among the SYG states, the largest homicide rate was in Louisiana in

July 2009 with 0.66 homicides per 100,000 residents. Table 2 also shows that SYG and

non-SYG states differ in several observable characteristics. In particular, SYG states have

a higher percentage of black population, more likely to have a Republican governor, a

higher incarceration rate and a larger number of law enforcement agents. These states

also tend to be more urban, and have a higher poverty rate.21



IV. Empirical Strategy

        We are interested in examining the impact of the SYG law on homicides due to

gun assaults. The key empirical challenge in answering this question stems from the fact

there may be a myriad of other factors that might be correlated with the passage of these

laws and independently affect homicides due to gun assaults. Therefore, a simple before-

and-after approach would fail to identify the effect of SYG laws unless the spread of

these laws across states was effectively random with respect to both observable and

unobservable characteristics of those states. However, this assumption is unlikely. For

example, if the law enforcement officers anticipate that these laws may lead to a rise in


21
 A similar picture is obtained if we rather focus on the differences between state-month-year observations
with SYG law in effect and without a SYG law as presented in columns 4 and 5 of Table 2.

                                                    15
gun prevalence and escalation of violent conflicts, then they may react by intensifying

their policing efforts. Alternatively, if the new laws result in an increase in the number of

regular citizens taking up arms, for example, to serve as community watch volunteers,

then the law enforcement officers may actually reduce their patrolling activities in some

neighborhoods. Furthermore, the states that pass the SYG laws are different than other

states in many ways. For example, in a study examining the evolution of these laws,

Boots et al. (2009) show Republicans are more likely to initiate and sign a SYG bill into

law than Democrats. With respect to the geographic representation, as indicated by Table

1, southern states are more likely to have a SYG law. These also tend to be the states

with widespread support for gun rights and a strong presence of pro-gun organizations

like the NRA. If cultural or socio-economic differences across states are correlated with

both the passage of these laws and homicides, then failing to control for them would lead

to a bias in the estimated impact of SYG laws on homicides.

       To address these problems, we employ a difference-in-difference strategy,

exploiting the variation in the timing of these laws across states. A key identification

assumption in this strategy is that, in the absence of the SYG laws, homicide rates would

have trended similarly between states which had enacted these laws and those which had

not. One potential threat to this is that the decision to pass a SYG law may reflect policy

endogeneity.    While pro-gun activists have intensified their campaigns both at the

legislative and grassroots levels in the last decade, it is not exactly clear what specifically

prompted these particular states to extend the Castle Doctrine in such a controversial way.

As Jansen and Nugent-Borakove (2007) point out, there are many unanswered questions

about the impact of these Castle Doctrine expansion policies, particularly because there is



                                              16
no evidence to determine why these specific expansions were proposed in the first

place.22 However, one thing that is clear is that these laws could not have been introduced

as a reaction to a wave of crime epidemic in the states that have passed these laws. On

the contrary, crime rates have been on the decline virtually everywhere in the U.S. during

this period. Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 2, trends in homicide rates are fairly

similar across states that passed SYG laws and those that did not prior to passage of these

laws. The line with solid circles reflects the smoothed average homicide rate in a given

month and a year among the treatment states, i.e., the states that passed a SYG law since

2005. The vertical line presents the month and the year in which the SYG law became

effective in each of the treatment states. Since these laws became effective at different

points in time, the graph is centered in the month and year the SYG law became effective

in each of the SYG states (time 0) and tracks homicide rates in the months leading up to

and after this period for 18 months (e.g., time 0 is 10/2005 for Florida and 6/2006 for

Georgia). The line with solid diamonds in Figure 2 displays the smoothed average

homicide rate across states that fall into the control group, i.e., those states that did not

pass a SYG law.23

         As shown in Figure 2, the homicide rates are higher in treatment states than the

control states prior to the effective dates of SYG laws. Note that the differences in levels

of homicide between the two types of states are not a concern for our identification


22
   Some suggest that increased concerns about public safety in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in 2001
and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 have played a role in the spread of SYG laws (Jansen and Nugent-Borakove,
2007).
23
   To illustrate, assume we have three states with the SYG laws, which became effective on 10/2005,
6/2006, and 12/2007, and three control states (X, Y, and Z) that did not pass a SYG law during the analysis
period. Then the average homicide rate among the control states in time 0 is based on the homicide rates in
states X, Y, and Z in 10/2005, 6/2006, and 12/2007. Similarly, the homicide rates in control states in time 1
is constructed as the average of homicide rates in states X, Y, and Z in 11/2005, 7/2006, and 1/2008. The
average homicide rates for the months prior to time 0 are constructed in a similar fashion.

                                                    17
because we condition on state and month*year fixed effects. However, the SYG and non-

SYG states follow a generally similar trend in homicide rate prior to the SYG laws,

suggesting little evidence of systematic differences between the two groups of states

other than differences in levels. Note that when we focus on the combinations of gender

and race, the picture becomes more blurred, especially for the homicides among the

treatment states, because of volatility in the monthly rates of homicides.24 Following the

enactment of SYG laws, the homicide rates start trending upwards in the treatment states,

especially for white males. Control states, on the other hand, exhibit no such trend in an

apparent way. Moreover, we control for state specific trends in our analysis, which

allows the homicide rate to trend differently between the SYG and non-SYS states. This

picture provides suggestive evidence that in the absence of SYG laws, the treatment

states might have followed a similarly flat or downward trend. The difference-in-

difference method can be formalized in a regression framework as follows:



        Hsmy = α SYGsmy + Xsmyβ + μs + λmy + εsmy,                                              (1)



where Hsmy is the rate of homicides in state s in month m in calendar year y. SYGsmy is

our key explanatory variable, which equals one if state s has a SYG law effective in

month m in calendar year y, and 0 otherwise. The Xsmy is a vector of exogenous

determinants of crime described above. The μs are state fixed effects and would capture

any time invariant, state specific factors, which may influence homicides. The λmy are

month*year fixed effects that would account any seasonality-related trends as well as

24
  Note that the volatility in homicides in SYG states is particularly higher because the number of states
with a SYG law in effect decreases as one moves away from time 0. In other words, the homicide rate is
averaged over a decreasing number of states as one deviate from time 0.

                                                   18
national changes in homicides that are common to all states. The εsmy is the usual error

term. Note that our unit of observation is by state, year, and month. The coefficient of

interest is α, the impact of SYG laws on homicides. The standard errors are clustered at

the state level to account for serial correlation (Bertrand et al., 2004).

         Although the evidence illustrated in Figure 2 suggests that there is little evidence

of policy endogeneity or systematic pre-existing trends that differ between the treatment

and control states, we extend our baseline specification in equation (1) by including state-

specific linear trends in addition to state and month*year fixed effects. These additional

controls would account for any unobserved factors that trend over time within a state and

are correlated with homicides.25

         We begin our empirical analysis with OLS models estimated in the logarithm of

homicide rates per 100,000 state residents.26 However, estimating a proportional effects

model is not straightforward in our case because of zero homicides observed in some

states in certain months. To overcome this complication, we replaced zeros with ones,

and estimated log-linear models with the resulting data.27 Next, we present results from

fixed-effects Poisson models.28 These models are particularly well-suited for our purpose

given the count nature of our data and the fact that homicides are rare events, especially

25
   We also experiment with specifications that control for state-specific quadratic trends as well as
region*year fixed effects. These results did not cause any appreciable changes to the results presented here.
26
   The regressions are weighted by state population for the relevant demographic group. Our results are
similar when we estimate these models using rates of homicide instead. These results are presented in
Appendix Table 1. For example, the effect of 0.049 additional deaths per 100,000 white males reported
Appendix Table 1 is very close to the corresponding figure of 0.062 obtained from Table 3A.
27
   Our results do not change when we only use the non-zero observations. These results are available from
the authors upon request.
28
   One advantage of Poisson models is that, observed homicide rates of zero present no problem since
Poisson regression does not require taking the logarithm of the dependent variable. However, one limitation
of these models is the assumption that variance equals the mean. We use the robust option to obtain robust
standard errors as recommended by Cameron and Trivedi (2010), which should mitigate concerns over the
equivariance assumption. The violation of the equivariance assumption still produces consistent estimates
but standard errors could be biased towards zero. Using Poisson regression also allows us to cluster
standard errors at the state level.

                                                    19
at the monthly level and in some smaller states, and are widely used in the crime

literature (e.g., Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls, 1997; Osgood, 2000; Weiner, Lutz, and

Ludwig, 2009).29 In fixed effects Poisson models, we control for the logarithm of state

population for the relevant race and gender group.30



V. Results

         Table 3A presents OLS estimates of the impact of the SYG laws on logarithm of

the homicides per 100,000 residents. Each cell in the table presents the coefficient on the

indicator for SYG law and its standard error (adjusted for clustering at the state level).

We present results for the full sample in Panel A, and then separately by race and by

combinations of race and gender in Panels B through G. In each panel, column (1) shows

the SYG estimates from a specification expressed in equation (1) that controls for state,

month, and year fixed effects; column (2) displays the estimates from the specification

that adds state specific annual time trends.

         As shown in Panel A of Table 3A, the estimates are positive and significant in

both specifications, suggesting that SYG laws increase the rate of homicides.                           The

estimate in the second column indicates that having a SYG law is associated with a 6.8

percent increase in the homicide rate. When we consider the impact of SYG laws on

homicides separately by race, an interesting picture emerges, suggesting that the positive

impact of these laws only applies to whites, while the estimates for blacks are negative

but not statistically significant. The point estimate on the specification in column (2)

29
   In addition to fixed effects Poisson models, we estimated fixed effects Negative Binomial models to
account for potential overdispersion in the data. The Negative Binomial results are not appreciably different
from the Poisson or OLS results presented here and are available from the authors upon request.
30
   By adding the logarithm of state population, Poisson regression becomes an analysis of rates of
homicides per population, rather than an analysis of counts of homicides.

                                                    20
indicates that the SYG law increases firearm related homicide rate among whites by 11.6

percent. Given that the SYG states had an average of 0.21 white homicides per 100,000

persons in the month prior to SYG law, the estimate implies that these laws result in

about 0.024 additional white individuals per 100,000 getting killed in each state each

month. With a white population of 91.5 million in the SYG states, this is equal to an

additional 22 deaths per month.

       Next, we turn our attention to the SYG estimates separately by race and gender.

These results, presented in Panels D through G of Table 3A, reveal that the positive effect

of SYG laws among whites is primarily driven by homicides of white males, while the

impact among white females is not significant. With an average homicide rate of 0.425

per 100,000 for white males in the month prior to the SYG laws, the SYG estimate of

0.147 translates into an approximately 0.062 additional homicides per 100,000 per month

among white males. Given a white male population of 45.4 million in these states, this

would indicate an additional 28 deaths per month among this demographic group. The

fact that this figure is close to the estimate in Panel B is not surprising given the smaller

and imprecisely estimated coefficient for white females as well as the lower homicide

rate among white females. Consistent with the results presented in Panel C, the estimates

on blacks are small in size and statistically insignificant for both males and females.

       The results from the fixed effects Poisson models are presented in Table 3B and

are largely consistent with those from the OLS. The point estimate in column (2) of Panel

D is 0.158 indicating that the SYG laws result in an increase in the homicide rate among

white males by 17.1 percent (e0.158 – 1). This translates into an additional 0.07 homicides

per 100,000 residents per month per state among this group or 33 homicides per month.



                                             21
Focusing on the estimates for blacks displayed in Panels F and G, we see that the

estimates are again small in magnitude and imprecisely estimated, indicating that the

SYG laws are not causing any effect in homicides among blacks.

       The results presented so far refer to the impact of SYG laws that have explicit

language extending no duty to retreat to places an individual has a legal right to be.

However, some states have passed narrower versions of self-defense laws that limit the

no duty to treat only to an individual’s home, business, or vehicle, include provisions that

create a presumption of reasonableness, or remove civil liability for individuals using

deadly force in self-defense. Note that it is the provision of “no duty to retreat in any

place an individual has a legal right to be” that is the most controversial aspect of the new

SYG laws and it has been this provision that has been at the center of recent debates. In

fact, the other provision providing “no duty to retreat at one’s home” has been the part of

common law for many decades and individuals have rarely been prosecuted for using

force, including deadly force, against intruders. Nevertheless, we conducted a robustness

analysis to determine the extent to which our results are confounded by these other

provisions. To do this, we created an additional indicator to reflect whether a state has

passed some type of Castle Doctrine law during the analysis period, but one without

removing duty to retreat in any place a person has a legal right to be. We call this

indicator “Other Self-Defense Provisions.” Then we estimate all our models with these

two variables. The omitted category in our models is states that did not pass any self-

defense laws during this period.

       As shown in Table 4A, the OLS results from this analysis barely change from the

results reported in Table 3A. The estimates on SYG indicator continue to point to a



                                             22
robust impact of SYG laws on homicides among white males. In particular, the estimate

of 0.141 for white males translates into about 27 (0.141*0.425*45.4 million/100,000)

additional deaths per month, which is similar to the one in Table 3A. Moreover, the

estimates on blacks are still negative in sign, small in size, and statistically insignificant.

Regarding the coefficients on the indicator for other self-defense provisions, they are

estimated with precision only significant for white males. Surprisingly, however, the

estimates are opposite in sign, suggesting that these other provisions are associated with a

decrease in the homicide rate among this group.

        The estimates from the fixed effects Poisson results are presented in Table 4B.

Similarly, these results are nearly indistinguishable from those shown in Table 3B. We

interpret this as strong evidence to confirm that the estimated SYG law impacts obtained

earlier are not confounded by these other provisions. Focusing on gender and race

specific estimates in Panels B through G, we see that the impact of SYG laws on the

homicide rate among white males is 16.5 percent, almost identical to the estimate in

Table 3B. Furthermore, all of the SYG estimates on blacks are small in size and none are

statistically significant. Regarding the estimates on the indicator for other self-defense

provisions, we obtain negative and statistically significant impacts for white males, while

the estimate on white females is positive and significant.31

         In sum, the results presented in Tables 3A, 3B, 4A, and 4B provide no evidence,

unlike the advocates of these laws have argued, that the SYG laws would result in a



31
   It is not surprising that the estimates on the other self-defense provisions are not consistent across
specifications and demographic groups. This is likely because there is a wide variation in the scope of
these other provisions across states. For example, some states only created a presumption of
reasonableness for those using deadly force in self-defense situations, while others only removed civil
liability for those justified under the self-defense law. Thus, bundling multiple laws into one single
category like the one implemented here may fail to capture their overall impact properly.

                                                   23
reduced number of deaths among citizens in the states that have introduced such laws.

On the contrary, these results indicate that the number of firearm related homicides

among white males increase significantly as a result of these laws.



Justifiable versus Non-Justifiable Homicides

         It may be argued that the increase in homicides might largely be driven by killings

that are justified by the SYG laws, i.e., deaths that occur while law-abiding citizens are

protecting themselves from intruders or attackers, and that this should not be viewed as a

negative outcome.32 It is indeed possible that additional homicides associated with the

SYG law may partly be driven by the killings of assailants. However, note that the net

rise in homicides cannot be accounted by a one-to-one substitution between the killings

of assailants and the killings of victims unless multiple assailants are killed in some

instances (Cheng and Hoekstra, 2012). If at least some of the additional homicides are

due to individuals resorting to the use of deadly force against each other in situations

where the threat of death or serious bodily injury is not imminent to either party, this

could indicate that these laws impose serious costs not only on criminals both also private

citizens as well. It is also possible that potential intruders and attackers, who, in the

absence of SYG laws, could have committed their crimes without killing anyone, are now

being killed as a result of these laws. Whether or not these killings should be considered

justifiable in this case is beyond the purpose of this paper. However, it cannot be argued

in that case that the SYG laws are saving the lives of innocent people as these individuals

would not have been killed in the first place.


32
  Note that justifiable killings by police or other law enforcement officers are already excluded from our
analyses.

                                                     24
        While the U.S. Vital Statistics is the most reliable source of information on

homicides, it does not provide any information about whether the deaths fall under the

category of justifiable or non-justifiable homicides. In fact, the only nationally

representative source of information on justifiable and non-justifiable homicides comes

from the FBI’s Supplemental Homicide Reports (SHR). Despite the previously

mentioned problems related to the reliability of the SHR data, especially with its

breakdown of justifiable and non-justifiable homicides, we believe that an analysis with

the SHR still has the potential to provide useful insights into the relationship between

SYG laws and justifiable versus non-justifiable homicides.

        To implement this analysis, we gathered data from the SHR between 2000 and

2009.    The means for homicide counts in SHR are shown in Appendix Table 2.

Consistent with the earlier discussion, the homicide numbers in the SHR data are an

undercount of the total number of homicides.33 As expected, the overwhelming majority

of homicides are classified as non-justifiable. For example, there are only 4.1 justifiable

homicides compared to 201.1 non-justifiable homicides in our full sample. The number

of justifiable homicides is 2.6 for the non-SYG states and 6.6 and for the SYG states,

while the corresponding figures for non-justifiable homicides are 171.5 and 251.

        Next, we run separate regressions for non-justifiable and justifiable homicides

aggregated at the annual level using data from the SHR between 2000 and 2009.34 In

Tables 5A and 5B, we report the SYG estimates for the models of justifiable homicides


33
   Note that we excluded fatal shootings committed by police officers from the count of justifiable
 homicides.
34
   We conducted the analysis with the SHR data both at the annual and monthly levels. To economize on
space, we only present results from the annual level analysis. Furthermore, the monthly counts are
especially noisy because of the reasons mentioned previously. Despite these problems, the results from the
analyses conducted at the monthly and the annual levels point to a similar conclusion. These results from
the monthly analysis are available from the authors upon request.

                                                   25
with OLS and fixed effects Poisson regressions, respectively.35 Similar to the earlier

tables, we present estimates from a specification that includes state and year fixed effects

along with time-varying state characteristics in the first column. The estimates shown in

the second column add to this list state-specific linear time trends. As shown in Table

5A, once we control for state specific time trends, the only two groups with a statistically

significant estimate on SYG are whites and white males. In fact, the point estimate

implies that the SYG law is associated with a 47 percent increase in justifiable homicides

for white males. Such a large effect is consistent with the voluminous anecdotal and

descriptive evidence pointing to a sharp rise in the number of justifiable homicides

following SYG laws. As explained above however, this may represent a rather

mechanical shift and does not necessarily indicate an increase crime, if incidents, which

could have been categorized as non-justifiable homicides before the SYG laws, now fall

under the umbrella of justifiable homicides. The results from the fixed effects Poisson

regressions are presented in Table 5B and point to a substantial increase in justifiable

homicides among white males associated with the SYG laws. In fact, the marginal effect

indicates that the SYG law almost doubles the number of justifiable homicides.

         The results for the non-justifiable homicides are reported in Tables 6A and 6B.

The OLS estimates shown in Table 6A suggest that the SYG law has a large and

statistically significant positive effect in the non-justified homicides among white males.

The point estimate in column 2 indicates a 23 percent increase in these homicides

associated with the SYG laws.             The results from the fixed effects Poisson regressions

35
  Given that the justifiable homicide figures for white females and black females are so low and coupled
with the already mentioned problems associated with justifiable homicide records, we believe that the
estimates for females are not reliable, so are not presented in the tables. For example, there are 0.04 deaths
per state per year among white females that are classified as justifiable. The corresponding figure for black
females is 0.02. Nevertheless, they are available from the authors upon request.

                                                     26
shown in Table 6B suggest that the SYG law is associated with a significant increase in

the non-justifiable homicides of not only white males, but also white females, while no

other statistically significant effect is detected for other groups. The marginal effects

indicate that the SYG law increases non-justifiable homicides by 46.5 (e0.382 – 1) percent

among white males and 31.9 (e0.277 – 1) percent among white females.

       Despite the previously mentioned concerns about the reliability of the SHR data,

the pattern obtained from the results in Tables 6A and 6B is supportive of the earlier

finding that SYG laws do in fact cause an increase in the total homicides including those

that fall under the non-justifiable category. Also, if these laws do not increase overall

homicides, but simply result in a substitution away from non-justifiable homicides

towards justifiable homicides, then we should have seen a clear reduction in non-

justifiable homicides. If anything, the evidence from Tables 6A and 6B shows strong

evidence that the opposite is true.



Robustness Analyses and Placebo Test

       According to data from the Uniform Crime Reports, 67.5 percent of all homicides

are committed by firearms in the U.S. in 2010. Majority of the anecdotal evidence on the

consequences of SYG laws refer to cases which involve the use of firearms.

Nevertheless, the law is not weapon-specific, and thus can apply to any homicide

regardless of the weapon used. To assess the sensitivity of our results to the type of

weapon, we estimated all of our models using homicides committed with all types of

weapons including firearms and non-firearms. This analysis produced results that are




                                           27
remarkably similar to those presented in Tables 3A and 3B.36 In particular, the marginal

effects for white males are 0.142 for the OLS model and 0.102 for the fixed effects

Poisson model and are both statistically significant. Consistent with our earlier results,

none of the estimates for other race and gender categories are estimated with statistical

precision.

        Next we conducted a placebo analysis. To do this, we grouped all non-homicide

and non-suicide related deaths together and estimated our models using this measure as

the outcome. These deaths primarily include those caused by cardiovascular events,

cancer, and motor vehicle accidents, which arguably should not be affected by gun laws.

The results from this placebo analysis are presented in Table 7. As expected, the

estimates are imprecisely estimated for most of the categories and small in magnitude in

all cases. This suggests that the SYG laws do not exhibit any meaningful association

with the type of deaths that they should not be associated with.



Emergency Room Visits and Hospital Discharges

        If the SYG laws are causing an increase in homicides, it is plausible to think that

it should cause even a larger increase in emergency room (ER) visits and hospitalizations

due to firearm related injuries. According to data from the National Center for Health

Statistics, in 2009, for each death by injury, there were about 11 times as many

hospitalizations and 182 times as many ER visits. Therefore, one attractive way to assess

the reliability of our findings is to examine whether the SYG laws are also related to

firearm related injuries that show up in emergency rooms and result in hospitalizations


36
  Full results from these analyses are not shown to economize on space. However, they are available from
the authors upon request.

                                                  28
        To accomplish this goal, we utilized information from two databases collected by

the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), which services a family of health

care databases developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership and sponsored by

the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Specifically, for ER

department visits, we use the State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD), which

provides discharge information on all emergency department visits that do not result in

admission to a hospital. For hospital discharges, we rely upon the State Inpatient Databases

(SID), which hold the universe of inpatient discharge abstracts from individual states. In

order for a discharge record to exist, the patient must have been admitted to hospital.

Thus, the SID typically contains records of patients who require more intensive treatment

or for whom treatment cannot be provided on an out-patient basis. Note that our SEDD

and SID data cover the states of California, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Maryland, New

Jersey, and Wisconsin and for the period between 2005 and 2009.37 There are a few

reasons for limiting the ER and hospitalizations analysis to these states. First, individual

states voluntarily subscribe to the HCUP project, so not every state provides these data.38

Second, some states do not provide information on patient race, which is crucial for our

analyses. Third, there is a financial cost, which makes it prohibitively expensive to

acquire data for all available states for all years. Note that among our states, Florida is

the only one which has passed a SYG law during the analysis period.




37
   Note that we have data from California for only between 2005 and 2008. Our results are not sensitive to
Hawaii.
38
   For example, only 17 states provided the SEDD data and 27 states provided the SID data in 2009. Since
we use the sum of ER visits and hospital discharges in our analyses, we cannot have more than 17 states
represented in our analyses. For a full list of states with SEDD and SID data, please visit http://www.hcup-
us.ahrq.gov/databases.jsp.

                                                    29
        The injury categories in the HCUP data are based on ICD-9 codes and we focus

on external injuries that are inflicted purposefully, excluding firearm injuries that are

inflicted accidently or by police officers. We identified the firearm related injuries in the

SEDD and SID databases for each of our sample states and aggregated the counts at the

quarterly level. Then we summed up the quarterly total counts of ER visits (from SEDD)

and hospital discharges (from SID) to generate our outcome measure.39 To our

knowledge, this is the first study to consider the effect of SYG laws on firearm related

injuries. The descriptive statistics for the ER visits and hospital discharges are presented

in Appendix Table 3. Both the ER visits and hospitalizations are higher, both in levels

and in rates per 100,000 persons, among SYG states than non-SYG states. This is

suggestive that the SYG law may indeed play a role in increasing injuries in these states.

        The estimation results from the analysis of the effect of SYG laws on ER visits

and hospital discharges are presented in Tables 8A and 8B for OLS and the fixed effects

Poisson regressions, respectively. Focusing on the estimates in column 2, which control

for state specific linear time trends in addition to state level time-varying variables, state

fixed effects and year and quarter fixed effects, we see from the OLS estimates in Table

8A that the SYG laws are associated with an increase in the firearm related injuries that

result in ER visits and hospitalizations among white males in the order of approximately

20 percent and among black females in the order of almost 60 percent.40 The estimates

from the fixed effects Poisson regressions shown in Table 8B are consistent with those

from the OLS, indicating that the SYG law is associated with significant increases in

39
   Since the SEDD records include cases that did not result in a hospital admission, summing counts from
SEDD and SID does not result in double-counting.
40
   The large estimate on black females is consistent with the hypothesis that the SYG laws are associated
with an increase in firearm related injuries for this demographic group. However, this finding is not
supported with our earlier analysis on homicides and therefore, deserves further investigation.

firearm related injuries among white males and black females. Remarkably, the marginal

effect of the SYG estimate among white males is 20 percent (e0.188 – 1), which is identical

to the corresponding figure from the OLS. Taken together, the results presented in Tables

8A and 8B are generally in line with those from the mortality analysis, indicating that the

SYG laws are not only associated with increased homicides, but also increased firearm

injuries.



VI. Conclusions

        The controversies surrounding a recent wave of self-defense laws introduced by

an increasing number states in the United States have captured the nation’s attention

recently. Since 2005, a total of 18 states have passed legislation that has extended the no

duty to retreat rule to apply to public places and a number of states are debating the

adoption of similar legislation. Despite significant implications of these new laws for

public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impacts. In this paper,

we show that SYG laws that extend the right to self-defense to areas outside the home are

associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides. Our gender and race

specific analyses indicate that the rise in homicides is primarily driven by the deaths

among whites, especially white males, while we generally find no effect on blacks.          .

According to our estimates, between 28 and 33 additional white males are killed each

month as a result of these laws, , accounting for about 8 to 9 percent of the 4,234

homicides committed against white males in 2010.

        Our analysis using data on emergency room visits and hospital discharges from a

number of states including Florida indicate that the SYG laws also cause a substantial



                                             31
increase in number of individuals who are taken to emergency rooms and hospitals for

firearm related injuries.

       We also find evidence to suggest that the SYG laws are associated with increases

in both justifiable and non-justifiable homicides, using data from the Supplemental

Homicide Reports. We find no evidence that these laws are related to non-homicide

deaths, which makes sense given that one would expect no association between gun laws

and these types of deaths.

       Our results suggest that it is indeed the most controversial aspect of these laws,

i.e., the provision that extends no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to

be, that causes the increase in homicides. In particular, we show strong evidence to

indicate that our results are not driven by other self-defense provisions adopted by states.

Taken together, our findings raise serious doubts against the argument that the stand your

ground laws serve as a deterrent for crime. On the contrary, we show consistent evidence

that these laws are associated with an increase in crime, at least measured by homicides,

especially among white males.

       There are a number of possible explanations for the finding that the SYG laws are

significantly associated with the homicides among white males, but not with other

demographic groups. For example, it has been suggested that the SYG laws may be

associated with an increase in gun ownership (Jansen and Nugent-Borakove, 2007). In

fact, there has been some mentioning in the media of a sharp increase in the applications

for concealed weapon permits following the passage of these laws in Florida.41 Given that

the overwhelming majority of concealed guns are owned and carried by white males in

                                             32
the United States, it is plausible to expect the SYG impact to be more pronounced for this

group. Furthermore, it has been argued that the SYG laws may embolden individuals to

stand their ground rather than simply walk away and may lead to individuals resorting to

the use of deadly weapons even in incidents with no real threat to people’s lives.

However, in order for these behaviors to be associated with the SYG laws, people must

have knowledge of these laws. In other words, these laws should only have an effect on

the behavior of individuals who have heard about these laws. Then it is plausible to think

that white males, who are more likely to own and carry guns and who constitute the vast

majority of the membership for pro-gun organizations like the NRA, are the ones who

have more interest in following the legislative activity related to guns. Finally, our results

are also consistent with the bystander story, i.e., given that the no-duty to retreat applies

to any public place in the SYG states, these laws may pose an increased risk to

bystanders. If gun owners, who are more likely to be white males, are also more likely to

be surrounded by whites and especially white males, then this may suggest that the SYG

law should have a stronger impact on this group. However, the explanations offered here

should only be interpreted as suggestive and seen as an important avenue of future

research.
