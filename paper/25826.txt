Double-Counting of Investment

                                          ABSTRACT

The national-income accounts double-count investment, which enters once when it occurs and
again in present value as rental income on added capital. The double-counting implies over-
statement of levels of GDP and national income. Across countries, those with higher propensities
to invest artificially look richer gauged by per capita GDP. There is also exaggeration of capital-
income shares. An alternative measure involves a form of full expensing of gross investment. In
the steady state, revised product and income correspond to consumption. Outside of the steady
state, the measure deviates from consumption because full expensing applies to the long-run flow
of gross investment.

        In setting up a system of national accounts, Kuznets (1941) stressed that the only true final

goods are consumption at various dates. Therefore, a reasonable test for a national accounting system

for production and income is how well it measures the potential for consumption over time. As Kuznets

put it (p. 46): “Is it the value of goods produced that leads to the most valid appraisal of the positive

contents of economic activity? Since the final aim is to satisfy the wants of ultimate consumers, we

might perhaps more properly center attention on ultimate consumption.”

        If the only final goods are consumption in various periods, a reasonable requirement for a

measure of national product or income is that it accurately reflect, subject to data constraints, the

resources available for consumption. More specifically, a necessary condition from an intertemporal

perspective is that—at least conceptually—the present value of production and income should equal the

present value of consumption. However, the usual measures of national or domestic product and

income fail this test because they double-count investment. Gross or net product includes gross or net

investment when it occurs and includes the corresponding present value a second time when additional

rental income results from the enhanced stocks of capital. From the standpoint of the intertemporal

budget constraint for consumption, aggregates such as GDP and national income overstate the

resources available for consumption and also exaggerate capital’s share of product and income.

        In a model with a representative agent, such as the one constructed in the next section, welfare

corresponds to the single agent’s attained utility. Then, with no labor-leisure choice, welfare depends

only on the time path of consumption. More generally, measured welfare would factor in the path of

leisure time and the distributions of consumption and leisure, as suggested by a report written for the

U.S. Senate by Kuznets (1934, pp. 6-7):

        “Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of
        income is known. And no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side
        of income, that is, the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of
        income. The welfare of a nation can, therefore, scarcely be inferred from a
        measurement of national income … “


                                                      2
The present paper deals with how the reported aggregates of product and income relate to the path of

aggregate consumption. Therefore, the analysis relates to welfare in so far as welfare depends on the

path of aggregate consumption, rather than, per se, the paths of aggregate production and income. 1

         The dynamic problems focused on in this paper arise in the standard national-accounting

framework because the setup is fundamentally static. The setting is not well grounded in intertemporal

budget constraints and, therefore, does not handle appropriately the economic role of investment and

capital stocks. These issues emerge clearly within a simple, well-known framework, the steady state of

the neoclassical growth model. However, the results generalize beyond this setting. The key element of

the model is its respect for intertemporal budget constraints.


I. Intertemporal Framework

         The setup is standard, corresponding to the well-known infinite-horizon neoclassical growth

model for a closed economy. 2 The representative agent’s assets are held as internal loans (private

bonds that aggregate to zero) or claims on capital, K(t), which depreciates at the constant rate δ>0.

Perfectly competitive producers of goods produce output, Y(t), using K(t) and labor, L(t), through a

constant-returns-to-scale production function, F(∙), which satisfies the usual neoclassical properties.

Output divides in a one-sector-production-function setup between consumption, C(t), and gross

investment, I(t). 3

         The representative agent’s budget constraint at a point in time is:

         (1)              Y(t) = F[K(t), L(t)] = C(t) + I(t) = w(t)L(t) + R(t)K(t),

2
 This setup is often called the Ramsey model or the Cass-Koopmans model, following Ramsey (1928), Cass (1965),
and Koopmans (1965). Cass and Koopmans generalized the models of Solow (1956) and Swan (1956).

 The focus here is on a closed economy without government. But C can include net imports and government
consumption, I can include net foreign investment and public investment, and K can include net foreign assets.

                                                          3
where w(t) is the real wage rate, equaling the marginal product of labor, and R(t) is the real rental price

of capital, equaling the marginal product of capital. 4 The real rate of return on capital and internal loans

in this one-sector-production-function model is

           (2)                       r(t) = R(t) – δ.

           The representative consumer chooses C(t) over time to maximize overall utility. In the usual

setup, as presented in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004, Ch. 2), the steady-state real interest rate is

determined by parameters related to time preference and intertemporal substitution and by technical

progress, typically assumed to be labor-augmenting. This technical change can be exogenous or

endogenous. Correspondingly, the common steady-state growth rate of Y(t), C(t), K(t), and w(t)L(t) is a

constant, g≥0, which is the sum of the constant growth rate of labor (corresponding to constant

population growth) and the constant rate of technical progress. In a stochastic version of this model,

the steady-state expected real rate of return on capital depends also on risk aversion and on parameters

related to uncertainty in the production process. 5

           The present analysis simplifies by assuming that the expected real rate of return on capital, r(t),

is constant throughout at its steady-state value, denoted by r. The rate r exceeds the constant safe real

interest rate by an amount that corresponds to the equity premium. More generally, r does not have to

be constant and can be viewed as an average of present and expected future real rates of return on

capital.

           The intertemporal budget constraint for the representative household, starting from the current

date t, is
                                      ∞                                     ∞
           (3)             𝐾𝐾(𝑡𝑡) + ∫𝑡𝑡 𝑤𝑤(𝑇𝑇)𝐿𝐿(𝑇𝑇)𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟(𝑇𝑇−𝑡𝑡) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = ∫𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶(𝑇𝑇)𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟(𝑇𝑇−𝑡𝑡) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.


4
 The uses of output in this one-sector model can be expanded to include perishable intermediate goods, which
enter into production of final goods. The production function F(∙) in equation (1) can then be viewed as applying to
value added. This setup works exactly if intermediates enter in fixed proportions with gross output; for example, if
an automobile always requires one ton of steel.
5
 See, for example, Barro (2009).

                                                              4
This constraint reflects the usual transversality or dynamic-efficiency condition, r>g. This condition

ensures that the “terminal value” of K(T) has a present value that asymptotes to zero as T tends to

infinity. 6 Empirically, r>g is satisfied if we measure r by the long-run average real rate of return on

equity (not the safe real interest rate) and g by the long-run average growth rate of output or

consumption. Reasonable values, discussed later, are r around 0.08 per year and g between 0.02 and

0.03 per year.

           Assume to simplify that real labor income, w(T)L(T) for T≥t, always grows at its constant steady-

state rate, g. If L(T) corresponds to population, which grows at a constant rate, then the assumption is

that w(T) always grows at its steady-state rate, which reflects labor-augmenting technological progress.

In this case, equation (3) simplifies to:
                                                                                    ∞
           (4)                  (𝑟𝑟 − 𝑔𝑔) ∙ 𝐾𝐾(𝑡𝑡) + 𝑤𝑤(𝑡𝑡)𝐿𝐿(𝑡𝑡) = (𝑟𝑟 − 𝑔𝑔) ∙ ∫𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶(𝑇𝑇)𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟(𝑇𝑇−𝑡𝑡) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.

If consumption, C(T), also grew at the constant rate g (as it does in the steady state), the right side of

equation (4) would simplify to C(t). More generally, the right side can be viewed, in the spirit of Milton

Friedman (1957, Ch.2), as “permanent consumption.” Permanent consumption at time t is defined as

the flow that, when growing at the steady-state rate g, has a present value equal to the actual one,
    ∞
∫𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶(𝑇𝑇)𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟(𝑇𝑇−𝑡𝑡) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.

           The perspective of the left side of equation (4) allows for an evaluation of three concepts of

product or income, differing only by the rate of return associated with K(t). The first is gross domestic

product, Y; 7 the second is net domestic product, which equals national income, Yn, for a closed

economy; the third, labeled Y*, can be viewed as “permanent income” (equal to the permanent

setting.

 For an open economy, the corresponding measure is gross national product, which includes net foreign assets
in K(t). The labor L(t) still refers to domestic residents if workers all work in their home country.

                                                                   5
consumption mentioned before) and corresponds to the left side of equation (4). Hence, the suggested

alternatives are:

        (5a)     GDP: Y(t) = RK(t) + w(t)L(t) = (r+δ)∙K(t) + w(t)L(t),

        (5b)     Net domestic product or national income: Yn(t) = (R-δ)∙K(t) + w(t)L(t) = rK(t) + w(t)L(t),

        (5c)     Permanent income: Y*(t) = (r-g)∙K(t) + w(t)L(t).


        A. Capital income and labor income

        A natural measure of capital income is rK(t), which enters along with labor income, w(t)L(t), in

national income, Yn, in equation (5b). This concept uses r, the net real rate of return on capital, to gauge

capital income, and the capital-income share of national income would be the ratio of rK(t) to Yn. The

labor-income share of national income is then one minus the capital-income share. However, while this

approach delivers meaningful results at a point in time, it does not work well in the context of the

intertemporal budget constraint in equations (3) and (4).

        If K(t) is the capital stock at the current date t, then (with r constant) rK(t) is the flow of

consumption that could be sustained forever out of this capital stock. The present value of this flow is

obviously just K(t). In contrast, if w(T)L(T) for T≥t is always growing at the constant rate g (where 0≤g<r),

then w(t)L(t)/(r-g) is the present value of consumption that can be sustained by the present and future

flows of labor income. Therefore, in an intertemporal context, K(t) and w(t)L(t)/(r-g) are the comparable

present-value objects. Or, in terms of flows, (r-g)K(t) and w(t)L(t) are the parallel income terms. That is,

because w(T)L(T) is growing for T≥t, w(t)L(t) counts more than one-to-one with rK(t) in the intertemporal

budget constraint. Specifically, with w(T)L(T) growing at the constant rate g, the downward adjustment

of rK(t) to (r-g)K(t) is the correct one. Therefore, the terms (r-g)K(t) and w(t)L(t) enter in parallel form

into permanent income, Y*(t), in equation (5c). Thus, to compute a capital-income share from an

intertemporal perspective, the natural measure is the ratio of (r-g)K(t) to Y*(t). The labor-income share

of permanent income is then one minus this capital-income share.

                                                        6
        The assumed constancy of r and g is unimportant for the basic approach. More generally, r can

be viewed as an average of current and expected future real rates of return on capital, and g can be

viewed as an average of expected future growth rates of real labor income. The identification of r with

the (constant) steady-state real rate of return and of g with the (constant) steady-state growth rate of

real labor income are just approximations. However, these identifications do make the computation of

permanent income in equation (5c) readily implementable from an empirical standpoint. Permanent

income, Y*(t), is just the subtraction of (δ+g)∙K(t) from the standard GDP, Y(t), in equation (5a), whereas

national income, Yn(t), in equation (5b) is, as usual, the subtraction of δK(t) from Y(t). (In practice, these

calculations would associate different values of δ with different types of capital.)

        One approach that seems to have no economic rationale is the standard one that identifies

capital income with RK(t) in equation (5a). The capital-income share is then the ratio of RK(t) to Y(t), and

the labor-income share is one minus this capital-income share. This calculation is not meaningful

economically because R is a gross rental price that does not net out depreciation, at rate δ, to compute

a net real rate of return on capital. Since RK(t) is not a measure of net income, the ratio of these gross

rental payments to Y(t) is not an income share. Moreover, as discussed below, with reasonable

parameters, this standard method sharply overstates the capital share of product and income. The

computation of the capital-income share from national income also overstates the share from an

intertemporal perspective but by not nearly as much as the share based on GDP.


        B. Double-counting of product and income

        As already noted, the only true final goods for households are consumption, C(t), at various

dates. Correspondingly, the intertemporal budget constraint for the representative household involves
                                       ∞
the financing of the present value ∫𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶(𝑇𝑇)𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟(𝑇𝑇−𝑡𝑡) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑, which appears on the right sides of

equations (3) and (4). Meaningful concepts of product and income should have a present value equal to



                                                        7
    ∞
∫𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶(𝑇𝑇)𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟(𝑇𝑇−𝑡𝑡) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑. 8 The standard concepts of GDP and national income do not satisfy this condition

because saving and investment are double-counted (to differing degrees). 9 As an example, suppose that

a household receives one extra unit of labor income, w(t)L(t), at time t. This unit appears one-to-one in

the household’s overall present value of income. But if this unit is saved (invested) at time t, the return

on this savings appears again in future income and product. Hence, there is double-counting in the

calculated present values.

        To calculate the extent of double-counting, consider the full steady state, where K(T) grows

along with w(T)L(T) and C(T) at the constant rate g. In that case, the present values starting at date t of

the three proposed concepts of income in equation (5) are:

        (6a)     GDP, Y: present value = K(t)∙(r+δ)/(r-g) + w(t)L(t)/(r-g),

        (6b)     National income, Yn: present value = K(t)∙r/(r-g) + w(t)L(t)/(r-g),

        (6c)     Permanent income, Y*: present value = K(t) + w(t)L(t)/(r-g).

        The permanent-income concept in equation (6c) corresponds from equations (3) and (4) to the

present value of C(T), which grows in the steady state at rate g. Hence, for permanent income, there is

no double-counting of saving and investment in the steady state.

        In equation (6b), the double-counting for national income involves the term that includes K(t).

The excess of this term over K(t) equals K(t)∙g/(r-g). In the steady state, the K(t)∙g part of this expression

equals net investment, which grows at rate g in the steady state, and K(t)∙g/(r-g) is the present value of

this flow. Hence, the double-counting equals the present value of net investment. That is, the standard

concepts of national income and net product count net investment once when it occurs and include the

same present value again when adding up the future returns realized on this investment. Therefore, in

the steady state, national income involves precisely double-counting of net investment.




The focus on the present value of consumption accords with the setup in Weitzman (1976).
8

This result applies as much to an individual’s intertemporal accounting as to national accounting.

                                                        8
        In equation (6a), the double-counting for GDP involves the term that includes K(t). The excess of

this term over K(t) equals K(t)∙(δ+g)/(r-g). In the steady state, the K(t)∙(δ+g) part of this expression

equals gross investment, which grows at rate g in the steady state, and K(t)∙(δ+g)/(r-g) is the present

value of this flow. Hence, the double-counting equals the present value of gross investment. That is,

the standard concepts of GDP and the corresponding gross income count gross investment once when it

occurs and include the same present value again when adding up the future gross returns generated by

this investment. Hence, in the steady state, GDP exactly double-counts gross investment.

        The proportional double-counting of GDP and national income in the steady state depend on

the steady-state capital-output ratio, K/Y. To get quantitative insights on this ratio, suppose that the

neoclassical production function F(∙) in equation (1) is Cobb-Douglas with exponents α on K and 1-α on L:

        (7)                                 𝑌𝑌 = 𝐴𝐴 ∙ 𝐾𝐾 𝛼𝛼 𝐿𝐿1−𝛼𝛼 ,

where A>0 and 0<α<1. Perfect competition among goods producers implies the equation of the gross

marginal product of capital, given by αY/K, to R=r+δ. This condition implies from equation (7) that K/Y is

constant in the steady state and given by:

                                            𝐾𝐾        𝛼𝛼
        (8)                                      =           .
                                            𝑌𝑌       𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿

        The difference between Y(t) and Y*(t) from equations (5a) and (5c) implies that the flow of

double-counting in GDP equals (δ+g)∙K(t). Using equation (8), the ratio of this double-counting to Y is

constant in the steady state and given by:

                                                                       𝛼𝛼∙(𝛿𝛿+𝑔𝑔)
        (9)               Ratio of GDP double-counting to GDP =                  .
                                                                         𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿

This double-counting is nil when δ=g=0 (so that there is no gross investment in the steady state). As a

quantitative example, suppose that α=0.40, δ=0.09 per year, g=0.03 per year, and r=0.08 per year. 10 In



10
  These parameters are motivated mostly by U.S. data. The value of δ is an average of the economic depreciation
rates (weighted by “income shares”) for the five categories of U.S. capital considered in Barro and Furman (2018,
Table 3). The value for g corresponds to the long-run average growth rate of real GDP. (The U.S. long-term

                                                                 9
this case, the ratio given in equation (9) equals 0.28. 11 That is, in the steady state with reasonable

parameters, GDP overstates permanent income (and permanent consumption) by 28%. 12

        An analogous exercise applies to the double-counting ratio for national income. The result in

the steady state is:
                                                                                           𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼
        (10)     Ratio of national-income double-counting to national income =                    .
                                                                                       𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿(1−𝛼𝛼)


This double-counting is nil when g=0 (so that there is no net investment in the steady state). Using the

parameters noted above, we get that national income overstates permanent income in the steady state

by 0.09. That is, in the steady state with reasonable parameters, national income overstates permanent

income by 9%. Hence, the netting out of depreciation substantially reduces the over-counting of income

(from 28% to 9%) but does not eliminate it.


        C. Thoughts on the double-counting of product and income

        The double-counting in product and income measures arises because these concepts include

gross or net investment and also include the gross or net returns on past investments. Thus, for GDP in

equation (1), I(t) appears in the middle of the equation, and the gross return on past investments,

R(t)K(t), enters on the right side of the equation. A reasonable idea is that the double-counting for GDP

could be eliminated by excluding one or the other of these two terms. 13 Similarly, for national income,




average of 0.035 is close to that, 0.030, for a group of 11 OECD countries with long-term data.) The value for α
approximates estimates of Fernald (2014) for the United States in recent years. The value for r corresponds to an
average of the (arithmetic) real rate of return on equity (0.081 for the United States, 0.073 for 11 OECD countries
with long-term data) from an updated version of the numbers in Barro and Ursua (2008, Table 5). The underlying
data come mostly from Global Financial Data. The calculated real rates of return are net of taxes levied on
corporations; a value for r gross of business taxes (corresponding more closely to the marginal product of capital)
would be higher. However, a lower value of r would be appropriate to allow for the influence of leverage on the
rate of return on equity.
11
  With the assumed parameter values, the steady-state K/Y from equation (8) equals 2.4 (in units of years).
12
  An alternative is to look at the ratio of U.S. gross private fixed domestic investment to GDP—which averaged 0.17
from 1950 to 2018. However, this measure excludes public investment, which averaged 0.05 relative to GDP.
13
  To maintain the equality in equation (1), an adjustment to one term—I(t) in the middle or R(t)K(t) on the right—
requires a corresponding adjustment in the other term.

one might think of eliminating either net investment, I(t)-δK(t), or the net return on past

investments, r(t)K(t).

        The first possibility is to define net income by omitting gross capital income, R(t)K(t), in the

measure of gross income on the right side of equation (1). 14 This exclusion implies that only labor

income, w(t)L(t), appears in net income. However, it is clear from equations (3) and (4) that the present

value of labor income falls short of the present value of consumption. That is, the “initial” capital

stock, K(t), is a resource that should be included along with the present value of labor income when

assessing possibilities for present and future consumption in the intertemporal budget constraint, as in

equation (3). It may be that, in the far distant past, there was no initial capital (though that is unclear),

so that only labor is an ultimate source of income and production. 15 However, once the economy has

arrived at time t, prior costs of investment associated with the creation of K(t) are sunk, and this initial

capital stock should be regarded as a resource for financing consumption from time t into the future. 16

        The second possibility is to define net product by subtracting gross investment, I(t), from gross

product in the middle of equation (1). That is, all of investment would be 100% expensed at the time it

occurs. 17 In this case, net product equals consumption, C(t). 18 One attractive feature of this approach is




14
  This procedure is effectively followed in the national accounts for government owned capital, which is assumed
to have a positive estimated depreciation rate but a net real rate of return of zero.
15
  However, as is well-known, when the production function satisfies the standard neoclassical properties—as is
true for the Cobb-Douglas form in equation (7)—no output can be produced when K=0.
16
  This viewpoint accords with Hulten’s (1979) setup.
17
  The standard national accounts (BEA [2017], United Nations [2009]) take this approach for intermediate goods
that last less than one year. This approach was also followed by the BEA for intellectual-property products until
the revisions in 1999 and 2013 and by the United Nations until the revisions in 1993 and 2008.
18
  Consumption should be interpreted here as the sum of private and public consumption. As noted before, the
identification of production with consumption accords with Kuznets (1941, p. 46). Yet, in defining net national
product and national income, Kuznets (1941, p. 266) always included investment, net of estimated depreciation, as
part of the production of final goods: “By final goods, we mean commodities and services in the form in which …
they are used by ultimate consumers in households or by consumers of durable capital equipment in business and
other economic enterprises. They include fully finished consumer goods reaching ultimate consumers, fully
finished construction of all types, and durable capital equipment reaching the economic enterprises that use it in
the production process. … The values of construction and durable equipment are net, i.e., the remainder left after
an allowance has been made for the construction and equipment consumed during the year … “ This Kuznets

                                                       11
that the present value of this definition of net product obviously equals the present value of

consumption. Moreover, the identification of net product with consumption would be satisfactory if

one limited attention to a steady state.

         Outside of a steady state, the full expensing of gross investment in the definition of net product

is problematic. Consider, as an example, a shift at time t between C(t) and I(t) for a given total of

output, Y(t), on the left side of equation (1). 19 This shift might be motivated by a temporary opportunity

for investment or by a temporarily high or low value attached to consumption. Specifically, suppose

that C(t) declines and I(t) rises for some length of time, so that the expanded capital stock allows for

higher C(T) in the future. The identification of net product with C(t) would imply that current net

product declines, although the present value of consumption dictated by the intertemporal budget

constraint in equations (3) and (4) does not change. Thus, the full expensing of gross investment at each

point in time implies that the proposed measure of current net product (i.e. current consumption) gives

an inaccurate picture of intertemporal consumption possibilities outside of the steady state.

         For permanent income, Y*(t), as defined in equation (5c), measured net product and income do

not change when C(t) and I(t) shift at time t for given Y(t). From the comparison with GDP in

equation (5a), Y*(t) effectively applies 100% expensing only to the flow of gross investment, (δ+g)∙K(t),

that arises in the steady state (or on average in the future when g is not precisely constant). This

amount of expensing does not change at time t when C(t) and I(t) shift for given Y(t).

         The more general idea is that one would like a notion of current income that reveals, to the

extent feasible, the possibilities for consumption in a full intertemporal sense. In the example just

considered, to get the “right answer,” one would have to factor in that the decline in current




procedure is consistent with the one established by Meade and Stone (1941), which later evolved into the U.N.
System of National Accounts (SNA), described in United Nations (1993, 2009).
19
  The assumption is still that r is constant at its steady-state value and that w(T)L(T) always grows at its steady-
state rate, g. However, these conditions could be relaxed.

                                                          12
consumption, C(t), is accompanied by a corresponding rise in the present value of (expected) future

consumption, C(T). This approach is not operational from a national-accounting perspective because it

requires measurement at time t not only of C(t) but also of (expected) future C(T). Permanent income,

Y*(t), as defined in equation (5c), works here because—by remaining unchanged 20—it accurately

reflects the reality that the present value of consumption is unchanged. Moreover, aside from knowing

the parameters δ and g, the calculation of Y*(t) requires knowledge only of the current variables Y(t)

and K(t).

         In terms of practical measurement, it is worth stressing that, starting from the computed

GDP, Y(t), in equation (5a), the calculation of permanent income, Y*(t), in equation (5c) is a

straightforward extension of the usual practice of deducting depreciation to compute net product or

national income, Yn(t), as in equation (5b). That is, national income subtracts δK(t) from Y(t), 21 and

permanent income in equation (5c) goes further to subtract “effective depreciation,” (δ+g)K(t),

from Y(t). In other words, the effective depreciation rate is δ+g, rather than δ, and the g part



20
  In the example presented, the measured Y*(T) would rise over time, compared to its previous path, to reflect the
boost to the capital stock, K(T) for T≥t, generated by the short-term cut in consumption. That is, by cutting
consumption in the short run, the economy really can sustain a higher present value of consumption when
calculated in the future.
21
  Kuznets stressed that estimating depreciation is crucial for computing net concepts of product and income but
that the measurement of depreciation is difficult. (Much later, Hulten and Wykoff [1981] pioneered the use of
observed prices of used capital goods of different vintages to infer depreciation rates.) Kuznets (1941, pp. 41-42)
said: “What fraction of the durable capital good is consumed during the given period? The signs that would
indicate that this or that fraction of a machine’s total useful life or capacity has been absorbed are few. There are
few reliable data even on total useful life and capacity. Consequently, estimates by business enterprises of current
consumption of durable capital are exceedingly crude … The investigator must accept these estimates … To
prevent distortion of the national income total and its distribution, estimates of intermediate consumption must
be complete.” In comparing net product with gross product, Kuznets (1937, p. 3) noted some advantages of the
gross measures: “Of … several possible concepts of gross national product one appears of greater importance than
the others, that in which the value of commodities and services produced is not adjusted for the value of durable
capital goods consumed in the process of production, but is adjusted for raw materials, partly fabricated products
and fuel consumed. It is this concept that is referred to … as gross national product … [which] has the advantage of
being a variable that can be measured more accurately than net national product. More important is the fact that
the replacement of durable capital goods in use by new commodities is not as rigidly controlled by technical
considerations as is the replacement of raw materials … over short periods the stock of capital equipment may be
treated as indestructible, and its consumption in the process of production neglected. … Consequently, in addition
to net national product or national income, we also measure gross national product …”

                                                         13
corresponds to an average of expected future rates of economic growth. Just as the calculation of

national income requires an estimate of the depreciation rate, δ, the calculation of permanent income

requires also an estimate of the expected long-run economic growth rate, g. Empirically, the estimation

of g actually seems less challenging than the estimation of δ (which, in practice, varies greatly across

types of capital).

        Note that, as long as the key parameters and measurement procedures are fixed, the

double-counting problem affects computed levels of standard macroeconomic aggregates but need not

affect growth rates, including the steady-state growth rate, g. In the steady state, all of the measures

related to product and income—including real GDP, real national income, permanent income, capital

stock, real labor income, and consumption—grow at the same rate, g.

        The level effects are important, however, and do not involve merely a normalization for the

calculated level of real GDP. The double-counting issue affects ratios of GDP or national income to

consumption. For example, in the steady state, the ratio of C to GDP is:

                         𝐶𝐶       𝐼𝐼       (𝛿𝛿+𝑔𝑔)𝐾𝐾         𝛼𝛼∙(𝛿𝛿+𝑔𝑔)
        (11)                  =1− =1−                  =1−             ,
                         𝑌𝑌       𝑌𝑌          𝑌𝑌               (𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿)



where the last result uses the formula for steady-state K/Y with a Cobb-Douglas production function

from equation (8). The last term on the right side of equation (11) is the ratio of GDP double-counting

to GDP, as contained in equation (9). This term reveals the proportionate extent to which C falls short of

Y in the steady state; that is, it indicates by how much production (real GDP) proportionately overstates

the resources available for consumption.

         The level effects are also important for comparisons across countries. The central idea of the

International Comparison Program (ICP) is to use estimated purchasing-power parities (PPPs) to

construct levels of real per capita GDP that can be compared among countries at a point in




                                                        14
time. 22 These cross-sectional comparisons would be affected by the double-counting issue if the

problem were more serious in some countries than in others. Specifically, countries with higher capital-

output ratios, K/Y—reflecting higher propensities to save and invest—would tend to have greater over-

statement in levels of real per capita GDP. The “contribution” of saving and investment to a central

measure of economic development—the PPP adjusted real per capita GDP—is, therefore, mechanically

exaggerated. 23


        D. Capital-income shares

        As mentioned before, income shares of capital and labor can be calculated corresponding to the

three concepts of product and income in equation (5). The analysis here assumes the Cobb-Douglas

form of the production function in equation (7).

        For GDP (equation [5a]), capital’s rental price, R=r+δ, is equated to its gross marginal product,

which equals α∙Y/K. Therefore, as usual, the ratio of capital’s gross rental income, (r+δ)∙K(t), to Y(t)

equals α, which was set at 0.40 in the previous examples. As noted before, this standard concept does

not correspond to a capital-income share because gross rental income is not a measure of net income.

However, if one takes seriously the Cobb-Douglas form of the production function, as in equation (7),

then the standard “capital-income share” is interesting as a measure of the exponent α, which gives the

elasticity of output, Y(t), with respect to the capital stock, K(t).

        For national income, the income on capital in equation (5b) is rK(t), which depends on the net

rate of return, r, rather than the return gross of depreciation, R=r+δ. The ratio of rK(t) to national

income, Y(t)-δK(t), in the steady state can be determined to equal:

  This program was begun in 1968 as a joint venture of the United Nations and the University of Pennsylvania and
is now directed by the World Bank in connection with the United Nations. For a conceptual discussion, see
Summers and Heston (1991) and Feenstra, Inklaar, and Timmer (2015).
23
  This conclusion applies also to level comparisons across countries that are based on observed exchange rates,
rather than purchasing-power parities.

                                                       15
                                                                    𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟
        (12)               National-income capital share =                 .
                                                               𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿(1−𝛼𝛼)


This share equals α when δ=0 (in which case national income equals GDP, and net investment equals

gross investment). Using the parameter values assumed before for r, δ, and α, the national-income

capital share in equation (12) is 0.24, sharply below the standard number of α=0.40.

        For permanent income, the income on capital in equation (5c) is (r-g)∙K(t). The ratio to

permanent income, Y*(t), in the steady state can be determined to equal:

                                                                      (𝑟𝑟−𝑔𝑔)∙𝛼𝛼
        (13)               Permanent-income capital share =                          .
                                                                  𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿(1−𝛼𝛼)−𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔


This share equals α when δ=g=0 (in which case permanent income equals GDP, and net and gross

investment are both zero in the steady state). Using the parameter values assumed before for r, δ, g,

and α, the permanent-income capital share in equation (13) is 0.16, less than half of the standard share

number of α=0.40.


        E. Input-output tables

        Another issue is that the treatment of investment as a final good affects the BEA’s main input-

output tables, which apply across industries. 24 Goods treated as perishable (materials and

intermediates) show up in these tables as flows from one sector to another. Goods viewed as durable

investments are treated instead as final goods, which appear, along with consumption, as a final-good

use of products. The BEA does generate Capital Flow Tables, last produced for 1997, which provide an

input-output analysis for newly produced structures, equipment, and software. These tables apply to

investment, not to the flows of rental services on capital that would enter as inputs into production.

        As discussed in the next section, the BEA revised its accounting procedures in 1999 and 2013 to

capitalize some types of intellectual-property products. Before the revisions, these products—such as

software and R&D—entered into the BEA’s main input-output tables as flows of non-durable goods from



 For a discussion of these tables, see Young, et al. (2015).
24


                                                          16
one industry to another. After the revisions, these outlays were treated as final goods (investments)

that no longer appeared in the flows across sectors. 25

        An alternative procedure would treat estimated rental services on durable investments, such as

machines, as flows of services from one sector to another. These amounts would arise naturally if

capital goods were literally rented by producers (say manufacturers of machines) to users (say

construction companies or farmers). Importantly, these rental flows would not be contemporaneous

with the investments themselves. Conceivably, the information that underlies the BEA’s Capital Use

Tables could be used to construct an input-output analysis of rental services.


II. Examples of Capital in the National Accounts

        The model applies directly to several forms of capital in the national accounts, including

business equipment and non-residential structures. Issues arise for other types of “capital.”

Remarkably, the standard treatment of investment and capital varies substantially across forms of

capital and not in ways that are readily understandable from the viewpoints of economic concepts or

practicalities of measurement.

        The model can address issues with different forms of capital from an extension to allow for two

types, K1 and K2. Hence, the Cobb-Douglas production function from equation (7) is extended to:
                                               𝛼𝛼    𝛼𝛼
        (14)                      𝑌𝑌 = 𝐴𝐴 ∙ 𝐾𝐾1 1 𝐾𝐾2 2 𝐿𝐿1−𝛼𝛼1 −𝛼𝛼2 ,

where α1>0, α2≥0, and 0<α1+α2<1. GDP now equals consumption, C, plus the two types of gross

investment, I1 and I2. To simplify the algebra, the two depreciations rates, δ1 and δ2, are assumed to be

the same and equal to δ. In this case, the prior results on double-counting of product and income and

on capital shares continue to apply, with the substitution of α1+α2 for α in the various equations.

If α1+α2 = 0.40, the value assumed before for α, the previous numerical results continue to hold.




 Xiang Ding brought this point to my attention.

                                                            17
        A. Intellectual property

        In the first application, K2 is identified with intellectual property, a form of intangible capital. In

its 1999 and 2013 revisions to the national accounts, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) included

categories of intellectual property—software in 1999, research & development and artistic originals in

2013—as capital goods, analogous to equipment and structures. 26 Intellectual property is now a large

item, constituting 26% of U.S. private fixed domestic investment in 2018. This category has grown

significantly over time, from 4% of private fixed investment in 1950 and 10% in 1980 (see bea.gov).

        Barro and Furman (2018, Table 3) estimated for 2017 that the intellectual property category

constituted 29% of the standard measure of the total capital-income share of GDP, which corresponds

to α1+α2 in equation (14). Therefore, the parameters α1=0.28 and α2=0.12 (which add to 0.40) should

provide a reasonable approximation to the production-function parameters.

        Suppose now that equation (14) represents the true production function throughout, but that

the BEA changed its measurement in 1999 and 2013 to capitalize the investment expenses that

underlie K2. Capitalization for investments underlying K1 applies throughout. The assumption is that the

BEA is now generating “accurate” measures of the two gross investment measures, I1 and I2, and of the

associated capital stocks, K1 and K2. However, prior to 1999, the BEA reported I2=K2=0; that is, outlays on

intellectual property were treated as current expenses and were, therefore, netted out in the

calculation of business value added.

        In the old system, measured GDP equals C+ I1; that is, I2.is excluded. In this sense, measured

GDP understates true GDP. Recall, however, that true GDP is an overestimate not only of national

income but also of permanent income, which is superior to GDP or national income as an intertemporal

gauge of consumption possibilities. Therefore, it is possible (actually likely) that the improvement in




26
  Similarly, the U.N.’s 2008 System of National Accounts capitalizes some outlays on intellectual property products,
including software, R&D, and artistic originals. See United Nations (2009).

                                                        18
measured GDP is accompanied by a worsening of measurement for purposes of gauging permanent

income and consumption.

        On the income side, the old system has labor income wL and rental income RK1 arising from the

first type of capital and treated here as observable. With this approach, a residual capital income

attaches to the second type of capital, K2—because this intellectual property is actually durable and

productive but is not measured that way. Measured GDP in the old system is:

        (15)     𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 = 𝐶𝐶 + 𝐼𝐼1 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 + R𝐾𝐾1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2 .

True GDP (assumed to be measured in accordance with current BEA practice) includes 𝐼𝐼2 and R𝐾𝐾2 and is

given by:

        (16)                𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 = 𝐶𝐶 + 𝐼𝐼1 + 𝐼𝐼2 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 + R𝐾𝐾1 + R𝐾𝐾2 .

Note that the factor incomes on the right side of equation (16) are assumed to exhaust the true GDP.

Also, the factor prices, w and R, and the quantities, C, 𝐼𝐼1 , and 𝐾𝐾1 , are the same in the measured and true

cases, given the assumption that BEA measurement choices affect nothing real. A further assumption is

that the same rental price, R, applies to 𝐾𝐾1 and 𝐾𝐾2 (although differences in depreciation rates would

create a divergence here).

        The residual capital income of type 2 can be computed from equations (15) and (16) as:

        (17)     𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2 = 𝑅𝑅𝐾𝐾2 − 𝐼𝐼2 = (𝑟𝑟 + 𝛿𝛿)𝐾𝐾2 − 𝐼𝐼2.

In the steady state, 𝐼𝐼2 =(δ+g)𝐾𝐾2 , and the expression on the right side simplifies to (r-g)𝐾𝐾2 . Note that this

expression for type-2 capital income takes exactly the form of the “net” capital income that enters into

the definition of permanent income in equation (5c). That is, the old system of national accounts gets

the right answer for the 𝐾𝐾2 part of capital income in the steady state because it effectively expenses

(nets out) the investment outlay 𝐼𝐼2 in the measurement of GDP in equation (15). Outside of the steady

state, however, this full expensing is problematic because it implies, along the lines discussed before,

that a shift currently between C and 𝐼𝐼2 would affect measured GDP in equation (15).


                                                                 19
        Another way to look at the results is that the revisions of the national accounts to capitalize

intellectual property worsened the double-counting problem for GDP. The computations in Section I.B,

based on a set of reasonable parameters and a Cobb-Douglas form of the production function, found

that, in the steady state, the BEA’s current procedure double-counted GDP when compared to

permanent income and consumption by 28%. The pre-1999 BEA system avoided this problem with

respect to the intellectual property part of investment and capital stock. Using parameters already

described, including α1=0.28 and α2=0.12, the double-counting of GDP compared to permanent income

in the steady state in the pre-1999 system turns out to be 20%, rather than 28%. To put it another way,

the combined impact of the 1999 and 2013 revisions of the national accounts with respect to

intellectual property is to worsen the double-counting problem by 8 percentage points.

        The BEA’s revised treatment of intellectual property also affects the computed capital-income

share of GDP. This idea is stressed by Koh, Santaeulalia-Llopis, and Zheng (2018). In the BEA’s current

system, the usually calculated capital-income share is α1+α2=0.40. In the old system, in the steady state,

type-2 gross investment, (δ+g)K2, is subtracted from GDP and from rental income. Therefore, the

capital-income share of GDP in the steady state is

                                                                           𝑅𝑅∙(𝐾𝐾1 +𝐾𝐾2 )−(𝛿𝛿+𝑔𝑔)𝐾𝐾2
                          𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 =         𝑌𝑌−(𝛿𝛿+𝑔𝑔)𝐾𝐾2


With the Cobb-Douglas form of the production function in equation (13), this result becomes:

                                                                           𝛼𝛼1 (𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿)+𝛼𝛼2 (𝑟𝑟−𝑔𝑔)
        (18)              𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 =                           .
                                                                              𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿−𝛼𝛼2 (𝑟𝑟+𝑔𝑔)


Using the parameter values from before, this expression equals 0.33, as contrasted with the standard

number of 0.40. That is, the combined 1999 and 2013 revisions in the BEA’s measurement of

intellectual property can “explain” a rise in the capital-income share of GDP from 0.33 to 0.40. This

result accords roughly with the calculations in Koh, Santaeulalia-Llopis, and Zheng (2018, Figure 1). 27


 Their results allow for comparisons of capital-income shares across concepts (for example, with or without
27

capitalization of intellectual property investment) and over time within concepts.

Recall also that the permanent-income capital share in equation (12) is only around 0.16, far below

either the old or new GDP-based values.


         B. Home production and consumer durables

         Not all aspects of standard national accounting generate over-statements of product and

income from the perspective of gauging consumption possibilities. The most important sources of

under-statement likely involve the neglect of most home production and the informal or black-market

economy. 28 The BEA recognizes these sources of understatement of production and income and has

tried to rectify this problem with respect to home production through the construction of “satellite

accounts” that include estimates of the amount of this form of economic activity. (See Bridgman, et al.

[2012] and Bridgman [2016].) This section deals with home production, though an analysis of the

informal sector would be similar in form.

         Household production involves consumer durables, including households’ ownership of

automobiles, furniture, appliances, and so on. Households’ ownership of houses is treated differently in

the national accounts, as discussed in the next section.

         Suppose in equation (14) that K1 represents capital goods used in the market (such as

businesses’ equipment and structures), and K2 represents capital goods used in home production. The

standard GDP comprises consumption of market goods, C1; gross investment, I1, in market capital; and

gross investment, I2, in home capital. The last item constitutes purchases of consumer durables and is



28
  Kuznets (1941, p. 20) argued for the exclusion of most non-market activities, including illegal transactions: “ … of
the net money receipts by individuals from ordinary market transactions or other sources the following are
excluded: … products of illegal activities, such as smuggling, racketeering, bootlegging, and drug peddling.” This
measurement procedure is still followed in the United States; for example, the BEA (2017, p. 2-2) says: “… illegal
activities, such as gambling and prostitution in some states, should in principle be included in measures of
production. However, these activities are excluded from the U.S. accounts because they are by their very nature
conducted out of sight of public scrutiny and so data are not available to measure them.” In contrast with the U.S.
procedure, estimates of the underground or informal economy and of illegal activity are included in GDP to some
extent in some countries. For example, these activities are included in the formal setup of the U.N.’s System of
National Accounts for 2008 (see United Nations [2009, Section 6.9ff and Ch. 25]).


                                                          21
included in the standard national accounts as part of personal consumer expenditure, rather than gross

investment. Home production is assumed to go entirely to home consumption, C2.

        The standard GDP is generated by market capital and labor and is given as an extension of

equation (1) by:

        (19)                 𝑌𝑌1 = 𝐹𝐹(𝐾𝐾1 , 𝐿𝐿1 ) = 𝐶𝐶1 + 𝐼𝐼1 + 𝐼𝐼2 = 𝑤𝑤𝐿𝐿1 + 𝑅𝑅𝐾𝐾1 .

Analogously, home production depends on home capital and labor and is given by:

        (20)                            𝑌𝑌2 = 𝐺𝐺(𝐾𝐾2 , 𝐿𝐿2 ) = 𝐶𝐶2 = 𝑤𝑤𝐿𝐿2 + 𝑅𝑅𝐾𝐾2 .

The production functions F(∙) and G(∙) satisfy the usual neoclassical properties. The change in each

capital stock equals gross investment less depreciation, where the two depreciation rates are assumed

to be the same and equal to δ. The assumption in equation (20) is that home labor and capital have

associated shadow prices, w and R, that are the same as those of market labor and capital, respectively.

This assumption would be valid if households can readily shift time and capital between home and

market uses (ignoring taxes and assuming that time spent at market and home work are the same from

a utility perspective). Note in equation (19) that measured GDP excludes home production and

consumption, 𝑌𝑌2 and 𝐶𝐶2 , and gross income excludes home wage and rental income, 𝑤𝑤𝐿𝐿2 and 𝑅𝑅𝐾𝐾2 .

        As before, the market production function F(∙) in equation (19) is assumed to be Cobb-Douglas

with capital exponent α, as in equation (7). Going further, the home production function G(∙) in

equation (20) is also assumed to be Cobb-Douglas with capital exponent α. In this setup, which features

equal capital intensities for producing market and home goods, the relative price of market and home

consumption goods is fixed on the supply side, with the division between 𝐶𝐶1 and 𝐶𝐶2 determined only by

preferences. In this case, the intertemporal budget constraint from equation (3) can be expressed

directly in terms of total consumption, 𝐶𝐶1 +𝐶𝐶2 :
                                  ∞                                                     ∞
 (21)     𝐾𝐾1 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝐾𝐾2 (𝑡𝑡) + ∫𝑡𝑡 𝑤𝑤(𝑇𝑇) ∙ [𝐿𝐿1 (𝑇𝑇)+𝐿𝐿2 (𝑇𝑇)]𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟(𝑇𝑇−𝑡𝑡) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = ∫𝑡𝑡 [𝐶𝐶1 (𝑇𝑇) + 𝐶𝐶2 (𝑇𝑇)]𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟(𝑇𝑇−𝑡𝑡) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.




                                                                22
If w(T)L1(T) and w(T)L2(T) each grow at every date at the steady-state rate g, equation (21) becomes (as

an extension of equation [4]):
                                                                                                         ∞
     (22)   (𝑟𝑟 − 𝑔𝑔) ∙ [𝐾𝐾1 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝐾𝐾2 (𝑡𝑡)] + 𝑤𝑤(𝑡𝑡) ∙ [𝐿𝐿1 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝐿𝐿2 (𝑡𝑡)] = (𝑟𝑟 − 𝑔𝑔) ∙ ∫𝑡𝑡 [𝐶𝐶1 (𝑇𝑇) + 𝐶𝐶2 (𝑇𝑇)]𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟(𝑇𝑇−𝑡𝑡) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.

            The left side of equation (22) equals permanent income, Y*(t), as discussed earlier. The

difference between GDP and permanent income includes, as before, the difference between RK1(t) and

(r-g)∙K1(t); that is, (δ+g)∙K1(t). A new effect is that GDP excludes the home production terms,

(r-g)∙K2(t)+w(t)L2(t). The net amount of GDP over-counting can be written as

            (23)     GDP over-counting = (𝛿𝛿 + 𝑔𝑔) ∙[𝐾𝐾1 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝐾𝐾2 (𝑡𝑡)] − 𝑌𝑌2 (𝑡𝑡).

            The usual conditions for a steady state (with Cobb-Douglas production functions) give the

capital-output ratios as K1/Y1 = K2/Y2 = α/(r+δ), as in equation (8). These results imply that the GDP over-

counting in equation (23) can be expressed relative to GDP, Y1, as:

                                                          𝛼𝛼∙(𝛿𝛿+𝑔𝑔)        𝑌𝑌           𝛼𝛼∙(𝛿𝛿+𝑔𝑔)
            (24)     (GDP over-counting)/GDP =                         − �𝑌𝑌2 � ∙ [1 −     (𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿)
                                                                                                    ].
                                                            (𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿)          1


In the steady state, Y2/Y1 = K2/K1 = I2/I1, and the last ratio can be calculated from numbers on purchases

of consumer durables (I2) and gross private fixed domestic investment (taken as a measure of I1 29). For

example, for 2017, the ratio I2/I1 equals 0.42. In that case, with the previously used parameters (α=0.40,

δ=0.09, g=0.03, r=0.08), the first term on the right side of equation (24) is 0.28, as before, and the

second term is -0.30. Therefore, on net, GDP is under-counted by 2%; that is, the effect from the

omission of home production slightly more than offsets that from the double-counting of investment.

            An alternative procedure uses more detailed estimates of home production; for example,

Bridgman, et al. (2012) and Bridgman (2016) estimate from data on household time-use and consumer

durables that the ratio of U.S. home production to GDP was 0.37 in 1965 but only 0.23 in 2014. 30 Using



29
  This concept includes residential investment. An alternative would be to use gross private non-residential fixed
domestic investment.
30
  Bridgman, et al. (2012, p. 23) say: “The decline reflects the steadily decreasing number of hours households spent
on home production. In 1965, men and women spent an average of 27 hours in home production, and by 2010, they

                                                                       23
the recent value of 0.23 to gauge Y2/Y1 in equation (24), 31 the second term on the right side of the

equation becomes -0.17. In this case, the net effect is an over-counting of GDP by 11%.

         Although the consideration of home production and consumer durables has a major impact on

GDP over-counting, it tends not to have major implications for the calculations of capital-income shares.

In the case just presented, the “capital-income share” computed by expanding GDP to include estimated

home production is still α=0.40 (because home production is assumed to have the same capital intensity

as market production). The capital-income shares associated with national income and permanent

income are adjusted downward in the same way as before; that is, with the previously used parameters,

they become 0.24 and 0.16, respectively.


         C. Housing

         Suppose now in equation (14) that the analysis treats K2 as housing and neglects other forms of

consumer durables. The variable Y2, which equals C2, now refers to household production of housing

services. Unlike other consumer durables, the standard national accounts include in GDP and

consumption the imputed rental income, RK2, on owner-occupied housing. 32 The rental income on

rental housing is also included in GDP. What is unclear is the treatment of home labor input, L2,



spent 22 hours. This overall decline reflects a drop in women’s home production from 40 hours to 26 hours, which
more than offset an increase in men’s hours from 14 hours to 17 hours.”
31
  However, the value 0.23 may be an under-estimate, because Bridgman (2016, p. 2) uses a low shadow wage rate
to value household time used in home production: “The value of general services is the product of wage rate of
general-purpose domestic workers and the number of hours of work.” For many household members, the value of
time would exceed the low wage rate received by domestic workers.
32
  This treatment appears in Kuznets (1941, p. 20). However, in an earlier analysis, Kuznets (1934, p. 12) suggested
that it might be better to omit this item: “ … there is some doubt as to the propriety of including this item
[imputed net rental income accruing to people living in their own homes] since the ownership of a home combined
with its possession does not constitute a participation by the proprietor in the economic activity of the nation in
the same recognized fashion as does his work for wages, profit, or salary, or his capital investment in industry. For
similar reasons, such an item as interest on durable goods owned has also been omitted.” The BEA says that one
motivation for its methodology on owner-occupied housing is “for GDP to be invariant when housing units shift
between tenant occupancy and owner occupancy” (Mayerhauser and Reinsdorf [2007]). (GDP is not invariant to
other shifts between renting or leasing and owning, such as for household automobiles and furniture.) The BEA
procedure estimates the imputed rental income on owner-occupied housing by observing “rents charged for
similar tenant-occupied buildings” (op. cit.). The owner-occupied housing part of housing services in personal
consumer expenditure includes also outlays on maintenance & repairs, property insurance, and a few other items.

                                                         24
associated with the production of housing services. Most of the associated payments (or shadow

payments), wL2, would not appear in GDP—that is, the value of occupants’ time expended on housing

services would be excluded. This omission is likely to be greater for owner-occupied housing than for

rental housing—if landlord-provided labor services (which appear in GDP) go beyond those purchased

on the market by owner-occupiers (and, therefore, included in GDP). However, the assumption here is

that wL2 is fully absent from GDP in both contexts.

        Because imputed or explicit rental income on housing appears in GDP, the expression for GDP

over-counting in equation (23) no longer involves subtraction of the full home production, Y2, on the

right side. Instead, the subtraction involves Y2-RK2, which equals the unmeasured home labor

income, wL2. Again assuming Cobb-Douglas production functions (with the same capital intensities for

market goods and for housing services), equation (24) is modified accordingly to:

                                                𝛼𝛼∙(𝛿𝛿+𝑔𝑔)        𝑌𝑌                 𝛼𝛼∙(𝛿𝛿+𝑔𝑔)
        (25)     (GDP over-counting)/GDP =                   − � 2 � ∙ [(1 − 𝛼𝛼) −     (𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿)
                                                                                                ].
                                                  (𝑟𝑟+𝛿𝛿)         𝑌𝑌1


Note that the term 1-α (corresponding to home labor earnings) appears within the brackets on the right

side of equation (25), whereas the term 1 appears in the comparable position in equation (24).

        In the steady state, Y2/Y1 = K2/K1 = I2/I1 again applies. The last ratio can now be calculated from

numbers on gross private fixed domestic residential investment (I2) and gross private fixed domestic

non-residential investment (I1). For example, for 2017, the ratio I2/I1 equals 0.31. In that case, with the

previously used parameters (α=0.40, δ=0.09, g=0.03, r=0.08), the first term on the right side of

equation (25) is 0.28, as before, and the second term is -0.10. 33 Therefore, on net, GDP would be over-

counted by 18%. This net over-counting is larger than that associated with consumer durables because

GDP includes the rental income on housing.




33
  If the production of housing services were more capital intensive than the production of market goods, the
second term would be comparatively less important.

                                                             25
        D. Inventories

        Inventories comprise materials, goods-in-process, and finished goods. Net increases in stocks

are classified as investment. Since inventories entail holding costs, a corresponding rental income

associated with these holdings must appear in GDP. The rentals might reflect the benefit from having a

larger stock available to meet customer demand (in the case of finished or nearly finished goods) or

might represent cost reductions from employing a production process that allows large average holdings

of materials, etc. (as opposed to a process that utilizes just-in-time inventory management).

        Since GDP counts investment in inventories and also counts the rental income on stocks of

inventories, the usual double-counting issue applies. However, because inventory change is, on

average, a small fraction of GDP (0.55% from 1950 to 2018), the double-counting is minor when

considered relative to GDP.


        E. Government fixed capital

        Denote by K2 in equation (14) the amount of government owned capital. The new element here

is that the national accounts allow for depreciation of public capital, δK2, but assume a net real rate of

return, r, of zero on this capital. 34 Hence, this treatment follows the suggestion mentioned before (but

rejected) of excluding capital’s net rental income, rK2, from the calculated national income.

        The associated over-counting of GDP equals δK2 – (r-g)K2 = (δ+g-r)K2. With the parameters used

before, this term is positive. However, for national income, the over-counting equals (g-r)K2, which is

negative. That is, as discussed before, the deduction of net rental income from national income




 According to BEA (2017, p. 9-4): “Alternatively, BEA could augment its measure of capital services by including a
34

net return on assets, a change that would tend to raise the overall level of government output and consumption
expenditures, and thus GDP. Several approaches have been suggested: using a private sector rate of return, a
municipal bond rate, the Office of Management and Budget hurdle rate for investment, or others.”


                                                        26
constitutes an excessive adjustment and leads to an understatement of intertemporal consumption

possibilities.


         F. Human capital

         This section is a sketch of how human capital would enter into the analysis. Formal schooling

and on-the-job training contribute to human capital and, thereby, to higher labor productivity. The

returns on this form of capital would show up in real GDP, though directly as income from labor,

w(t)L(t), rather than from capital. Human capital would also enter into home production. As with the

implicit rentals on consumer durables, the implicit rentals on human capital used at home would not

appear in measured GDP.

         On the investment side, part of the outlays for accumulating human capital show up in GDP.

Included here are costs of schooling, notably for teachers and school buildings. The bulk of these

expenses appear in the national accounts as government consumption and investment and are valued at

cost of production (including a net real rate of return of zero on government-owned capital). Another

part of the expenditure on education involves private market purchases, and these outlays enter into

the national accounts as personal consumer expenditure. An important omission on the expenditure

side is the shadow value of student time used as an input into the educational process. From the

perspective of GDP measurement, the omission of student time lessens the double-counting effect for

human capital compared to that for physical capital.

         For capital-income shares, a key issue is whether the returns to human capital should be

construed as part of the income from labor or instead as part of the income from a broad concept of

capital. The inclusion with labor income matches up with the simple observation that the income

accrues to workers (in an amount consistent with the enhanced productivity derived from more human

capital). However, the inclusion with capital income is appropriate from the perspective that the

income reflects in part the services from a form of “capital,” which is accumulated through a costly

                                                   27
process of investment. In this respect, human capital and investments in this capital are analogous to

physical capital and investments in that capital.


III. Observations

        The basic structure of the national income and product accounts features double-counting of

investment. Gross (or net) fixed investment counts once in gross (or net) domestic or national product

when the investment occurs and a second time in present value when the cumulated capital leads to

more gross (or net) rental income. This double-counting leads to over-statement of levels of aggregates

such as GDP and national income; that is, measured product and income exaggerate sustainable

consumption. The standard approach also over-states capital-income shares.

        The over-counting problem is straightforward for businesses’ equipment and structures but

takes on different forms for other types of capital, such as intellectual property, household durables,

housing, inventories, government capital, and human capital. As an example, the recent revisions of the

national accounts to capitalize intellectual property resulted in substantial increases in reported levels of

product and income and in capital-income shares. Thus, although reasonable for some purposes, the

capitalization of investment flows for durable goods or ideas can sometimes deliver misleading results.

        A tentative solution for the double-counting problem involves a form of full expensing for gross

investment. The standard calculations of net product and national income feature deductions for

depreciation of the existing capital stock. The purging of the remaining double-counting requires a

further downward adjustment that reflects the long-term flow of net investment associated with the

existing capital stock. In the steady state, this approach measures product and income by consumption,

which corresponds to the full subtraction of gross investment from GDP. This general idea was raised

long ago by Kuznets (1941, p. 46), who stressed that consumption was the only true “final good.”

        Outside of the steady state, the new concept of product and income differs from consumption

because the full expensing relates to the long-run flow of gross investment, rather than the current flow.

                                                     28
At a practical level, the proposed concept seems implementable because it requires only an extension

from the standard depreciation rate to an effective rate that adds in the economy’s expected long-run

rate of economic growth.
