Are Supply Shocks Contractionary at the ZLB? Evidence from Utilization-Adjusted TFP Data

                                         ABSTRACT

The basic New Keynesian model predicts that positive supply shocks are less expansionary at the
zero lower bound (ZLB) compared to periods of active monetary policy. We test this prediction
empirically using Fernald's (2014) utilization-adjusted total factor productivity series, which we
take as a measure of exogenous productivity. In contrast to the predictions of the model, positive
productivity shocks are estimated to be more expansionary at the ZLB compared to normal times.
However, in line with the predictions of the basic model, positive productivity shocks have a
stronger negative effect on inflation at the ZLB.

1     Introduction
    Are positive supply shocks contractionary in periods where monetary policy is constrained
by the zero lower bound (ZLB)? The textbook New Keynesian (NK) model suggests that this
is a possibility. The potential for this paradoxical result is driven by general equilibrium effects.
Suppose that the supply shock is an increase in neutral productivity. Higher productivity
lowers the natural rate of interest (i.e. the real interest rate consistent with a hypothetical
equilibrium where prices are flexible). An inflation-targeting central bank can optimally
respond by lowering nominal interest rates, which allows output to expand. If the central
bank is constrained by the zero lower bound, however, nominal interest rates cannot fall. This
results in a decrease in current and expected future inflation, which drives the equilibrium
real interest rate up. The increase in the real interest rate chokes off demand, resulting in a
smaller output increase than if policy were active. If the expected duration of the ZLB is
long enough, the rise in the real interest rate can be sufficiently large that output declines.
    In this paper we empirically test this prediction of the NK model using aggregate US
data. Until very recently this has been a virtual impossibility, given the paucity of aggregate
time series observations where the ZLB was binding. But there are now seven years of data
(from the end of 2008 through the end of 2015) in which the effective Federal Funds Rate was
at zero. We use Fernald (2014)’s utilization-adjusted total factor productivity (TFP) series,
which we take to be a good measure of exogenous productivity. We then estimate impulse
responses of output to changes in productivity, both inside and outside of the ZLB, using
Jordà (2005)’s local projections method. The local projections method is a simple and robust
way to estimate impulse responses, and can easily accommodate the kind of non-linearity
induced by a binding ZLB.
    In contrast to the predictions of the textbook NK model, we find that output responds
more on impact to an increase in productivity at the ZLB than away from it. The difference in
impact responses at and away from the ZLB is both economically and statistically significant.
After a couple of quarters there is no difference at or away from the ZLB in the estimated
response of output to a productivity shock. Our result is robust to a number of different
variations on our baseline specification.
    Since a decline in inflation is the mechanism by which the textbook NK model generates
a smaller output response to a productivity shock at the ZLB, we also empirically examine
the effects of productivity shocks on inflation, both inside and outside of the ZLB. Over the
period 1984-2007, we find that there is no statistically significant effect of a productivity
shock on inflation, which is consistent with an inflation targeting monetary policy regime.
At the ZLB, in contrast, we find that productivity shocks have a large, negative effect on


                                                 1
inflation. This result is robust along a number of dimensions.
    Taken together, our results for the effects of productivity shocks on output and inflation at
the ZLB present something of a puzzle. A stronger deflationary effect of productivity shocks
at the ZLB is consistent with the predictions of a textbook NK model. Since a deflationary
response is the mechanism through which output responds less to a productivity shock at the
ZLB, our findings that output responds more to a productivity shock at the ZLB is puzzling.
Our results suggest a failing of the textbook NK model along some dimension.
    While our paper focuses on the effects of supply shocks at the ZLB, our work has
implications for demand-side policies as well. Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011)
and others have argued that the government spending multiplier is significantly larger at
the ZLB in comparison to normal times. A number of authors, most notably Del-Negro and
Giannoni (2015), have noted that extended periods of anticipated monetary accommodation
can be wildly expansionary. The mechanism by which demand shocks can have large effects
at the ZLB is, in a sense, the mirror image of why supply shocks might have small effects.
Demand shocks raise inflation, which pushes down real interest rates when nominal rates are
constrained by the ZLB. Our empirical findings suggest that this “inflation channel” (Dupor
and Li (2015)) does not seem to be operative at the ZLB in the way predicted by the theory,
at least conditional on supply shocks. Our results therefore suggest that caution ought to be
in order when applying the basic intuition from the NK model to draw inferences about the
likely effects of demand shocks.
    Our work contributes to a literature investigating the macroeconomic effects of supply
shocks at the zero lower bound. Eggertson (2012) and Eggertsson and Krugman (2012)
both argue that New Deal policies, which reduced the natural rate of output, were in fact
expansionary due to the zero lower bound. On the other hand, Wieland (2015) uses the
Great Japan Earthquake and global oil supply disruptions as exogenous supply shocks and
finds that negative shocks are contractionary at the zero lower bound. In a similar vein,
Cohen-Setton, Hausman, and Wieland (2016) show that cartelization efforts exacerbated
France’s Great Depression. These papers focus on shocks to aggregate supply which are
different than neutral productivity shocks. We are unaware of any paper which studies the
consequences of exogenous productivity shocks at the zero lower bound.
    Our work also fits more broadly into a growing literature which empirically tests other
predictions of the textbook NK model when the ZLB binds. Bachmann, Berg, and Sims
(2015) find no evidence that consumer willingness to spend on durable goods is affected by
inflation expectations, either at or away from the ZLB. Burke and Ozdagli (2013) reach similar
conclusions. In contrast, D’Acunto, Hoang, and Weber (2016) argue that a VAT increase
in Germany which raised household inflation expectations was quite expansionary. Similar,


                                               2
Ichiue and Nishiguchi (2015) find that higher inflation expectations positively correlate with
consumption spending for households in Japan. Dupor and Li (2015) find no evidence to
support an important “expected inflation channel” for large fiscal multipliers at the ZLB.
Ramey and Zubairy (2014) estimate state-dependent regression models similar to ours to
study the magnitude of the fiscal multiplier, both across states of the business cycle as well
as in periods where the ZLB binds. They find no evidence of a significantly larger multiplier
during periods in which the ZLB binds.


2     Theory
   Consider the textbook NK model. The two principal equations of the model are the IS
equation and a Phillips Curve:

                                              1
                                xt = Et xt+1 −   (it − Et πt+1 − rtf )                         (1)
                                              σ
                                πt = γxt + β Et πt+1 .                                         (2)

    Here xt is the output gap, defined as the log deviation of output, yt , from its flexible price
level, xt = yt − ytf . The nominal interest rate, expressed in absolute deviations from steady
state, is it . The hypothetical real interest rate if prices were fully flexible is rtf . σ is the
inverse elasticity of intertemporal substitution. The slope coefficient in the Phillips Curve is
γ = (1−φ)(1−φβ)
          φ     (σ + χ), where φ ∈ [0, 1) is the probability firms cannot adjust their price in a
given period, 0 < β < 1 is a subjective discount factor, and χ is the inverse Frisch elasticity of
labor supply. The exogenous driving force in the model is log productivity, at , which obeys a
stationary AR(1) process with 0 ≤ ρa < 1:

                               at = ρa at−1 + εa,t , εa,t ∼ N (0, s2 ).                        (3)

    In terms of exogenous productivity, the flexible price real interest rate and output can be
solved for analytically as:
                                               1+χ
                                         ytf =      at                                      (4)
                                               σ+χ
                                             σ(1 + χ)(ρa − 1)
                                     rtf =                    at .                             (5)
                                                  σ+χ
   To complete the model, it remains to specify a monetary policy rule. During normal
times, we assume that the central bank follows a strict inflation target, adjusting the nominal




                                                    3
interest rate so as to implement πt = 0.1 So as to approximate the effects of a binding zero
lower bound on nominal interest rates in a tractable way, we consider a case in which the
nominal interest rate is pegged at a fixed value for a deterministic number of periods, H.
In particular, suppose that it is fixed at 1 − 1/β for H periods. Since it is the deviation of
the nominal interest rate from steady state, and 1/β − 1 is the steady state nominal interest
rate, this means that the nominal interest rate is fixed at 0. After this period of time, agents
in the economy expect the central bank to return to an inflation targeting regime, which
requires that the nominal interest rate equal the natural rate of interest. Formally, monetary
policy under this kind of peg is characterized by:2

                                                         if h ≥ H.
                                         ⎩ E t  t+h

    We solve for the expected time path of output backwards. Starting in period t + H,
agents will expect Et it+H = Et rt+H
                                  f
                                     , which implies that Et πt+H = Et xt+H = 0. This means that
Et xt+H−1 = − σ (1 − β ) + σ Et rt+H−1 and Et πt+H−1 = γ Et xt+H−1 . This can then be iterated
              1      1     1     f

back to period t, yielding the expected time paths of the output gap and inflation. The
expected path of output can then be recovered from the path of the output gap, given an
exogenous path for productivity.
    We parameterize the model as follows. We set φ = 0.75, which implies a four quarter
average duration between price changes. The elasticity of intertemporal substitution is σ = 1,
and we assume preferences are linear over labor, so χ = 0. The discount factor is β = 0.99. We
assume that the persistence of the productivity shock is ρa = 0.9. Consider a one unit positive
shock to productivity. The impulse response of output under various different durations of
the interest rate peg are shown in Figure 1.
    The solid blue line shows the response of output when H = 0, so that the central bank
targets an inflation rate of zero in all periods. Given our parameterization of σ = 1, the
impulse response of output is just equal to the impulse response of at . We consider three
additional peg lengths of H = 3, H = 6, and H = 10. Given the absence of endogenous state
variables in the model, after horizon H the response of output is identical to the inflation
targeting case. One observes that the output response on impact is smaller than the inflation
targeting case for H > 0. Furthermore, the impact response of output is smaller the bigger is

B for details.

      It is well-known that an exogenous interest rate peg results in equilibrium indeterminacy. We do not
have such a problem in our setup, because policy after the ZLB is formulated in terms of an inflation target,
                                                                  f
Et πt+h = 0 for h ≥ H. With this inflation target, Et it+h = Et rt+h  in equilibrium, not as a policy rule that
might hold off equilibrium.

H. For H sufficiently large, output can actually decline on impact, as it does here in the
case of H = 10. Given our parameterization of the model, the impact response of output is
negative for H ≥ 8.
    The mechanism for the smaller output response for a longer duration of the interest rate
peg lies in the response of inflation. Dupor and Li (2015) have termed this the “expected
inflation channel.” In particular, a positive productivity shock lowers inflation when monetary
policy is passive. The longer the nominal interest rate is pegged, the more inflation falls. A
decline in expected inflation, coupled with a fixed nominal interest rate, results in an increase
in the real interest rate. The higher real interest rate chokes off demand and results in a
smaller increase in output. These effects can be seen in Figure 2, which is similar to Figure 1
but plots the response of inflation to a productivity shock as a function of the duration of
the interest rate peg, H.

                   strict inflation target at all times.



    An alternative approach to modeling the effects of the zero lower bound is to assume
that the duration of a pegged nominal interest rate is stochastic, rather than deterministic
as we have assumed. A stochastic duration of an interest rate peg is the approach taken,
for example, in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011). In particular, one can assume
that each period there is a fixed probability, p, with p ∈ [0, 1), that the nominal interest rate
will remain at zero. The expected duration of the peg is then 1/(1 − p) periods. Carlstrom,


                                                        5
Fuerst, and Paustian (2014) argue that a deterministic peg length provides much more
reasonable results in a textbook NK model with government spending than does a stochastic
peg. Carlstrom, Fuerst, and Paustian (2015) examine the effects of forward guidance in a
textbook New Keynesian model. When the interest rate is pegged for a stochastic period
of time, they find that there are sign reversals in the effects of forward guidance on current
inflation and output.3 In Appendix A, we show the impulse responses of output and inflation
to a productivity shock for different expected durations of an interest rate peg. For moderate
expected durations of the peg, our results are the same as in the main text – output responds
less to a positive productivity shock the longer is the expected duration of the peg, and
inflation falls more. However, like Carlstrom et al. (2015), if the expected duration of the peg
is sufficiently long we find sign reversals, wherein output responds more to a productivity
shock than under an inflation target and the inflation response is positive, rather than
negative.

                      rate at zero. H = 0 corresponds to the case where the central bank obeys a
                      strict inflation target at all times.

     In Carlstrom et al. (2015), they begin with a standard NK model and show that the response of output
and inflation to a deterministic period of forward guidance is exponentially increasing in the duration of low
interest rates. However, when inflation indexation is introduced into the model, sign reversals begin to occur
wherein output and inflation fall, rather than rise, with the anticipation of an extended period of low interest
rates. When they consider a stochastic interest rate peg, they find sign reversals at modest durations of a
peg even without backward indexation in the model.

3     Empirical Analysis
   In this section we empirically test the prediction that a positive productivity shock has
a smaller, and potentially negative, effect on output when the zero lower bound binds in
comparison to normal times. We measure productivity using Fernald (2014)’s quarterly series
on utilization-adjusted total factor productivity. Subsection 3.1 describes this data series
and makes the case that it can plausibly be considered an exogenous productivity series.
Subsection 3.2 estimates the effects of productivity shocks on output, both inside and outside
the ZLB. Subsection 3.3 does the same but for inflation. Subsection 3.4 considers several
robustness exercises.


3.1     Data
    For our empirical analysis it is critical that we observe a variable which accurately
measures exogenous productivity. A traditional Solow residual is likely to be a poor measure
of exogenous productivity because of factor hoarding. We therefore use the utilization-
adjusted TFP series produced and provided by Fernald (2014). Formally, he assumes an
aggregate production function of the form:

                                     Yt = At (zt Kt )αt (et Lt )1−αt                             (7)

where Yt is output, Kt is physical capital, and Lt is aggregate labor hours. At is an exogenous
productivity shifter. zt denotes capital utilization and et labor effort. αt is a potentially
time-varying capital’s share parameter. A traditional measure of TFP is log output less
share-weighted capital and labor. In terms of (7) this can be written:

                             ln T F Pt = ln Yt − αt ln Kt − (1 − αt ) ln Lt
                                       = ln At + ln ut .                                         (8)

Here ln ut = αt ln zt + (1 − αt ) ln et is a composite utilization factor. Only if factor utilization
is constant will a traditional TFP series correspond to the exogenous productivity concept in
(7). Fernald (2014) uses the insights from Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2006) and follow-up
work from Basu, Fernald, Fisher, and Kimball (2013) to create an aggregate utilization series,
which is used to “correct” a traditional TFP series. In other words:

                                       ln At = ln T F Pt − ln ut .                               (9)

We will denote the utilization-adjusted TFP series by At , the same symbol used to denote

                                                    7
exogenous productivity in (7). The interested reader is referred to Fernald (2014) for more
details on the construction of the utilization-adjusted TFP series.4
    Table 1 presents some summary statistics on the log first difference of the utilization-
adjusted TFP series. For point of comparison, we also show statistics on the log first difference
of a traditional measure of TFP. In addition, we show moments for output growth and inflation,
as these are the key aggregate variables used in our regression analysis below. Output is
measured as real GDP from the NIPA tables, while inflation is the log first difference of the
corresponding price deflator. We focus on the sample period 1984Q1–2015Q4, which is the
sample period we use in our baseline regressions.

            Notes: These moments are calculated for the period 1984Q1–2015Q4. ∆ denotes the first difference
            of the relevant variable. T F Pt corresponds to log output less share-weighted capital and labor
            as described in Equation (8). At refers to the measure provided by Fernald (2014) described in
            (9). Output, Yt , is real GDP from the NIPA tables. Inflation, πt is the log first difference of the
            corresponding price deflator.



    In terms of volatilities, the utilization-adjusted TFP series is actually more volatile
than the conventional TFP series, both of which are slightly more volatile than output
growth. Inflation is quite stable over the sample period in consideration. Output growth
and inflation are both highly autocorrelated. The growth rate of utilization-adjusted TFP is
not autocorrelated, consistent with this series obeying a random walk, as argued in Basu
et al. (2006). The traditional TFP series is slightly positively autocorrelated. The lower part
of the table shows the correlation matrix for these variables. Utilization-adjusted TFP is
mildly positively correlated with output growth (0.2), though this correlation is small in
absolute terms. In contrast, the conventional TFP series is quite strongly positively correlated
with output growth (0.7).5 The growth rate of the utilization-adjusted TFP series is mildly

      Sims (2016) documents large differences in the time series properties of Fernald’s utilization-adjusted
TFP series by vintage. In particular, there is a discrete change in the time series properties of the series
which occurred beginning with vintages produced starting in the spring of 2014, based on an update to
using the Basu et al. (2013) methodology for measuring factor utilization. Sims (2016) argues that the most
recent vintages of Fernald’s data are better than earlier vintages. The vintage of Fernald’s data we use was
downloaded in March of 2016, fully reflecting the updates to his series from the spring of 2014.
    5
      Over a longer sample period, the utilization-adjusted TFP series is even more weakly correlated with


                                                             8
negatively correlated with inflation (-0.1), more strongly so than the correlation between the
conventional TFP series and inflation (-0.05).
    The fact that the utilization-adjusted TFP series is more weakly correlated with out-
put than a traditional TFP series suggests that the utilization-adjustment represents an
improvement over a conventional growth accounting exercise. It does not, however, prove
that Fernald’s series can be considered exogenous with respect to macroeconomic conditions.
To go a step further, we conduct a sequence of pairwise Granger causality tests using the
first log difference of Fernald’s utilization-adjusted TFP series and other macroeconomic
shocks and variables. Under the null hypothesis that the utilization-adjusted TFP series is a
measure of exogenous productivity, it should not be predictable from other variables. We
take three popular measures of macroeconomic shocks identified in the literature – Romer
and Romer (2004) monetary policy shocks, Romer and Romer (2010) tax shocks, and the
defense news shock produced by Ramey (2011). We also consider the first difference of the
log S&P 500 stock market index and the first log difference of a measure of oil prices. F
statistics and p values from the pairwise Granger causality tests are presented in Table 2.

                        shock measure (mnemonic RESID) for the period 1984Q1–1996Q4.
                        For Romer and Romer (2010)’s measure we use “Exogenous Tax
                        Changes” based on the present value of tax changes relative to
                        nominal GDP (mnemonic EXOGEPDVRATIO), for the period 1984Q1–
                        2007Q4. Ramey (2011)’s series is “Defense news as a % of lagged
                        nominal GDP” for the period 1984Q1–2013Q4. ∆ S&P 500 In-
                        dex is the quarterly average of monthly growth rate of close price
                        adjusted for dividends and splits for the period 1984Q1–2015Q4
                        divided by the consumer price index. ∆OILt is the log first dif-
                        ference of the BLS’s producer price index for domestic crude oil
                        (series ID WPU0561) for the period 1984Q1–2015Q4.



   The results in Table 2 fail to reject the null hypothesis that any of the series in question
do not Granger cause the log first difference of utilization-adjusted TFP. The p values for
the exogenous policy shocks are particularly high. The p values for the S&P 500 index and

output growth than presented here. In particular, over the period 1947Q2-2015Q4, the correlation between
output growth and utilization-adjusted TFP is only 0.12.

the crude oil price are lower, but are still substantially higher than conventional significance
levels. These results are suggestive, but of course not dispositive, that Fernald’s series can be
treated as exogenous.


3.2    Productivity Shocks and Output: At and Away from the ZLB
    Our objective is to estimate the impulse response of output to a productivity shock,
both inside and outside of periods where the ZLB binds. To that end, we estimate a state-
dependent regression model using Jordà (2005)’s local projection method. This is more robust
to misspecification than a traditional VAR and it is straightforward to adapt to a non-linear
setting. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013) and Ramey and Zubairy (2014) are examples of
two recent papers which have used the local projections method to estimate state-dependent
fiscal multipliers.
    We estimate a sequence of regressions of the form:
                                    p                 p
      ln Yt+h = α + β
                h       h
                            ln At + ∑ γsh ln Yt−s   + ∑ φhs ln At−s
                                    s=1              s=1
                                                               p           p
                                 + Zt [αzh + βzh ln At + ∑ γz,s
                                                            h
                                                                ln Yt−s + ∑ φhz,s ln At−s ] + ut+h .   (10)
                                                           s=1            s=1


    This regression is estimated separately for different forecast horizons, h ≥ 0. In words,
the log level of output at a lead of h horizons is regressed on a constant, the period t log
level of productivity, and p lags of the log levels of output and productivity. That the
period t value of productivity appears on the right hand side reflects an assumption that the
utilization-adjusted TFP series is exogenous with respect to output within a period. Lags
of output and utilization-adjusted TFP are included in the regression to partial out any
predictable movements in adjusted TFP. Zt is a dummy variable taking on a value of 1 in
periods where the zero lower bound binds. To allow for different effects at the zero lower
bound, we include an interaction term which allows all coefficients to differ during periods in
which the ZLB binds. Outside of the zero lower bound, the estimate of the impulse response
of output at horizon h to a change in productivity is given by β h . At the zero lower bound
the response is given by β h + βzh .
    As a baseline, we estimate these regressions over the sample period 1984Q1 through
2015Q4. The beginning date is chosen to coincide with conventional dating of the “Great
Moderation.” The end of the sample leaves 29 observations where the zero lower bound binds
(2008Q4 through 2015Q4), or about 23 percent of the sample period. In accordance with
the Akaike Information Criterion, we estimate the regression with p = 3 lags. Inference is
conducted using Newey and West (1987) HAC standard errors.

                                                          10
    We graphically display the results from the baseline model in Figure 3. The blue line
with ‘x’ markers shows the estimated impulse response of output to a one unit productivity
shock outside of the ZLB; the shaded gray region corresponds to the 95 percent confidence
interval associated with this response. Output increases on impact and continues to rise
for several quarters thereafter. The red line with ‘*’ markers plots the estimated response
when the zero lower bound binds. Contrary to the theory outlined in Section 2, output is
estimated to respond by nearly four times as much to a productivity shock on impact at
the ZLB than outside of it. Hence, not only does the economy expand after a productivity
increase at the ZLB, the response is actually amplified in periods where nominal interest
rates are zero. After a couple of periods the response at the ZLB converges to the response
outside of the ZLB.

                the no ZLB case using Newey and West (1987) HAC standard errors. The red line
                with ‘*’ markers shows the response when the ZLB binds.



   In Table 3 we show the estimates, standard errors, and p values for the coefficient βzh
by forecast horizon. The p values can be interpreted as a test of the hypothesis that βzh = 0
(equivalently, that there is no statistically significant difference between the response of
output in normal times compared to the ZLB). On impact, the p value is close to zero, so the
hypothesis can be rejected. At a lead of one period, the hypothesis that the responses are
the same can be rejected at the 10 percent level, but not at a 5 percent significance level.
The estimates of βzh are statistically insignificant from zero at leads of h = 2 and higher.

3.3    Inspecting the Mechanism
    As discussed in Section 2, in the NK model output responds less to a productivity shock
at the ZLB because of an effect of inflation on the real interest rate. In particular, inflation
falls after a productivity shock when the central bank is unable to adjust nominal rates, which
drives the real rate up and crowds out demand, resulting in a smaller increase in output.
    In this subsection, we empirically investigate the response of inflation to a productivity
shock, both inside and outside of the ZLB. We estimate a sequence of regressions similar to

    We measure inflation as the annualized percentage change in the GDP price deflator.
We again estimate these regressions with p = 3 lags. The estimated impulse responses of
inflation both inside and outside of the ZLB are shown in Figure 4. The blue line with ‘x’
markers denotes the response outside of the ZLB, while the red line with the ‘*’ markers is
the response at the ZLB. The shaded gray region is the 95 percent confidence interval for the
response estimated outside of the ZLB.

                Notes: This figure shows the effects of At on inflation at various horizons. The
                dotted line is when the ZLB binds or Zt = 1. The blue line with ‘x’ markers is when
                Zt = 0. The shaded area bands represent the 95 percent confidence interval about
                the no ZLB case using Newey and West (1987) HAC standard errors. The red line
                with ‘*’ markers shows the response when the ZLB binds.



    During normal times, the estimated response of inflation to a productivity shock is negative
on impact but statistically indistinguishable from zero. The response is also insignificant at
all subsequent forecast horizons. This response is consistent with a strict inflation target,
as assumed in the theoretical model in Section 2. At the ZLB, in contrast, the inflation
response is negative on impact, much more so than during periods where the ZLB does not
bind. While the estimated response is quite choppy, at most forecast horizons the inflation
response at the ZLB lies below the estimated response in normal times.
    Table 4 shows the coefficient estimates of βzh , along with standard errors and p values. A
test of the hypothesis that βzh = 0 amounts to a test of the hypothesis that inflation response
at horizon h differs at the ZLB in comparison to normal times. The response of inflation is
significantly different at horizons h = 1 and h = 5.
    In summary, our results present something of a puzzle in light of the predictions of the
textbook NK model. The mechanism through which output ought to respond less to a
productivity shock at the ZLB – namely, a decrease in current and expected inflation – is
present in the data. Yet, in contrast to the theory, the output response to a productivity
shock at the ZLB is amplified rather than dampened. Put together, these findings suggest
some basic flaw in the textbook NK model.

                            ing standard errors and p values. These are for
                            regressions with inflation in place of output. Stan-
                            dard errors are computed using Newey and West
                            (1987).



    In Section 2 we discussed the possibility of a sign reversal under a stochastic peg whereby
output would increase more at the ZLB than away from it. One rationalization for our results
for the output effects of a productivity shock at the ZLB is that the duration of the peg is
stochastic and individuals expect that it will persist for a sufficiently long duration. Sign
reversals in the theoretical model apply both to the responses of output and inflation – if
output responds more to a productivity shock because of a binding ZLB, then the inflation
response ought to be positive. We find that the inflation response to a productivity shock is
negative, both away from the ZLB and more strongly so at the ZLB. Hence, our empirical
results for output and inflation jointly taken together cannot be rationalized by the type of
sign reversals in the standard NK model emphasized by Carlstrom et al. (2015).


3.4    Robustness
    We consider a number of robustness checks on our baseline result. Robustness checks for
the output regressions are shown in different panels of Figure 5. First, we consider robustness
to sample period. We consider the following two alternative sample periods – 1947Q2 -
2015Q4 and 1960Q1 - 2015Q4. The responses are shown in the upper left panel of the figure.
Because βzh is identified only off of the most recent data, the estimate of the impulse response
of output at the zero lower bound is not affected by longer sample periods. The estimated
response outside of the ZLB is fairly similar across samples, though it is a bit smaller at all
horizons when using the longest sample period. This means that the difference between the
impact response at the ZLB compared to away from the ZLB is even larger with the longer

                                                    14
sample compared to our baseline results.
   One might worry that our result that output responds by more to a productivity shock at
the ZLB compared to normal times is in actuality driven by the fact that the most recent
ZLB period coincides with the height of the Great Recession. Put differently, it may be the
case that output responds by more to a productivity shock in a time of recession, and that
our ZLB dummy variable is simply proxying for periods of recession. We address this concern
by augmenting our baseline regression to include a recession dummy variable, interacted in an
analogous way to the ZLB dummy interaction. Our regression specification is shown below:
                                      p               p
     ln Yt+h = αh + β h ln At + ∑ γsh ln Yt−s + ∑ φhs ln At−s
                                      s=1            s=1
                                                               p             p
                                   + Zt [αzh + βzh ln At + ∑ γz,s
                                                              h
                                                                  ln Yt−s + ∑ φhz,s ln At−s ]
                                                           s=1              s=1
                                                            p                p
                                   + Rt [αrh + βrh ln At + ∑ γr,s
                                                              h
                                                                  ln Yt−s + ∑ φhr,s ln At−s ] + ut+h .     (12)
                                                           s=1              s=1


    In this specification Rt is a dummy variable taking on a value of one in periods identified
by the NBER as recessions. We do find that output responds more to a productivity shock
in a time of recession compared to normal times. Nevertheless, we still find that output
responds by more on impact to a productivity shock at the ZLB than away from it. This
response is shown in the middle panel of Figure 5. Relative to our baseline, though larger
on impact the response of output at the ZLB is estimated to be less persistent compared to
normal times.
    Our baseline regression specification is in the levels of the variables. This specification
is robust to cointegration between output and productivity. We consider an alternative
specification in which variables appear in growth rates. Let ∆ denote the first difference
operator. We estimate:
                                                p                 p
   ln Yt+h − ln Yt−1 = α   h
                               + β ∆ ln At + ∑ γs ∆ ln Yt−s + ∑ φhs ∆ ln At−s
                                  h                 h
                                                s=1              s=1
                                                          p                  p
                               + Zt [αzh + βzh ∆ ln At + ∑ γz,s
                                                             h
                                                                ∆ ln Yt−s + ∑ φhz,s ∆ ln At−s ] + ut+h .   (13)
                                                         s=1                s=1


    In this specification the cumulative growth rate of output over h horizons is regressed
on the current growth rate of the adjusted TFP series and lags of the growth rates of the
adjusted TFP series and output. The estimated responses inside and outside of the ZLB
are shown in the upper right panel of the first row of Figure 5. Qualitatively our results are
the same with this alternative specification. On impact, output responds by more to the


                                                          15
productivity shock at the ZLB than outside of it. The main difference relative to our baseline
result is that the output response at the ZLB is less persistent.

figure uses different numbers of lags. The estimated responses are qualitatively insensitive to
the number of lags in the regression. The right panel in the lower row includes a deterministic
time trend in our baseline regression. We consider both a linear time trend and a quadratic
trend. As one can see in the figure, the inclusion of a time trend has little noticeable effect
on the results.
    Next, we consider the same robustness checks for the response of inflation to a productivity
shock. The estimated impulse responses for these robustness checks are depicted graphically
in Figure 6. In the growth rates specification inflation enters in levels, but utilization-adjusted
TFP enters in log first differences. The upper left panel shows responses estimated over
different time horizons. The response of inflation at the ZLB is the same across samples,
since the ZLB sample is fixed across specifications. Interestingly, one observes that inflation
responds more negatively to a productivity shock outside of the ZLB regime in samples that
extend farther back in time. In particular, the impact decline in inflation is largest over the


                                                                                    16
sample that extends back to 1947. These findings are consistent with the analysis in Gali
et al. (2003), who estimate the effects of technology shocks identified from a VAR on inflation
in the pre- and post-Volcker periods. In their analysis, there is no significant response of
inflation to a positive productivity shock in the post-Volcker period, whereas in the earlier
sample the decline in inflation after a productivity improvement is quantitatively large and
statistically significant. The other panels of the figure confirm the robustness of our main
result for inflation. In all of these different specification, inflation falls more on impact at the
ZLB than outside of it.

    Notes: This figure shows estimated impulse responses of inflation to a productivity shock, both inside and outside of the

4                   Conclusion
    The textbook New Keynesian model predicts that the output response to a productivity
shock is smaller when the nominal interest rate is constrained by the zero lower bound
compared to periods where monetary policy is active. The mechanism by which this happens
is that a positive productivity shock results in a decrease in inflation, which drives up the
real interest rate when the nominal rate is constrained by the ZLB.
    Contrary to the theory, we show that positive productivity shocks increase output more

                                                                                                          17
in periods where the zero lower bound binds in comparison to normal times. For inflation,
we find results that are broadly consistent with the textbook NK model – inflation does not
react significantly to a productivity shock in normal times, but falls significantly at the ZLB.
Taken together, these results present something of a puzzle, and suggest that some important
ingredient is missing from the textbook model.
    One potential solution to reconcile theory and evidence is to discard the representative
agent assumption. Wieland (2015) shows that when a fraction of households are borrowing
constrained, a negative supply shock at the ZLB is contractionary provided the elasticity of
substitution is sufficiently small. In this regard, heterogeneous agent New Keynesian models
as discussed in Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2016) are promising. Understanding how our
results may or may not fit in with these new models is an interesting exercise and is left for
future work. In the meantime, since our empirical results are difficult to square with the
textbook theory, caution seems to be in order when advocating for policies such as forward
guidance and fiscal stimulus, both of which are predicted to be highly expansionary when
policy is constrained by the ZLB.

A       Stochastic Peg
    As alternative to what we do in the main text, which is to approximate the effects of a
binding zero lower bound with an interest rate peg of deterministic duration, in this Appendix
we consider the case in which the duration of the interest rate peg is stochastic. This is
the approach taken in the small-scale NK model in Christiano et al. (2011), for example. A
stochastic peg length has the advantage that it permits clean closed form solutions, which is
not the case for the deterministic peg case. A downside of the stochastic peg case is that
it can result in counterintuitive “sign flips” in which the effect of a natural rate shock on
output flips sign for a sufficiently long expected duration of the peg.
    As in the main text, suppose that the current nominal interest rate equals zero, so in
deviation terms we have it = 1 − 1/β. With probability 1 − p, in period t + 1 the central bank
returns to an inflation target, which implies that Et πt+1 = Et xt+1 = 0 and Et it+1 = Et rt+1
                                                                                             f
                                                                                                .
With probability p, the nominal interest rate in period t + 1 remains at zero. The probability
of returning to the strict inflation target in any subsequent period, conditional on arriving in
that period with the nominal rate still at zero, is fixed at p. We solve for analytic solutions
for πt and xt using the method of undetermined coefficients. Using the expression mapping
at into rtf from the text, (4), we can write these solutions as:

                 γ               1                  γ                σ(1 + χ)(ρa − 1)
 πt =                        (1 − ) +                                                 at (A.1)
      −σ(1 − βp)(1 − p) + pγ     β    σ(1 − βpρa )(1 − pρa ) − pρa γ      σ+χ
              1 − βp             1               1 − βp              σ(1 + χ)(ρa − 1)
 xt =                        (1 − ) +                                                 at . (A.2)
      −σ(1 − βp)(1 − p) + pγ     β    σ(1 − βpρa )(1 − pρa ) − pρa γ      σ+χ

Since xt = yt − ytf , and ytf =   1+χ
                                  σ+χ at ,   this implies that output can be written:

                   1 − βp             1              σ(ρa − 1)(1 − βp)          1+χ
    yt =                          (1 − ) + [1 +                               ]      at .   (A.3)
           −σ(1 − βp)(1 − p) + pγ     β         σ(1 − βpρa (1 − pρa ) − pρa γ) σ + χ

    In Figure A1a we plot impulse responses of output to a productivity shock for two different
levels of p: p ∈ {2/3, 4/5}. This corresponds to expected durations of three and five quarters,
respectively. For point of comparison, we also show the case in which the central bank targets
a zero inflation rate in every period, in which case yt = ytf . We assume that ρa = 0.90, σ = 1,
χ = 0, β = 0.99, and φ = 0.75. Clearly, as the expected duration of the ZLB increases, the less
output expands on impact in response to a productivity shock. For sufficiently long forecast
horizons the responses are not affected much by the value of p, because in expectation the
economy will have likely exited the ZLB. Differently than the deterministic peg case, the
response under a stochastic peg only asymptotically approaches the flexible price responses,


                                                       21
whereas in the deterministic peg the responses lie on top of one another after the peg period.

Figure A1: Responses to a Productivity Shock as a Function of Duration of ZLB From A
                                   Stochastic Peg
Notes: These figures plots the impulse responses of output (right) inflation (left) to a one percent increase in productivity for
different values of α. The time period is a quarter.



    Figure A1b is similar to Figure A1a, except we plot the inflation response for different
expected durations of the peg. As in the main text, the longer is the expected duration of
the peg, the more inflation falls on impact.
    As documented in Carlstrom et al. (2014), for sufficiently high values of p, the sign of the
effect of a productivity shock on output and inflation can flip. For the values of the other
parameters we have chosen, this sign flip occurs at about p = 0.83, or an expected duration of
the peg of about six quarters. The sign flips do not occur in the deterministic duration case
considered in the text.

   Outside of the ZLB, the interest rate rule is given by

                                                    i t = φ π πt .

Also,
                                                    1+χ
                                            rtf =       (ρ − 1)at .
                                                    σ+χ
   We first solve for the policy functions of the output gap and inflation outside the ZLB
and then consider the ZLB. Substitute the interest rate rule into Equation B.1:

                                                    1
                                   xt = Et xt+1 −     (φπ πt − Et πt+1 − rtf ) .
                                                    σ

   Guess xt = θ1 at and πt = θ2 at . After some algebraic manipulations:

                                          (1 − βρ)σ −1          1+χ
                            xt =                                      (ρ − 1)at
                                   (1 − βρ)(1 − ρ) + ρ (φπ − ρ) σ + χ
                                                     γ

                                              γσ −1             1+χ
                            πt =                                      (ρ − 1)at .
                                   (1 − βρ)(1 − ρ) + ρ (φπ − ρ) σ + χ
                                                     γ



    The peg runs for H periods and lifts in period H. This implies that Et xt+H = θ1 ρH at and
Et πt+H = θ2 ρH at . Since the interest rate is now constrained at 0, this means Et it+h = 1 − 1/β
for all h < H. In period H − 1 we have:

                                                 1     1
                       Et xt+H−1 = Et xt+H +       (1 − + Et πt+H + Et rt+H−1
                                                                        f
                                                                               )

                                                 1     1
                                     = θ1 ρH at + (1 − + θ2 ρH at + δρH−1 at )
                                                 σ     β

where δ =   χ+σ (ρ − 1).
            1+χ
                           Substitute the last expression into Equation B.2:

                Et πt+H−1 = γ Et xt+H−1 + βθ2 ρH at
                                         1      1
                          = γ [θ1 ρH at + (1 − + θ2 ρH at + δρH−1 at )] + βθ2 ρH at .
                                         σ      β

We continue to iterate back to period t.
    With the exception of φπ , which is set to 1.5, the rest of the parameterization is identical
to the one in the main text. We consider peg lengths of H ∈ {0, 3, 6, 10}. Figure B1 presents
the results. Note that when H = 0 output does not increase by as much as productivity. This
is the consequence of price stickiness and it is exactly what inflation targeting avoids, namely
non-zero values of the output gap and inflation. Also note that the fall in output for longer


                                                         23
peg lengths is significantly bigger than when the unconstrained rule is inflation targeting.
Relatedly, output can decline on impact for shorter durations of the peg than in the strict
inflation targeting case.
