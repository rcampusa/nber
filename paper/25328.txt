The Long-run Impact of New Medical Ideas on Cancer Survival and Mortality
Frank R. Lichtenberg
NBER Working Paper No. 25328
December 2018
JEL No. I1,J11,O3

                                           ABSTRACT

I investigate whether the types of cancer (breast, colon, lung, etc.) subject to greater penetration
of new ideas had larger subsequent survival gains and mortality reductions, controlling for
changing incidence. I use the MEDLINE/PubMED database, which contains more than 23
million references to journal articles published in 5400 leading biomedical journals, to construct
longitudinal measures of the penetration of new medical ideas.

The 5-year survival rate is strongly positively related to the novelty of ideas in articles published
12-24 years earlier. This finding is consistent with evidence from case studies that it takes a long
time for research evidence to reach clinical practice. The estimates suggest that about 70% of the
1994-2008 increase in the 5-year observed survival rate for all cancer sites combined may have
been due to the increase in the novelty of medical ideas 12-24 years earlier.

The number of years of potential life lost from cancer before ages 80 and 70 are inversely related
to the novelty of ideas in articles published 12-24 years earlier, conditional on incidence. The
increase in medical idea novelty was estimated to have caused a 38% decline in the premature
(before age 80) cancer mortality rate 12-24 years later.

    I.       Introduction


         Longevity increase is a very important part of economic growth, broadly defined.
Nordhaus (2005) argued that “improvements in health status have been a major contributor to
economic welfare over the twentieth century. To a first approximation, the economic value of
increases in longevity in the last hundred years is about as large as the value of measured growth
in non-health goods and services.” Murphy and Topel (2006) estimated that cumulative gains in
life expectancy after 1900 were worth over $1.2 million to the representative American in 2000,
whereas post-1970 gains added about $3.2 trillion per year to national wealth, equal to about half
of GDP. The United Nations’ Human Development Index, which is used to rank countries into
four tiers of human development, is a composite statistic of life expectancy, income per capita,
and education (United Nations (2017)).
         There is a consensus among macroeconomists that technological progress is the principal
source of GDP growth. Romer (1990) argued that “growth…is driven by technological change
that arises from intentional investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents” (S71).
Jones argued that “long-run growth is driven by the discovery of new ideas throughout the
world.” 1,2 And Chien (2015) said that “it has been shown, both theoretically and empirically,
that technological progress is the main driver of long-run growth.”
         Since technological progress, or the discovery of new ideas, is the fundamental source of
one of the major components—GDP growth—of “human development,” or economic growth,
broadly defined, it is quite plausible that the discovery of new ideas has also played a major role
in longevity growth. Some previous authors have suggested that this is the case. Fuchs (2010)
said that “since World War II…biomedical innovations (new drugs, devices, and procedures)
have been the primary source of increases in longevity,” although he did not provide evidence to
support this claim. Cutler, Deaton and Lleras-Muney (2006) performed a survey of a large and
diverse literature on the determinants of mortality, and “tentatively identif[ied] the application of

1
  Sobel (1995) provides an excellent account of a specific innovation that had a substantial positive impact on
economic growth: the development (by John Harrison, an 18th-century clockmaker) of the first clock (chronometer)
sufficiently accurate to be used to determine longitude at sea—an important development in navigation.
2
  The discovery of new ideas could increase economic output for two different reasons. First, output could simply
be positively related to the quantity (and variety) of ideas ever discovered. Second, output could be positively
related to the (mean or maximum) quality of ideas ever discovered, and new ideas may be better (of higher quality),
on average, than old ideas. As noted by Jovanovic and Yatsenko (2012), in “the Spence–Dixit–Stiglitz
tradition…new goods [are] of higher quality than old goods.”
                                                                                                                    4


scientific advance and technical progress (some of which is induced by income and facilitated by
education) as the ultimate determinant of health.” They concluded that “knowledge, science, and
technology are the keys to any coherent explanation” of mortality.
         In this paper, I will test the hypothesis that the arrival of new medical ideas 3,4 has played
a major role in the long-run increase in U.S. cancer survival and decline in cancer mortality. 5 A
difference-in-differences research design will be used: I will investigate whether types of cancer
(breast, colon, lung, etc.) subject to greater penetration of new ideas had larger survival gains and
mortality reductions, controlling for changing incidence.
         I will allow for substantial lags in the relationship between new ideas and cancer patient
outcomes; evidence from numerous case studies indicates that it takes a long time for research
evidence to reach clinical practice. Morris, Wooding, and Grant (2011) reviewed 23 studies that
quantified time lags in the development of health interventions. One study estimated that the
time lag from publication of a clinical trial of a treatment for acute myocardial infarction to the
establishment of a guideline/recommendation was between 6 and 13 years. Another study
estimated a mean time lag from drug discovery to commercialization of 9 years. Balas and
Bohen (2000), Grant et al (2003) and Wratschko (2009) all estimated a time lag of 17 years,
measuring different points of the process. 6
         Cancer provides a good opportunity to study the impact of new ideas on mortality, for
two reasons. First, as shown in Figure 1, in 2015 cancer was the leading cause of an important
mortality measure: the number of years of potential life lost before age 80 (YPLL80). It was the



3
  Some ideas that are new in medicine may not be completely new. Gelijns and Rosenberg (1994) argued that “a
high percentage of new medical devices have emerged not out of biomedical research, but through transfer of
technologies that were developed elsewhere: lasers, ultrasound, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and that most
general-purpose of all technologies, the computer. Both the modern intensive care unit, with its dependence upon
elaborate monitoring technologies, and much medical research itself have been based upon new capabilities acquired
through transfer and subsequent modification to suit the particular needs of the medical sector.”
4
  For a new medical idea, or invention, to have an impact on health, the idea must be implemented. An invention
that is licensed is likely to have a greater impact on health than one that is not licensed. Ali and Gittelman (2016)
demonstrated that inventions by teams composed of clinical researchers (MDs) are more likely to be licensed than
inventions by teams of basic scientists (PhDs); inventions that include both MDs and PhDs are not more likely to be
licensed.
5
  Survival and mortality are not “mirror images” of each other. Survival measures (e.g. the 5-year survival rate) are
conditional upon diagnosis, whereas mortality measures are not, although I will control, in an unrestrictive manner,
for cancer incidence in the mortality analysis. Also, survival data are based on a sample (only people residing in
SEER 9 cancer registry regions are included), whereas mortality data are derived from a census of all deaths.
6
  Unlike the present study, the endpoints in those studies were not health outcomes (e.g. mortality or survival); they
were events such as establishment of a guideline or drug marketing approval.
                                                                                                                         5


cause of 6.3 million YPLL80. It accounted for 22% of YPLL80 from all causes, and 39% more
YPLL80 than the second highest cause, heart disease. 7,8 Second, due to the existence of cancer
registries, I can control for changes in the number of people diagnosed and their characteristics
(e.g. their mean age). Incidence data are not available for most other diseases.
         I will use the MEDLINE/PubMED database to construct measures of the penetration of
new medical ideas applied to most types of cancer over time. MEDLINE/PubMED is the U.S.
National Library of Medicine’s (NLM’s) premier bibliographic database; it contains more than
23 million references to journal articles published since 1946 in 5400 of the world's leading
biomedical journals. A distinctive feature of MEDLINE/PubMED is that the records are indexed
with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). MeSH is the NLM’s controlled vocabulary thesaurus;
the NLM says that MeSH “is one of the most highly sophisticated thesauri in existence today.” 9
It consists of sets of terms (“descriptors”) in a hierarchical structure that permits searching at
various levels of specificity. 10 There were 27,883 descriptors in 2016 MeSH. 11 Figure 2 shows
the distribution of MeSH descriptors by major branch of the MeSH tree. 12 Chemicals and Drugs
(branch D) is the largest by far, accounting for 37.7% of descriptors; Analytical, Diagnostic and
Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [branch E] is the fourth largest, accounting for 8.6% of
descriptors.
         The MeSH Section staff continually revise and update the MeSH vocabulary. 13 Staff
subject specialists are responsible for areas of the health sciences in which they have knowledge
and expertise. In addition to receiving suggestions from indexers and others, the staff collect new
terms as they appear in the scientific literature or in emerging areas of research; define these

  Cancer was the second highest cause of YPLL70, but it was a close second; it caused 99% as many YPLL70 as the
highest cause, unintentional injury.
8
  In view of the importance of cancer as a cause of premature mortality, it is not surprising that Murphy and Topel
estimated that “a 1 percent reduction in cancer mortality would be worth $500 billion.”

10
   Most Descriptors indicate the subject of an indexed item, such as a journal article, that is, what the article is about.
https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/intro_record_types.html. The MeSH “tree” can be explored here:
https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/treeView.
11
   In addition to these headings, there are more than 232,000 Supplementary Concept Records (SCRs) within a
separate file. Generally SCR records contain specific examples of chemicals, diseases, and drug protocols. They are
updated more frequently than descriptors. Each SCR is assigned to a related descriptor via the Heading Map (HM)
field. The HM is used to rapidly identify the most specific descriptor class and include it in the citation.
12
   A given descriptor can appear multiple times in the MeSH tree. For example, “Drug Therapy, Computer-
Assisted” occurs in both branch E (Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment) and branch
L (Information Science).

terms within the context of existing vocabulary; and recommend their addition to MeSH.
Professionals in various disciplines are also consulted regarding broad organizational changes
and close coordination is maintained with various specialized vocabularies. As shown in Figure
3, between 1955 and 2015, the number of MeSH descriptors increased from 15.8 thousand to
27.8 thousand. On average, about 200 descriptors were added per year.
          In Section II, I will describe the econometric models of cancer survival and mortality that
I will estimate. The measurement of medical idea (MeSH descriptor) novelty will be discussed
in Section III. Data sources and descriptive statistics will be presented in Section IV. Empirical
results will be presented in Section V. The magnitude of the long-run impact of new ideas on
cancer survival and mortality will be quantified in Section VI. Section VII provides a summary
and conclusions.

    II.      Econometric models of cancer survival and mortality

          I will estimate models of the 5-year observed survival rate and of several mortality
measures using longitudinal cancer-site-level data. The survival rate model to be estimated is:


          ln(SURV_OBSst / (1 – SURV_OBSst)) = βk NEW_IDEASs,t-k

                  + γ ln(SURV_EXPst / (1 – SURV_EXPst)) + π ln(N_DXst) + αs + δt + εst                           (1)

where

     SURV_OBSst = the observed 5-year survival rate of patients diagnosed in SEER 9
                registries with cancer at site s in year t (t = 1994, 2008 14)

 NEW_IDEASs,t-k = a measure of the novelty of ideas/descriptors in MEDLINE/PubMED
                articles about cancer at site s in year t-k (k = 0, 3, 6,…,24)

     SURV_EXPst = the expected 5-year survival rate of patients diagnosed in SEER 9
                registries with cancer at site s in year t 15

             N_DXst = the number of patients diagnosed in SEER 9 registries with cancer at site
                    s in year t

14
   The 5-year survival rate is “forward-looking”: the 5-year survival rate in 2008 is the fraction of patients diagnosed
in 2008 who were alive at the end of 2013. 2008 is the most recent year for which data on the 5-year survival rate
were available.
15
   The expected survival rate is the survival rate of cancer-free individuals of the same age, sex, and race as cancer
patients.
                                                                                                  7



The measures of NEW_IDEASs,t-k will be defined below. The mortality model to be estimated
is:


        ln(MORTst) = βk NEW_IDEASs,t-k + γ ln(N_DX_10_YEARst)

                                      + π AGE_DX_10_YEARst + αs + δt + εst                 (2)

where MORTst is one of the following variables:

  N_DEATHSst = the number of deaths due to cancer at site s in year t (t = 1999, 2013)

     YPLL80st = the number of years of potential life lost before age 80 due to cancer at site
                  s in year t
     YPLL70st = the number of years of potential life lost before age 70 due to cancer at site
                  s in year t
The other variables in eq. (2) are

      N_DX_10_YEARst = the average annual number of people diagnosed with cancer at site
                     s in years t-10 to t-1

 AGE_DX_10_YEARst = the mean age at time of diagnosis of people diagnosed with cancer
                  at site s in years t-10 to t-1

Eqs. (1) and (2) will be estimated via weighted-least squares. The weight for eq. (1) will be
N_DXst; the weight for eq. (2) will be (1 / T) ∑t MORTst. Disturbances will be clustered within
cancer sites.
        From the fixed-effects models (eqs. (1) and (2)), we can derive “long-difference” models.
For example, eq. (2) implies the following long-difference model of cancer mortality:


        ∆ln(MORTs) = βk ∆NEW_IDEAS_ks + γ ∆ln(N_DX_10_YEARs)

                                      + π ∆AGE_DX_10_YEARs + δ’ + ε's                      (3)
where

                ∆ln(MORTs) = ln(MORTs,2013) - ln(MORTs,1999)

        ∆NEW_IDEAS_ks = NEW_IDEASs,2013-k - NEW_IDEASs,1999-k

 ∆ln(N_DX_10_YEARs) = ln(N_DX_10_YEARs,2013) - ln(N_DX_10_YEARs,1999)
                                                                                                                     8



     ∆AGE_DX_10_YEARs = AGE_DX_10_YEARs,2013 - AGE_DX_10_YEARs,1999

                            δ’ = δ2013 - δ1999

In Section V, I will present a graph (Figure 8) based on eq. (3).

      III.      Measurement of idea/descriptor novelty


             One major branch (branch C) of the MeSH tree is the Diseases branch; it contains
descriptors of thousands of diseases. By using these descriptors, we can identify all
MEDLINE/PubMED articles that are about a particular disease, e.g. breast neoplasms. For each
of those articles, we can determine the year of publication, and all of the descriptors assigned by
the MeSH Section staff. A total of 247 million descriptors are assigned to the 27 million articles
in MEDLINE/PubMED, so the average number of descriptors per article is 9.2.
             One potential measure of idea novelty is the (frequency-weighted) mean vintage of
MeSH descriptors used in articles about cancer at site s published in year t:


             VINTAGEst = Σd FREQdst FIRST_YEARd
                               Σd FREQdst

where

       VINTAGEst = the (frequency-weighted) mean vintage of MeSH descriptors assigned to
                 articles about cancer at site s published in year t

             FREQdst = the number of times MeSH descriptor d was assigned to articles about
                     cancer at site s published in year t

 FIRST_YEARd = the first year in which MeSH descriptor d was assigned to any article in
             MEDLINE/PubMED

Because the time coverage of MEDLINE/PubMED is generally 1946 to the present, with some
older material, the variable FIRST_YEARd is left-censored. 16,17 Therefore, a measure like the


16
  The number of descriptors increased from 297 in 1944 to 11,205 in 1947.
17
  I calculated the vintage of each descriptor (FIRST_YEARd) by determining the first year in which the descriptor
occurred in the file containing 247 million descriptor records merged with publication dates. Two alternative
potential methods of calculating the vintage of each descriptor did not yield reliable results. One of these methods is
to use the DA (DATE OF ENTRY) field in the ASCII MeSH file. The other is to use the Medline citation counts by
                                                                                                                    9


following, based on a binary function of FIRST_YEAR, may be more appropriate than a
measure based on FIRST_YEAR itself:

         POST1975%st = Σd FREQdst POST1975d
                            Σd FREQdst

where

 POST1975%st = the (frequency-weighted) fraction of MeSH descriptors assigned to articles
             about cancer at site s published in year t that were established after 1975

    POST1975d = 1 if FIRST_YEARd > 1975

                     = 0 if FIRST_YEARd < 1975

         The MeSH FTP Archive includes lists of new MeSH descriptors added each year since
1999. For example, one file shows MeSH descriptors added in 2016. Some new MeSH
descriptors are not new ideas. For example, one MeSH descriptor added in 2016 was “Alcohol
Drinking in College” (UI D000067292); this “idea” undoubtedly occurred to someone well
before 2016. Hence, the relative frequency of new MeSH descriptors is a noisy, or imperfect,
measure of the penetration of new medical ideas. If this measurement error is random, it will
bias the coefficients on our measures of new ideas towards zero.
         The MEDLINE/PubMED data provide us with an opportunity to assess the validity of
MeSH descriptor novelty as an indicator of new ideas, or technological progress. Most scholars
agree with Jones’ (1998, pp.89-90) statement that “technological progress is driven by research
and development (R&D) in the advanced world.” It is possible to distinguish between
MEDLINE/PubMED articles that resulted from research funding (when that financial support is
mentioned in the articles) and MEDLINE/PubMED articles that did not result from (or mention)
research funding. 18 One would expect newer descriptors to be assigned to “research-based
articles” than to “non-research-based” articles. Figure 4 shows the % of descriptors in 2010


descriptor and year from the Unified Medical Language System. See
https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/2006AA_umls_documentation.pdf
18
   MeSH includes Publication Types to identify financial support of the research that resulted in the published papers
when that support is mentioned in the articles. Three types of research support (Non-U.S. Gov't, U.S. Gov't--Non-
P.H.S., and U.S. Gov't--P.H.S.) have been coded since 1975; two types (N.I.H.--Extramural and N.I.H.--Intramural)
have been coded since 2005; and one type (American Recovery & Reinvestment Act) has been coded since 2010.
Funding Support (Grant) Information in MEDLINE/PubMed.
                                                                                                            10


publications established after 1980, by type of research support. 4.5% of the descriptors in 2010
“non-research” publications were established after 1980. 8.1% of the descriptors in 2010
publications that mentioned non-government (but not government) research support were
established after 1980. 8.8% of the descriptors in 2010 publications that mentioned government
(but not non-government) research support were established after 1980. And 10.5% of the
descriptors in 2010 publications that mentioned both non-government and government research
support were established after 1980. This evidence supports the hypothesis that newer
descriptors are assigned to “research articles” than to “non-research” articles.
          The vintage measure described above will be constructed using data on one MeSH record
type: MeSH descriptors. Another MeSH record type is Supplementary Concept Records (SCRs).
SCRs are used to index chemicals, drugs, and other concepts such as rare diseases. The vintage
measure described above (POST1975%st) can be constructed using both SCRs and descriptor
records combined instead of using descriptor records alone. 19
          There are several reasons to believe that vintage measures based solely on descriptor
records are more reliable than vintage measures based on both SCRs and descriptor records
combined. The NLM says that descriptors “play a central role in MeSH vocabulary as a unit of
indexing and retrieval” 20; they don’t say that about SCRs. Descriptors seem to be more carefully
curated than SCRs: descriptors are generally updated on an annual basis (but may, on occasion,
be updated more frequently), while SCRs are created daily. Most importantly, vintage measures
based on both SCRs and descriptor records combined may be subject to double-counting, since
“each SCR is linked to one or more Descriptors by the Heading Mapped To (HM) field in the
SCR.” 21

    IV.      Data sources and descriptive statistics

          Survival rate data for SEER 9 registries were obtained from SEER*Stat Software
(Version 8.3.4).


19
   Although the number of SCR terms (> 230,000) is much greater than the number of descriptors (about 28,000),
the number of descriptor records in PubMed cancer publications is more than 5 times as great as the number of
SCRs.

   9 of the 10 (and 19 of the 31) largest-selling cancer drugs (e.g. RITUXIMAB, BEVACIZUMAB) have descriptor
records rather than SCRs. Other cancer drugs with SCRs are mapped to descriptor records. For example,
NILOTINIB is mapped to Pyrimidines, and IPILIMUMAB is mapped to Antibodies, Monoclonal.

       Mortality data were obtained from the raw datafiles of the WHO Mortality Database,
which is a compilation of mortality data by age, sex and cause of death, as reported annually by
Member States from their civil registration systems.
       MEDLINE/PubMed data were provided by Pierre Azoulay and Bhaven Sampat, who
obtained and reformatted data from the NLM Bulk Download FTP site.
       Cancer incidence data from SEER 9 registries were obtained from SEER research data,
which include SEER incidence and population data associated by age, sex, race, year of
diagnosis, and geographic areas (including SEER registry and county).
       Population by age data were obtained from CDC Wonder Bridged-Race Population
Estimates 1990-2013.
       Disease classification. The disease (cancer site) classification used in the analysis was
based on the SEER Cause of Death Recode 1969+. Appendix Table 1 shows the MeSH
descriptors linked to SEER causes of death.
       Observed and expected 5-year survival rates in 1994 and 2008 of patients diagnosed in
SEER 9 registries, by cancer site ranked by descending number of patients diagnosed in 1994,
are shown in Appendix Table 2.
       Mortality and incidence data for 1999 and 2013, by cancer site ranked by descending
YPLL80 in 1999, are shown in Appendix Table 3.
       Figure 5 shows the percent of descriptors in 2013 articles that were established after
1980, by cancer site, for cancer sites with at least 10,000 descriptors in 2013. The percent of
post-1980 descriptors in 2013 was almost twice as great for the top two cancer sites as it was for
the bottom two.
       Figure 6 shows the percent of cancer article descriptors that were less than 25 years old,
by publication year (1995-2015). The new descriptor fraction exhibits a slight downward trend;
it was 7.1% during 1995-2005 and 6.3% in 2010-2015. Bloom et al (2017) “present a wide
range of evidence from various industries, products, and firms showing that research effort is
rising substantially while research productivity is declining sharply.” The slight downward trend
in the mean novelty of cancer publications may indicate that cancer research effort has not
increased as much as cancer research productivity has declined.

     V.      Empirical results


     a. Survival model (eq. (1)) estimates


          Estimates of βk parameters of models of the 5-year observed survival rate (eq. (1)) are
shown in Table 1. Each estimate is from a separate model. All models included
ln(SURV_EXPst / (1 – SURV_EXPst)), ln(N_DXst), cancer-site and year fixed effects;
coefficients on these variables are not shown to conserve space. 22 I estimated 6 sets of models;
these sets varied with respect to (1) whether all cancer sites were included; (2) whether the
NEW_IDEAS measure was based on descriptor records only or descriptor + supplementary
concept records; and (3) the year threshold (e.g. 1975) for distinguishing between “new ideas”
and “old ideas.” For each set, I estimated the model for 9 different assumed lags (0, 3, 6,…,24
years) of NEW_IDEAS.
          In Panel A of Table 5, all cancer sites are included; the NEW_IDEAS measure is based
on descriptor records only; and the new-idea year threshold is 1975. When the lag length k < 9,
the estimates of βk are not statistically significant. However, when k > 12, the estimates of βk are
positive and highly statistically significant. This indicates that the 5-year survival rate is not
related to the novelty of ideas in (i.e. the fraction of post-1975 descriptors of) articles published
0-9 years earlier, but strongly related to the novelty of ideas in articles published 12-24 years
earlier. This finding is consistent with the evidence from case studies cited above that it takes a
long time for research evidence to reach clinical practice.
          The estimates in Table 1 are weighted by the number of patients diagnosed, and as shown
in Appendix Table 2, the cancer site with the largest number of patients diagnosed is prostate
cancer. Although prostate cancer does not appear to be an outlier (e.g. with respect to
NEW_IDEAS, as shown in Figure 5), some estimates suggested that it might be an influential
observation. Panel B of Table 1 shows estimates of eq. (1) when prostate cancer is excluded.
The point estimates of the parameters are somewhat smaller, but as in Panel A, when the lag
length k < 9, the estimates of βk are not statistically significant, and when k > 12, the estimates of
βk are positive and highly statistically significant.

22
 The coefficient on ln(SURV_EXPst / (1 – SURV_EXPst)) was positive and significant in some, but not all,
models. The coefficient on ln(N_DXst) was insignificant in all models.
                                                                                                          13


        In Panel C of Table 1, all cancer sites are included, and the NEW_IDEAS measure is
based on descriptor + supplementary concept records. The same pattern emerges: estimates of βk
are positive and highly statistically significant only when k > 12.
        In Panel D, prostate cancer is excluded, and the NEW_IDEAS measure is based on
descriptor + supplementary concept records. In this case, the β15 and β18 coefficients are
statistically significant (the β12 coefficient is marginally significant), but the β21 and β24
coefficients are insignificant. However, it may be inappropriate to exclude prostate cancer, 23 and
as discussed above, vintage measures based solely on descriptor records are probably more
reliable than vintage measures based on both SCRs and descriptor records combined.
        Panels E and F of Table 1 examine the sensitivity of the estimates to the choice of the
year threshold for distinguishing between “new ideas” and “old ideas.” In Panel E, the year
threshold is 1970; in Panel F, it is 1980. In both cases, estimates of βk are positive and highly
statistically significant only when k > 12.


     b. Mortality model (eq. (2)) estimates


        Estimates of βk parameters of models of mortality measures (eq. (2)) are shown in Table
2. Once again, each estimate is from a separate model. All models included
ln(N_DX_10_YEARst), AGE_DX_10_YEARst, cancer-site and year fixed effects; coefficients
on these variables are not shown to conserve space. 24 I estimated 6 sets of models; these sets
varied with respect to (1) the dependent variable (mortality measure); and (2) whether the
NEW_IDEAS measure was based on descriptor records only or descriptor + supplementary
concept records. In all models in Table 2, the year threshold for distinguishing between “new
ideas” and “old ideas” was 1980. For each set, I estimated the model for 9 different assumed
lags (0, 3, 6,…,24 years).
        In Panel A of Table 2, the dependent variable is ln(YPLL80)—the log of the number of
years of potential life lost before age 80. The estimated coefficient on POST1980%s,t-k is not
significant for k < 6, but is negative and highly significant for k > 9. This indicates that

23
  The fact that an observation is influential does not necessarily mean that it should be excluded.
24
  The coefficient on ln(N_DX_10_YEARst) was positive and highly significant in all models. The coefficient on
AGE_DX_10_YEARst was negative and highly significant in the YPLL80 and YPLL70 models, and insignificant in
the DEATHS models.
                                                                                                                    14


premature (before age 80) mortality is inversely related to the fraction of descriptors established
after 1980 9-24 years earlier. The estimates in Panel A are plotted in Figure 7. The relationship
across cancer sites between the 1981-1995 change in POST1980% and the 1999-2013 change in
ln(YPLL80), controlling for changes in incidence, is shown in Figure 8.
           The estimates in Panel A are weighted by mean YPLL80. As shown in Appendix Table
3, cancer of the lung and bronchus is the largest cause of YPLL80 by far, accounting for more
than a quarter of the total, and almost three times as much as the second highest cause, breast
cancer. But excluding cancer of the lung and bronchus has very little effect on the estimates.
For example, estimates of β18 when cancer of the lung and bronchus are included (as in Panel A)
and excluded are -10.92 (Z = 4.26) and -10.83 (Z = 4.41), respectively. Changing the year
threshold for distinguishing between “new ideas” and “old ideas” to either 1975 or 1985 also has
little effect on the estimates.
           In Panel B of Table 2, POST1980% is based on descriptor + supplementary concept
records. The estimates of βk are negative and highly statistically significant only when k > 12.
           In panels C and D of Table 2, a lower age cutoff—age 70—is used for measuring
premature mortality. The results are similar to those in Panels A and B, where the higher (age
80) age cutoff was used. In Panels E and F of Table 2, the dependent variable is the log of the
number of deaths. The estimates indicate that the number of deaths is inversely related to the
novelty of ideas published in articles 12-24 years earlier, conditional on the number of patients
diagnosed 1-10 years before and their mean age at time of diagnosis.


     VI.      Discussion


           The estimates in Tables 1 and 2 are highly consistent with the hypothesis that the
application of new ideas has increased cancer survival and reduced cancer mortality, with a
significant lag. Now I will quantify the magnitude of these impacts.
           The 1994-2008 change in the weighted (by number of patients diagnosed) mean value of
the log-odds of the observed 5-year survival rate (ln(SURV_OBSst / (1 – SURV_OBSst))) was
0.527. 25 The increase in the log-odds of survival attributable to the increasing share of post-1975


25
  This is larger than the 0.371 increase in the log-odds of the survival rate for all cancer sites combined. That
survival rate increased from 52.1% in 1994 to 61.2% in 2008.
                                                                                                                    15


descriptors may be estimated by multiplying the estimated coefficients in Table 1 by the
weighted mean change in the lagged share of post-1975 descriptors. Panel A of Table 3 shows
these calculations using the statistically significant estimates in Panel A of Table 1.
         The estimate of β12 suggests that the increase in descriptor novelty 12 years earlier
accounted for almost all (94% = .496 / .527) of the increase in survival. The estimate of β24
suggests that the increase in descriptor novelty 24 years earlier accounted for about half as much
(48% = .251 / .527) of the increase in survival. The average of the estimates for 12 < k < 24
suggests that the increase in descriptor novelty 12-24 years earlier accounted for 71% (= .372 /
.527) of the increase in survival.
         The 1999-2013 change in the weighted (by mean YPLL80) mean value of ln(YPLL80)
was 0.045. 26 During that period, the population below age 80 increased by 12.7%, from 270.0 to
304.3 million, so that YPLL80 from cancer per person below age 80 declined by about 8.0%. As
shown in Panel B of Table 3, the average of the estimates for 9 < k < 24 in Panel A of Table 2
suggests that the increase in descriptor novelty 9-24 years earlier resulted in a 26% decline in
YPLL80, and a 38% decline in YPLL80 per person below age 80.
         This is much larger than the actual (8%) reduction in YPLL80 from cancer per person
below age 80. This suggests that, if new ideas had not been applied to cancer, the premature
(before age 80) cancer mortality rate would have increased significantly (by about 30%) between
1999 and 2013. A possible explanation for this is declining competing risk from cardiovascular
disease (Honoré and Lleras-Muney (2006)), although inclusion of cancer incidence measures in
the mortality model may have controlled for this to some extent.

     VII.    Summary and conclusions


         I performed tests of the hypothesis that the arrival of new medical ideas has played a
major role in the long-run increase in U.S. cancer survival and decline in cancer mortality, by
investigating whether the types of cancer (breast, colon, lung, etc.) subject to greater penetration
of new ideas had larger subsequent survival gains and mortality reductions, controlling for
changing incidence.


26
  This is similar to the 0.040 log increase (from 6.06 to 6.31 million) indicated by Years of Potential Life Lost
(YPLL) Reports, 1999 – 2015.
                                                                                                      16


        I used the MEDLINE/PubMED database, which contains more than 23 million references
to journal articles published since 1946 in 5400 of the world's leading biomedical journals, to
construct measures of the penetration of new medical ideas applied to most types of cancer over
time. MEDLINE/PubMED records are indexed with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), “one of
the most highly sophisticated thesauri in existence today.” Between 1955 and 2015, the number
of MeSH descriptors increased from 15.8 thousand to 27.8 thousand. Newer descriptors are
assigned to “research articles” than to “non-research” articles.
        The estimates indicated that the 5-year survival rate is not related to the novelty of ideas
in (i.e. the fraction of post-1975 MeSH descriptors of) articles published 0-9 years earlier, but
strongly positively related to the novelty of ideas in articles published 12-24 years earlier. This
finding is consistent with evidence from case studies that it takes a long time for research
evidence to reach clinical practice. Between 1994 and 2008, the 5-year observed survival rate
for all cancer sites combined increased from 52.1% to 61.2%. The estimates suggest that about
70% of this increase may have been due to the increase in the novelty of medical ideas 12-24
years earlier.
        The number of years of potential life lost from cancer before ages 80 and 70 and the
number of cancer deaths are inversely related to the novelty of ideas in articles published 12-24
years earlier, conditional on the number of patients diagnosed 1-10 years before and their mean
age at time of diagnosis. The increase in descriptor novelty was estimated to have caused a 38%
decline in the premature (before age 80) cancer mortality rate 12-24 years later. The fact that
this is much larger than the actual (8%) reduction in the premature cancer mortality rate may be
due, in part, to declining competing risk from cardiovascular disease.
        The econometric models estimated in this paper probably don’t fully capture the rich
complexity of biomedical innovation. As discussed by Gelijns and Rosenberg (1994):

        The popular perception of medical innovation is one in which a group of biomedical
        scientists has a bright new idea, which then moves in a linear progression from the
        laboratory to animal models, to select populations, and finally to the bedside. Although
        much innovation in medicine flows in this fashion, this linear conceptualization captures
        only part of the reality, particularly with regard to medical devices.”

        …much uncertainty associated with a new technology can be resolved only after
        extensive use in practice. Thus, development does not end with the adoption of an
        innovation. Actual adoption constitutes only the beginning of an often-prolonged process
                                                                                                              17


        in which important redesigning takes place, exploiting the feedback of new information
        generated by users.

        Our econometric analysis provided evidence about the clinical effectiveness of new
medical ideas—their impact on health outcomes—but not on their cost-effectiveness—the ratio
of their impact on cost 27 to their impact on health outcomes. Evaluation of the latter using our
framework would require reliable data on the average cost of treatment, by cancer site and year.
The National Cancer Institute (2018) has published data on average annual treatment cost, by
cancer site, but only during a single period (2001-2006). Moreover, Lipscomb (2008) argues
that estimating the cost of cancer care in the United States is “a work very much in progress”:
“different experts have chosen different data sources and methods to evaluate a specific issue [in
cancer care costing] and have ended up with different results.” Evaluation of the cost-
effectiveness of new medical ideas for cancer (and other diseases) is a task for future research.

Each estimate is from a separate model. All models include ln(SURV_EXPst / (1 – SURV_EXPst)), ln(N_DXst),
cancer-site and year fixed effects; coefficients on these variables are not shown to conserve space. Models were
estimated via weighted-least squares, weighting by N_DXst. Disturbances were clustered within cancer sites.
Estimates in bold are statistically significant (p-value < .05).

Each estimate is from a separate model. All models include ln(N_DX_10_YEARst),
AGE_DX_10_YEARst, cancer-site and year fixed effects; coefficients on these variables are not shown
to conserve space. Models were estimated via weighted-least squares, weighting by (1 / T) ∑t MORTst.
Disturbances were clustered within cancer sites. Estimates in bold are statistically significant (p-value
< .05).
