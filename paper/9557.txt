This paper develops a model of inflation inertia based on optimizing forward looking staggered price
setting in a small open economy. Unlike in current models of sticky prices, transitions to a lower
steady state inflation rate take time even if they are fully credible, and they are associated with
significant output losses. There is a welfare trade-off between these output losses and the gains from

smaller inflationary distortions. For reasonable parameter values inflation stabilization improves

welfare. The optimal steady state is reached at the Friedman rule.

1 Introduction

   An expanding literature on monetary policy analysis uses optimizing dynamic general

equilibrium models in which forward-looking agents face nominal rigidities. This literature builds

on the original time-dependent price adjustment formulations of Taylor (1980), Rotemberg (1982)

and Calvo (1983).1 The renewed interest in this line of research was motivated by empirical

evidence showing that monetary policy has significant short-run real effects.2 But whether the

inflation specifications derived from such models can fully account for all short-run empirical

properties of inflation and output has recently been much debated.3 In particular, starting with

Fuhrer and Moore (1995), existing rational expectations staggered pricing models in which agents

have perfect information have been shown to display a much lower degree of inflation inertia than

what is found in the data. This in turn implies that disinflation policies have minimal real costs,

or even that anticipated disinflations cause booms (Ball, 1994a), which is also inconsistent with a

large body of empirical evidence (see e.g. Gordon 1982, 1997). This paper proposes a tractable

generalization of the Calvo (1983) staggered pricing model that generates both inflation inertia and

recessionary disinflations in a fully specified dynamic general equilibrium model.

   Our model retains the commonly used Calvo (1983) assumption of exogenous and stochastic

timing of price changing opportunities. Where we depart from the existing literature is in the

specification of price setting behavior. In the realistic case of a positive steady state inflation rate,

we suggest that it is plausible to assume that firms employ pricing rules which keep them as close

as possible to their flexible price optimum without incurring reoptimization costs. To keep the

model tractable, we specifically assume that once a firm gets the chance to change its pricing plan,

it jointly and optimally chooses an initial price level and a rate at which it will update its price in

the future, a ‘firm-specific inflation rate’.4 This approach differs from the two dominant approaches

in the literature. In one (e.g. Woodford , 2001) firms choose only a price level without updating. At

positive steady state inflation this has been shown to generate a monetary nonneutrality (Rotemberg

and Woodford,1998) where higher steady state inflation implies lower steady state output through

increased price dispersion. This nonneutrality is removed in the second approach, starting with

Yun (1996), where firms still choose only a price level but update their prices at the steady state

inflation rate at all times.5 But under both of these approaches only the aggregate price level is

sticky while inflation is flexible. Credible disinflations therefore do not cause recessions.

   By contrast, when firms employ pricing rules of the kind we propose, an unexpected and

permanent decline in the steady state inflation rate targeted by monetary policy entails a slow

   4
       As our pricing rule does not take the simple form of setting new price levels, it is important to stress that our
   motivation for time dependent nominal rigidities is not based on menu costs (Akerlof and Yellen (1985)) but instead
   on reoptimization costs, such as costs of information gathering, decision making, negotiation and communication.
   The empirical evidence presented by Zbaracki, Ritson, Levy, Dutta and Bergen (2000) emphasizes the importance
   of such reoptimization costs relative to menu costs. Christiano et al. (2001) also stress the reoptimization cost
   motivation.
   5
       As we allow for updating, our model also removes the nonneutrality.

inflation response and output losses, even if the change in policy is perfectly credible. There

are two main reasons for this. The first is the lingering effect of historic pricing decisions. The

economy initially contains a large number of firms that have chosen their price updating rates under

the previous policy, and the weighted average of such updating rates is an important component of

aggregate inflation. The second reason is the behavior of new price setters. The spread between

firms’ initially chosen price and the aggregate price level—termed front loading by Christiano et

al. (2001) —is the second component of aggregate inflation. Because firms have the option of

updating their prices, front loading will initially respond little to the policy change, contributing to

the sluggishness of the inflation response. Finally, the real interest rate change induced by the slow

inflation response gives rise to a recession.6

   The motivation for our work was first developed in Calvo, Celasun and Kumhof (2001), and

is similar to that of Mankiw and Reis (2002). The latter present a model where price setters

are assumed to be able to reset their price every period, but receive information only at random

intervals. This is equivalent to assuming that firms choose a price path, and it implies that aggregate

inflation responds to monetary policy changes with a lag and that disinflations are recessionary.

The Mankiw and Reis (2002) model is capable of generating predictions that qualitatively match

the inflation inertia and recessionary disinflations features of the data. Its drawback, however, is

that the model’s microeconomic foundations are not fully laid out, which makes it harder to explore


   6
       Empirical tests of the pricing model based on Mexican data, and reported in Calvo, Celasun and Kumhof (2001),
   are supportive of our inflation specification, suggesting that our formulation is a sensible way of capturing inflation
   inertia in similar countries.

                                                           4
its quantitative predictions and their sensitivity to the values of structural parameters. It is therefore

also not possible to conduct welfare analysis. The general equilibrium model of Burstein (2002)

can be seen as a way of providing microeconomic foundations for the Mankiw and Reis (2002)

formulation.7 However it is a nonlinear model and therefore complex to solve. We argue that it

is reasonable to focus on equilibria characterized by a constant steady state growth path for the

nominal anchor. The model can then be solved by linearizing around that steady state. In that case

it is sufficient to allow firms to specify their pricing policies up to the growth rate of their price

path. A considerable advantage of this approach is that our model can be solved with conventional

solution methods, which makes it straightforward to conduct quantitative work including welfare

analysis, as will be shown in Section 4.

   The literature related to inflation inertia also encompasses models of backward-looking

behavior, imperfect credibility, learning and supply side rigidities. Until quite recently the literature

mostly relied on specifications that were not explicitly built on forward-looking optimizing

behavior. Fuhrer and Moore (1995) present a relative real wage model, while Ghezzi (2001) and

Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1999) modify the Calvo (1983) model to allow for a share of price setters

to be backward looking, in the sense of using a rule of thumb that depends on lagged inflation. A

well-known explanation for inflation inertia during disinflations is lack of credibility, e.g. the

papers by Ball (1995) and Calvo and Vegh (1993). However, in many countries where disinflations

were costly the monetary authority enjoyed a high degree of credibility, as argued e.g. by Ball

   7
     In Burstein’s (2002) model pricing decisions are state- as well as time-dependent, but a pure time dependent
   model is shown to be sufficient to characterize disinflationary dynamics when the disinflation is not too large.

                                                        5
(1994b). This is therefore only a suitable explanation for a limited number of cases. Models of

learning about monetary policy have recently become popular, and clearly such models do give rise

to inflation inertia. Two examples are Woodford (2001) and Erceg and Levin (2002). Christiano,

Eichenbaum and Evans (2001) generate inflation and output inertia in a rational expectations model

by introducing a number of nominal and real supply side rigidities. Their most successful model

variant does however still rely on a backward-looking price and wage updating scheme.

   The pricing mechanism we propose is very general and can be embedded in a variety of

macroeconomic models. The key features of inflation inertia and recessionary disinflations are

robust across such environments.8 For this paper we choose an open economy setting, and for

our specification of disinflationary monetary policy we choose exchange rate targeting.9 The

disinflations we have in mind are the moderate disinflations experienced by several industrialized

countries in the 1970s and 1980s, and by a number of countries in Latin America in more recent

years.10

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3

discusses model calibration and computation of solution paths for a permanent and credible

disinflation. Section 4 evaluates the welfare trade-off between the output losses and efficiency


   8
       For example, Kumhof, Cespedes and Parrado (2002) analyze the closed economy case in a discrete time sto-
   chastic setting.
   9
       A model of inflation targeting is analytically more complex while displaying very similar qualitative features.
  10
       Historically, many exchange rate based stabilizations of very high inflation have been characterized by an
   initial consumption boom followed by a later recession, see Calvo and Vegh (1999) for a survey. Our model
   does not incorporate elements that could generate such a boom, such as lack of credibility or wealth effects.
   Our result that inflation inertia by itself leads to an initial recession is consistent with Calvo and Vegh (1994),
   who posit a wage setting equation that is not derived from optimization.

2 The Model

   Consider a small open economy which consists of a government, a continuum of measure one

of identical price-taking infinitely-lived households, and a continuum, indexed by j ∈ [0, 1], of

monopolistically competitive infinitely-lived nontradable goods producing firms. The economy

trades goods with the rest of the world, and for the prices of these tradable goods purchasing power

parity is assumed to hold. Normalizing the foreign price level to one this implies that the nominal

price of tradables equals the nominal exchange rate Et . The nominal price level of nontradable

goods is denoted by Pt , and the associated inflation rate by π t = Ṗt /Pt . The relative price of

tradables and nontradables, which will be referred to as the real exchange rate, is et = Et /Pt . The

economy can also freely borrow from or lend to the rest of the world, and uncovered interest parity

is assumed to hold:


                                                    it = r + εt .                                                   (1)


   Here r is the exogenous, constant and positive real international interest rate, εt = Ėt /Et is

the rate of exchange rate depreciation, and it is the nominal interest rate on domestic currency

denominated assets.

     Households maximize lifetime utility, which depends on their consumption of homogenous

tradable goods c∗t , heterogeneous nontradable goods ct (j), j ∈ [0, 1], and utility from leisure 1−Lt ,

where 1 is the fixed endowment of time and Lt is total labor supply to firms. To rule out inessential

dynamics households’ personal discount rate is assumed to equal the real return r on international

bonds denominated in units of tradable goods bt . Aggregate nontradables consumption is given

   Here λ is the constant multiplier of the lifetime budget constraint (8), equal to the shadow

value of lifetime wealth. Equation (9) equates the marginal utility of tradables consumption to

the marginal utility of wealth times the effective price of consumption, the latter being equal to

the purchase price plus the cost of holding the money balances necessary to conduct transactions.

Equation (10) equates the marginal rate of substitution between tradables and nontradables to their

relative price, the real exchange rate. Equation (11) equates the real wage to the marginal rate of

substitution between consumption and leisure, corrected for a monetary distortion. The latter is

increasing in deviations from the Friedman rule.

      Firms

   Firms in the nontradables sector are distributed uniformly along the unit interval and have linear

production functions in labor input lt (j):


                                     yt (j) = lt (j),   j ∈ [0, 1] .                            (12)

   They are price takers in the labor market and monopolistically competitive in the goods market.

Firms distribute all nominal profits Πt (j) to households in a lump-sum fashion:


                            Πt (j) = Pt (j)ct (j) − Wt lt (j),   j ∈ [0, 1] .                   (13)

   Following Calvo (1983), it is assumed that firms only get infrequent opportunities to change

their prices, and that these opportunities arrive as exogenous random processes. For each firm they

follow an exponential distribution with probability density δe−δt , and are therefore independent

of their last occurrence. They are also independent across firms. This allows the application of

                                                   10
a law of large numbers and implies that firm-specific uncertainty does not translate into income

uncertainty for the representative household.

   Firms maximize the present discounted value of real future profits each time they are allowed

to change prices. Their discount rate is the own rate of interest for nontradable goods r + εt − π t ,

and in addition they weight profits at each future time by the probability that today’s price will still

be in force. Firms’ real marginal cost equals the real wage in terms of nontradables wt = Wt /Pt ,

where Wt and Pt are taken as given. Firms receive a proportional output subsidy sub = (σ − 1)−1

from the government. This offsets the steady state markup distortion that arises under monopolistic

competition (see e.g. Woodford (2002)). Crucially for this paper, whenever firms do receive a price

changing opportunity they determine an optimal price schedule, consisting of today’s price level

Vtj and a firm specific inflation rate vtj . If the price schedule of product variety j was last set at

time t, we therefore have for all s > t that

   We define the new variable pt ≡ Vt /Pt , the initial relative price of new price setters. Note also

   Steady state values will be denoted by a bar above the respective variable. Note that in steady

state, for a constant rate of exchange rate depreciation ε̄, we must have π̄ = v̄ = ε̄ and p̄ = 1. The

steady state real wage therefore follows from (17) as w̄ = 1. The first-order condition for vt is
   Z       ∞        Rs                               ³     Rs             ´−σ        h     Rs                 i

   Next we linearize (17) and (18) around the steady state.12 The following expressions are

obtained:

   The derivatives with respect to time of these expressions are

       In the following derivations we make use of the following two properties of exponential distributions: δ                       (s−

   We combine (21) and (22) to obtain the following differential equation for the firm-specific

inflation rate vt :

                                         v̇t = −(δ + r)2 (pt − wt )                 .                       (23)

   It is clear that υ t is a jump variable. When there is a discrete change in the monetary policy

regime it will be optimal for firms receiving a price changing signal to allow discrete changes in

both their current price and their firm specific inflation rate.

   To complete the description of price dynamics we now turn to the aggregate price index. When

firms set prices in the manner specified above, the index (4) can be rewritten as
                                 µ Z       t                                         ¶ 1−σ

                                         −∞


   To obtain an expression for the aggregate inflation rate we first take the derivative of (24) with

respect to time. We obtain:
                                                   Z   t               ³     R               ´1−σ

                                                           e            ps e                      vs ds .   (25)
                     1−σ t                         −∞


   Next we linearize this expression around the steady state:
                             Z   t             ·                     µ           Z t              ¶¸

                              −∞                                                                 s

   This expression can be simplified by realizing that the price index (24) can, after applying the

                                                               13

   Substituting this expression into (26) we obtain
                                                              Z   t

   We now define a new variable ψt as the weighted average of currently ’active’ firm-specific

   This variable is predetermined, and its time derivative is


                                           ψ̇t = δ(vt − ε̄) − δ(ψt − ε̄) .                         (30)

   Using the definition of ψt we can rewrite the expression for aggregate inflation as


                                      (π t − ε̄) = δ(pt − 1) + (ψt − ε̄) .                         (31)

   This is a key equation. The second term reflects inertia in the aggregate inflation rate through

the historic pricing policies of firms which have not yet received a price changing opportunity. The

first term, the initial relative price of new price setters pt , is free to jump at time 0. Therefore,

despite the presence of an inertial component, aggregate inflation is a free or jump variable. Its

derivative with respect to time is found, after some algebra, to equal


     π̇t = −(3δ + 2r)(ψt − ε̄) + 2δ(vt − ε̄) + (δ + 2r)(π t − ε̄) − 2δ(δ + r) (wt − 1)         .   (32)

   Expression (31) can also be used to rewrite the differential equation for firm-specific inflation

     The system of differential equations (30), (32) and (33) in ψ, π and v must be closed with

a fourth equation for real marginal cost w, derived from (11), to fully characterize the dynamic

behavior of this economy. To do so we must first describe government behavior and define

equilibrium.

   Equations (34), (8) holding with equality, and the definition of equilibrium imply that the

following aggregate budget constraint must hold:

   Combining this constraint with the first order condition (9) one can derive the path of tradables

consumption. This is trivial for the case of a constant nominal interest rate such as in our assumed

permanent stabilization policy, which features a constant predetermined exchange rate depreciation

path. We have

                                         c∗t = y ∗ + rf0 ∀t .                                   (39)

   Note that, even for the more general disinflation policies discussed in Section 4, the equilibrium

paths of tradables consumption and therefore of net foreign assets can be computed independently

from the rest of the economy because they are functions only of endowments (f0 and y ∗ ) and of

exogenous world and policy variables (r and εt ). This is useful in computing the equilibrium of

the nontradable goods market.

      Complete Dynamic System

   The results of the previous subsection can be used to derive a differential equation for real

marginal cost w from (11). We begin by linearizing the equation around the steady state, obtaining

                                                 α                   L̄
                (wt − 1) = (ln ct − ln c̄) +           (εt − ε̄) +        (ln Lt − ln L̄) .     (40)
                                               1 + αı̄             1 − L̄
   To make further progress we have to establish a relationship between c and L. It is shown in

Appendix A that L̄ = c̄ and that, after linearizing, one obtains

                                    ln Lt − ln L̄ = ln ct − ln c̄ .                             (41)

   Therefore (40) simplifies to

                                        1                        α
                         (wt − 1) =          (ln ct − ln c̄) +         (εt − ε̄) .              (42)
                                      1 − c̄                   1 + αı̄

                                                    17
   Note that steady state nontradables consumption c̄ is a strictly decreasing function of the

exogenous steady state nominal interest rate ı̄. This reflects the negative effect of deviations from

the Friedman rule on steady state output, which will play an important part in the welfare analysis.

It can be seen in the steady state version of (11):

                                                    (1 − γ)
                                       c̄ =                        .                              (43)
                                              (1 − γ) + κ(1 + αı̄)
   Next we linearize equation (10) to obtain the first term of equation (42):

                      (ln(ct ) − ln(c̄)) = (ln(c∗t ) − ln(c̄∗ )) + (ln(et ) − ln(ē)) .           (44)

   To derive a differential equation for wt note first that, given (9) and our assumptions about

government policy, exchange rate depreciation and the tradables consumption profile satisfy ε̇t = 0

and ċ∗t = 0. Secondly, for the real exchange rate we have
                                               •
                                           (ln et ) = εt − πt    .                                (45)

   Therefore we finally obtain
                                   µ     ¶              µ        ¶
                                    1                       1
                          ẇt = −          (π t − ε̄) +            (εt − ε̄) .                    (46)
                                  1 − c̄                  1 − c̄
   This equation says that a real appreciation, i.e. a rising relative price of nontradables, is

associated with a fall in real wages in the nontradables sector. The reason is that the higher relative

price lowers the demand for nontradables output and therefore for labor, which depresses the real

wage.

   We now show that wt is a predetermined variable. Consider equation (42) and the possibility

of jumps at time 0. The excess demand component is decomposed in (44). The real exchange

                                                     18
rate is predetermined under predetermined nominal exchange rates and sticky prices, while the

tradables consumption path is a function only of exogenous lifetime resources and government

policies. This makes excess demand a predetermined variable. See Ghezzi (2001) and Calvo and

Vegh (1994) for similar arguments. Jumps in εt in equation (42) are also exogenous. Therefore

wt is a predetermined variable, along with ψt . The variables vt and πt are free to jump at time 0.

The full dynamic system for this economy is represented by equations (30), (33), (32) and (46). In

matrix form it looks as follows:

   In Appendix B we prove that this system has two eigenvalues with positive real parts and two

with negative real parts. Given our results about the number of predetermined variables this proves

that the system is saddle path stable. It can further be shown numerically that for a very large range

of relevant parameter values13 all roots are real.


3 Model Solution and Discussion

       Calibration

   In this section we compute solution paths for the model after assigning the parameter values

shown in Table 1. The time unit for calibration of stock-flow ratios is one quarter. We consider a

relatively moderate disinflation from 20% to 10%, which is of the order of magnitude of several

recent and current Latin American disinflations. The parameters α and r are calibrated based on
  13
       We searched over δ ∈ [0.05, 2], leaving all other values at those used below in the calibrations.

sample averages for Brazil between the beginning of 1995 and the end of 1998, corresponding to

the main period of that country’s exchange rate based disinflation plan. Inverse velocity α is set

equal to the average of the M2/GDP ratio, giving α = 1.118. The real marginal cost of Brazil’s

borrowing in international capital markets is given by the nominal Brady bond yield adjusted for

US inflation, which equals r = 12.68% p.a.. A 50% share of tradables in consumption γ is

empirically reasonable for most countries, see De Gregorio, Giovannini and Wolf (1994). The

value for the proportion of time spent working in steady state, L̄ = 1/3, is based on the evidence

cited in Cooley and Prescott (1995). We assume that this is the value associated with the high

inflation steady state, and compute the larger value associated with low inflation from (11). Finally,

the average length of price quotations of four quarters implied by δ = 1/4 is reasonable, see the

evidence cited in Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996, chapter 10) and Taylor (1998).

   Without loss of generality we normalize the tradables endowment to y ∗ = L̄ = c̄, and initial net

foreign assets to f0 = 0. Note that for the purpose of presenting computed solution paths in Figure

1 we renormalize the initial steady state values of tradables and nontradables consumption to 1.

The log-linear specification of the utility index implies an intertemporal elasticity of substitution of

one. Empirical estimates of this elasticity are typically below one, as in Reinhart and Vegh (1995).

However, see Ogaki and Reinhart (1998) and Eckstein and Leiderman (1992) for examples of

estimates closer to one.

     Dynamic Response to Disinflation

   Figure 2 shows equilibrium paths for an unanticipated permanent inflation stabilization from

20% p.a. to 10% p.a. In a conventional Calvo-Yun sticky price model this would have no real

effects, and aggregate inflation would immediately jump to 10%. By contrast, in our model

inflation π does not immediately jump to the new lower steady state level. As can be seen in

equation (31), this has two main reasons. The first is the lingering influence of historic price

setting decisions on current aggregate inflation through the weighted average of past firm-specific

inflation rates ψ. While ψ immediately starts to decline it can only adjust slowly as and when

additional firms revise their pricing policies. The second reason is the behavior of current price

setters. Given the permanent nature of disinflation, the response of their updating rate vt is very

strong, and consequently the extent of their front loading pt need not change very much. But pt

is the second component of aggregate inflation. Inflation therefore also responds slowly because

current price setters can spread their response to new information out over time, unlike in the

Calvo-Yun model.



                                                21
   The slow response of nontradables inflation combined with the immediately lower exchange

rate depreciation implies that the real exchange rate appreciates sharply. In other words, the own

real rate of interest on nontradables r+ε−π initially falls sharply, giving rise to a downward sloping

path of nontradables consumption. The lowest point, an output loss of around 2%, is reached at

the time nontradables inflation starts to undershoot exchange rate depreciation, thereby starting to

depreciate the real exchange rate to its new equilibrium level. The nontradables recession is fairly

long-lived at around a two-year duration.

   In the new steady state nontradables output is permanently higher, reflecting the efficiency

gain resulting from a reduction in the monetary distortion to the consumption-leisure choice, see

equation (43). Disinflation therefore entails initial output costs and eventual permanent output

gains. A welfare-theoretic evaluation of this trade-off is undertaken in Section 4.


4 Welfare

   In analyzing the effects of disinflation policy in the previous section, it was found that there is a

trade-off between costs due to an initial recession and benefits due to eventually smaller inflation-

induced distortions to the consumption-leisure choice. The appropriate metric to evaluate this

trade-off is the compensating variation in lifetime consumption introduced by Lucas (1987). The

net welfare gain accomplished by a permanent reduction in the rate of exchange rate depreciation

is defined as the fraction by which consumers’ original steady state consumption basket c̄∗γ c̄1−γ

would have to be increased to make them indifferent between their lifetime utility in the

old, high inflation steady state and the lifetime utility achieved along the equilibrium path to the

new, low inflation steady state. For the disinflation shown in Figure 1 this calculation produces

a small welfare gain of 0.0272%. That is a very small gain from a 10% reduction in inflation.

Some further comments are therefore warranted. Most importantly, this is a net gain after taking

account of the welfare costs of the nontradables recession. Furthermore, it is not clear that adding

more features to the model would necessarily increase that gain significantly. On the one hand

one may prefer to introduce different or even multiple monetary distortions, which would produce

larger efficiency gains. But another reasonable generalization would be the introduction of wage

stickiness, which could considerably increase the cost of the recession. Therefore, what we wish

to emphasize in the current paper is the existence of a trade-off when disinflating under inflation

inertia, rather than the precise welfare numbers obtained.

   Next we explore the sensitivity of our welfare results to two parameters, the degree of price

stickiness and the speed of disinflation. We parametrize the latter by considering gradual linear

disinflation policies of the following form:

                                  ε̇t = −η     for t < (εh − εl )/η ,                            (48)

                                          0 for t ≥ (εh − εl )/η ,

   where the parameter η characterizes the speed of disinflation. The results are presented in

Figure 2 below in terms of contours of net utility gains. The horizontal axis is the overall length

of the disinflation period or degree of gradualism (εh − εl )/η while the vertical axis is the average

duration of pricing policies 1/δ. The figure shows that, for reasonable average contract lengths of

                                                  24
up to four quarters, a disinflation from 20% p.a. to 10% p.a. produces small net welfare gains of

around 0.03% - 0.05%. These gains are always decreasing in 1/δ, because the latter deepens and

prolongs the nontradables recession. For any given 1/δ greater gradualism causes a milder real

appreciation and therefore a shallower nontradables recession. But the downside of gradualism

is the fact that the efficiency gains associated with the new less distorted steady state are realized

later. At high 1/δ the first effect is stronger and greater gradualism improves welfare. But for lower

1/δ excessive gradualism starts to reduce welfare because the efficiency gains are delayed for too

long. This is reflected in the fact that the welfare contours eventually bend downwards. Figure 2

suggests that for our chosen value of δ the length of the disinflation period should be quite short,

between one and two years.

   The same qualitative results hold for any size of disinflation in our model. Whether welfare is

increased depends on the size of the monetary distortion, the average duration of pricing policies,

and the degree of gradualism. Similar results will also hold if the monetary distortion is introduced

in other ways as long as lower steady state inflation implies higher steady state welfare.

   Finally, the minimum possible rate of steady state inflation is given by the Friedman rule −r,

which is also the welfare maximizing steady state. This is in contrast to a recent literature14 which,

using a framework where firms can only choose a price level, finds that the welfare maximizing

steady state minimizes relative price dispersion and is therefore found close to zero inflation, not

at the Friedman rule.

5 Conclusion

   This paper proposes a model of inflation inertia in an environment of maximizing, rational,

forward-looking agents. It has set out one way to reconcile rational expectations staggered pricing

models with important empirical regularities that have been hard to explain, namely inflation

inertia and recessionary disinflations. In the proposed framework it becomes possible to conduct

an explicit welfare analysis of disinflations that quantifies the trade-off between initial recessions

and eventual efficiency gains. Under our parameterizations the latter were found to be always

larger. As a by-product it was also shown that under our price-setting assumptions the Friedman

rule continues to attain the optimal steady state.


                                                                                                            26
   An attractive feature of this approach is that it accomplishes these objectives while otherwise

remaining firmly within the ’New Keynesian’ modelling tradition. This opens up rich possibilities

for expanding an already large research agenda.




Appendix A. The Relationship between Labor Supply and
Nontradables Consumption

   We begin by defining the aggregate output index yt as
                                             µZ        1                       ¶ σ−1
                                                                                  σ
                                                                    σ−1
                                   yt =                    yt (j)    σ    dj                   .   (A.1)
                                                   0


   From the definition of equilibrium we know that yt (j) = ct (j) and therefore yt = ct . Then (3)

and (4) give us
                                                                µ              ¶−σ
                                                                    Pt (j)
                                        yt (j) = yt                                    .           (A.2)
                                                                     Pt
   Next we define the aggregate output quantity index ỹt , using (12) and (37), as
                                       Z     1                      Z     1
                               ỹt =             yt (j)dj =                   lt (j)dj = Lt ,      (A.3)
                                         0                            0


   and the alternative price index P̃t as
                                                  µZ       1                       ¶− σ1
                                       P̃t =                   Pt (j)   −σ
                                                                              dj           .       (A.4)
                                                       0


   Then we can derive the following relationship from (A.1) - (A.4):
                                        Ã !−σ          Ã !−σ
                                          P̃t           P̃t
                             Lt = ỹt =           yt =          ct .                               (A.5)
                                          Pt            Pt

                                                                27
   This implies that the steady state relationship between labor supply and nontradables

consumption/output is

                                                L̄ = c̄ .                                         (A.6)

   Furthermore, (A.5) can be linearized as
                                                                 Ã         !
                          ¡             ¢                            P̃t
                           ln Lt − ln L̄ = (ln ct − ln c̄) − σ           −1 .                     (A.7)
                                                                     Pt
   Using (A.4) the linearization of the ratio P̃t /Pt can be shown to equal
                 Ã         ! Z                   µ             Z t              ¶

   But from (27) the right-hand side of this equation is zero. For the linearized system we therefore

obtain the simple relationship

evaluated at the original steady state c̄ = 1/3, can be derived as

                                  λ4 − 2rλ3 + λ2 r2 − 3δ(δ + r)                                   (B.1)
                                                    3¡ 2        ¢
                              +λ(3δ2 r + 3δr2 ) +     δ (δ + r)2 = 0 .
                                                    2
   In the following we make use of Theorem 1.2.12 in Horn and Johnson (1985, p. 42). Let the

4 × 4 coefficient matrix in (47) be denoted by A, and the four roots by λ1 , λ2 , λ3 , λ4 . Then it must

                                                  28
be true that
                                                          3¡ 2        ¢
                               λ1 λ2 λ3 λ4 = det(A) =       δ (δ + r)2 > 0 .                       (B.2)
                                                          2
   There must therefore be zero, two or four roots with negative real part. Furthermore,

                                  λ1 + λ2 + λ3 + λ4 = tr(A) = 2r > 0 .                             (B.3)

   This rules out the case of four roots with negative real part. For the final part of the proof, let

χx,y,z be the 3 × 3 principal minor of A associated with columns and rows x, y and z. Then the

theorem states that the following must hold:

               λ1 λ2 λ3 + λ1 λ2 λ4 + λ1 λ3 λ4 + λ2 λ3 λ4 = χ1,2,3 + χ1,2,4 + χ1,3,4 + χ2,3,4   .   (B.4)

   For the sake of our argument, let the roots λ3 and λ4 have positive real parts. We compute the

right-hand side and rewrite the left-hand side of (B.4) to get

                        (λ1 + λ2 )λ3 λ4 + λ1 λ2 (λ3 + λ4 ) = −3(δ 2 r + δr2 ) < 0 .                (B.5)

   The second term on the left-hand side is positive, and therefore we must have

                                              λ1 + λ2 < 0 .                                        (B.6)

   This requires that these two roots be either real and negative or complex with negative real

parts. As mentioned in the text, it can be established numerically that they are in fact real for all

interesting parameter values. The same is true for the positive roots.
