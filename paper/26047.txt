Fertility Decline in the Civil Rights Era

                                            ABSTRACT

Large black-white fertility differences are a key feature of US demography, and are closely
related to the broader dynamics of US racial inequality. To better understand the origins and
determinants of racial fertility differentials, this paper examines fertility patterns in the period
surrounding passage and implementation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which precipitated a
period of rapid socioeconomic and political progress among African Americans, with these gains
strongly concentrated in the South. I first show that the relative fertility of southern black women
precipitously declined immediately after 1964. Specifically, as of 1964 the general fertility rate of
southern black women was 53 births greater than the general fertility rate of southern white
women, but by 1969 this gap had fallen to 33 births, a decline of approximately 40% in five
years. The black-white fertility gap outside of the South was unchanged over this period.
Measures of completed childbearing similarly show rapid black-white fertility convergence in the
South but not in the North. An analysis of potential mechanisms finds that a substantial share of
the observed fertility convergence can be explained by relative improvements in the earnings of
southern blacks, and that the historical intensity of slavery and lynching activity are the strongest
spacial correlates of fertility convergence

Introduction

Large black-white dierences in fertility are among the most salient and persistent demographic features of

the United States. As early as the 1830 Census, the completed childbearing of African American women was

observed to be more than one full child greater than that of white women, and large black-white fertility

dierentials were maintained through emancipation, industrialization, the baby boom, and the advent of

eective reproductive control methods, among other transformative fertility-related events (Tolnay 1981;

Tamura et al. 2016; Bailey & Hershbein 2018).


Black-white fertility dierences are in part a consequence of discrimination faced by African Americans. For

example, discriminatory labor markets will reduce the opportunity cost of children by lowering the potential

earnings of black parents, and unequal access to educational and medical services will constrain the ability of

African American parents to invest heavily in the human capital of a smaller number of children (see Becker

1960). More fundamentally, for extended periods of US history African American women have had minimal

protections against sexual violence or other violations of reproductive autonomy (Roberts 1999).


In addition to being a result of discrimination, racial fertility dierences have also likely been one cause of

the contemporary persistence of racial inequality. For example research indicates that fertility events have

large and sustained negative impacts on women's labor supply and wages (Angrist & Evans 1998; Kleven

et al.   2019), such that greater fertility among African American women will depress their total earnings

relative to groups with lower fertility. Similarly, there is evidence that larger family sizes and higher birth

orders have negative eects on children's educational and labor market outcomes (Black et al. 2005; Conley

& Glauber 2006; Sacerdote 2007), and racial fertility dierentials will mechanically cause the average African

American child to come from a larger family and be of a higher birth order than the average white child.


Given these strong and multidirectional relationships between fertility and socioeconomic outcomes, under-

standing the nature and causes of racial dierences in fertility is critical for understanding the nature and

causes of US racial inequality more generally.


Recent work has used historical events to better understand the origins and determinants of racial fertility

dierentials. For example, Allen (2015) studies the fertility outcomes of enslaved women before and after

implementation of the Fugitive Slave Act, and nds that fertility declined with the probability of successful

escape.   Likewise, Aaronson et al.   (2014) examines the fertility of African American women around the

introduction of the Rosenwald schools in the early 20th century.       The authors nd that women whose

children gained greater educational access due to these schools reduced their total fertility but were also

more likely to have at least one child, while women whose own access to education was improved decreased

their fertility on both the intensive and extensive margin.


The current paper examines changes in race-specic fertility patterns around another key historical event,

passage and implementation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This act was the legislative culmination of the

decades long Civil Rights Movement, and precipitated a period of rapid progress among African Americans

across a wide variety of economic, social and political dimensions.


Two features of the Civil Rights Act make it a particularly informative context for studying race-specic

fertility determination. First, its provisions had direct and qualitatively large impacts on numerous fertility

determinants, for instance labor market opportunity and access to education and health services. Second,

its provisions were typically eective immediately after 1964 and were by far the most binding for southern




                                                      2
blacks, with much less consequential eects for northern blacks or whites in any region (Donohue & Heckman

1991; Wright 2013).       These features naturally suggest a transparent research design in which changes in

fertility among southern black women before and after 1964 are compared with fertility changes among

other race-by-region groups over the same period.


The rst section of the paper implements such a design to document a novel set of descriptive facts about the

relative fertility outcomes of southern black women in the Civil Rights Era. In particular, I show that there

was a qualitatively large and discontinuous decline in the general fertility rates of southern African American

women immediately after 1964, with no comparable decline among northern black women or white women

in any region. Completed fertility measures similarly show large-scale reductions in the average number of

children ever born among southern black women, which was driven by substitution out of very high levels

of completed fertility.    I then assess various mechanisms that may have contributed to this rapid fertility

convergence by performing decompositions and by analyzing geographic heterogeneity in the strength of

relative black fertility decline.




1     Post-1964 Fertility Convergence

I begin by simply reporting trends in the general fertility rate (GFR) from 1955-1975, disaggregated by

race and region.
                  1 Following convention, I calculate the GFR as the ratio of total live births to the number

of women between ages 14 and 44, measured in thousands.                  Live birth totals by state are drawn from

Vital Statistics print reports from 1955-1967 and from digitized Vital Statistics microdata from 1968-1975.

Population counts by gender, age and race are drawn from the Decennial Census with linear interpolations

for 1955-1968, and from the Survey of Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) for 1969-1975.


Figure 1A plots the level GFR trends from 1955 through 1975. The gure shows that among southern black

women fertility rates fall substantially after 1964, with the average number of births per thousand southern

black women of childbearing age declining from 151 in 1964 to 118 in 1969. The other race-by-region groups

also experienced declining fertility rates over this period, but the magnitudes of these reductions are smaller

and none display a discrete post-1964 trend break comparable to southern black women, implying that there

was a strong convergence in the fertility rates of southern blacks and the other groups after 1964.


The precipitous and discontinuous nature of this post-1964 convergence is seen more clearly in Figure 1B,

which plots black-white fertility    dierences    by region. The solid line in Figure 1B shows that in 1964 there

were 53 more live births per thousand women of childbearing age among southern blacks than there were

among southern whites, but by 1969 this gap had fallen to 33 births, a decline of approximately 40% over

a ve year period. The dashed line in Figure 1B plots black-white fertility rate dierences outside of the

South, and nds no relative decline in the fertility rates of African American women after 1964.


Figure 1 eectively used southern whites, northern blacks, and northern whites as control groups that

accounted for any fertility determinants that were general to all women from a given region or racial group.

A conceptually similar alternative is to pool all regions and races, then estimate regressions that include

   1 I dene the South as the eleven states of the Former Confederacy, with the remaining lower 48 states constituting the
North, and in Appendix A I demonstrate that the results are not sensitive to alternative regional denitions, and also report
results on a state-by-state basis. Maternal race is aggregated only into white and non-white, but blacks were the dominant
minority population in this context, and in Appendix A I show that the results are not sensitive to excluding counties where
African Americans constituted less than 99% of the non-white population.


                                                             3
three-way interactions between year dummies, a black dummy, and a South dummy.                       I report results of

such a triple-dierence specication in Appendix A, and the results similarly demonstrate large relative

fertility declines among southern black women immediately after 1964. Appendix A also demonstrates that

this result holds when the GFR is entered in logs, so that fertility changes can be interpreted in percentage

terms.


Figure 2 reproduces Figure 1B, but disaggregates by ve-year maternal age groupings using data from print

Vital Statistics books transcribed by the author. The gure shows that large-scale and unique reductions in

the black-white GFR gap occurred after 1964 among southern women in all age groups except 15-19.


Figures 1 and 2 reported fertility     rates, which are distinct from the total number of children born over the
full course of a woman's childbearing years, or completed fertility. Fortunately the Decennial Censuses of

1970, 1980 and 1990 asked all female respondents ages 14 and over the total number of children ever born

to them, and I use responses to this question among Census respondents ages 44-70 to measure completed

childbearing across cohorts of women whose fertile-aged years spanned 1964.
                                                                                       2


The use of completed fertility measures from the Census oers two additional advantages.                    First, Census

respondents report both state of birth and state of residence, rather than solely state of residence as in the

Vital Statistics data, which is a potentially important distinction given the large-scale and heavily selected

inter-regional migration that occurred among African Americans during the 20th century.                    Here I simply

exclude inter-regional migrants from the analysis, and in Appendix B I demonstrate that the ndings are

robust to dening southern status on the basis of either current region of residence or region of birth, and also

report fertility trends specically for migrants. Second, completed fertility measures contain information on

the full fertility distribution, which allows me to assess which parity margins drove overall fertility reductions.


Figure 3A displays trends in the black-white completed fertility dierential for the 1920-1946 birth cohorts,

disaggregated by region. For reference, dashed vertical lines indicate the 1929 and 1944 birth cohorts, which

is the range of cohorts that were ages 20-35 as of 1964 and whose prime childbearing years therefore spanned

1964. The solid line shows that as of the 1929 birth cohort, the completed fertility of southern black women

was approximately 1.5 live births greater on average than the completed fertility of southern white women,

but that by the 1944 birth cohort this dierence had fallen to approximately .8 live births, a reduction

of approximately 50% in the span of 15 birth cohorts.              No similar reduction is observed outside of the

South. Appendix B reports the results of triple-dierence regression specications that include three-way

interactions between cohort dummies, a black dummy, and a South dummy, which similarly demonstrate

large reductions in the completed fertility of southern black women relative to other race-by-region groups.


I note that the cohort trends shown in Figure 3A do not directly implicate events occurring in 1964, and

are instead plausibly consistent with a much broader set of factors aecting the cohorts of the 1930s and

early 1940s. However, the annual fertility rates shown in Figures 1 and 2 clearly indicate a strong                 period
eect centered specically around 1964, in which southern black women of virtually all ages (and thus

various cohorts) discretely reduced their fertility at this particular point in time.              Such a period eect

being observed specically for southern black women strongly implicates Civil Rights related explanations

for relative fertility declines, and would not have been evident using only cohort-based measures such as

Figure 3A. This highlights the importance of analyzing time, age and cohort level trends to fully understand

  2 Censuses prior to 1970 only asked this question of ever-married women and the question was dropped entirely after 1990,
which only allows completed fertility to be observed through the 1946 cohort. In Appendix B I use CPS June Fertility
Supplements to examine a wider range of cohorts, and nd similar patterns.

changing fertility behavior in this context.


Figure 3B extends the analysis beyond simple means by showing histograms of the race-specic completed

fertility distribution among southern women who were born between 1925 and 1930 (prior the convergence

shown in Figure 3A) versus those who were born between 1941-1946 (after the convergence shown in Figure

3A). For southern black women, the gure indicates a dramatic truncation of the right-tail of the completed

fertility distribution between these two sets of cohorts, with large numbers of women substituting out of

completed fertility levels in the range of 6-12 children ever born and into fertility levels in the range of 1-4

children ever born.      In contrast, changes in the completed fertility of southern white women were much

less drastic during this period, and consisted primarily of substituting from completed fertility levels of 3-4

children ever born and into completed fertility of 2-3 children ever born. Consistent with Aaronson et al.

(2014), the gure also shows relative           increases   in the portion of southern black women having at least one

child, which may reect the fact that one cannot invest in child quality without having at least one child.


The remainder of the paper explores the mechanisms potentially underlying the documented fertility trends.




2     Explaining Fertility Convergence


2.1     Theoretical Framework


To help structure the analysis of mechanisms, I adopt the theoretical framework of Galor (2012), who

considers a household that maximizes a utility function              U (c, q, w)       by choosing non-child consumption ( ), c
the quantity of children (q), and the well-being of each child (                  w ) or child quality.   Households are subject

to the budget constraint     q ( q +  w w) + c  I, where  q denotes the xed-costs of each child,  w denotes
                                                                                                       
the price of child   well-being, and I is normalized household income. At an interior optimum of (q , w ), the

shadow price of child quantity and child well-being are respectively given by:



                                                    Pq =  q +  w w            and



                                                           Pw =  w q  .


These equations show that the shadow price of child quantity is increasing in child well-being, while the

shadow price of child well-being is increasing in child quantity. Fertility transitions occur when these rela-

tionships induce self-reinforcing substitution of child well-being for child quantity.                    Other than arbitrarily

assuming changes in preferences, the key parameters that may change to engender a fertility transition are
                                    q
the xed costs of each child (           ) and the price of generating child well-being ( w ).         For present purposes, the

central question is how these parameters changed among southern blacks after 1964.

                                                                          q
The most important changes in the xed costs of children (                     )   likely took the form of increased opportunity

costs from forgone labor market earnings. In particular, to the extent that Civil Rights Act implementation

reduced labor market discrimination and increased the potential earnings of southern African Americans,

the relative xed costs of children would increase among southern blacks after 1964.
                                                                                                            3   A closely related

   3 Since children are typically assumed to be a normal good, increased income could also have a positive eect on child quantity.
The fact that fertility declined with potential earnings in the current context suggests that any income eect is dominated by
substitution into child well-being.


                                                                5
consideration is that many southern blacks left agricultural employment during the study period, often

transitioning to positions in recently desegregated textile mills and other urban employers (Wright 2013).

To the extent that child labor is more prevalent in rural agriculture than wage labor markets in metropolitan

areas, urbanization would also increase the net xed costs of children.

                                                               w
With respect to changes in the price of child well-being (         ),   events such as the desegregation of southern
                                                                 w
schools and medical facilities would have directly reduced           among southern blacks by decreasing barriers

to investing in children's human capital development and increasing the ecacy of such investments.                  A
                                    w
related channel through which           may have fallen among southern blacks is an increase in the anticipated

future returns to human capital, such that any investment in child human capital would be more readily

translated into desirable socioeconomic outcomes. If the parameter            w   is interpreted broadly as the price

of generating favorable child   outcomes,    rather than narrowly as the price of human capital         inputs,   then

anticipated future reductions in discrimination would also lower the price of child well-being and cause

relative fertility reductions among southern blacks.


There were also a large number of plausibly relevant federal policy shifts and changes in social norms during

the study period. For instance War on Poverty programs such as Medicaid, Head Start and the Food Stamp

Program directly reduced barriers to investing in children's health and education; The introduction of Enovid

for contraceptive purposes in 1960, the initiation of the federal Family Planning Program in 1964, and the

national legalization of abortion in 1973 would all have decreased the costs associated with preventing a

birth; And gender norms in both the family and the workplace were rapidly changing in this period, with

substantial overall decreases in marriage rates and increases in female labor force participation (Goldin 2006).

An ex-ante reason to be skeptical of these factors as explanations for the trends documented above is that

they typically applied to all racial groups and all regions, whereas the documented fertility decline is distinct

to southern African Americans. But to the extent that southern blacks were especially impacted by these

changes, they may have contributed to the documented convergence.




2.2    Decompositions in Census Microdata


Empirically, there are two necessary conditions for any proposed mechanism to have plausibly contributed

to the fertility patterns found above. First, the proposed mechanism must have changed dierentially among

southern blacks after 1964. Second, the proposed mechanism must be associated with fertility. For example

an increase in real or potential earnings is one potential mechanism suggested by the theoretical framework.

In order for earnings to indeed be a valid mechanism, it is necessary both that the relative earnings of

southern blacks actually improved after 1964, and also that there is a negative relationship between earnings

and fertility.   This reasoning suggests that one potentially insightful approach to empirically assessing a

proposed mechanism is to estimate (1) the extent to which the proposed mechanism changed dierentially

among southern blacks after 1964 and (2) the strength of the proposed mechanism's association with fertility.


While intuitive and transparent, such an approach requires data with information on both fertility outcomes

and relevant individual and household characteristics. The Vital Statistics data used above had the advan-

tages of being measured annually and containing the near-universe of live births, but was aggregated to the

state or county level and did not contain detailed information on the characteristics of mothers or families.

Fortunately, the studied fertility decline occurred between the Decennial Censuses of 1960 and 1970, which

makes it possible to observe large cross-sections of women shorty before and shortly after 1964 in a data set



                                                         6
that also contains demographic and socioeconomic measures.


An important limitation of Census data is that respondents were not directly asked their recent fertility

histories.   To overcome this limitation, I measure fertility rates by restricting the 1960 and 1970 Census

samples to females ages 14-44 and observing whether household rosters indicate that these women were living

with an own-child under the age of one. If such a child is present, I assume that the woman experienced a

live birth in the past year.


This approach to measuring fertility within household surveys is commonly used by demographers (see

Palmore & Gardner 1983), but will underestimate the true fertility rate in cases where children die before

their rst birthday or do not live with their biological mothers, and will overestimate the true fertility rate in

cases where step-children, adopted children or other relationship types are misidentied as own-children. In

Appendix C I compare this fertility rate measure to the corresponding measures in the Vital Statistics data,

both with and without infant mortality adjustments. I nd that the fertility rates implied by the household

structure of Census respondents are overall moderately lower than those from Vital Statistics records, but

that Census-based estimates of GFR          changes   from 1960-1970 are very similar to those in Vital Statistics

data, suggesting that this approach to measuring fertility is reasonably reliable for present purposes.


Using this data, I formalize the intuition discussed above regarding the necessary conditions for particular

characteristics to be contributing mechanisms by implementing a variant of the decomposition method

proposed by Gelbach (2016).         As described in more detail momentarily, this decomposition is based on

the common technique of adding control variables to a baseline regression specication and observing the

extent to which the coecient on a variable of interest is attenuated. While this decomposition approach is

systematic, I note at the outset that it is primarily descriptive in nature. It eectively calculates the change

in fertility that would have been expected given the changes in a set of observable characteristics and the

associations between those characteristics and fertility. But standard concerns related to omitted variables,

reverse causality, and other sources of bias prevent the associations between observable characteristics and

fertility from being interpreted causally.       Despite this limitation, a systematic accounting of how fertility

correlates changed for southern blacks and whites over the study period remains valuable for assessing

potential mechanisms.


The rst step of the decomposition estimates the changes in potentially relevant characteristics occurring

between 1960 and 1970. The analyzed characteristics were chosen to proxy for the theoretical mechanisms

discussed above, and include individual and family level earnings, urban and rural residence, labor force

participation, educational attainment, and marital status, as well as age at the time of the survey.                     To

estimate the group-specic changes in these characteristics occurring between 1960 and 1970, I simply regress

each characteristic onto a 1970 indicator separately for southern black women and southern white women.

The results are reported in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1, with each row reporting changes in a separate

characteristics.
                 4


With respect to earnings, the results in Table 1 indicate that between 1960 and 1970 the individual and

family level earnings of southern black women increased by $7,626 and $21,700, respectively (in constant

year 2000 dollars).    Among southern white women, the analogous changes were only $4,389 and $14,895,

indicating substantial relative economic progress among southern black women in this period. These relative

  4 Here I focus on changes in the fertility rates of southern black women relative to southern white women, and also exclude
women born in one region but residing in the other. In Appendix C I report results that incorporate women in the North as
additional control observations, as well as results that include inter-regional migrants.


                                                             7
gains make income a highly plausible contributing mechanism for the documented fertility convergence.


Table 1 also nds that the fraction of southern black women residing in rural (non-metropolitan) areas fell

by 9.4 percentage points between 1960 and 1970, but that southern white women also experienced an 8.4

percentage point decline in rural residence. This relatively small dierence in rural residence declines will

likely limit the magnitude of urbanization's role in fertility convergence.
                                                                                 5 Likewise, Table 1 nds that the

labor force participation rate of southern black women increased by 4.2 percentage points between 1960

and 1970, but increased by an even greater 7.9 percentage points among southern white women over the

same time period. This likely reects the relatively high baseline labor force participation rate of African

American women (see Boustan & Collins 2014), and makes labor force participation an unlikely explanation

for fertility convergence.


Turning to educational attainment, Table 1 shows that high school graduation rates increased substantially

more among southern black women than southern white women in this period, but that increases in college

attendance and completion were stronger for southern white women, making the potential fertility impacts

of changes in educational attainment ambiguous.


Finally, marriage rates fell for both racial groups in this period, but these marriage declines were stronger

for southern black women (8.4 percentage points) than for southern white women (5.2 percentage points).

Southern black women were also more likely to remain never-married, whereas southern white women expe-

rienced increases in being divorced, separated or widowed (the omitted category). As discussed below, the

stronger reduction in marriage rates among southern blacks may have been a cause of fertility decline, but

was equally plausibly an eect of fertility decline, complicating the assessment of marriage as a potential

mechanism.


The next step of the decomposition estimates changes in the fertility rates of southern black women and

southern white women between 1960 and 1970, rst unconditionally and then conditional on the set of

studied covariates:




                                       I (Child < 1)i × 1000 = Y 1970i + i                                          (1)




                                   I (Child < 1)i × 1000 = Y 1970i + Xi  + i .                                      (2)



In these models   I (Child < 1)i   is an indicator of whether woman      i   was living with an own-child under the

age of one (multiplied by 1,000 to match standard GFR units),          Y 1970i is an indicator of whether     woman    i
was observed in the 1970 Census rather than the 1960 Census, and           Xi is the vector of covariates.

Focusing rst on the unconditional models, reported in Columns 3 and 5 of Table 1, the GFR of southern

black women is estimated to have fallen by 38.3 births per thousand women of childbearing age between

1960 and 1970, while the GFR of southern white women is estimated to have fallen by 25.2 over the same

period.   These coecients imply that the dierence in the GFRs of southern blacks and southern whites

converged by   38.3 - 25.2 = 13.1   births between 1960 and 1970, an estimate that is generally consistent with

the 17.8 birth convergence shown in Figure 1, which was derived using a wholly separate data source and

methodology.

  5 The omitted residence category is suburban, so that the reported coecients imply that southern black women primarily
moved from rural to urban areas, while southern white women primarily moved from rural to suburban areas.


                                                           8
Turning to the conditional models, reported in Columns 4 and 6 of Table 1, adding the full set of controls

causes the estimated fertility reduction occurring between 1960 and 1970 among southern black women to

fall from 38.3 to 20.7, while the estimated fertility reduction occurring among southern white women over

the same period falls from 25.2 to 21.5.        The change in the black-white fertility gap between 1960 and

1970 conditional on the included covariates is therefore       20.7 - 21.5 = -0.8     births per thousand women of

childbearing age, which indicates that the entirety of the black-white fertility convergence occurring between

1960 and 1970 can be descriptively explained by the included set of controls.


With respect to the coecients on the covariates themselves, income and urban residence have the expected

negative correlations with fertility, especially within the southern black sample.
                                                                                            6   Similarly, being in the

labor force, being single, and being older all have strong negative associations with fertility. Finally, women

with greater educational attainment actually have higher fertility rates in this context, conditional on the

other covariates.


While the results in Columns 3-6 of Table 1 indicate that convergence can be fully attributed to the utilized

set of controls as a whole, they do not readily indicate         which   of the included covariates account for the

observed reduction. One common practice is to sequentially add covariates and observe the corresponding

reduction in the independent variable of interest, but such reductions will often depend on the arbitrary

order in which covariates are added. As an alternative, Gelbach (2016) shows that the contribution of each

individual covariate will be equal to the product of the change in that covariate occurring between 1960

and 1970 (as reported in Columns 1 and 2) and the covariate's coecient in the model with the full control

vector (as reported in Columns 4 and 6). Gelbach (2016) also shows that the estimated contribution of each

covariate under this method will sum to the total reduction from adding the full set of controls as an identity,

that it is valid to sum these products over groups of covariates, and that because the            conditional   eect of

each covariate is used, the results do not depend on the arbitrary choice of which covariates are added rst.


The results of a decomposition using this approach are reported in Column 7 of Table 1.
                                                                                                 7 The results indicate

that relative changes in earned income were an important contributor to the documented black-white fertility

convergence. Specically Column 7 nds that individual and family level earnings jointly explain a 4.9 birth

reduction in the black-white fertility gap among southern women, or 35% of the total observed reduction

of 13.1 births. Changes in rural versus urban residence account for an additional 1.1 birth decline in the

black-white fertility gap, or approximately 8% of the total unconditional convergence. These contributions

are jointly due to the strong association of fertility with income and rural residence, even conditional on

the other covariates, and to the presence of relative changes in these characteristics among southern black

women between 1960 and 1970.


In contrast, the decomposition nds that relative changes in female labor force participation rates would

have been expected to actually      increase   the black-white GFR gap by 3.1 births between 1960 and 1970,

which is due to the relatively large increases in labor force participation rates among southern white women

and the strongly negative conditional association between labor force participation and fertility. Educational

attainment and age explain small and statistically insignicant portions of fertility convergence, primarily

   6 Note that because separate models are estimated for southern black women and southern white women, the coecients on
the covariates are not restricted to be equal across racial groups.
   7 The mechanical calculation of the results reported in Column 7 is as follows: Each covariate's coecient in the fully
specied models (Columns 4 and 6) is multiplied by its level change between 1960 and 1970 (Columns 1 and 2), and the value
of this product among southern white women is subtracted from the analogous product among southern black women. The
contributions of related covariates are then summed. Standard errors are calculated using the formulas derived by Gelbach
(2016), and clustered at the state level.


                                                           9
because black-white dierences in these characteristics did not change in a uniform fashion between 1960

and 1970.


Changes in marital status have by far the most explanatory power among the included covariates, accounting

for an 11.4 birth reduction in the black-white GFR gap between 1960 and 1970. As noted, the decomposition

exercise is descriptive in nature, and cannot identify whether the strong association between marriage and

fertility is due to reductions in marriage causing lower fertility, lower fertility causing reductions in marriage,

or some combination of the two.       Additionally, there is no evidence that marriage rates discontinuously

fell among southern blacks in 1964, and the declines observed in Table 1 are instead part of longer-term

secular reductions in marriage.     Given these considerations, it is arguably preferable to exclude marital

status from the decomposition, and such results are reported in Appendix C. With marriage excluded, the

overall explanatory power of the covariate vector unsurprisingly falls substantially, but the estimated impacts

of the other covariates are very similar to those reported in Table 1. In particular, changes in income and

urban residence continue to exert signicant negative inuences on black-white fertility gaps, while changes

in labor force participation typically work in the opposite direction.


Appendix C also reports various robustness checks and extensions of the decomposition from Table 1, for

instance using various alternative covariate vectors, not excluding inter-regional migrants, and including

women in the North as additional controls. These analyses nd that while the overall explanatory power

of the covariates and the values of some parameters often do vary substantially across specications, the

estimated contributions of income and urbanization are highly robust and similar to those shown in Table 1.


In summary, decompositions suggest that basic socioeconomic characteristics, most importantly earnings,

robustly explain a substantial portion of the observed black-white fertility convergence. This is due to the

simple observation that earnings have a strong theoretical and empirical relationship with fertility and that

the earnings growth of southern blacks between 1960 and 1970 was unusually large. However, changes in

observable socioeconomic characteristics do not provide a comprehensive explanation for southern black

fertility decline, necessitating the examination of additional potential mechanisms.




2.3    Geographic Heterogeneity


A limitation of the utilized decomposition approach was that many of the potential mechanisms suggested

by the theoretical framework are not readily observable. For instance Census respondents do not report the

segregation status of their local schools and hospitals or their participation in federal programs, and factors

like the extent to which the Civil Rights Act led to an updating of the anticipated level of discrimination that

black parents believed their children would face are even more nebulously dened and dicult to quantify.

In the absence of direct measures, it may be insightful to analyze heterogeneity in the strength of fertility

convergence across smaller geographic areas, with counties being the smallest areas with race-specic fertility

data available.


Interpreting any spacial variation in fertility patterns faces several limitations.     In addition to standard

omitted variable and selection bias concerns, non-random migration is a much more acute issue at the county

level than at the regional level. This is both because cross-county migration is simply more common than

cross-region migration, and because many of the mechanisms that may have caused relative fertility declines,

for instance urbanization, virtually necessitate migration.     This makes it dicult to distinguish between




                                                        10
changes in fertility behavior within a county's existing population versus changes in the composition of its

population.


These issues notwithstanding, it is still potentially insightful to systematically examine geographic patterns

in the intensity of post-1964 fertility convergence, and Figure 4 maps the changes in the black-white fertility

gap occurring between 1964 and 1969 across the 712 southern counties with available data.
                                                                                                             8   Figure 4

shows substantial spacial heterogeneity in the magnitude of post-CRA racial fertility convergence, with the

strongest convergence occurring in counties along the Mississippi River Delta, selected counties in central

Alabama and Georgia, and counties in the tobacco-growing regions of Virginia and North Carolina.


A natural question is how the characteristics of counties with stronger post-1964 convergence diered from

those with more modest convergence magnitudes. In Appendix D I assemble a detailed county-level data

set with measures of school and hospital desegregation and the presence of Head Start, Medicaid, the

Food Stamp Program and the Family Planning Program. I also assemble data on the antebellum density

of enslaved African Americans and the prevalence of lynchings from 1882-1930, which existing literatures

have shown to be strong proxies for the intensity of discriminatory institutions, racial violence, and racially

conservative political attitudes (Bertocchi & Dimico 2013; Acharya et al. 2016; Cook et al. 2018). As such,

I expect the changes engendered by the Civil Rights Act to be more binding and impactful in areas with

higher historic levels of enslavement and lynching.


The analyses in Appendix D nd substantive positive associations between the local magnitude of relative

black fertility declines and the intensity of local school desegregation, hospital access, and War on Poverty

programs.     However, a county's historical intensity of slavery and lynching activity are the strongest and

most robust spacial correlates of post-CRA fertility convergence by a substantial margin. I interpret this

nding as suggestive evidence that the social and psychological ramications of dismantling of the most overt

forms of state-sponsored racism signicantly contributed to the documented decline in black-white fertility

dierences in the Civil Rights period.




3     Conclusion

Large black-white fertility dierences are a key feature of US demography, and are closely related to broader

dynamics of racial inequality. This paper showed that the racial fertility gap in the South fell precipitously

and discontinuously after 1964, suggesting that the fertility behavior of African American women was highly

responsive to changes in discriminatory institutions in this historical context.

  8 A majority of counties with missing data in Figure 4 are due to race-specic natality data being unavailable in counties
where non-whites constituted less than 10% of the population. Additionally, because the natality data classies race only as
white or non-white, the gure excludes 37 counties where more than 1% of the population in the 1970 census consisted of
non-black minorities, which ensures that non-whites consist almost exclusively of African Americans.

Notes: Sample includes black and non-Hispanic white females ages 14-44 from the 1960 and 1970 Decennial Censuses who were both born and were currently
residing in either Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas or Virginia. Each entry in Columns
1 and 2 comes from a separate bivariate regression with the variable indicated in the row as the dependent variable and a 1970 indicator as the independent variable.
The coefficients therefore estimate the change in the listed characteristics occurring between 1960 and 1970 within the indicated population. The dependent variable
in Columns 3-6 is an indicator of having an own-child under age one currently in the household, multiplied by 1,000. The coefficients therefore estimate the effect of
each independent variable on the general fertility rate within the indicated population. The decomposition entries reported in Column 7 are calculated by multiplying
the change in each covariate (Columns 1 and 2) by its conditional association with the GFR (Columns 4 and 6), subtracting this product among southern whites from
the analogous product among southern blacks, and summing these differences over the sets of covariates measuring earnings, residence-type, labor force
participation, education, marital status, and age. The omitted residence-type category is suburban, the omitted education category is less than high school, and the
omitted marital status category is divorced/separated/widowed. All standard errors are calculated using the formulas derived by Gelbach (2016) with clustering by
state of residence and are reported in parentheses.

Online Appendix A: Robustness and Extensions, General Fertility Rate Trends


Alternative Regional Denitions
The baseline results in Figure 1 dened the South as the 11 states of the former confederacy (Alabama,

Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and

Virginia) and the North as the balance of the lower 48 states.                 However, reasonable alternative regional

denitions exist and could yield dierent results. This possibility is explored in Figure A1.


Panel A of Figure A1 reproduces the baseline results from Figure 1B for reference. Panel B of Figure A1

reports results where ve border states (Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma and West Virginia) are

included in the South rather than the North. Panel C excludes these ve border states entirely. Panel D

follows Chay et al. (2009) and uses seven Rust-Belt states (Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New York, Ohio, and

Pennsylvania) as the northern control group, rather than all non-southern states, which may be preferable

since the Rust Belt is geographically proximate to the South and has a large African American population.

In all cases, the relative trends in black-white GFR gaps are virtually identical to the baseline trends.


Figure A2 assesses heterogeneity        within   the 11 states of the former confederacy by plotting black-white GFR

gap trends on a state-by-state basis. While these state-level trends are unsurprisingly somewhat noisier than

the trends at the regional level, all 11 states experience a clear post-1964 reduction in black-white GFR

dierences. Note that Figure 4 of the main paper provides even ner geographic disaggregation by mapping

changes in the black-white GFR gap occurring between 1964 and 1969 across the 712 southern                       counties   with

available data.

Exclusion of Counties with Substantial Non-Black Minority Populations
Another robustness related issue is that Vital Statistics from the study period only disaggregate maternal

race into white and non-white, such that non-black racial minorities are combined with African Americans.

While blacks were in most cases the largest minority population in the studied context, there may be some

concern that this rough aggregation of racial and ethnic identication aects the ndings, particularly since

Texas, Florida and many western states with substantial Hispanic populations are included in the analysis.

Several southern states also have signicant Native American populations that could plausibly impact the

ndings.      To address this issue, Figure A3 reports the results of re-estimating Figure 1B while excluding

counties where African Americans constituted less than 99% of the county's non-white population, such that

the vast majority of non-whites in the utilized sample are African American.
                                                                                               1 The level GFR dierence

outside of the South is modestly higher after this restriction, but all relevant trends are virtually unchanged

Triple-Dierence Specications
The baseline ndings in Figure 1 showed large declines in the black-white fertility gap within the South, and

also showed that no such change in the fertility gap occurred in the North. The choice to report the ndings

as trends in the black-white gap disaggregated by region was made primarily for graphical and expositional

clarity, and it is conceptually equivalent to consider southern blacks to be the treatment group while using

the other three race-by-region groups as control groups that jointly dene counterfactual fertility trends for

southern blacks in a triple-dierence framework.


In particular I have estimate regressions of the following form:

  1 The   reason this exclusion was not made in the baseline results is that race-specic natality data was suppressed in counties
where non-whites constituted less than 10% of the population, so that state-level aggregations provide a more comprehensive
measure.




                                                                2
F ertilityrjy = 1 Black + 2 South + 55 Y 1955 + 56 Y 1956 + ... + 75 Y 1975+
3 (Black × South) + 55 (Black × Y 1956) + 56 (Black × Y 1956) + ... + 75 (Black × Y 1975) + 55 (South × Y 1956) +
56 (South × Y 1956) + ...75 (South × Y 1975)+
55 (Black × South × Y 1956) + 56 (Black × South × Y 1956) + ... + 75 (Black × South × Y 1975) + rjy

In this specication     F ertilityrjy        is the GFR for racial group        r   (either black or white) region     j   (either

southern or     northern) and year y         (ranging from 1955-1975 and omitting 1964). The independent variables

are dummies indicating being black (Black), southern residence (South) and year of observation (Y1955,

Y1956,...,Y1975); all possible two way interactions of Black, South and the year dummies; and the three-way

interactions of Black, South and the year dummies. The coecients of interest are the triple-interactions of

Black, South and year (y ) which estimate the fertility rate of southern blacks relative to the other groups

in each year from 1955 to 1975 (with 1964 as the reference year), after exibly controlling for independent

eects of race, region and year.


The full set of results from estimating this specication are reported in the rst column of Table A1, and the

coecients on the three-way interaction terms are plotted in Panel A of Figure A4.
                                                                                                      2 As expected given the

trends shown in Figure 1 of the main paper, Table A1 and Figure A4 nd a clear trend break in 1964, with

the GFR of southern black women declining by approximately 20 births per thousand women of childbearing

age between 1964 and 1970, relative to women in other race-by-region groups.


The triple-dierence framework is also amenable to analyzing percent changes in fertility, rather than level

changes, by simply replacing the level GFR with the natural log of the GFR as the dependent variable in the

regression specication. Results of estimating such a model are reported in Column 2 of Table A1 and Panel

B of Figure A4. The results indicate that the relative fertility decline of southern blacks between 1964 and

1970 was approximately 15%, and the other qualitative conclusions hold in the logged specication. This

suggests that relative black fertility reductions did not solely reect the fertility of southern black women

having further to fall than other groups.




Online Appendix B: Robustness and Extensions, Completed Fertility Trends


Inter-Regional Migration
The baseline completed fertility results from Figure 2A of the main paper excluded all individuals who were

born in one region but resided in the other when they were surveyed at ages 44-70. While this restriction is a

reasonable baseline, the issue of inter-regional migration warrants additional attention given the large-scale

and heavily selected northern migration occurring among African Americans in the studied cohorts.


Two natural alternatives are to retain inter-regional migrants but dene southern status on the basis of either

birth region or current region of residence. Replications of Figure 2A using these alternative denitions are

respectively shown in Panels A and B of Figure A5. The most important feature of Figure A5 is that under

either regional classication approach there is a clear reduction in the black-white completed fertility gap in

the South but not the North.
   2 Note   that because the regression specication is estimated with data at the race-region-year level, which is the same level
as the interactions of interest, the   R2   of this regression is equal to 1 and the coecient's standard errors are not estimable.
If the specication is instead estimated with data at the state or county level the coecients on the triple-interaction terms
are statistically signicant at conventional levels, but these geographic disaggregation are arbitrary and the resulting standard
errors are therefore dicult to interpret, leading me to prefer the results reported in Table A1 and Figure A4.




                                                                   3
Another notable feature of Figure A5 is that relative convergence is noticeably stronger when region is dened

on the basis of residence (Panel B) than on the basis of birth (Panel A). In practice the primary dierence

between the samples used in Panels A and B is that the sample in Panel B excludes black women who were

born in the South but lived in the North when they were surveyed at ages 44-70. This is because 29% of

black women in the sample were born in the South but lived in the North when surveyed, and are therefore

included in the sample from Panel A but not the sample from Panel B, whereas only 2% of black women

in the overall sample were born in the North but lived in the South when surveyed, and only 3% of white

women in the overall sample were born in the South but lived in the North when surveyed. The dierences

in the patterns observed in Panels A and B therefore imply that decreases in fertility were relatively weak

among northern-migrating black women.


This is examined more directly in Figure A6, which reports trends in completed fertility separately for

southern-born black women who had left for the North by the time they were surveyed (leavers) versus

southern-born black women who had remained in the South at the time of survey (stayers). Figure A6

shows that completed fertility among stayers was higher than among leavers across all the studied cohorts,

and that the completed fertility declines occurring among the post-1930 cohorts were especially strong among

stayers, such that the dierence between these two groups falls from .65 within the 1930 cohort to .35 in the

1946 cohort.


While interesting, the causes and implications of these dierences are dicult to interpret without additional

information. On the one hand, the dierences in completed fertility between stayers and leavers may simply

reect the greater diculty of migrating with children, higher levels of socioeconomic status among migrants,

or other forms of selection. An alternative (but not mutually exclusive) explanation for the dierences shown

in Figure A6 is that exposure to post-1964 changes in environmental conditions aected fertility behavior

more than exposure to any events occurring in childhood, leading to greater fertility impacts among stayers

because they were more likely to have directly experienced the post-1964 social and economic changes

occurring in the South. I do note however, that region of residence in 1964 is not directly observed, since

the year of migration among individuals not residing in their region of birth is not reported.


It is also dicult to draw strong conclusions from Figures A5 and A6 about the contribution of inter-regional

migration to the observed declines in general fertility rates after 1964. While the fact that southern black

women with lower fertility propensities were more likely to migrate would lower the overall GFR among

African American women residing in the South, the eect of migration on year-specic GFR trends will

depend on the magnitude of migration and the degree of fertility-relevant selection among those migrants

in the years surrounding 1964, which are not observed.     Ultimately, the fact that strong relative fertility

reductions are observed using both residence-based and birth-based regional denitions strongly suggests

that the observed GFR trends are not purely an artifact of selective inter-regional migration, but the precise

impacts of migration are not readily identiable.

CPS Replications
As noted, the Census Bureau discontinued the completed fertility question after the 1990 Census, and in

conjunction with the standard over-44 age restriction for completed fertility calculations, this data limita-

tion does not allow completed fertility to be calculated beyond the 1946 cohort in Census data. However,

completed fertility can be calculated for a broader range of cohorts using the June Fertility Supplements

from the Current Population Survey, which was elded 26 times between 1976 and 2018.




                                                      4
While the CPS allows for completed fertility to be observed across a wider range of cohorts, it produces much

smaller working samples than the Census. Not only are the base sample sizes smaller, but in many years only

women ages 18-44 or ages 14-49 were asked their total number of live births, greatly limiting the number

of usable observations. As a result of these limitations, it is only possible to observe completed fertility for

405,785 CPS respondents over the relevant cohorts, compared to 2,659,622 in the Census analysis from the

main paper. A nal issue is that the CPS June Fertility Supplements used highly inconsistent top-coding of

total births, ranging from 5 to 20, which makes the calculation of the mean births particularly erratic.


These data issues notwithstanding, it is useful to extend the series in Figure 3 of the main paper beyond

the 1946 cohort, as well as to test whether the main completed fertility ndings are replicable in a second,

independently drawn sample. As such, Figure A7 replicates Figure 3 of the main paper using CPS data, and

does so for the 1920-1960 cohorts in Panel A (rather than 1920-1946), while using the 1945-1950 cohorts as

the post cohorts for the distributional analyses in Panel B (rather than 1941-1946).


As expected, the completed fertility series shown in Panel A is much more erratic than its Census-based

counterpart in Figure 3 of the main paper, but the trends are qualitatively similar, with the black-white gap

in completed fertility among southern women falling from approximately 1.5 live births in the 1930 cohort

to approximately .5 by the early 1940s, with no signicant changes in the North. Panel A of Figure A7 addi-

tionally shows that there was little additional change in relative mean completed fertility through the cohorts

of the mid-1950s, with some further declines in black-white gaps in the South after 1955, although these

declines are dicult to interpret given the large cross-cohort uctuations in completed fertility throughout

the series. Panel B nds changes in the completed fertility distributions of black and white women in the

South that are very similar to those in Figure 3, with a dramatic truncation of the right-tail of the completed

fertility distribution but decreases in childlessness for southern black women, and modest substitution from

completed fertility levels of 3-4 children ever born into 2-3 children ever born for southern white women.


Overall, the results in Figure A7 indicate that the main paper's completed fertility results were not an

artifact of any sampling or data construction issues unique to the Decennial Censuses, and that no large-sale

and systematic additional fertility changes appear to have taken place after the 1946 cohort.

Triple-Dierence Specications
As was the case for the general fertility rate results, the completed fertility analysis can be implemented as a

triple-dierence specication that estimates completed fertility changes across cohorts among southern blacks

while dierencing out a common region eect, a common race eect, and common cohort eects, eectively

using the other three race-by-region groups as controls that jointly dene a counterfactual completed fertility

trend for southern blacks.


To implement such analyses in a regression framework I estimate a specication very similar to the one from

Online Appendix A, but replace the GFR with completed fertility as the dependent variable and replace

year dummies with birth cohort dummies:

CompF ertilityirjc = 1 Black + 2 South + 20 C 1920 + 21 C 1921 + ... + 46 C 1946+
3 (Black × South) + 20 (Black × C 1920) + 21 (Black × C 1921) + ... + 46 (Black × C 1946 + 20 (South × C 1920) +
21 (South × C 1921) + ...46 (South × C 1946)+
20 (Black × South × C 1920) + 21 (Black × South × C 1921) + ... + 46 (Black × South × C 1946) + irjc .

In this specication    CompF ertilityirjc   is the completed fertility of woman   i of racial group r   (either black or

white) region   j   (either southern or northern) and cohort   c   (ranging from 1920 to 1946 and omitting 1935).



                                                          5
The independent variables are dummies indicating being black (Black), southern residence (South) and birth

cohort (C1920, C1921,...,C1946); all possible two way interactions of Black, South and the cohort dummies;

and the three-way interaction of Black, South and the cohort dummies. The coecients of interest are the

triple-interactions of Black, South and cohort (c ) which estimate the completed fertility of southern black

women relative to the other groups in each cohort from 1920 to 1946 (with 1935 as the reference year), after

exibly controlling for independent eects of race, region and cohort.

The full set of results from estimating this specication are reported in Table A2, and the coecients on

the three-way interaction terms are plotted in Figure A8. Because completed fertility trends are estimated

using individual level data, standard errors are estimable, and Table A2 reports standard errors clustered at

the state level, while Figure A8 displays the 90% condence intervals for the triple-interactions. As expected

given the trends shown in Figure 3 of the main paper, Table A2 and Figure A8 nd large relative reductions

in the completed fertility of southern black women from cohorts after 1935 relative to cohort trends among

women in other race-by-region groups, with statistically signicant relative reductions of approximately .7

live births between the 1935 cohort and the cohorts of the mid-1940s.




Online Appendix C: Robustness and Extensions, Census Decompositions


The Accuracy of GFR Measures in the Census
As noted in the main paper, I estimate fertility rates in the Decennial Censuses by restricting the 1960

and 1970 Census samples to females ages 14-44 and observing whether household rosters indicate that these

women were living with an own-child under the age of one, then assume that if such a child is present the

woman experienced a live birth in the past year. More specically, I begin with the 1960 and 1970 Census

Form 1 and Form 2 samples from IPUMS, then restrict these samples to women who were ages 14-44 at the

time of the survey and who were both born in the South and were currently residing in the South. Own

children under age one are then identied from the relationship types listed in the household rosters.

While the relationship types available in these samples for both 1960 and 1970 can distinguish parents

from grandparents, siblings, or other extended family members, the utilized data does not allow adoptive-

children and step-children to be consistently distinguished from own-children. When a woman's step-child

or adoptive-child are misidentied as their own biological child, the utilized fertility measure will be biased

upward, although I note that at an aggregate level there will often be an osetting under-count for the

step/adoptive child's non-resident biological mother.
                                                               3 On the other hand, the utilized fertility measure will

be biased downward when a child dies before their rst birthday and is not enumerated by the Census during

the period they were alive.

Palmore & Gardner (1983) note that in practice the latter source of bias is typically stronger than the former,

so that roster-based fertility measures from household surveys usually nd lower fertility levels than Vital

Statistics based measures, but the sign and magnitude of any bias will of course depend on the particular

data and context. To assess the accuracy of the survey based fertility measures used here, Table A3 compares

the GFR levels from the Census versus Vital Statistics data sets that were used in the main paper. The

table reports GFR levels from these two data sources for each race-by-region group and for 1960 and 1970,

as well as the fertility    change   occurring within each race-by-region group between 1960 and 1970.

   3 To   help mitigate this source of bias, I drop observations where the woman with an own-child under age one reported never
having had a live birth, as well as women residing in group quarters or multifamily households, where it is more dicult to
ascertain precise relationship types.




                                                                6
The rst row of Table A3 reports GFR estimates in the two data sets for southern black women. In the

Vital Statistics records, the GFR of women in this population fell from 160 in 1960 to 118 in 1970, a decline

of 41. Table A3 shows that Census-based GFR estimates for this population are substantially lower overall,

with a GFR estimate of 126 in 1960 and 86 in 1970. However, the estimated 40 birth GFR decline between

1960 and 1970 is virtually identical to the Vital Statistics estimate of 41. This is reassuring, given that the

analysis in the main paper is primarily concerned with group specic fertility changes over time.

Vital Statistics GFR estimates are similarly higher than Census based estimates for the other three groups as

well, although these level dierences are typically smaller than what was observed for southern blacks. Most

importantly, the changes between 1960 and 1970 are again very similar across Vital Statistics and Census

records. Specically, the GFR of southern white women was estimated to fall by 24 in Vital Statistics records

versus 27 in Census records; the GFR of northern black women was estimated to fall by 34 in Vital Statistics

records versus 31 in Census records; and the GFR of northern white women was estimated to fall by 29 in

Vital Statistics records versus 31 in Census records. Overall the ndings in Table A3 are consistent with

Census records having a moderate negative bias relative to Vital Statistics records, but with the magnitude

of that bias being relatively constant over time for all groups, allowing for credible analyses of relative trends.

The most obvious potential explanation for the level dierences in GFR estimates is that some children

under age one die before being enumerated by the Census, and to investigate this issue Table A4 adjusts

the Census estimates from Table A3 for infant mortality rates. Specically, Columns 1-3 of Table A4 report

infant mortality rates by race, region and year, while Columns 4-6 of Table A4 use these rates to adjust

the Census GFR estimates. For example among southern black children born in 1960 there were 47 infant

deaths per thousand live births, or 4.7% (Column 1). This suggests that while Census records show that 126

out of every 1,000 southern black women of childbearing age had an own-child living with them in 1960, an

additional   126 × .047  6   women may have given birth to a child who died prior to enumeration. Column 4

of Table A4 simply adds 6 to the baseline GFR estimate of 126. This process is then repeated for each race,

region and year.

Table A4 nds that while some of the dierences in estimated GFR levels between Vital Statistics and Census

records can be attributed to infant mortality, the changes are typically quite modest, and the estimated

changes between 1960 and 1970 are very similar after adjusting for infant mortality.            This is primarily

because while infant mortality in the study period was extremely high by normative and modern standards,

infant deaths were still a relatively rare event, such that the impact of infant mortality of aggregate fertility

estimates is modest.

Other potential reasons for the level dierences in Table A3 are that some young children live with individuals

other than their biological mothers (for instance their fathers or grandparents) and imperfect sampling

techniques in the 1960 and 1970 Censuses. In any case, for present purposes it is sucient that any such

biases are relatively consistent over time within race-by-region groups, and Table A3 suggests that this is

the case.

Alternative Decomposition Specications
Table A5 reports the results of several robustness and specication checks for the decomposition results in

Table 1 of the main paper. Column 1 of Table A5 reproduces the baseline decomposition results from Column

7 of Table 1 in the main paper for reference. For brevity the remaining columns report nal decomposition

results under alternative specications, rather than all constituent elements of the decompositions. Interested

readers can reproduce each component of the alternative decompositions using the provided data and code.



                                                        7
The baseline decomposition restricted the sample to individuals who were residing in the region of their

birth to minimize the impacts of selective migration. Column 2 of Table A5 includes these individuals, and

classies their region based on current residence, which matches the regional classication used in Vital

Statistics data. The results are very similar to the baseline ndings that excluded inter-regional migrants.


As noted in the main paper, changes in marital status had by far the most explanatory power of the

included covariates in the baseline results. This was because reductions in marriage rates between 1960 and

1970 were moderately stronger for southern black women than southern white women (a reduction of 8.4

vs. 5.2 percentage points) and because there is unsurprisingly a very strong association between marriage

and fertility. However, this strong association may be due to reductions in fertility causing lower marriage

rates rather than lower marriage reducing fertility, making it arguably preferable to exclude marital status

from the decomposition, and decomposition results that are identical to the baseline model but exclude the

marriage covariates are reported in Column 3 of Table A5.


The exclusion of the marriage covariates greatly reduces the overall explanatory power of the covariate

vector.   Specically, while adding covariates reduced the estimated GFR convergence by 13.9 births with

marital status indicator included, the analogous reduction is only 3.4 births when marital status indicators

are excluded from the covariate vector. Despite this large reduction in total explanatory power, the estimated

contributions of earnings, urbanization and labor force participation are generally similar to those in the

baseline decomposition. In particular, the estimated reduction in the black-white GFR gap among southern

women that is attributable to changes in earnings goes from 4.9 births with marriage included to 3.1 births

with marriage excluded; the estimated reduction due to urban versus rural residence goes from 1.1 with

marriage included to .81 with marriage excluded; and the estimated contribution of labor force participation

goes from 3.1 with marriage included to 3.6 with marriage excluded. These results indicate that while the

appropriateness of including marriage as a covariate is questionable and does have large impacts on the

decomposition results, the qualitative conclusion that relative changes in the earnings and urban residence

status of southern black women between 1960 and 1970 exerted a signicant negative inuence on black-

white fertility gaps, while changes in relative female labor force participation rates had the opposite eect,

hold regardless of marital status's inclusion as as covariate.


Similar to marital status, a high degree of reverse-casualty may be responsible for the observed association

between female labor force participation and fertility. Column 4 of Table A5 reports results that additionally

exclude the labor force participation controls, and nd that the estimated contributions of earnings and urban

residence are nearly unchanged.


The baseline decomposition assessed changes in the GFR gap between southern blacks and southern whites.

But as was the case in the prior analyses, it is also reasonable to use northern blacks as the control group

or to estimate triple-dierence models that compare southern blacks to the other three race-by-region cells,

and results of these alternative comparisons are reported in Columns 5 and 6 of Table A5.


The decomposition reported in Column 5 is structurally similar to the decomposition reported in Table 1 of

the main paper, but uses the sample of African Americans in both regions and replaces the black indicator

with a South indicator throughout the decomposition.


When using this alternative control group, earnings continue to explain a substantial portion of the observed

reduction in the relative fertility of southern black women. In particular, Column 5 indicates that individual

and family level earnings jointly explain a statistically signicant 5.2 birth reduction in the GFR gap




                                                       8
between southern and northern blacks.         Interestingly, both labor force participation and marriage have

much less predictive power when using northern blacks as the comparison group.               This is because while

these characteristics are strongly associated with fertility for blacks in both regions, changes in their levels

between 1960 and 1970 were not substantially stronger among southern blacks than among northern blacks.

In particular, while the labor force participation rate of fertile-aged southern black women increased by 4.2

percentage points among southern black women between 1960 and 1970 (see Table 1), it increased by only

2.9 percentage points among northern black women (not shown). Similarly, while marriage rates decreased

by 8.4 percentage points among southern black women between 1960 and 1970, the analogous change for

northern black women was 11.1 percentage points (not shown).


The nal column of Table A5 reports the results of a specication that pools observations from both races

and both regions then decomposes the sources of dierential fertility changes among southern blacks.             In

practice this is implemented by including the three way interaction of a 1970 indicator, a black indicator and

a South indicator as the independent variable of interest (as well as main eects and all possible two way

interactions of these variables), then observing the extent to which the coecient on this triple interaction

falls when the covariate vector is included in the model (as well as interactions between the covariates and

black and south indicators). As in Column 5, the estimated impact of marriage and labor force participation

change substantially in this specication, but there is a large and robust reduction in the relative fertility of

southern blacks attributed to earnings, and a smaller but still signicant eect attributed to urbanization.




Online Appendix D: Analyses of Geographic Heterogeneity


Figure 4 of the main paper showed substantial spacial heterogeneity in the magnitude of post-CRA racial

fertility convergence. To provide a more systematic accounting of which county characteristics were most

strongly correlated with the strength of fertility convergence, I assemble a detailed data set with various

potentially relevant county characteristics, then estimate the county-level associations between these charac-

teristics and the strength of local fertility convergence. In particular, I estimate regressions of the following

form:




                                           F ertilityGapc = Xc + c                                              (1)



whereF ertilityGapc is the change in the black-white GFR gap occurring in county c between 1964 and 1969
and Xc measures a characteristic of county c that potentially inuenced the strength of fertility convergence.

I rst report the bivariate association between fertility decline and various county characteristics while

excluding the other studied characteristics, then report a single specication that includes all of the studied

county characteristics simultaneously. As a robustness check I additionally estimate and report specications

that include a control vector with each county's total black population, total population of all races, and a

state xed-eect, which will help to account for basic county characteristics that may confound the association

between the studied factors and fertility, such as the presence of a population center, the county's overall

racial composition, and state-level policies.


Results of this exercise are reported in Table A6, using an estimation sample that includes 675 counties with

non-missing data on all of the studied covariates. To facilitate comparisons across county traits measured in

dierent units, all of the   Xc   variables are standardized into z-scores, such that      can be interpreted as the




                                                         9
change in the strength of fertility convergence associated with a one standard deviation increase in                        Xc .   The

mean and standard deviation of each utilized measure are reported at the bottom of Table A6 for reference.

Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in parentheses.


I begin by estimating the association between fertility convergence and school desegregation and hospital

access, with results reported in Columns 1 and 2 of Table A6.


School desegregation data is drawn from Oce of Civil Rights (OCR) compliance surveys and the South-

ern Education Reporting Service (SERS), a consortium of southern newspaper editors, and was primarily

collected and generously made available by Sarah Reber (see Reber 2010; Cascio et al.                          2010) with some

additional data transcription by the author.
                                            4 I measure the level of school desegregation in a given year

as the fraction of black students attending a school that also enrolled whites, then calculate the                      change      in

this measure occurring between 1964 and 1969 for each county. The descriptive statistics at the bottom of

Column 1 indicate rapid school integration: In the typical county, the fraction of African American students

attending an integrated school increased by 58 percentage points between 1964 and 1969.


I measure hospital access in a given year as the black-white dierence in the fraction of births which occurred

in a hospital, which was recorded in the same Vital Statistics data used for the baseline fertility analyses,

and again calculate the         change    in this measure between 1964 and 1969 for each county.                 The descriptive

statistics at the bottom of Column 2 show that this gap fell by 16 percentage points between 1964 and 1969

(reecting an increase from 73% to 89% among blacks and a constant rate of 99% among whites).
                                                                                                                        5


The regression results for school desegregation in Column 1 indicate that a standard deviation increase in the

magnitude of local school desegregation increased the strength of black-white fertility convergence by a .63

births, while the results in Column 2 indicate that a standard deviation increase in the magnitude of local

hospital access increased the strength of convergence by 2.44 births. The magnitude of fertility convergence

in the average county within the estimation sample was 27 births, so that these coecients translate into

convergence levels that were 2-9% stronger than average, but neither association is statistically signicant

at conventional levels.
                            6


I next estimate the associations between fertility convergence and the local presence of potentially relevant

federal programs, specically Medicaid, the Food Stamp Program, Head Start and the Family Planning

Program, which may have directly or indirectly changed the costs of investing in children's human capital

or avoiding a birth. The presence of Medicaid and the Food Stamp Program are measured as the average

level of per-capita spending on these programs between 1964 and 1969, Head Start presence is measured

   4 The   OCR surveys were rst elded in 1968 as part of the federal government's eorts to monitor compliance with the CRA,
and collected school-level counts of students, disaggregated by race. The OCR sample for most years included approximately
75,000 individual schools located in 8,000 school districts nationwide. All school districts with enrollment greater than 3,000 were
included in the sample, and districts with enrollment between 300 and 3,000 were subject to probability sampling proportionate
to their enrollment totals.     Additionally, school districts of special interest to the OCR were included irrespective of size,
typically those with histories of compliance failure, which in practice meant that a large majority of southern school districts
were included. I supplement the OCR data with the SERS data to measure baseline desegregation levels in 1964, although in
practice virtually all of the schools in the 11 states of the former Confederacy studied here were fully segregated as of 1964,
with less than 3% of black students attending desegregated schools during the 1964 school year.
   5 An   alternative measure of health care access is the infant mortality rate (IMR), which fell by approximately 10 infant deaths
per 1,000 live births among southern blacks between 1964 and 1969, but by only 3 infant deaths among southern whites over
the same period. Results when the IMR is used in place of (or in addition to) the in-hospital birth rate are qualitatively similar
to those shown below, but I prefer the in-hospital birth rate because the race-specic IMR is unavailable for approximately 30
of the counties in the estimation sample.
   6 The   27 birth reduction in the black-white fertility gap in the average county is greater than the 20 birth convergence
from 1964-1969 shown in Figure 1B because the analysis from Table A6 gives all counties equal weight, and convergence was
somewhat stronger in less populous counties.




                                                                 10
with average spending per four year-old between 1964 and 1969, and the presence of the Family Planning

Program is measured using an indicator of whether this program was operational in each county at some

point between 1964 and 1969. Data on the local spending and operations of these programs are drawn from

archival records which were collected and generously made available by Almond, Hoynes & Schanzenbach

(2011), by Bailey (2012), and by Bailey & Goodman-Bacon (2015). The means in the nal row of Table

A6 indicate that from 1964-1969 the average county in the sample had spending of $36.27 per resident for

Medicaid, $7.24 per resident for Food Stamps, and $491.25 per four year-old for Head Start, and that the

Federal Family Planning Program was present in 16% of counties at some point from 1964-1969.


Columns 3-6 of Table A6 report the results for these four programs, and nd that all four were associated with

stronger fertility convergence, with three of the four associations statistically signicant at conventional levels.

With the exception of the Family Planning Program, the magnitudes of the associations are qualitatively

large. While potential biases from selection, non-random migration, measurement error and other potential

issues prevent strong causal inferences from being drawn from these associations, the fact that counties with

greater exposure to these programs experienced systematically stronger relative black fertility declines is

consistent with War on Poverty and Great Society programming meaningfully contributing to the observed

fertility convergence.


Among the most important eects of the Civil Rights Movement, but also among the most dicult to

quantify, are the social and psychological ramications of full citizenship and equal protection under the law.

For example the act of voting or riding in the front of public buses had few direct economic consequences, but

obviously carried great social signicance, and likely had meaningful impacts on optimism and expectations

about future levels of opportunity that could have plausibly led southern African Americans to reduce fertility

levels and invest more heavily in smaller numbers of children.


An indirect method of evaluating this possibility is to test whether fertility convergence was stronger in areas

of the South that had the most severe histories of state-sponsored discrimination and racial violence. To

do so, I estimate the association between fertility convergence and each county's antebellum slave density,

measured as the ratio of enslaved African Americans to the total county population in 1860, and the number

of lynchings per 1,000 black residents occurring between 1882 and 1930. Slave densities are calculated with

1860 Census data and follow the method of Acharya, Blackwell & Sen (2016) to create historically consistent

county boundaries. Lynching data comes from the Historical American Lynching Data Collection Project

(Project HAL 2019), and includes all known lynchings in which the victim was African American and the

mob was white. The provided descriptive statistics indicate that for the average county in the estimation

sample 43% of the 1860 population consisted of enslaved African Americans, and .48 lynchings per 1,000

black residents had occurred during the Reconstruction and Jim Crow periods.


The results in Column 7 of Table A6 indicate that a standard deviation increase in 1960 slave density is

associated with a statistically signicant increase in post-1964 fertility convergence of 4.32 births, which

is approximately 16% stronger than convergence in the average county, and is the strongest association

among the studied characteristics. Column 8 nds that a standard deviation increase in per-capita lynchings

is associated with a statistically signicant 2.24 birth increase in the magnitude of fertility convergence,

also one of the stronger observed associations.     Again, while the current exercise is primarily descriptive,

the presence of such strong associations between historical measures of the intensity of enslavement and

racial violence and post-1964 relative black fertility decline is consistent with the possibility that some of

the observed change in fertility behavior was a response to the dismantling of the most overt forms of



                                                        11
state-sponsored racism, rather than solely due to narrower economic incentives such as increases in forgone

earnings from parenthood after 1964.


The nal column of Table A6 reports the results of a specication that includes all of the studied county

characteristics simultaneously, and most of qualitative conclusions are unchanged. The conditional correla-

tion between fertility convergence and school and hospital desegregation are both positive and non-trivial

but not statistically signicant; the presence and expenditures of newly created social programs are pos-

itively associated with fertility convergence and are in some cases statistically signicant; and both 1860

slave density and lynching rates have strong and statistically signicant correlations with the strength of

post-1964 fertility convergence, even conditional on the other county characteristics. Calculating the linear

combination of the coecients in Column 9 for sets of related county characteristics indicates that the com-

bined impact of school integration and hospital access was 4.43 births ( p=.11 ), the combined impact of the
studied War on Poverty programs was 4.90 births (    p=.056 ),   and the combined impact of historical slave

usage and lynchings was 6.45 births (  p=.008 ).
Table A7 repeats the analyses in Table A6, but includes controls for each county's total black population,

total all-race population, and state xed-eects in all of the specications.      The results are qualitatively

similar to those in Table A6.

Notes: Columns 1-3 report infant mortality rates in the specified population and year, measured as the
ratio of deaths occurring before age one to the total number of live births, multiplied by 1,000. Columns
4-6 use these infant mortality rates to adjust the Census-based GFR estimates from Table A3 by adding
the estimated number of infant deaths to the estimated number of total births.

Notes: Baseline results in Column 1 reproduce Column 7 of Table 1 from the main paper. Relative to this baseline specification, Column 2 includes
individuals who were born in the North but were residing in the South at the time of enumeration; Column 3 excludes marital status measures from
the decomposition; Column 4 excludes both marital status and labor force participation measures from the decomposition; Column 5 uses the
sample of African Americans in both regions, excludes southern whites from the sample, and performs the decomposition using the interaction of a
1970 indicator and a South indicator as the independent variable of interest; Column 6 pools observations from both races and both regions and
performs the decomposition using the three way interaction of a 1970 indicator, a black indicator and a South indicator as the independent variable
of interest. All standard errors are calculated using the formulas derived by Gelbach (2016) with clustering by state of residence and reported in
parentheses. *, ** and *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively.

Notes: All specifications include controls each county's total black population, total population of all races, and state fixed-effects. Units of observation are counties in the
South. Dependent variable in all specifications is the change in the black-white GFR gap occurring between 1964 and 1969. All independent variables are measured in
standardized units (z-scores). See Appendix D for detailed variable descriptions and data sources. Standard errors, clustered by state, are reported in parentheses. *, ** and
*** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively.
