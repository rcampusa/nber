                ESTIMATING THE AGE-PRODUCTIVITY PROFILE USING
                              LIFETIME EARNINGS

                                  ABSTRACT




     Understanding how productivity varies with age is important for a
variety of reasons. A decline in productivity with age implies that aging
societies must increasingly depend on the labor supply of the young and
middle age. It also means that policies designed to keep the elderly in the
work force, while potentially good for the elderly, may decrease overall
productivity. A third implication is that, absent government intervention,
employers may not be willing to hire the elderly for the same compensation
as younger workers. Labor economists are particularly interested in the
relationship of productivity and age because it can help test alternative
theories of the labor market.

     This paper assumes risk neutral employers and estimates the age—
productivity relationship using the first order condition that the present
expected value of total compensation equals the present expected value of
productivity; workers hired at different ages have different present
expected values of total compensation, and, correspondingly, different
present expected values of productivity. Hence, if one psrameterizes the
age—productivity relationship, the parameters of this relationship can be
identified from information on how total present expected compensation
varies with age.

     The data in the study are earnings histories for over three hundred
thousand employees of a Fortune 1000 corporation covering the period 1969—
1983. While the results may be subject to several biases and should be
viewed cautiously, they are fairly striking. For each of the five sex—
occupation groups, productivity falls with age.  For young workers,
compensation (earnings plus pension accrual) is below productivity and for
older workers compensation exceeds productivity. For several worker groups
the discrepancy between compensation and productivity is very substantial.

     In addition to confirming some features of contrsct theory, the results
lend support to the bonding models of Becker and Stigler and Lazear which
suggest that firms use the age—earnings profile as an incentive device.

variety of reasons.    A decline in productivity with age implies that aging

sotieties must intreasingly depend on the labor supply of the young and

middle age.     It also means that policies designed to keep the elderly in the

work force, while potentially good for the elderly, may decrease overall

productivity.     A third implication is that, absent government intervention,

employers may not be willing to hire the elderly for the same compensation

as younger workers.

     Labor economists are particularly interested in the relationship of

                                                          theories of the
productivity and age because it can help test alternative

labor market.     The simplest such theory is the spot market theory in which

workers are paid, at least annually, their marginal product.       However, there

appear to he few, if any, economists who view the spot market theory as

reasonable.     My research with David Wise (Kotlikoff and Wise;   1985,   l987a,

l987b) presents fairly strong evidence against the spot market theory;        we

demonstrated that most defined benefit pension plans induce very sharp

discontinuities with age in vested pension accrual.     Under the spot market

                                                        at these ages in
theory there should be offsetting sharp discontinuities

wage compensation.     Such offsetting wage discontinuities are not, however,

evident in the data.

      In contrast to the spot market theory, contract theories of labor

markets imply only a present value relationship between compensation and

productivity.     Consider, for example, the contracts that would he written by

 risk neutral employers.     In these contracts, although earnings in any single

                            than that year's productivity, the present
 year can exceed or be less
                                       will equal the present expected velue
 expected value of the worker's output

 of her compensation.
       Different contract theories have different implications concerning the

relationahip of productivity and wages as the worker ages.        One such theory

is the specific human capital model of Mincer (1964)     and Becker (1971).      It

suggests that if firms sre free to fire older workers, the age—wage profile

will be structured such that earnings exceed productivity when young and

vice versa when old.    On the other hand, in Lazear's   (1979,   1981) agency

model of worker shirking, the worker receives less than her marginal product

when young, with the difference paid out in the form of wages, accrued

pension benefits, or severance pay in excess of the marginal product when

old.

       The efficiency wage models of Harris and Todaro (1970),     Stofft (1984),

Yellen (1984), Stiglitz and Shapiro (1984),    end Bulow and Summers (1985)

represent a third view of the labor market.    These models stress the payment

of above market clearing wages, rather than the shape of the age—

compensation profile as an incentive device.    While there is equilibrium

unemployment in these models, they, like the spot market theory, predict

that workers are paid their marginal products at each age over the work

span.

        The evidence to date on the age—productivity relationship is limited

and mixed.     The findings for older workers of Abraham and Madoff (1981) that

                                                                      in
pay increases although indices of productivity decline, suggest wages

 excess of marginal products toward the end of the work span.       Lazear and

Moore (1983)    report that the earnings profiles of the self—employed are

 flatter than those of employees, also suggesting earnings in excess of

 productivity among older employees.    Kahn and Lang (1986),     in contrast,

 examine responses to questions concerning desired hours of work; they point

 out that older workers, with earnings in excess of their marginal products,
                                      —4—


are likely to be hours—constrained by their employers and, therefore, desire

to work more.    The opposite would be true if earnings of older workers is

below their marginal products.    Kahn and Lang's empirical findings support

the view that marginal productivity exceeds earnings for older workers.

    This paper assumes risk neutral employers and estimates the age—

productivity relationship using the first order condition that the presenr

expected value of total compensation equals the present expected value of

productivity; workers hired at different ages have different present

expected values of total compensation and, correspondingly, different

present expected values of productivity.    Hence, if one parameterizes the

age—productivity relationship, the parameters of this relationship can be

identified from information on how total present expected compensation

varies with age.

     The data in the study are earnings histories for over three hundred

thousand employees of a Fortune 1000 corporstion covering the period 1969 —

1983.    While the firm's name can not be disclosed, the firm is involved

primarily in sales.    These data are advantageous not only because one can

control for the firm, but also because one can determine precisely the

accrued pension compensation arising under the firm's defined benefit

pension plan.     At particular ages and amounts of service, pension

compensation in this firm is an important component of total compensation.

        The results indicate that productivity declines with age and that

workers are paid more than they produce when old to offset being paid less

than they produce when young.    For some sex—occupation groups the difference

between productivity and compensation at young and old ages is very

sizeable.    The results support the bonding models of Becker and Stigler

(1974) and Lazear (1979,1981) as opposed to the efficiency wage models cited

however,   compatible with more general efficiency wage

Katz, 1956).

     There are, however, a number of reasons for viewing these results

cautiously.    First the analysis assumes that the form of contracts remained

constant over the sample period.     Second, the probability of remaining

                                     time invariant, rather than an

                                                the analysis assumes the age—

While         the length         of employment is uncertain, the assumption of risk neutral

employers and risk averse workers, whose productive characteristics are

fully known by the firm,                    implies that the actual compensation payments are

specified with certainty at the time the worker joins the firm.

          Assuming the structure of the compensation contract is constant through

time, the ratio of compensation at age i+l to compensation at age i is

independent of time;                    i.e.,

If the age—productivity relationship and the probabilities of departure are

also assumed to be time invariant, the third arguments in the functions

where C(a,t) stands for the left hand side of (7) and equals the present

expected compensation of a worker hired at age a in year t.

        To gain some intuition about the relationship between the C(               ,    )s and

the h(    ,   )s,   consider the simple tase in which there is a constant

In this case C(a,r)         — C*(a),
                                   and    a little manipulation of (8) leads to:

and

Section IV.     Estimates of the Age—Productivity Profile

     Table 3 presents the regression results from estimating (11') assuming

a 6 percent interest rate.     In the regression observations on workers hired

                                                      since pension accrual
only during the years 1970 through 1983 are included,

for workers hired prior to 1969 could not be determined.       All of the age—

squared and age—cubed coefficients reported in the Table are highly

significant.     MAny of the year dummies are also significant, suggesting that

the modeling of expectations of future Os may be important.       The regression

coefficients are little affected by the choice of interest rate; the

                                            rates of both 3 percent and          9
regressions were repeated assuming interest
                                                                 in Table
percent, and the coefficients are very similar to those reported
                                                                                       3.



     Figures 2 through 6 are based on the six percent interest rate

regressions of Table 3.     They present the age—productivity profiles (dashed

lines) predicted by the regressions for the five sex—occupation groups for

workers hired initially at age 35.     They also present the ag—tota1

compensation profile (solid lines) implied by the smoothed p(       ,   )s   and the

pattern of pension accrual.     The age 35 initial level of productivity and

                                                                 value of
compensation are chosen to insure that both the present expected

compensation and the present expected value of marginal product equal

$500,000.     Table 4 presents the values of compensation and productivity

profiles presented in Figures 2 through 6.

              While productivity initially rises with age in each diagram, it

 eventually starts declining with age.       For male office workers productivity

 peaks at age 45 and declines thereafter.       For this group age 65 productivity

 is less than one—third    of peak productivity.    The female office workers

accrual prior to age 55.             After age 55 the accrual is much smaller and,

indeed, can become negative.

    The q(     ,       )s   used in constructing   catj       and the variables in equations

(10') and (13) were calculated separately for each of the five age—

occupation groups in the following manner.                First,         the fraction of workers

at a given age and initial age of hire who remain in the firm from one year

to the next was calculated.            Next, these annual survival hazards were

smoothed using a third order polynomial in age, age of hire, and interaction

terms.     Finally, the cumulative survival probabilities, the q(                        ,   )s,   were

computed based on the smoothed annual survival probabilities.

     The   (   , )s in the above discussion have stood for the growth in total

compensation, including pension compensation; but in order to determine the

course of pension compensation, one needs first to know the course of

nonpension compensation.             Hence, the function       *(    ,    ),   which   gives the

growth in nonpension compensation, was first estimated by regressing

observed growth rates in earnings, excluding pension compensation, against a

third order polynomial in age, age of hire, and interaction terms.                                 The

initial wage together with the smoothed             p(    ,    )s   provide a path of

nonpension compensation that can be used to calculate the path of pension

accrual.     The path of nonpension plus pension compensation is then used to

form the present expected value of total compensation, the

     Tables        1   and 2 present, respectively, the smoothed q(                ,   ) and p*(         ,




functions    for the different occupation—sex groups at selected ages and ages

of hire.     Table 1 indicates very substantial differences in job survival

rates across the five groups; 34.3 percent of male managers who hire on at

age 30 are predicted to remain with the firm 25 years later.                            For male and
                                           —15—




female office workers the comparable percentages are 21.5 and 14.2,

respectively.     For salesmen and saleswomen the respective percentages are

5.4 and 2.3.    The Table also demonstrates that workers hired at older ages,

at least through age    50, have larger probabilities     of remaining in the    fin
for a given period of time than workers hired at younger ages.

        Table 2 indicates that the age of hire also is an important factor in

real wage growth.    According to the regression, workers hired at later ages

often experience greater real wage growth than workers hired at younger

ages.     In addition, wage growth for female office workers and saleswomen at

particular combinations of age and age of hire often exceeds that of their

male occupational counterparts.

        A reduced form regression can help illustrate the shape of the age—

profile of the present expected value of compensation.            This regression

relates the log of the present expected value of compensation (calculeted

using the inital wage, the q(    ,   )   function, and the p( ,   ) function),   to a

set of year dummies and a polynomial in age.         The exponent of the

coefficients of this polynomial in age multiplied by their respective

variables indicates the shape of the age—present expected value of

compensation profile.    Figure 1 presents this profile for each of the five

sex—occupation group normalized by the age 40 level of this profile.             Notice

that each of the normalized profiles of present expected compensation rises

at early ages at a decreasing rate,        suggesting, as indicated above, that

productivity rises with age at these ages.         In addition, each of the

profiles, except that of saleswomen, declines a decreasing rate in old age,

suggesting that productivity declineswith age at these ages for at least

the other sex—occupation groups.

problem for estimating the age productivity relationship, the parameter a1

is normalized to unity.          With this normalization and using (12), equation

(11)   can now be expressed as:



(11')               catj   —   logB + log[X1(a)   + 023(2(5)
                                                           + a3X3(a)] +   'atj
where X1(a), Xp(a), and X3(a) are the respective sums on the right hand side

of   (12).    Equation (11') can be estimated nonlinearly.        Since time enters

only through the intercept term log6, data for workars hired in different

years can be pooled by simply entering year dummies.

       The assumption of myopic expectations may not be justified.          An

alternative assumption is that firms expect that the value of the marginal

revenue product of labor will revert to a value 6* next period and stay at

that level in the future.          Under this assumption we have:


                                            t+75—a

                                            s—t+l


In principal, equation          (13) can be estimated nonlinearly   to recover values

of   6*,   the   6    as well as   2 and 03.   In practice, parameter estimates of

this model did not converge because of colinearity of the right hand side

variables in (13).         The nonconvergence occurs even if one models h(       ,   ) as a
gradratic, rather than a cubic function of age.

Section      III.    The Data and Emoirical Implementation

       The large firm's data used in this study are earnings histories

covering the period 1969 through 1983 of workers employed in the firm at
                                      —13—




some time during the period 1980 through 1983.    The workers ste classified

into three rather broad occupation and sex groups: male office workers,

female office workers, salesmen, saleswomen, and male managers.     There are

too few female managers ro warrant their analysis.    Unfortunately, there are

no additional demographic variables that could be included in the analysis.

     The firm has a defined benefit plan with a fairly complex set of age—

and service—related benefits.     The benefit formula is a percent of earnings

formula in which the basic retirement annuity equals a percentage rate times

the number of years of service for workers with fewer than 26 years of

service.   For those with more service, the formula equals 25 times the

former percentage rate, plus the additional service beyond 25 times a lower

percentage rate.   The baaic benefit is offset by the amount of Social

Security benefits the firm predicts the worker will receive.     The predicted

Social Security benefit is derived from another age— and service—related

formula unique to the firm.

     The pension plan's normal retirement age is 65, and its early

retirement age is 55.   For workers who retire after the early retirement

                                                    a special early
age, but before the normal retirement age, there is

retirement benefit reduction table that is based on the workers' age and

service.   Workers who terminate employment before age 55 are not eligible

for the quite generous early retirement benefit reduction rates and face

 instead actuarially reduced benefits.    Another very important penalty for

                                             is that for workers retiring
 terminating before the early retirement age

 after the early retirement age have their Social Security offset deferred

 until they reach age 65.     These provisions of the firm's pension can produce

                                          at age 55, but rather modest

departing the firm is high, pR will be much less thsn unity, and a value of

C*(a+l) in excess of C*(a) is consistent with positive values of v(a).

        The formula for changes in productivity with age is given in (10).       In

some cases one can read the age—productivity relationship from the slope of

the age—present expected compensation profile, C*(a), and knowledge that

pR<l.    For example, productivity is constant with age in the range of ages

over which the C*(a) profile is flat.      One can also tell that productivity

rises with age over ranges in which C*(a) is rising, but at a decreasing

rate; the intuition here is that a positive, but flattening slope of C*(s)

means that the immediate positive slope of C*(a) (the difference in C*(a+l)

and C*(a)) is due to v(a+l) exceeding v(a), rather than to later marginal

products exceeding v(a).       If C*(a) is increasing, but at an increasing rate,

one can not say whether productivity at age s+l exceeds or falls short of

productivity at age a.      Similarly, one can tell that productivity delines

with age over ranges of ages in which C*(a) declines with age at a

decreasing rate; however, if C*(a) declines with age at an increasing rate,

one can not tell whether productivity is decreasing or increasing with age.

        Returning to the general case, ecuation (8) can be transformed into an

econometric relation by appending s multiplicative error term, eC5,t,j,

where the subscript    j   references the individual worker.   The error term can

be viewed as s worker—specific productivity factor.       Its inclusion in the

model means that workers hired at the same age in the same sex—occupation

category may have different initial salaries.      Hence, the model permits

worker heterogeneity as well as selectivity based on the        a,t.j5   While

workers hired at psrticular ages, or in certain years, may be more or less

productive than workers hired at other ages or in other years without
                                                 —11—




biasing the results, the model does require the saae wage—growth contract

and the same departure rates for all wotkers within a sex—occupation group.

       Taking logarithms of the resulting expression yields:



(11)                      —    logO   ÷ logH(a) +
                 ca,t,j                                 6a,t,j




Tn (11), Ca,t,j is the logarithm of C(a,t) for worker j who is age a in year

t.    While h(    ,   ) can,   in principle, be parameterized as a function of

service as well as age, in ptactice, the resulting cummulative age and

cummulative service vatiables are too colinear to estimate separate age and

service coefficients.           Hence,   I   parameterize the productivity function h(

     as simply a cubic function of age, and acknowledge that the age—

productivity results reported below confound service—productivity effects.

Letting h(k,a) — a1k + c2k2 + a3k3, H(a) can be written as:




                               t+75—a                                t+75—a

productivity profile is quite similar to that of the male office workers,

both the salesmen and saleswomen productivity profiles peak a few years

later than those of office wotkers, hut their rate of decline with age is

quite similar.   Productivity for male managers peaks at age 43; by age 60

productivity is less than one third of peak productivity, and productivity

actually becomes negative after age 62.

     In four of the diagrams productivity exceeds total compensation while

the worker is young and then falls below total compensation; in the

remaining case, that of salesmen,   the relationship of compensation and

productivity is quite similar to the other four groups,   except after age 61

when productivity again exceeds compensation.   Except for the kinks in the

                                                           the age—

compensation profiles and age—productivity profiles

saleswomen are very close to one another at each age.     This is what one

would predict since salesworkers in this firm are paid, in large part, on a

commission basis.

     In contrast, to the results for salesworkers, one might expect the

weakest connection between annual earnings and annual productivity among

                                         is indeed the case.    At age 35
male managers.   Figure 4 indicates this
                               exceeds total compensation by more than a

factor of two, while compensation is over twice as high as productivity by

age 57.   The discrepancies between total compensation and productivity at

 these ages are somewhat smaller for office workers, but

                             35 total compensation for female office workers
 important. For example, age

 is $22,616, while age 35 productivity is $33,604.   In contrast, age 57 total

                                                is only $28,117.

      The results depicted in Figures 2 through 6 are not sensitive to the

inclusion of pension accrual in total compensation; if one ignores pension

accrual in the estimation, the age—earnings end age—productivity profiles

have tha same relative shapes as those presented.            Of course, the age—

earoings profile does not exhibit the kinks of the age—total compensation

profile sioce these kinks atise from pension accrual.            In the absence of

considering pension accrual, one csn also use the data on workers hired

prior to 1970.         While the initial wage of those hited prior to 1969 is not

reported, thIs wage can be inferred based on the wage observed in 1969 and

the u(     ,   )s;   i.e., one can inpute backwards the wage   at the initial age of

hire,     The results based on this larger data set are again extremely similar

to those presented in Figures 2 through 6.

        As indicated in Figures 7 through 16 which present compensation and

productivity profiles at 3 percent and         6   percent interest rates,   the general

shapes of the age—total compensation profiles and age—productivity profiles

are also insensitive to the choice of interest rate.            For example, compare

the   3   percent snd 9 percent compensation and productivity profiles of female

office workers in Figures 13 and 14.          Since the present value of these

profiles always equals $500,000, the profiles assuming a 9 percent interest

rate are initially higher than those assuming a 3 percent interest rate.

The percentage differences between the two profiles is slightly larger at

early and late ages, assuming a 9 percent, rather than a 3 percent interest

rate; but since the initial levels of the profiles           in Figure 14 are higher,

the absolute differences between compensation and productivity are

considerably larger.          The age at which productivity of female office workers

falls below compensation also depends on the interest rate.            The cross—over

age is roughly 50 assuming a 3 percent intereat rate; it is roughly 48

aasuming a 6 percent intereat rate; and it is roughly 45 (ignoring the

vesting kink in the compensation profile) assuming an interest rate of 9

percent.

      Another concern is the extent to which the profiles described here as

age—productivity profiles confound service—produotivity            effects.

Unfortunately,    the colinesrity between cumulated        service and age variables

precludes modeling the h(    ,   )   function as   a continuous function both of age

and age of hire.     An alternative way to explore this issue is to model h(            ,)


as   depending only on age, but to estimate the model separately for workers

hired at different ages.     If one estimates the model separately for those

hired prior to age 35 and those after age          35,   the resulting general shapes

of the productivity profiles are quite similar to those based on the entire

sample.    The post—age 35 profiles are indeed very similar, while the pro—age

35 profiles exhibit a steeper decline in productivity with age, with

negative predicted productivity after roughly age            55.   This prediction of

negative productIvity late in the work span may simply represent a poor fit

in the tail of the estimated polynomial.




Section V.    Conclusions and Suggestions for Additional Research

       The findings that productivity decreases with age must be viewed

cautiously.      Contrary to what has been assumed,        it may be that some workers

within a sex—occupation category receive different contracts than others.
                                                         A and B type workers
 Suppose that within a sex—occupation categor' there are

 and that A type workers receive contracts with steeper compensation profiles

 than B type workers.     Also assume that A type workers have smaller values of
                                               —25—


q(   ,   ) than B   type workers.       If the composition of workers remaining with

the firm changes, the estimated p(              ,   ) and q(   ,   ) functions would differ
from those for either A or B separately or from those that would arise if

the separate p(         )s and q(   ,    )s   for A end B were averaged using constant

weights.      As a consequence, the age—productivity profile derived using the

method presented here could differ from either the profile for group A

workers or the profile for group B workers.                    Similar biases may ariae if the

                                                                 as the age
composition of type A and type B workers among new hires changes

of hire increases.        These potential biases need to be explored more formally

as does the possible bias arising from assuming static expectations of

overall worker productivity.

         These concerns notwithstanding,            the results are fairly striking.

Productivity        falls with age, compensation at first lies below and than

exceeds productivity,        and the discrepancy between compensation and

productivity        can be very substantial.          Interestingly, there is much closer

correspondence        of productivity to compensation for amlasworkera, who are

compensated more on a spot market basis, than for other types of workers.

Also, the relationship of productivity to compenaation is weakest for male

managers,     who, one would expect, are most likely to be hired on a contract

 rather than a spot market basis.

          In addition to confirming contract theory, the results lend support to

 the bonding wage models of Becker and Stigler (1974) and Lazear (1979,1981).

 In contrast, the reaults contradict the predictions of the standard Mincer—

 Becker human cmpital model in which workers receive more than they are worth

 when young and less than they are worth when old.                    They also are at odds

 with the eaaertion of some efficiency wage models that workers receive their

 marginal product on an annual basis.
