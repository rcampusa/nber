                       Shifts in the Nineteenth—Century
                          Phillips Curve Relationship

                                     ABSTRACT




       This paper examines shifts in the output   effects   of unanticipated

inflation in the nineteenth—century United States     hyestimating      a Lucas—type

aggregate supply function over the 184fl—1900 period. It is shown that, in

contrast to the twentieth-century experience in which there has been a

pronounced movement toward greater cyclical price rigidity, the nineteenth—

century   output response to unanti cipated price changes was      roughly stable over

the   period. Such stability is also particularly interesting in view of the
dramatic changes in communications and transportation technology, particularly

the telegraph and the railroad, which greatly facilitated information flows

and thereby should have forced the price—surprise coefficient downward. Other

factors which may have offset the influence of these improvements in

information technology on the price—surprise coefficient include the reduced

general price level variability due to the gold     standard in    the posthel lum

period and the possibility that the net effects of such improvements may in
fact have been small because shocks were able to spread more rapidly as

well. Finally, the perceived increase in cyclical pric rigidity over the

nineteenth century in the raw data is shown to have resulted not from a change

in price—surprise coefficient hut rather from an increased degree of

persistence or inertia in the econom.

      An important issue in macroeconomics has been whether the Phillips curve

 relationship has been changing over time toward greater price rigidity over

 the business cycle, It has often been argued that a given increase in the

 level of unemployment is now associated with a smaller reduction in inflation

 than had been true in the past.     In other words, the suggestion is that the

output costs of lowering inflation has increased over time. Studies based

essentially on twentieth—century U.S. data (e.g., Cagan, 1975; Sachs, 1980) in

general confirm that the cyclical rigidity of prices has been increasing.' In

his Phillips curve estimates Sachs (p. 83) finds, for example, a dramatic

shift in the inflation—unemployment relationship between the pre—1929 and the

post—World War II period —   the   estimated coefficients fall by more than 70

percent.

     Greater historical perspective would be useful in assessing long—term

shifts in the degree of price rigidity over the business cycle. Although

original studies of the Phillips curve (Phillips, 1958; Lipsey, 1960) were

based on historical data, relatively little attention has been devotedto

studying long—term changes since then.2 This paper therefore will consider

the American case between 1840 and 1900. The nineteenth—century experience

should be especially interesting in terms of informational theories of the

Phillips curve or aggregate supply (Phelps, 1970, pp. 6—7; Lucas, 1973). The

theory suggests that if the economy were composed of a large number of

scattered, competitive markets, or "islands", and information flows among them

are costly, suppliers of labor and goods would have difficulty in

distinguishing relative price changes from general movements in the price

level. The presence of imperfect information leads to a positive association

of price and output changes in the short run as suppliers misinterpret general

price level changes for relative price changes. In the nineteenth century
                                     —2--



when transportation and communication were significantly more difficult and

costly than today, this t1isiand' characterization of markets should be

particularly appropriate. In view of some difficulties in estimating positive

price—surprise terms in aggregate supply curves with contemporary data (Fair,

1979), the results for the nineteenth century in measuring the output response

to inflationary surprises should he of some interest.

     The basic historical evidence for the period 1835—1975 is summarized in

Tables I and II, and also in Tables IA and hA. Tables I and II report the

total change in wholesale prices from peak to trough of the business cycle to

give an idea of the magnitude of decline, while Tables IA and hA present the

change in inflation rates resulting from the cycle. The change in inflation

is measured as the difference between the inflation rate in the year prior to

the peak of the cycle and the average rate of price change during the downturn

(following Sachs). The change in the gap btween actual real out-put and

potential output from peak to trough of the cycle (a widening of the GNP gap

carries a minus sign) is used as a measure of the magnitude of the cycle and

the cycles are grouped in terms of severity.3 Such a classification scheme

allows contractions of a similar degree of severity to be compared directly.

Note first of all however that three nineteenth—century periods, 1847-48,

1873—79, 1890—91, which had been previously classified as contractions on the

basis of movements of NRER business cycle indicators, were in fact

expansionary periods marked by a narrowing GNP gap. These, as a result, will

be omitted in the period comparisons which follow.

     The increase in cyclical rigidity in the post—World War II period is

readily apparent. For mild contractions, downward price flexibility appears

to have ended with the post—World War II period and the size of the reduction

in the inflation rate declines significantly as well (the same is true for
                                      —3—

 moderate contractions, but there is only one postwar observation here).

 Longer term trends are more difficult to discern from the tables however, so

 price and output gap changes over cyclical downturns with the trend line for

 the nineteenth and twentieth centuries respectively are plotted in Figures I

 and II. Comparing the nineteenth and twentieth century experience directly is

 a rather dangerous enterprise because the figures are based on different data

 sources and output variability in the nineteenth century may be

 understated.4 Nevertheless, increased price rigidity (flatter slope) in the

 twentieth century is certainly supported by the figures. Moreover, this trend

 remains even when the data are divided into shorter periods. Regressions of

 price change on output gap change with the observations grouped into three

periods—-pre—Civil War, Civil War to World War II, and post—World War Il——show

a progressively smaller coefficient in each period with the shifts being

statistically significant in a likelihood ratio test.5 Thi cuggestion of a

very long term trend toward increased price rigidity from the raw data (from

the antebellum period on) however is primarily for a bit of (perhaps

questionable) historical perspective. Problems of possibly incOmparable data

will he avoided by focusing on the nineteenth century.

     Rather than such casual empiricism, as above, this paper will examine the

issue of changing price rigidity, or in the context of an aggregate supply

curve shifts in the output effects of unanticipated inflation, over the mid

and late nineteenth century more formally. Distinguishing between anticipated

and unanticipated inflation, I estimate an expectational aggregate supply

curve over the period 1840—60, 1870-1900. This period is particularly

interesting as well because it encompasses the diffusion of two of the most

important improvements in communications and transportation, the telegraph and

the railroad.   It will be shown however that, notwithstanding the apparent
                                        -4-.



trend toward greater cyclical price rigidity and the dramatic improvements in

communications and transportation over the period, the output response to

inflationary surprises was remarkably stable over the last sixty years of the

nineteenth century. The sharp decline in the slope of tfie twentieth—century

Phillips curve therefore was not characteristic of the nineteenth century.

     The estimation of the aggregate supply curve is described in Section I,

while the results are analyzed in Section II. The conclusions appear in

Section III, and the data are discussed in the Appendix.




                                         II.




        It is assumed that the aggregate supply function is the familiar

expectational form with lagged adjustment, as in Lucas (1973).

                                        a2(pt-.Etipt)
                                                        +
                                                            a0 + Ut          (1)



where       y, and      are logarithms of real output, real potential output,

and the price level respectively at time t. The variable Et_ipt represents

the public's expectation of the log of the price level in period t as of the

end of period t—1 based on information available at that point.

     The gap between actual and potential output is a function of last

period's gap and the difference between the actual price level and the

public's expectation of it. Unanticipated price increases lead to increases

in real output, a result consistent with a negatively sloped short—run

Phillips curve, but a vertical long—run one. Gordon (1980, 1981, 1982) has

criticized such a specification for assuming complete rather than gradual
                                          —5—


 price adjustment. Nevertheless, with annual data, as we have here, this does

 not seem to be an unreasonable characterization.6

      Potential output is taken to be a simple constant returns to scale Cobb—

 Douglas function of exogenous factor inputs:



              =
                  ktkt   + Ltt + Tttt + At                                   (2)




          with Kt + Lt + Tt =       1




where k, 9., and t are the logs of capital, labor, and land respectively;

Kt' Lt' and Tt are the factor shares; and At is the efficiency parameter at

time t.

     Substituting (2) into (1), we may rewrite the supply curve as:



             =
                  Ktkt   + Lt9.t + Tttt



             + a1(y1- Kt1kt1 - Lt-19.t           -
                                                     Tt1tt1)                 (3)




             + a2(p -              + a3timet +
                          Etipt)                     + Ut



where changes in the efficiency parameter At are captured by a time trend.

     Price expectations are taken to have been formed based on two lagged

values of the price level. They are 'economically rational't in the sense that

given available information at the time the public did not make systematic

errors in forming expectations of future price levels (Feige and Pearce,

1976). Such a specification seems particularly appropriate for the nineteenth
                                       -6-


century when information on exogenous variables must have been quite difficult

and costly to obtain.7

     Equation (3) therefore was estimated concurrently with the price

forecasting equation by instrumental variables. The instruments used included

the exogenous and predetermined variables in the model plus the logs of the

money supply, government expenditures, and exports.8 The hypothesis of no

first—order autocorrelation is not rejected using Godfrey's it   test   (1976).

The results for the equation estimated over the period 1841-1900 with a gap in

the 1860's appear in the first line of Table III. The coefficient of the

price surprise variable, pt—Et_ipt, is positive and statistically significant,

so that unanticipated increases in the price level elicits an increased supply

of output, as in the traditional expectational Phillips curve.9 This result

contrasts with the inability of Friedman and Schwartz (1982, p. 461) to

identify a statistically significant Phillips curve relationship in the United

States after 1867. With the exception of the interwar period, they find that

the relation between price change and output change, if anything, was negative

rather than positive.10 The influence of the lagged output gap is

significantly positive and the time trend is as well, consistent with

technical progress. The positive constant term might indicate some error in

the measurement of potential output.

    fleviations from full employment in the aggregate supply function of

equation (1) are caused by aggregate demand shocks. Recent experience however

has shown that supply—side shocks, where price and output movements are

negatively rather than positively related, can also he important influences on

the output gap and hence on the observed Phillips—curve tradeoff (Gordon,

1982; Froyen and Waud, 1984). Supply shocks in agriculture (bad harvests,

etc.) may have been particularly important in nineteenth—century America, when
                                         —7—


 agriculture constituted a much larger proportion of total output than today.

 To allow for the influence of supply perturbations a supply-shock variable,

      measured here as the relative price of food products)1 is included in the

 aggregate supply equation. The results of the estimation are presented in the

 second line of Table III. The coefficient of the supply—shock measure, Zt, is

 not significantly different from zero, and the estimates of the other

 coefficients are essentially unchanged from their values in line 1. Allowing

 for agricultural supply shocks does not therefore affect our estimate of the

trdnff
       Gordon (1982, pp. 1090—1091) derives another formulation of the aggregate

supply function in which the unanticipated component of nominal GNP change,

UY, appears on the right—hand side of the       equation rather than the price

surpri Se.




                -   y=     UY
                                +   X(y1 -   y1)   +
                                                        c                        (4)



To   separate the nominal GNP change into anticipated and unanticipated
components, the nominal change is regressed on two lagged values each of

changes in nominal GNP, the money stock, the rate of wholesale price change,

and the interest rate on government bonds, as well as the other right—hand

side variables in the supply equation —      the lagged output gap and time. The
fitted values from the estimated equation are taken to represent expected

income change, and the residuals, unanticipated changes in nominal income.12

This proxy for UY was then used in the estimation of equation (4). The

results are reported in the third line of Table III. The estimated tradeoff

coefficient, a, is again significantly positive and also of a similar

magnitude    (.6463) to those of the first two equations in Table III. The
                                        -8-

estimate of the Phillips curve parameter seems to he quite robust with respect

to alternate specifications of the aggregate supply function. On average 39

percent (1a) of the unanticipated nominal change showed up as output change

and 61 percent (-j-) as price change.

    Did the Phillips curve relationship, that is, the output response to

unanticipated inflation as given by a2, shift over the nineteenth century?

The regression results from estimating equation (3) over two subperiods,

divided by the Civil War decade, which appear in the first two lines of Table

IV show an upward movement in the price—surprise coefficient a2.13 This is

supported as well by the set of regression results at the bottom of Table IV

in which the sample size is increased by five year increments. The pattern is

generally one of a steadily increasing a2 over the postbellurn period,

indicating a shift toward a flatter Phillips curve (a smaller unanticipated

price change associated with a given output change over the business cycle)

which Sachs argues is characteristic of the twentieth century. However, a

likelihood ratio test for a shift in a2 after the Civil War decade produces a

test statistic x2(1) =   6.07,   significant at the 5 percent level (3.84), but

not at the 1 percent level (6.63).14 Although there may have been a bit of

trend toward larger output responses to a given unanticipated price change in

the late nineteenth century, the shift does not appear nearly as pronounced as

that in the following century. In contrast to the twentieth-century

experience the output-unanticipated inflation tradeoff appears to have been

roughly stable over the 1840—1900 period.

                                         II.

      The relative stability of the price—surprise coefficient cx2 after 1840 is

 remarkable in view of the dramatic improvements in technology, particularly

 the telegraph and the railroad, which greatly facilitated information flows

 over the period. Commercial telegraphy beginning with Samuel F. B. Morse's

 famous cable in 1844 spread rapidly across the tinited States, so that within a

decade more than 20,000 miles of telegraph line had been put in place. From

 its inception it was used primarily for business purposes, and its 'market

perfecting" impact in reducing information and transactions costs soon became

apparent (flu Boff, 1983, pp. 255—258). The railroad network in the United

States began to develop in the late antebellum period as well. From its

beginnings in the 1830's, it tripled in size over the decade of the 1850's to

a total of over 30,000 miles by 1860, Growth in track mileage continied in

the postbellum period, although at slower rates. The railroad was also an

important force in promoting the integration of dispersed local markets

(Chandler, 1977).

     Some crude evidence of increased local market integration may be offered

in the form of a significant decrease in the degree of geographical price

dispersion over the early part of our period. Consider the variance of

averaged first differences of logarithms of regional price indices as a

measure of how closely prices move together (Hercowitz, 1981, p. 337).



         Ap =   i- (   Ar)
            =
                    (ft)2    -

where       is the logarithm of the price index of region i at time t. Using

the Coelho and Shepherd (1974) indices of regional retail prices based on the

Weeks Report (they exclude the South Atlantic and Western regions) as the

price data, we see that the variance of regional price changes decreased by

about 30 percent between the decade of the 1850's and that of the 1870's.'5

        In the Lucas supply function (1973, p. 328) 2 may be written as:


                         2

            a2
                 =
                     (       2)   '                                                          (5)


where   2 represents the variance of the "prior" distribution of the log of the
general price level for           the traders,          is the variance of the distribution of
the deviation of prices in individual markets from the average, and y is the
supply elasticity with respect to price surprises. The term in parentheses

then is the fraction of total individual price variance which is due to

relative price variation.

     Cukierman (1979) in turn generalized a price—surprise aggregate supply

model to the case in which individuals may have access to price information

from other markets rather than just observing the current price in her own

market.     In such a case the "Lucas type effect" becomes 2/(na2 +

where n is the number of other markets from which the individual has access to

information. Information about general price movements is reinforced as the

individual samples more and more markets, so the ratio nc2/-r2 is an increasing

function of n. As n increases, r2/(nc12 +                   2)   and hence a2 should decrease.

As the number of other markets observed grows larger, the output effect grows

weaker. Or, in other words, as price information becomes more widely diffused

in the economy, the slope of the Phillips curve should become steeper.
                                       — ii   —




       Moreover, improvements in communication and transportation should make

 local market prices less subject to peculiarly local shocks. As a result, the

 degree of local price variability      should decline, which also decreases a2.

 Both of these effects of improved communication and transportation technology,

 access to price information from other markets and reduced local price

 variability, therefore should work in the same direction, toward a fall in

a2•       Suppliers of labor and goods would have been less likely to think that

general price increases represented relative price changes in their favor and

to increase output in response.

      However, the price—surprise coefficient a2 (from Table IV) in fact

remained roughly stable, or increased slightly, rather than falling. What

forces offset the effects of improvements in information technology? First of

all, the net effects of such changes are less clear because even though

information is propagated more swiftly and efficiently throughout the economy,

shocks are spread more rapidly as well. The relative position of individuals

in local markets may have been largely unchanged if at the same time

information from other markets were available more rapidly, shocks from the

outside world impinged more quickly as well. For example, in the (pre—

telegraph) Panic of 1837 the wave of suspension of specie payments in local

banks radiating outward from New York reached Boston in two days, Pittsburgh

in five days, Detroit in seven days, and St. Louis in twelve days (Pred, 1973,

pp. 250—252). In contrast, during the Panic of 1873 suspension in other

financial centers followed that in New York almost immediately (Sprague, 1910,

p. 62).

      In addition, the variance of the general price level, cr2, which also

affects a2, may have changed over the nineteenth century as well. The period

before the Civil War was marked by a bimetallic monetary standard, while from
                                               — 12 —




the Civil War until Resumption in 1879 the United States was on a fiat
standard with floating exchange rates (the Greenback Era). In 1879 the

monetary regime was switched to the gold standard. Even though the mean of

the distribution of the log of the price level changed little between the

antebellum and postbellum periods, the degree of unpredictability decreased

substantially —           the   variance of residuals from the price forecasting equation

(log of prices regressed on two lagged values) declined from .278 for the

1841—60 period to .011 for 1871—1900, a shift that is             significant   at the 1


percent      level •17 The price level variance 2 should be inversely related
to         from (5)   -   the higher the variance in the general price level, the less
      a2

favorable      the tradeoff will be.'8 Thus, a decrease in price level variability

or unpredictability resulting from the transition to convertibility (over the

1870's) and the adoption of the gold standard (after 1879) would have pushed

the    a2 coefficient upward, contrary to the influences of improved
transportation and communications.
           The econometric evidence indicates that the price-surprise coefficient is

roughly stable over the 1840—1900 period, but at the same time the cyclical

price and output gap change data (Tables I and II) indicate a trend toward

increased cyclical price rigidity (or a smaller output response to price

changes) in the nineteenth as well as in the twentieth century. Such a trend

was not due to a change in a2 but rather in the lagged output gap coefficient

a,.

           In Table IV the shift in a1 is clear. The estimated coefficient which

had been relatively small in magnitude and not statistically significantly

different from zero in the period before the Civil-War became much larger and

statistically significant in the period after the Civil War. The regressions

at the bottom of Table IV confirm this change, showing increases in the
                                     — 13 —




 magnitude of the estimated a1 coefficients and their associated t statistics

 as the sample period is extended into the postbeilum era. The influence of

 the lagged output gap on the current gap appeared to be growing between 1840

 and 1900. During a downturn, for example, the lagged effect of actual output

 falling below potential output would pull current output farther below

 potential than would have been predicted earlier. ceteris paribus. In other

words, increased inertia in the economy or increased persistence effects of

the.deviation of output from its potential level was responsible for the
                            -          10
apparent increase in cyclical rigidity.

     Explanations for this rise in the importance of lagged effects must

remain primarily speculative here, but some possibilities may be identified.

The first is based on the dramatic increase in the rates of savings and

investment in the nineteenth-century United States. Over the middle third of

the century the share of capital formation in gross national product

approximately doubled.2° This sharp rise in the investment rate by itself

could have played an important role in magnifying persistence effects over

time periods if it takes some time to build new capital goods (Kydland and

Prescott, 1982). Also, multiplier effects could amplify and draw out the

influence of changes in the higher level of investment.

     Another possible explanation is based on the increased specialization in

the U.S. economy and within manufacturing in particular. With the growth of

the manufacturing sector both capital and labor were applied to increasingly

specialized tasks. Over the nineteenth century, the use of skilled as opposed

to unskilled labor increased dramatically (Williamson and Lindert, 1980).

While unskilled workers may have found it relatively easy to move from one

industry to another, skilled workers were probably much less mobile across

industries at least in the short term. Much of the accumulated human capital
                                   - 14 -


may have been relatively task specific and hence not readily transferable into

other industries. Similarly, machines cane to be designed for increasingly

specialized purposes as well. Rosenberg (1976, pp. 9—31) describes the trend

toward greater specialization in the machine tool industry, for example, and

observes that 'by 1880 the proliferation of new machine tools in American

industry had begun to reach torrential proportionsH (p. 24). If both labor

and capital had been becoming more 'fixed" or industry—specific over time, the

economy would have adjusted more slowly to demand shocks. The growth of the

railroad expanded geographical markets and facilitated interregional factor

mobility, but at the same time increased human capital accumulation and

specialization may have raised the barriers to intersectoral or interindustry

mobility. As a result, the degree of inertia or persistence in the economy

nay also have increased.




                                    III.




     Even though the direction of the long—term trend in the Phillips curve

relationship has remained unchanged in the United States from at least 1840

onward——toward larger output changes in response to a given change in

unanticipated inflation——there appears to be a distinct difference between the

nineteenth and twentieth century experience. While the twentieth cehtury

shows a pronounced trend toward greater cyclical price rigidity, in the sense

that a given rise in unemployment is associated with smaller and smaller

reductions in inflation than in the past, in the period between 1840 and 1900

the change in the expectational Phillips curve tradeoff was so small that the

relationship could he judged to have been a roughly stable one.2' This
                                      — 15




 relatively stable relationship persists even after taking possible changes in

 the nature of shocks to the economy into account. The inclusion of a supply-

 shock variable, relative agricultural prices, does not significantly affect

 the estimated coefficients in the aggregate supply function.22

      This essential stability of the price—surprise coefficient is

 particularly noteworthy in view of the rapid expansion of the telegraph and

 railroad after 1840, which by improving information flows should have led to a

 steeper Phillips curve. Suppliers were less likely to be fooled into

 changing output in response to a change in the aggregate price level. Since

 a2 did not fall, other factors must have offset the influences of improved

 information flows. It is possible that the net effects of such improvements

may have been small because shocks as well as new information were able to

spread more rapidly. Another counteracting effect on a2 may have been the

decreased variability of the general price level resulting from the move to

the gold standard. Sufficient information on the functioning of nineteenth—

century labor markets is not available to assess whether there were

substantial changes in the nature and extent of implicit contracting (in turn

affecting a2), but it is a possibility in view of the dramatic changes in

labor force composition over the period.

     The trend toward greater cyclical price rigidity over the nineteenth

century observed in the pattern of price and output gap changes over

successive business cycles therefore were not so much the result of a shift in

the output response to unanticipated inflation but rather of the increased

influence of the lagged output gap on current output. The degree of inertia

or persistence in the economy increased markedly over the per'iod due perhaps

to the sharp rise in the investment share of GNP or increased specialization
                                     — 16 —




in   the economy which made adjustment to shocks and intersectoral mobility more

difficult.

      The movement toward a substantially flatter Phillips curve relationship

(larger a2) whichappears characteristic of recent experience therefore does

not seem to have been true for the earlier period. It in fact then is

essentially a twentieth century phenomenon. Sachs (1980, pp. 87-88)

emphasizes the influence of countercyclical macroeconomic policy and the

spread   of long—term wage contracts particularly after World War II in reducing
cyclical   flexibility. However, Spencer (1977) finds a significant decrease in

downward cyclical flexibility of individual prices from industries

experiencing increases in concentration over the late nineteenth and early

twentieth century. Perhaps the merger wave and attendent increases in

industrial concentration should be accorded more attention in studies of

increases in cyclical rigidity.
                                 Data Appendix



      The annual real output series used here developed by Robert Gailman is

 unpublished but well known.23 Beginning in the mid 1830's, there is a gap

 over the decade of the 1860's. The years before 1859, which were Census years

 in the original series, have been interpolated into calendar years. A

potential difficulty with this series for measuring cyclical fluctuations is

that it omits changes in inventories. Evidence for the post—World War I

period suggests that inventory fluctuations are very significant in business

cycles (Abrarnovitz, 1950; Blinder and Holtz—Eakin, 1984). Neglecting

inventory shifts then would understate the degree of output variability in the

nineteenth century. Data are not available to measure these inventory shifts

directly, while contradictory influences make it difficult to puzzle out the

relative degree of nineteenth—century inventory fluctuations. On the nne

hand, improvements in communications and transportation, particularly the

railroad, have been widely argued to have reduced the level of inventory

holdings substantially, and thus the ratio of inventories to GNP (Du Boff,

1983). On the other hand, the shift in inventory composition away from farm

to more manufacturing over the period may have increased total variability.

     Kuznets' solution to this problem involved simply projecting a regression

line between annual inventory change on annual commodity output change for the

interwar period back to the nineteenth century and calculating fitted values

(1961, p. 601; also Kendrick, 1961, p. 277). This method, of course, does not

capture any effects from structural change that may have been occurring. This

measure of inventory change in turn was incorporated into Friedman and

Schwartz's income estimates which begin in 1869 (1982, p. 100). However,

estimating the aggregate supply curve (3) over the postbellum period with the
Friedman and Schwartz real income figures produced results very similar to

those from the regressions based on the Gallnan series. For example, the

Friedman and Schwartz price—surprise coefficient, a2, differed from the

reported one by only +.f)45, or less than 10 percent, with compa-rable t

statistics. The degree to which a2 is underestimated because the omission of

inventory shifts understates output variability appears quite small, at least

based on the Kuznets estimate of inventory changes. The Kuznets adjustment

for inventory changes therefore would not appear to imply a different pattern

of results or conclusions from those in the paper based on the Gailman series.

     Alternative series do not appear to be superior to the Gailman one in

measuring output fluctuations. In particular, Romer (1984) has argued that

the Frickey index of industrial production (1947) exaggerates the volatility

of the pre-World War I economy. Such a measure may not be an accurate

reflection of changes in aggregate output in any case in view of the

substantial   sectoral shift in the distribution of output that was taking place
over the period, with the share of agriculture in national income falling from

26 to 15 percent, and that of manufacturing and mining was rising from 14 to

25 percent over the second half of the nineteenth century. Furthermore, the

Gallman measure has the advantage of extending back into the antebellum

period, which is especially interesting because of the spread of the telegraph

and the railroad, while neither the Friedman and Schwartz income series nor

the Frickey industrial production index go back before the Civil War.

     There was considerable variation in the rate of growth of real output

across subperiods between 1840 and 1900 (Abramovitz and David, 1973, p. 431),

so a simple time trend is not a satisfactory measure of the growth of

potential output over the period. The potential output series used in the
 regressions is built up from constructed annual series for capital, labor, and

 land.

         Annual real capital stock figures were based on Davis and Gailman's

 Census year capital—output ratios (1973, p. 457) and Gallman's annual gross

 capital formation series. Using Census year capital stock figures as

benchmarks, one may solve for average decadal depreciation rates and thus for

an annual capital stock series. Davis and Gallman (1973, pp. 463—466) show

that capital stock figures calculated from investment flows are quite close to

those from Census year benchmarks so that the capital stock and flow data,

even though they come from different sources, are reasonably consistent and

combining them, as is done here, is basically legitimate.24 The Davis and

Galiman capital—output ratio estimates run from 1840 to 1900, which limits the

time period for the regressions to those dates. In any case, the Gallman real

output series extends only a few years earlier, into the mid 1830's.

     Estimates of land inputs are calculated from Davis and Gailman's

estimates of capital plus land-output ratios for Census years (p. 457) and

then interpolated. Labor force figures are constructed from annual population

estimates (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, p. 8) and Lebergott's estimates of

the labor force by Census years (Lehergott, 1964, p. 510). There were

dramatic changes in the size of relative factor shares over this period, with

the capital share rising from .27 to .37 between the 1834/36-1853/57 and the

1888/92—1903/07 periods, while the labor share fell from .62 to .54, so

clearly constant factor shares can not be assumed. Instead, time series for

the factor shares__L, Kt' and $T__are constructed by interpolating between

midpoints of David's 15 year periods (1977, p. 189). Technical progress, the

change in the efficiency parameter At, is captured by a time trend in the
               25
regressions.
     An alternative measure of potential output derived from projecting from a

benchmark year of full employment along a trend rate of growth may also be

constructed. In this case, estimates of y are projected forward from the

base year of 1834 using growth rates interpolated from David's period

estimates of growth in real product (1977, p. 189). This estimate is used in

calculating the output gap changes in Tables I and II, and IA and hA, because

we don't know the values of At in our first measure of potential output. The

same pattern of regression results remain if the trend growth rate projected

measure is used as y. with a2   increasing   somewhat from .5977 to .8411 between

the antebellum and postbellum periods.

     The price level is measured by the Warren-Pearson index of wholesale

prices (1933, pp. 25—27). The underlying data for the series are primarily

price quotations from New York markets. Changes in the degree of local price

variability across regions therefore are not captured directly in the price

series. While changes in price variability across products may be reflected

in the index, the influence of increasing integration of geographical markets

is reflected only in so far as it affects local price variability in New

York. However, the alternative price index spanning the period, the David and

Solar cost—of—living index of retail prices (1977, p. 21) is based on retail

price quotations from only Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and thus its

geographical coverage is only slightly greater than the Warren—Pearson.

     The degree of variability in the wholesale price index is significantly

greater than in the David and Solar consumer price index (David and Solar,

1977, pp. 20-21). For one thing, rent enters the index with a fairly large

weight (17.7 percent for 1851—1880), and such prices are likely to be rather

sticky in the short run (p. 55). Moreover, if the retail price markup adjusts

only slowly with a lag to changes in the wholesale market (pp. 52—55), the
degree of variability in retail prices will he reduced for that reason as

well.     It would seem that the wholesale price index would be the one more

relevant to suppliers in making output decisions, so we shall choose the

Warren—Pearson index for this paper.26 Ideally, we might prefer a GNP

deflator series as the measure of        but one is not available for this

pen od.

        As for the other instrumental variables, government expenditures are

taken as the sum of federal outlays (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, p. 1114)

and total state and local government expenditures (Davis and Legler, 1966),

which constituted a substantial part of the total in the nineteenth century.

Estimates of the money and specie stocks for the antebellum period are from

Stevens (1971); for the postheilum period they are taken from Friedman and

Schwartz (1970). Finally, exports are taken from (U.S. Bureau of the Census,

1975, pp. 864—865).
                                       Notes



1,     Gordon (1980), who finds a stable relation over the period, is one

exception to this generalization, but his estimates are not based on the

expectational Phillips curve specification. Wachter (1976) finds au contraire

increasing cyclical responsiveness in wages in the postwar period, but Sachs

(pp. 82—84) argues that his equations were misestimated.

2.     Lipsey (1960, p. 27) also identifies a shift in the relationship in the

U.K.   in the first part of the twentieth—century, around World War I - 'The
post-1922 experience was of less flexibility of wages in response to excess

demand, whether positive or negative, than occurred in the pre-1914 period."

3.     This classification scheme follows Sachs (1980, p. 81). However, the

classifications of the cycles themselves may differ because his criterion is

the change in the gap between actual and the trend level of industrial

production rather than between actual and potential real output. For example,

the contraction of 1902—1904 which Sachs classes as moderate is identified

here as mild; the downturn of 1918—19, labeled as strong by Sachs, is moderate

here. The measure of potential output used here is described in the Data

Appendix.

4.     The Gailman GNP figures for the nineteenth century omit inventories.

Since inventory fluctuations may have been significant over business cycles,

output fluctuations will be understated (see the discussion in the

Appendix). Also, to the extent that the derivation of the annual series

involved some interpolation some high frequency variability will be lost and

annual output variability understated.

5.     x   (2) = 8.88, which is significant at the 5 percent level. The estimated
coefficients for the time periods are 2.37, .73, and -2.31 respectively. A
 similar grouping for inflation rate changes as the dependent variable shows

 the same pattern of decreasing coefficients, but is not statistically

 significant by the likelihood ratio test.

 6.   Moreover, in Gordon's gradual price adjustment equation estimated on

quarterly data for the 1892—1929 period, the closest we can come to the

nineteenth century, the mean lag of past inflation variables was less than a

year and the coefficient of the lagged difference between actual and potential

output was quite small (.02). (Gordon, 1982, p. 1104)

7.    In addition, adding lagged fiscal and monetary variables, such as

government expenditures or the money supply, to the price forecasting equation

makes very little difference to the reported results.

8.    Minor variations in the list of instruments, such as replacing the money

stock by the specie stock or adding some international variables (see James,

1984, pp. 198—199) made no essential difference in the results.

9.    Perhaps   it   should be reiterated here that because the dependent variable

may understate the true level of output variability, the estimate of a2 here
may be a hit too low. See note 4.

10. Their specification however differs from the one used here. They use

unanticipated price change as the dependent variable and unanticipated money

stock change and the output gap as independent variables. On the other hand,

in this aggregate supply function and also in the relationship studied by

Irving Fisher (1926) on early twentieth—century data the output gap is taken

as the dependent variable.

11. Using relative agricultural prices as a measure of supply shocks would be

appropriate in a closed economy, but the nineteenth-century United States was

a significant exporter of agricultural products. In that case, high foreign

demand could lead to high relative farm prices, but it would be caused by a
demand rather than supply shock. Therefore exports as a percentage of GNP can

be included in our supply shock variable with a negative sign, ZZt
                                                                     = Zt —

x/y,     to reduce foreign demand influences. The new variable should respond

primarily to domestic supply shocks. However, when such a variable was

included in the aggregate supply curve, its coefficient also was not

significantly different from zero, and the estimates of the other coefficients

were not significantly different from those reported in Table II. The

conclusion reached in the text still appears to stand and is consistent with

Teniin's argument that the antebellum business cycle was driven by demand

shocks (1974).

      Alternative measures, the relative price of farm products or the rate of

change of food prices, relative to the wholesale price index, (Warren and

Pearson, 1933, pp. 25—27), made no significant difference to the reported

results.

12. This procedure is described in more detail in Gordon (1982, pp. 1096—

1097, 1099).

13.    In his estimates of the output—inflation tradeoff for the nineteenth—

century United States, Easton (1984, p. 526) finds a similar upward shift in

the   price—surprise coefficient.
14. A test for a shift in the pattern of price forecasting over the two
suhperiods cannot reject the null hypothesis of stability. The test statistic
F(2, 53) = 1.03 was much less than the critical value of 4.08 at the 5 percent
level.
15.    The decadal variance in the 1860's however actually increased, presumably

due   to the Civil War.
16.    It should perhaps be noted that the influence of the spread of the

telegraph in lowering the cost of obtaining price information from other
 markets is not captured explicitly in the specification of the price

 forecasting equation based on lagged general price level changes, and it is

 not clear how it should he modeled. One possibility is adding a time trend to

-theequation to represent improvements in the forecast over time due to

 increased information availability. In that case, the level, patterns of

 shift, and t statistics of the price—surprise coefficients in equation (3)

 remain essentially the same as those reported in the text. Rather

interestingly the time trend coefficient in the forecasting equation is

significantly different from zero in the antebellum period when telegraph and

rail systems were expanding rapidly, but not in the postbellum period under

the gold standard. The coefficient was also not significant when the equation

was estimated over the whole period.

17. The test statistic F(20,30) = 25.49 is much larger than the 1 percent

significance level, 2.77. Comparing the entire antebellum period, 1801—60,

with the 1871—1900 produces an even greater decline in variance, and omitting

the years during and after the War of 1812 does not alter the results.

Similarly, adding a time trend to the regression (in order to allow for a

change in the mean over time) does not affect the results either.

18. The larger the shocks to the economy as evidenced in the degree of price

level variability, the more incentive there is to distinguish between the

nominal and real components of any nominal income change (Aiberro, 1981, p.

248). Cukierman (1979) suggests that as 2 falls, individuals need to sample

price information in fewer other markets, so changes in n reinforce the effect

of changes in c2 on a2 for a given technology.

19. This increased lag implies that the total effect of a price surprise on

output would have risen significantly over the nineteenth century even though

the contemporaneous effect remained roughly stable. The total multiplier of
the price surprise, a2/(1 —           increased by 300 percent between the
                               a1),
antebellum and posthellum periods.

20.   In the 1839—1848 decade capital formation constituted an 11—12 percent

share of GNP, while by 1879-1888 it had increased to 19 percent, and to 20—22

percent by 1889—1898. (Davis and Gallman, 1973, P. 439)

21. Data limitations unfortunately prevent the period from being extended

earlier than 1840, but the early part of the century is a very interesting

period as wel 1.   Even without technol ogi cal changes as   dramatic as the

telegraph and the railroad, there appear to have been significant improvements

in information flows. Rothenberg, for example, in her study of Massachusetts

farmers (1981, pp. 300-305) finds pronounced declines in the coefficient of

variation over time for many crops, even early in the century when no

important transport innovations had yet occurred. Pred (1973, pp. 20-77)

finds a substantial decline in time lag of public information disseniation

among cities before 1840 based on examinations of local newspapers. In

addition if observations before 1840 had been available, we would have been

able to observe the effects on the aggregate supply function of a dramatic

change in information technology. Quite suggestively, David and Solar (1977,

p. 30) find a marked dampening in the amplitude of short-term cycles in their

change in labor—cost of living series. While many of the peak and trough

rates of change were greater than +10 or —10 percent per annum before 1840,

the fluctuations in subsequent years were significantly smaller.

22. Structural change in the economy may affect the nature of the shocks. As

the economy moved over time from an emphasis on agriculture to relatively more

emphasis on manufacturing, the nature of shocks to the economy may have

changed also — from supply shocks, where price and output changes are

inversely related, associated with agriculture (bad harvests), to demand
shocks, where price and output changes are positively related, more associated

with manufacturing. If this had been the case and price and output changes

were becoming more and more positively associated, then a2 would have been

forced up over time due to structural change. We may reject this possibility

however because including a variable to capture the influence of supply shocks

explicitly left the other coefficients essentially unaffecteth

23. Obtained through private correspondence from Robert E. Gallman.

24. A bit more evidence and detail on this point is available in James (1984,

p. 211).

25. However, the changes in relative factor shares in fact suggest that

technical change may have actually been more complex than the neutral

specification postulated here. See David (1977).

26. However, the David and Solar consumer price index produces roughly the

same pattern of regression results. Since the variance o the index is

smaller than that of the Warren-Pearson series the estimated a2 coefficients

are larger.

of the price index from peak to trough.
        GAP is measured as the difference in the logarithms of actual real
output and full employment output. The change in GAP therefore is the
difference betwee its values at the peak and trough of the cycle,
LGAP = GAP — GAP . This procedure follows Sachs (1980, p. 81), although he
measures deviations in industrial production rather than in real output. As a
result, the two measures of cyclical severity are not strictly comparable.
The cycles are grouped according to degrees of cyclical severity here as well,
but the criteria are somewhat different: Mild contactions —5 < zGAPx100;
                                           —
Moderate contractions, —10 < AGAPx100 < -5; Severe contractions,
tGAPx1O0 < -10.
