                       Monetary vs. Fiscal Policy Effects:
                             A Review of the Debate

                                     ABSTRACT




        This   paper     reviews   empirical findings,     econometric issues,        and

   theoretical results bearing upon the "monetary vs. fiscal policy" debate that

   began with the 1963 Friedrnan—Meiselman study.                The main substantive

   conclusions are not very dramatic.        The clearest is that an open-market

   increase in the money stock has a stimulative effect on aggregate demand, a

   conclusion that. in turn implies that a money-financed increase In government

   expenditures (or reduction in taxes) is more stimulative than it would be if

   bond financed.      This conclusion is based on empirical results obtained from

   St. Louis—type estimates and large scale economebic models and is supported by

theoretical    analysis involving both Ricardian and non—Ricardian assumptions.

        In the case of pure fiscal policy actions -—     i.e.,   bond-financed tax cuts

   or bond—financed expenditure increases --     theory suggests that the latter
   should be at least as stimulative as the former and probably to a positive

   extent; evidence is mixed but not obviously inconsistent with       this   prediction.

        With respect to the textbook issue concerning the relative effects of

   pure monetary and fiscal actions, the evidence seems to support the notion

   that a sequence of $k open-market purchases, one each period, will be much

   more stimulative than a single but unreversed $k/period bond—financed increase

   in expenditures. The importance of this last issue is debatable.

I.   Introduction

     The "monetary vs. fiscal policy" debate has not attracted much attention

in recent years, and in some ways that is not to be regretted.         It may

therefore be useful to begin this discussion with a quote from Phillip Cagan

(1978, pp. 85—6):



          Jo one who was not in touch with the economics profession in
      the 1940s and 1950s can quite imagine the state of thinking then
      in the profession at large on monetary theory and policy. The
      quantity of money was not considered important, indeed was hardly
      worth mentioning, for questions of aggregate demand, unemployment,
      and even inflation . . . . Textbooks in basic economics and even
      in money and banking mentioned the quantity theory of money, if at
      all, only to hold it up to ridicule. Those textbooks produced an
      entire cohort of professional economists who became the teachers
      of hordes of economics students.     There were, of ourse, many
      exceptions, most notably at the University of Chicago . . . . But
      if you travelled among the profession at large, mention of the
      quantity of money elicited puzzled glances of disbelief or sly
      smiles of condescension.


     s a former member of the horde of students that Cagan refers to, I would

modify his statement only by suggesting that the period in question lasted

longer than he indicates. For readers who find this claim hard to believe, I

would suggest perusal of the contents of the Anerican Economic Association's

Readings in Business Cycles, published in 1965 (Gordon and Kein, 1965).

Another interesting record is provided by the chapter on inflation in Ackley

(1961), the standard graduate macro text of the 1960's. Ackley begins with a

brief description of the "Classical school" theory whereby inflation depends
                                           2




                                           of money, but quickly moves on to other
primarily upon growth of the quantity
         1
ideas.

     Today, of course, matters are different.           There are few economists who

                                                                 macroecoflOmiStS hold
would label themselves "monetarists", but most publishing
                                                                                    in
views that would have been two standard deviations away from the mean --

the monetarist direction --   in   1965.       As one piece of evidence in support of

                                                         (i.e., list of variables) of
that claim, I would point to the specifications

vector autoregression (VAR) models currently being used for forecasting and/or

analysis.
               In particular, the VAR systems of Sims (1980)(1982), Litterrnan

(1982), Gordon and King (1982), Webb (198), and B. M. Friedman (1Y8) all

include monetary aggregates but no fiscal variables.

     Both sides in the debate can of course claim victory; the monetary policy

supporters for the reasons implicit in the foregoing comparison, and the
                                                       evidence which indicates that
fiscal policy supporters by citing theory and

fiscal actions are not without effect on aggregate demand. But the shift has

certainly been in favor of the former.

         The purpose of this paper is to review developments bearing on this

debate over the last twenty years. To describe all of the significant items

 in the literature would require a paper of' inordinate length and one that

 would be extremely dull for the participants at this conference, most of whom

 are intimately familiar with much of the material. Fortunately, it turns out




     1Another interesting sign of the times is provided by Michael Parkin's
 first notable publication (Lipsey and Parkin, 1970),
                                                         which centers on a
 "prototype model" of the wage and price inflation  process. The model's two
 endogenous variables are the money wage and the  price level; its exogenous
                                                                       and a
 variables are import prices, output/manhour, the unemployment rate,
 measure of trade union aggressiveness.  Unless  I am  mistaken, there is no
 mention of' "money" in the entire paper. This example will be appreciated most
 by those of us who know and admire Parkin's later work as a monetary
 economist.

to   be unnecessary for me to provide an extensive treatment of the main threads

of the argument, for a careful review was published fairly recently by eyer

and Rasche (1980).    I will be able, then, to pass quickly through the well-

known items and arguments and focus my attention on items that (i) have been

neglected, (ii) are fairly recent, or (iii) are somewhat original.          The

organization of the paper is very simple:        Section II is concerned with

empirical studies and econometric points of' interpretation while Section III

discusses some of the main theoretical issues.         In addition, Section IV

provides some tentative conclusions and judgments.
II. Empirical Results and Econometric Issues

11.1     Single-Equation Results

       In discussing the empirical analysis and related issues, it will be

convenient to organize the discussion around the results that have been

featured in a long series of articles prepared by the research department of

the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.2         Brief mention should be made,

however, of the earlier paper by Friedman and Meiselman (1963), which is not

discussed by Meyer and Rasche.

       The central ingredient of the Friedman-Meiselman study was a comparison

of simple correlations (based on annual U.S. data for 1897-1958 and

subperiods) of consumption with money stock magnitudes, on the one hand, and

consumption with "autonomous" fiscal variables,3 on the other hand. Friedman

and Meiselman found that movements in consumption were more highly correlated

with monetary than with fiscal variations.     Their own summary statement goes

as follows:



            The results are strikingly one—sided.    Except for the early
        years of the Great Depression, money .  . is
                                                .     more closely related
        to consumption than is autonomous expenditures . . . . This is so
        both for nominal values . . . and for "real" values . . . . It  is
        true both for absolute values and for year-to-year or quarter-to-
        quarter changes. Such correlation as there is between autonomous
        expenditures and consumption is in the main a disguised reflection
        of' the common effect of money on both . .




    2The original paper was Andersen and Jordan (1968), soon followed by
Andersen and Carison (1970)(1972). Other notable items in the series include
Carison (1978), Hafer (1982), and Batten and Thornton (1983).

       3Friedman and Meiselman used M2 as their monetary variable and defined
autonomous expenditures as "net private domestic investment plus the
government deficit on income and product account plus the net foreign balance"
(1963, p. 18L).   They also calculated partial correlations and devoted some
attention to quarterly data.
          One implication of the results is that the critical variable
      for monetary policy is the stock of money, not interest rates or
      investment expenditures (1963, p. 166).


    Given the climate described by Cagan, the central role of the consumotio

function in Keynesian analysis, and some questionable methodology, the

Friedman-Meiseirnan study was welcomed by the profession about like an

unexpected slap in the face.     Strongly critical studies were published by

Hester (19614), Pndo and Modigliani (1965), and DePrano and Mayer (1965).

Strongly worded replies and rejoinders followed promptly and at great length.

     It is clear that the Friedman-Meiselman approach was in fact open to

several methodological objections.   Its critics emphasized the questionable

nature of the measure used for autonomous expenditures as well as the

delineation of sample subperiods.    Especially troublesome was the focus on

contemporaneous relationships in single regression equations including only

one or two explanatory variables.          Most researchers in macroeconomics

believed, I would guess, that investigation of the issues under discussion

could be adequately carried out only in the context of a fully-specified,

simultaneous-equation econometric model.    The judgment of Blinder and Solow,

expressed a few years later, was that "all          of' this was essentially

pointless. The issue is simply not to be settled by comparing goodness of' fit

of one—equation models that are far too primitive to represent any theory

adequately" (19714, p. 65).

     Thus the Friedman—Meiselman results were in the process of being shrugged

off when the first of the St. Louis studies -—     that   of Andersen and Jordan

(1968) -—   appeared.   As is very well known, that study featured a least—

squares regression fit to quarterly U.S. data for 1952.1-1968.2 in which the

dependent variable was the change in nominal GMP while the explanatory

variables were current and lagged values of changes in the money stock (1 or
                                                6



                                                                                         The
base),   full-employment expenditures, and full-employment tax receipts.

striking finding was that the sum of coefficients on the monetary variable was

highly significant while the sum of coefficients on both fiscal variables was

insignificantly different from         zero.

11.2 Econometric Objections

      Again sharply critical objections were raised.                     The main lines of

argument were brought together by Blinder and Solow (1974) and are nicely

reviewed by Meyer and Rasche (180).                 My strategy here will be to focus on

three points emphasized by Blinder—Solow (see below) and on the evidence

concerning reliability of' "reduced form" procedures that was subsequently

described by Modigliani and Ando (1976).                  It will be convenient, though, to

begin by quickly mentioning the observation of Benjamin Friedman (1977) that

when data for the period 1970.1—1976.2 is added to the Andersen-Carlson (1970)

sample, the sum of the fiscal variable coefficients becomes significantly

positive.     It was quickly shown by Carison (1978), however, that this

conclusion does not obtain when the variables are entered in rate-of-chang.e

form, rather than as first differences.                    In effect, Carlson's suggested

specification amount to



                      +            +            +
(1)
                          $(L)Am       i(L)Ag       ut,


where       mt, and       are logarithms of nominal GNP, a money stock measure, and

a fiscal variable (respectively).           Also Ut       15 a   stochastic disturbance while

 8(L) and L) denote finite polynomials in the lag operator defined by




     An interesting predecessor of the Andersen-Jordan study, which probably
influenced the latter, is Brunner and Balbach (1959).

  Lnlx
              x         ,    so   that   8(L)Am stands for a distributed lag such as
                  t—n
          +
                  im1 +           ... + Bkmk.    Carison's specification not only has the

 desirable feature of relating relative rather than absolute changes, but also

 leads to residuals that are more consistent with the standard assumption that

 ut is a white-noise disturbance.5 Consequently, (1) seems preferable to the

 specification used previously, and this judgment leads to the conclusion that

 the inclusion of data for years since 1969 does not reverse the original

 finding that the sum of the                    coefficients is insignificantly different
 from zero.                 In what follows I will accordingly presume that (1) is the
 relevant specification.

     Let us now consider, then, the criticisms of Blinder and Solow (19714).

Those writers summarize their position very concisely, as follows:



             In summary, the Andersen-Jordan study errs for at least three
         reasons, any one of which is sufficient to render their results
         meaningless.   First, by omitting all exogenous variables other
         than fiscal or monetary policy, they seriously misspecify the
         reduced-form equation for real [sic] output   . . . Second, they
                                                              .


         use an incorrect measure of fiscal policy, which biases the
         coefficient toward zero. Finally, and most damaging to their
         position, they treat fiscal and monetary policies as exogenous
         when it is intuitively obvious that the authorities are in some
         sense reacting to movements in the macroeconomy (19714, pp. 70-71).


    These three difficulties correspond to those discussed by Meyer and Rasche

on pp. 56-63 and to those listed by Batten and Thornton (1983, n. 2). We will

take them in turn, starting with the omission of exogenous variables. In this

case the contention is that the true specification is not (1) but




    5Carlson (1978) indicates that the relative change specification passes,
and the absolute change specification fails, tests for the                   absence of
disturbance heteroschedasticity.

where Zt is an additional variable6 that has an important influence on ye,.

For the moment, let us suppose that mt and                                    are in fact exogenous, a

supposition that will be considered below, in connection with the third

difficulty. Now Blinder and Solow refer to Zt as an exogenous variable. But

the conditions for true statistical exogeneity are extremely stringent -— Zt

must be generated by a process that is independent of current and past values

        (and thus Ut). But it is hard to imagine any important macroeconomic

variable that is truly exogenous in that sense; even population growth and

technical change probably respond (with lags) to fluctuations in GNP.7 The

point is better expressed, then, as suggesting that (2) is applicable but with

         interpreted       as   an           endogenous variable               that   is affected   by

            and         only with a lag. Suppose that relation is

      60r variables. My discussion proceeds as if only one such variable were
omitted solely for convenience of exposition.

      7The impact of variables that follow smooth exponential trends is, of
course, picked up by the constant term. This was noted (for linear trends) by
Andersen and Jordan (1968).

which is not in the form of (2) because of' the appearance of a1(L)yi.

That can be remedied, however, by moving the                                      term to the left-hand-

side and multiplying through by [1 -                      La1(L)]1:

Here we have a relation of the form of (2), but (of course) with disturbances

and parameters that are quite different:

What we have in (5), is not a reduced—form equation but a final-form equation

for         (still assuming that                      and          are truly exogenous).8

      Thus we see that the coefficients in (5), which will be estimated by the

St. Louis procedure, are not the reduced-form coefficients in (1).                                        The

estimated values will, under the assumption that (L)                                     0   in (2) and that

is quite unclear; the coefficients in a reduced-form equation like (1) also

reflect influences that are "indirect".          The first problem mentioned by

                                                         the St. Louis estimates

"meaningless". It merely implies that. in interpreting the estimates it may

necessary to keep in mind that they reflect "indirect" effects.9

    The foregoing argument presumes,            it should be added, that the

relationship (3) is "stable" --   i.e.,   unchanging over the sample period. Such

relationships may in fact change significantly over real-time sample periods,

for reasons explained by Lucas (1976) or for other reasons. But precisely the

same must be said for (1); these two relationships are on the same footing in

                If' there is reason to believe that (1) is stable over a period,
that respect.

there is no particular reason to expect (3) to be shifting.

     Let us turn next to the second of the Blinder-Solow (197U) points, that

the St. Louis measures of fiscal policy may be "incorrect". What is meant by

that is that the St Louis variable does not correspond to the "weighted

standardized surplus" shown by Blinder and Solow (1974, pp. 23, 33—34) to be

the measure that would appear in a reduced-form expression within the

particular model that they use for illustrative purposes.           But this is a

conclusive criticism only to one who has some attachment to the particular

model in question,1° and then only if he believes that the effect of using

 alternative measures would be large.          While Corrigan (1970) found that a

 specific measure, which Blinder and Solow      consider reasonably attractive, led

 to estimates indicating a significant fiscal effect, it is my impression that




     9This point was made by Andersen-Jordan (1968), Darby (1976), and probably
 others.  It will arise again in the discussion of the Modigliani-AndO (1976)
 results.

the    variable—measurement problem      is   not of overwhelming        importance

empirically. Or, to put it differently, if there is a fiscal policy measure

which carries a strongly significant sum of coefficients in an equation of the

St. Louis form, its existence has not been well publicised.1 In any event,

analysis of the policy-variable measurement issue is undermined by the third

problem discussed by Blinder and Solow, to which we now turn.

      The issue in this case results from the endogeneity of policy actions, a

topic that was investigated in detail by Goldfeld and Blinder (1972).          The

Goldfeld—Blinder   paper     correctly emphasizes    the   distinction     between

exogerieity, in the sense of coming from outside the private sector of the

economy, and exogeneity in the statistical sense.     And they note that it is

almost inconceivable that either the monetary or fiscal variables in the St.

Louis studies could be exogenous in the latter sense, for that would imply

that the authorities' actions are not systematically influenced to any

significant extent by current or past macroeconomic conditions.       If in fact

the authorities' actions are so influenced, then (1) may not be a proper

reduced-form equation even if no variables are omitted.        In particular, the

disturbance term Ut   will   be correlated with regressor variables if policy

actions respond to current-quarter conditions or if policy responds with a lag

but the disturbance in (1) is autocorrelated. Under such circumstances, least

squares estimates of         B(L) and y(L)    will of course     be biased and
inconsistent.




      11Meyer and Rasehe (1980, p. 59) conclude their discussion of this
measurement issue as follows:    "However, the modifications . . . have not
generally resulted in dramatic changes in sample reduced-form equations."
                                       12




    This point is clearly correct in principle and could easily be of
                               The nunthers reported in Goldfeld and Blinder's
importance empirically.12
                                              bias should be about the same for

for the U.S. economy.

     Nevertheless, the point is important enough to warrant continued

discussion. Given that the policy authorities do respond to current or recent

macroeconomic conditions, the best way to proceed in estimating equations like

(1) or (5) is to append policy—rule or reaction—function specifications for

the authorities and carry out simultaneous equation estimation, as recommended

by Goldfeld and Blinder.       But it is not necessari to formulate explicitly

variable (IV)

Comparisons of' IV and OLS results should indicate whether severe biases are in

fact induced by the reactive behavior of the policy authorities.

     The results of an extremely brief and tentative exploration of that type

 are reported in Table 1.         The first pair of numerical columns gives

 coefficient and standard error values for an OLS regression of the form of

 (5), using quarterly data on nominal GNP,     the Ml money supply, and nominal

 federal purchases of goods and services for 195'4-1980. Despite the absence of

 polynomial constraints and the use of a different expenditure variable, the

strong sign of serially correlated disturbances, these estimates should be

consistent for the parameters of (5) even in the presence of current-period

responses of Am and           to values of Ay or other endogenous variables.

As is readily apparent, there are two major differences in these estimates as

compared to OLS. First, the coefficients attached to current-period values of

     and      are much smaller, with the latter turning negative. Second, the

standard errors are much larger indicating a substantial reduction in the

reported accuracy of the coefficient estimators.         In part the latter is

induced by lower overall explanatory power, but in part it is due to the

increased collinearity that arises when            and        are replaced by

constructed variables that are primarily linear combinations of lagged

 m and Ag values.

     It therefore appears from this experiment that the effects stressed by

Goldfeld and Blinder may indeed be of quantitative importance. Yet even in




     3Whether the magnitudes of these sums are important will be discussed in
Section IV.
                                         15




these estimates it remains the case that the coefficients on
sum    to   approximately 1.0 while those on               sum    to   approximately

zero. (The numbers are 1.08 and -0.14, respectively.)14

       Once it is recognized -— as seems necessary --   that   policy instruments

are set in response to current or recent conditions, then the motivation for

using high-unemployment        values of fiscal   variables      is    lessened   or

eliminated. Furthermore, it even becomes unclear why a distinction is drawn

between "discretionary't changes in expenditures or taxes and automatic changes

brought about as a result of the built-in stabilizers.                 It would be

appropriate to distinguish empirically between automatic and non-automatic

instrument changes if there were theoretical reasons to believe that these

would have different effects on nominal GNP, but the econometric reasons

appearently motivating Andersen and Jordan (1968) do not seem applicable.12

Consequently, it would appear that there remains room for an empirical study

that emphasizes the endogenous—policy effects emphasized by Goldfeld and

Blinder, and that also considers the impact on aggregate demand of tax changes

brought about by the built-in stabilizers of the U.S. tax system.           A major

reason why such a study is still lacking is the difficulty in modelling policy

behavior together with the absence of genuine exogenous variables.




       lUSimilar conclusions obtain when once and twice lagged values of the
unemployment rate for adult males are also used in the first-stage
regressions, though in this case the results are closer to thos obtained by
OLS.

11.3 The Modigliani-ndO Study

    Let us now turn to the rather interesting experiment conducted by

Modigliani and Ando (1976), who hypothesize that (even ignoring endogenous-

policy issues) estimates of policy multipliers obtained by means of the St.

Louis approach are extremely unreliable.      In support of that hypothesis,

Modigliani and Ando report that the St. Louis equation, when estimated using

artificial data generated by simulations of the MPS model, provides very poor

estimates of that model's known multipliers —-   estimates that are on the low

side for fiscal multipliers and on the high side for monetary multipliers.

While this finding does not literally imply that the St. Louis estimates of

the economy's multipliers are incorrect, it has been regarded by several

reviewers15 as tending to discredit the St. Louis procedure and thus its

results.

     Reflection suggests, however,        that this conclusion may not be

warranted. The reason for doubt involves the point made above, that there are

virtually no macroeconomic variables that can appropriately be treated as

exogenous. If that point is correct, then the Modigliani—Ando experiment will

be misleading in the following way. Under the hypothesis at hand, that there

are no exogenous variables, the MPS model (which treats a large number of

variables as exogenous) incorrectly omits a large number of behavioral

relationships analogous to (3) above. Therefore the "true" multiplier values

for the ME'S model reported by Modigliani and Ando correspond to           the

 (L) and y(L) values in equation (2). But estimates of' the MPS multipliers

obtained by the St. Louis approach correspond to the '(L) and ''(L)




     15These include Meyer and Rasche (1980, p. 62), Purvis (1978, pp. 108-9),
 and McCallurn (1978, p. 322).
                                       1 1




coefficients in (5), with aj values in (3) being whatever is implied by the

historical values of the variables treated (incorrectly) as exogenous, the

historical values of the policy instruments, and the simulated values of the

model's endogenous variables.      In other words, the comparison reported is

between actual MPS values of the coefficients in (2) and estimated values of

the coefficients in (5). Since these coefficients are truly different, under

the hypothesis that there are no exogenous variables in reality,           the

discrepancy between estimated and true values does not, indicate unreliability

of the estimation procedure.16 This argument, it should be said, seems to

amount to an elaboration of the comment provided by Darby (1976).



11.14 Evidence From Large Models

     One useful feature of the Meyer—Rasche survey is its compact tabulation

of policy multipliers for real GNP implied by seven prominent macroeconometric

models.   While there is considerable disagreement among the other models

concerning the magnitudes of fiscal and monetary multipliers, the St. Louis

results do depart significantly from the average of the others' values.    The

government spending multiplier after four quarters, for example, is 0.5 for

the St. Louis model as compared with a mean of 2.17 for the BEA, Brookings,

Michigan, DRI, MPS, and Wharton models. In the case of' the monetary variable,

the comparison is not straightforward since the St. Louis multipliers pertain

to an Ml variable while the others pertain to unborrowed reserves. But the




     l6Variants of this argument would appear to apply to the other Modigliani—
 Ando results.
other-model average after four quarters is 3.0, so the St. Louis value of 144

is much greater in elasticity terms, the ratio of' Ml to unborrowed reserves

being about 10.

     These multipliers are for real GNP, it will be noted, so their magnitudes

depend upon the models'       precise specifications of dynamic Phillips

relationships.
                  Since it is well—known that there exist major disagreements

                                           relationship, it is in principle not
over the proper specification of' this

surprising that the multipliers diverge.         What one might hope for is some

agreement concerning nominal GNP multipliers.            That, in any event, is the

topic under discussion in this paper -— the relative impact of' monetary and

fiscal actions on aggregate demand.

     But the foregoing statement applies only in principle.              In fact, the

predicted price level responses from any of the models in question is so slow

that four-quarter multipliers are essentially the same for nominal as for real

GNP. Thus we see that there is a considerable discrepancy between St. Louis

and other-model responses to a monetary policy action, through less than in

 the case of a fiscal policy action.
                                                                                    of'
     Niehans (1978) and McJelis (1980) have suggested that the implications

 non-St. Louis econometric models are actually much more "monetarist" than most

 observers have recognized.    Their argument starts with the idea that the

 proper comparison of fiscal vs. monetary policy effects requires that an

 unreversed $1 billion/year increase in government spending should be compared

 with a continuing seqaence of' $1 billion increases, one per year, in the high-

 powered money stock. nd when this comparison is made, it is found that "for

 every model except BEA and Wharton III .    .   . the   peak of' the money multipliers

 must be many times as high as the peak of the hypothetical fiscal multipliers,

 a typical ratio being perhaps 15:1    .   . . . The proposition that the quantity
                                       19




of money matters much more than the way it is created is evidently common to

both" monetarist and non-monetarist models (Niehans, 1978, P. 253).

     At first glance, this argument seems flawed.       Ihat is the point of

comparing effects of changes in stock and flow variables?           But then one

realizes that it is entirely apropriate to compare an unreversed $1 billion

change in expenditures financed by bond sales with a similar expenditure

change financed by money issues, the bond or money issues going on period

after period with total tax receipts unchanged.      And clearly the second of

these sequences is equivalent to the first plus a continuing sequence of open-

market bond purchases.   Thus the bond-financed expenditure increase and the

sequence of open-market purchases are the two constituent parts of a money-

financed expediture increase.     If the second constituent is much larger than

the first, as Niehans and McNelis claim it to be, then their comparison would

be both sensible and justified.

     Continuing to reflect reminds one, however, that           the simulation

experiments actually carried out in the large-scale models are ones that hold

constant tax rates, not tax receipts.             Thus putative bond—financed

expenditures and bond-financed money stock expansions are in fact tax-financed

to a considerable extent.         This would tend, since the models are not

Ricardian, to depress multiplier values.     It is not obvious to me that this

tends to bias the results in favor of either type of policy action, but it

would be preferable to compare the effects of the following two experiments:



     (i) an unreversed expansion of government expenditures financed by bond

          sales, with unchanged tax-receipt and money stock-paths

                                              of such an experiment were to support
I would not be surprised if the outcome

considerable extent --   but   as far as I can tell it has not yet been conducted.




11.5 Simsts VAR Evidence

     Before concluding this section, mention should be made of the argument

recently advanced by Sims (1980)(1983)
                                                to the effect that the impact of

monetary policy actions on GNP is extremely small. This argument stems from
                                          obtained by Sims, which show that money

 necessarily reflect irregular components of monetary policy. Indeed, when the

better represented by a VAR system's interest rate innovations than by its

money stock   innovations.18    And in fact interest rate innovations do

contribute importantly to output movements in Sims's results. Thus it cannot

be concluded that the actions of the monetary authority are unimportant for

the explanation of output and nominal GNP movements.19




     l8 do not mean to claim that interest rate innovations actually reflect
only policy surprises.   They do in the formal model in McCalluxn (1983) but
would not if the Fed's operating procedure were slightly different than that
assumed.   The main point of the demonstration is that it is unreasonable to
use money stock innovations as representative of monetary policy surprises.

    19This argument does not imply that interest rates are in general better
"indicators" than money stock growth rates of monetary policy impulses; the
relations mentioned in the text hold only for innovations.

III .Theoretical Issues

     Let us begin the theoretical discussion by reviewing the effects of

monetary and fiscal actions on aggregate demand in a Ricardian economy, i.e.,

one in which agents take account of the government budget restraint (GBR) in

making saving/consumption decisions for an effectively     infinite planning

horizon.20 Under such conditions, the asset value of government bonds held by

the public is offset by the present value of extra future taxes necessitated

by the existence of these bonds, so the latter do not constitute wealth to the

private sector as a whole. Thus a one-period tax reduction financed by bond

sales has no effect on aggregate demand, for the implied increase in future

taxes just offsets the effect on wealth of the reduction of current taxes.

This Ricardian equivalence result, well-known from the work of Barro

(19714)(19814), provides the basis for a comparative analysis of monetary and

fiscal policy effects.

     The case of a tax reduction financed by money creation is quite

different, for the asset value of the additional money is not offset by extra

implied future taxes, of which there are none.21 The added nominal wealth may

be negated in real terms by inflation, but the latter comes about as the

result of an upward shift in aggregate demand, which is precisely the effect

whose presence is being claimed. Thus the fact that inflation may for some

purposes be viewed as imposing a "tax" does not alter the validity of the




    20pl needed,    of course, is the assumption that taxes are lump sum in
nature,    i.e., have no major substitution effects.      That finite—lived
individuals may have effectively infinite planning horizons was shown by Barro
(19714).

     21See Patinkin (1965, p. 289). The reason money is willingly held despite
the absence of of interest payments is, of course, that it provides
transaction—facilitating services to its holders.
statement beginning this paragraph; a money-financed tax cut increase nominal

wealth and aggregate demand.

     Consequently, since a money-financed tax cut (of, say,   $x)   and a bond-

financed tax increase (of      $x)   are together equivalent to an open market

purchase, we see that an open market purchase unambiguously increases

aggregate demand (in a Ricardian economy).22 And this result clearly implies

that an increase in government spending must have a larger stimulative effect

on aggregate demand if it is money financed than if it is bond financed, for

the difference in the two actions is precisely an open-market purchase (or

sequence of purchases if we are discussing an unreversed increase in

government purchases23).

     It remains to be considered whether a bond (or tax) financed increase in

government purchases will have a non—zero effect on aggregate demand. Effects

of both temporary and permanent changes in government spending in a Ricardian

world have been analyzed, in a non-mathematical but careful fashion, by Barro

(198)4, pp. 309-312 and 316-320).    In the case of a temporary increase, there

is an increase in output and in the real rate of interest.          The latter

translates, in the absence of inflation, into a rise in the nominal rate. For

portfolio balance with a constant money stock, nominal income must then rise,

if the income elasticity of real money demand is less than unity.       To see

this, let us write the money demand function as




    22An open-market purchase leaves fewer bonds outstanding and so requires
smaller interest payments in the future by the government. Under Ricardian
assumptions it does not matter whether tins reduction in payments is
accompanied by lower taxes or by bond growth.

    23That maintained deficits are possible under bond finance, as well as
under money finance, is demonstrated in McCallum (19824a).
(6)        m_pa0+cz1y-2r

where m, p, and y are in logarithmic terms, r is the interest rate, and all

parameters are positive. This equation may be rearranged to read



(7)        y + p      m -    + (1-1)y   +




           '<   1
                    the increases in both y and r tend to increase y+p, the log of

nominal income.       En the case of a permanent increase in government spending,

Barro's analysis leads to no change in r but again to an increase in y so

again (7) indicates a rise in y+p.21 Thus we see that an increase in (real)

government spending tends to induce an increase in aggregate demand.

      In summary, a Ricardian analysis suggests that (i) open market purchases
                                                        increases or tax cuts are
are expansionary so (ii) money-financed spending

more expansionary than ones that are bond financed.             Indeed, (iii) bond-

financed tax cuts have no effect on aggregate demand, but (iv) bond-financed

 spending increases are expansionary.




    •24This type of result can be shown to hold in the Sidrauski-type version
 of the Ricardian model used by McCallum (1984a) as follows.       1s in Barro
 (19814), let the consumer obtain utility from government-provided services and
 express this by writing the within-period utility function for the
 representative household as u(c+g,m) with 0 <     < 1.   The budget
 constraint is not changed so the houseFiold's optimality conditions remain (3)—
 (10) in McCallum (19814a, pp. 128—129).     Consider alternative steady states
 with zero inflation.     Combining (14) and (5) then yields u2(c+cLg,m)            (1-
 )u1(c+ctg,m). In this particular model an    increase  in  g has  no  effect   on  the
 steady-state value of k -- see p. 129 -- so c+g is unaffected and an incrase
 in g lowers z    c+g. From the equation above we have dm/dz           [u1 +
                      — u22}.   From the the latter plus   the conditions     u11 < 0,
                       we  find that dm/dz > 0. So real  money  balances    fall   with
 u22 < 0, and u12 > 0
 a reduction in z coming from an increase in g.   But with a constant money
 stock, that implies an increase in the price   level and thus in aggregate
 demand.
                                              25




       Now it is of course not the case that Ricardian assumptions are literally

satisfied by the U.S. economy.              But the Ricardian model may nevertheless

provide a useful first approximation to the workings of the economy, a

fruitful starting-point for thinking about the effects of policy actions.            In


particular, it would seem more appropriate to regard bonds as contributing to

private wealth not at all, than to regard them as doing so fully.              If each

dollar of bonds functions macroeconomically as k dollars of net private wealth

--   which is the way Patinkin (1965, P. 289) puts it -- then the value of k is
(I would conjecture) much closer to 0.0 than to 1.0.25

       The relevance of this observation is, of course, that most of the

theoretical literature on monetary vs. fiscal policy effects has presumed --

usually      without discussion --   that   bonds constitute wealth fully (i.e., that k

     1.0).    Indeed, this literature abounds with paradoxical results that obtain

in large part because of wealth effects due to ongoing expansion or




    25This condition does not require that individuals' planning horizons
extend beyond their own lifetimes.   I would also conjective that analysis
using the recently-developed approach of Blanchard (198L) would support my
main conclusions.
contraction of government debt.26          Another source of paradox in this

literature -—   the exposition of which emphasizes the role of the GBR27 -- has
been the practice of focusing on "long run" effects, with the latter somewhat

misleadingly defined so       as   to   require a balanced budget.          The

inappropriateness of this terminology is emphasized by occasional statements

concerning the comparative "long run" effects of money- and bond-financed

deficit spending.28

     In any event, there is one contention that appears in this literature

with which I want to take issue, namely, the notion that open-market purchases

are contractionary or, as Blinder and Solow (1976, p. 500) put it., "the long-

run effect of government spending is greater when deficits are bond-financed

than when they are money-financed."29 The basis of this contention is, as

explained in MeCalluin (1981, p. 136), that in models of the type now under

discussion either the contention is true or the economy is dynamically




    26ome of the prominent items are included in volumes edited by Gordon
(19714) and Stein (1976).  Also influential were Christ (1968), Brunner and
Meltzer   (1972),   and  a series    of   papers by Blinder and Solow
(1973)(1974)(1976). A recent review, which shares the criticised presumption
of the items reviewed, is Mayer (19814).

         is worth noting that analysis that ignores the GBR is not thereby
discredited, as long as it does not pretend that time paths of money, bonds,
spending, and taxes can all be specified arbitrarily.        An analysis that
specifies paths for only three of these variables arbitrarily and ignores the
fourth, may be perfectly logical as long as it does not require an infeasible
path for the fourth variable -— for example, a path along which the bond stock
grows exponentially at a rate that exceeds the growth rate of output by more
than the rate of time preference (McCalluin, 198'4a). Failing to keep track of
the fourth variable may lead to errors if the model is non-Ricardian because
of induced shifts in behavioral relations.    But if it is Ricardian and the
fourth variable is bonds or tax receipts then such shifts will not occur.


    28see, e.g., Blinder and Solow (1976,p. 506).

    29Their contention is accepted by Mayer (19814).
                                     27




unstable when deficits are bond-financed (i.e., when paths of spending, the

money stock, and income tax rates are determined exogenously so that the stock

of bonds must adjust to satisfy the GBR).    Then by assuming stability, the

authors in question obtain the result.      But, as is argued in detail in

McCallum (1981, pp. 136-137), the appropriate conclusion is rather that the

economy is unstable3° under these conditions -— and open-market purchases are

expansionary even according to the models and concepts in question.31 That

conclusion is in no way refuted by-the observed stability of the U.S. economy

because neither the money stock nor taxes are in fact managed in the way

assumed by the setup in which the analysis is conducted.




    30Th McCallum (1981), it is suggested that the dynamic instability in
question can be avoided if the rate of output growth exceeds the after-tax
real rate of return.    But with an income tax, a maximizing analysis in a
Ricardian model of the type used in McCallum (19824a) indicates that the
steady-state, after-tax real rate of return will equal the rate of growth plus
the rate of time preference.   So the condition mentioned as an escape from
instability in my earlier paper cannot hold in the vicinity of the steady
state.  I was thus wrong to quarrel, in my 1981 paper, with the first of the
two "messages" suggested by Blinder and Solow (1976).

    31This conclusion seems to agree with that of Christ (1979, p. 533).
IV. Conclusions

    The substantive conclusions of the foregoing investigation/review are

fairly easy to discern and are not very dramatic.       The clearest is that an

open-market increase in the money stock has a stimulative effect on aggregate

demand, a conclusion that in turn implies that a money-financed increase in

expenditures (or reduction in taxes) is more stimulative than it would be if

bond—financed.    This conclusion is supported by empirical results obtained

both from St. Louis-style estimates and from large scale econometric models.

Furthermore, the conclusion is also supported by theoretical analysis

involving both Ricardian and non-Ricardian assumptions.

     In the case of pure fiscal policy actions --   i.e.,   bond-financed tax cuts

or bond—financed expenditure increases —-   the situation is not so clear. But

theory suggests that the latter should be at least as stimulative as the

former and most probably stimulative to a positive extent. The evidence on

these points is mixed but is not obviously inconsistent with the theoretical

predictions.

     With respect to the textbook issue concerning the relative (per dollar)

effect of pure monetary and fiscal actions, the evidence seems --      in   a rather

disorderly way ——   to   support the notion that a sequence of $x open-market

purchases, one each period, will be considerably more stimulative than a

single but unreversed $X/period bond-financed increase in expenditures.

     It might be added, however, that it is unclear that any great importance

attaches to this last issue, at least from a policy perspective, provided that

each type of policy has non-negligible effects. If the object of the debate

is to determine whether monetary or fiscal variables would serve better as

 instruments to be manipulated for stabilization purposes, then attention

should be focussed on the relative accuracy of the effects rather than the
                                         29




per—dollar magnitudes.        Adjustments in the instrument settings do not

themselves involve costs, in terms of destroyed resources, as is implicitly

suggested by the view that it is relative magnitudes that matter.32

    Nor is it entirely clear why, from a policy standpoint,33 so much

attention has been devoted to whether the sum of fiscal policy coefficients is

zero when individual coefficients are significantly non-zero. Only a minor

quibble3 keeps me from sharing Fischer's (1976) view that "if fiscal policy

had significant short—term effects . .        . but   no long-run effects it would be

an ideal stabilization tool."

    More generally, the essential issues concerning stabilization policy that

continue to divide macroeconomists are ones concerned with, first, the

desirability of activist policy and, second, whether activist policy (if

desirable) should be executed according to well—specified rules or in a

period-by—period discretionary manner.'6 As various writers have noted,37




        similar point was mentioned by Meltzer (1969, p. 31), but only with
respect to monetary instruments. Robert King has suggested to me that there
may be resource costs associated with adjustments of tax schedules or
government expenditures, which would tend to make money the better instrument.

    33The question of whether the cumulative effect of such actions is
stimulative, contractionary, or neither may be of theoretical interest since
it bears on the appropriateness of competing theories. It is not the case,
however, that a value of unity for the sum of the monetary policy coefficients
is necessary for "long run" monetary neturality.      For a recent discussion
relating to that point, see McCallum (19814b).


          quibble is that zero effects after the first period, rather than
zero "long-run" effects, would appear to be preferable.

    35me efficacy of various possible instruments and institutional
arrangements is also of importance.

    36The advantage of rule-like behavior of monetary policy has been
articulated by Earro and Gordon (1983).

    37Among   these   are Sargent (1976), Modigliani (1977), and McCallum (1978).
neither of these issues is strongly dependent upon       the outcome of the

relative—magnitudes question.

     That does not imply, however, that the monetary vs. fiscal policy debate
                           On the contrary, the various ins and outs of the
has been unenlightening.

discussion have served valuably to enhance knowledge and awareness of' the

central importance of monetary actions as determinants of nominal income.

That contribution is easy to belittle or overlook, given         today's wide

acceptance of that importance.   But the formation of' today's views --    i.e.,
the dramatic change away from the situation described by Cagan -- amounted to

a major overhaul in the practice of' macro and monetary economics, and this

change was aided substantially by the monetary vs. fiscal policy debate.
