                                           ABSTRACT

This paper shows that endogenous cycles can arise when contracts between firms and their
customers are incomplete and when products are experience goods. Then firms invest in the
quality of their output in order to establish a good reputation. Cycles arise because investment in
reputation causes self-fulfilling changes in the discount factor. Cycles are more likely to occur
when information diffuses slowly and consumers exhibit high risk aversion. A rise in
idiosyncratic uncertainty is of two kinds that work in opposite ways: Noise in observing effort is
contractionary as it generally is in agency models. But a rise in the variance of the distribution of
abilities is expansionary. A calibrated version produces realistic fluctuations in terms of peak-to-
trough movements in consumption and the spacing of time between recessions.

             This paper shows that endogenous cycles can arise when contracts between firms
          and their customers are incomplete and when products are experience goods. Then
          firms invest in the quality of their output in order to establish a good reputation.
          Cycles arise because investment in reputation causes self-fulfilling changes in the
          discount factor. Cycles are more likely to occur when information diﬀuses slowly
          and consumers exhibit high risk aversion. A rise in idiosyncratic uncertainty is of
          two kinds that work in opposite ways: Noise in observing eﬀort is contractionary
          as it generally is in agency models. But a rise in the variance of the distribution
          of abilities is expansionary. A calibrated version produces realistic fluctuations in
          terms of peak-to-trough movements in consumption and the spacing of time between
          recessions.

1         Introduction
A seller’s reputation is often the only guarantee of quality of its products or services.
By the same token, reputation building is often the seller’s only incentive to deliver on

quality. This is why consumers are willing to pay a premium for goods and services from
established brands. Underprovision of quality today will be punished by lower prices in
the future, and a positive surprise will be rewarded. Because of this, the seller’s market
value depends partly on his reputation or “brand value”, an intangible component of his
capital stock.1
       Since reputational investment today pays oﬀ in the future, a seller’s incentive to main-
tain or improve his reputation depends on his discount factor. And when the seller is risk
averse, his discount factor depends negatively on his consumption growth. We show that
if the seller is unable to smooth his consumption by other means, this force can give rise
to cycles.
       For a two-period cycle the intuition is simple. In a recession, current consumption
is low relative to future consumption which means that the discount factor is also low.
This reduces the incentive to create a good reputation and the recession is self fulfilling.
Conversely, current consumption in a boom is higher than future consumption, which
means that the discount factor is also high and so the boom too is self fulfilling. In other
words, the discount factor and reputational concern are pro-cyclical because consumption
growth is counter-cyclical.
       We embed this mechanism into a general equilibrium model and study how investment
in reputation aﬀects aggregate outcomes. The model has no direct externalities and no
aggregate shocks, but output oscillates. Cycles are sustainable because investment is
always below its output-maximizing level, a wedge that is driven by the delay with which
reputation reacts to investment. This market failure implies that output and investment
in quality are positively correlated.
       Consumption and investment are therefore both pro-cyclical, a basic feature of business
cycles which is diﬃcult to reconcile with canonical models of deterministic cycles based
on multi-sectoral economies, such as Benhabib and Nishimura (1985), or on replacement
echoes, such as Boucekkine, Germain and Licandro (1997). Besides these raw correlations,
our model is also consistent with a series of stylized facts about business cycles. First, it
predicts that output is more volatile than consumption but less than investment. Second,
product quality is pro-cyclical as recently documented by Broda and Weinstein (2010) or
Jaimovich, Rebelo and Wong (2015). Third, our model predicts that an inverted yield
   1
       McGrattan and Prescott (2000) argue that as much as 40 percent of GNP is intangible capital and
firm’s reputation accounts for a large fraction of it.

curve precedes recessions (Ang, Piazzesi and Wei, 2006). Finally we show that asymmetric
cycles with a string of positive growth rates followed by a highly negative growth rate —
i.e., a disaster — can also arise repeatedly.
   To go beyond qualitative insights, we use micro-data on firm dynamic to parametrize
the model. We explain how variance parameters can be recovered from estimates about
the evolution of TFP at the plant level. The speed at which consumers update their
beliefs determines the length of the period. Setting it equal to the average frequency of 56
months separating booms and busts, we find that the calibrated parameters fall well within
the region where cycles arise endogenously. Hence our model does not require extreme
parameter values in order to generate deterministic cycles. In particular, cycles with
a frequency of 56 months are sustainable whenever the annual discount factor is below
0977, a number well above the upper-bounds of the competitive equilibrium models
surveyed in Boldrin and Woodford (1990). This finding is in line with recent research
pointing out that market imperfections considerably widen the range of discount factors
compatible with endogenous cycles. For example, Beaudry, Galizia and Portier (2015)
find that adding strategic complementarities to a standard DSGE model allows them
to produce limit cycles that match US business fluctuations in employment and output.
Our analysis shows that pecuniary externalities can lead to a similar conclusion, so that
complementarities do not have to be directly embedded in the structure of the economy.
   We find that two kinds of uncertainty aﬀect output in opposite directions. A rise
in the variance of the distribution of productivity strengthens reputational concerns and
is expansionary. By contrast, a rise in the variance of output at the firm level makes
it harder for consumers to infer investment and is therefore contractionary. Since it
also dampens reputation cycles, an increase in the noisiness of the technology yields a
negative correlation between micro and macro volatility that is qualitatively similar to
the one observed during the great moderation.
   Although ours is a general equilibrium paper targeting aggregate business cycles, we
begin our analysis by showing that cyclical equilibria also arise in Holmström’s (1999)
partial equilibrium setting if the agent is risk averse and cannot borrow or lend. So, while
significant extensions have been made on the learning process (e.g., Board and Meyer-
ter-Vehn, 2013), our analysis suggests that similarly important insights can be gathered
studying the specification of preferences in reputation models.
   Section 2 lays out the model. Section 3 deals with partial equilibrium where the


                                                3
mechanism is more transparent while Section 4 deals with general equilibrium. Section
5 explains how the model can be parametrized, and shows that cycles arise for realistic
parameters values. Then we review major hypotheses for endogenous cycles in Section 6
so as to highlight the novelty of reputation cycles.


2         A model of firm reputation
We build on Holmström (1999) where a risk-neutral agent faces a spot market with risk-
neutral buyers. The unique equilibrium then entails a monotonic time path of eﬀort. We
will now show that if one assumes that the agent is risk averse, multiple equilibria arise
and in some of them eﬀort follows a 2-period cycle. In partial equilibrium our mechanism
requires the following assumptions:
        A1. Incomplete agency contracts with non-contractible eﬀort and output;
        A2. Risk averse agent facing risk-neutral principals;
        A3. Agent’s preferences have no wealth eﬀect (CARA utility);
        A4. Agent cannot borrow or lend.
        In general equilibrium A4 is replaced by the fact that the economy is closed, and
because of insurance possibilities among agents we can drop A3 and work with CRRA
utility.


2.1         Set-up
Each period an agent produces output  by exerting hidden eﬀort  :

                                               =  +  +                            (1)

Here  ∼  (0 2 ) is an i.i.d. shock. The variable  is the agent’s eﬃciency.  is unknown,
even to the the agent himself, and the common prior is N (0 2 ).2
        Contracts in which the period- payment is contingent on  are not feasible. Instead,
buyers pay the agent up front and the payment reflects the market belief at the beginning
of the period. Thus the agent exerts eﬀort only so as to raise his future income, and so
we refer to  as “investment”. Output has a persistent eﬀect on prices because it aﬀects
the market’s belief about the agent’s eﬃciency which fluctuates over time as
                                                      ¡      ¢

        We shall let the prior mean diﬀer from zero in Section 5.

       Each period the agent chooses an  from the feasible set A ⊆ R+ and everyone observes
. The agent can also observe  +  but not its components. The market’s participants
observe  only, but since they will infer  from equilibrium, they too will be able to infer
 + .
       Within a period, events unfold as follows:

   1. There are many identical and risk neutral potential buyers, and they get zero rents;
         the up-front payment the agent gets is  [ |   ]  where   ≡ { }−1
                                                                                 =0 is his public
         history.

   2. The agent chooses  , privately.

   3. Output  is realized, and it becomes part of the agent’s history  +1 .

       At date , everyone knows the history   . Let ∗ denote the agent’s equilibrium action.
We will derive an equilibrium in which ∗ depends on , but not on   . A suﬃcient
statistic for the information revealed about  is the sequence  ≡ (0   −1 ), where
 ≡  − ∗ =  +  . The market treats  as the signal, which is normally distributed.
                                                                    ¡     2

The agent is risk averse and infinitely lived. We focus on deterministic solutions of his
optimization program4
                                         "∞                #

                             =0
                                            =0

where  obeys the law of motion (5) and  ∈ A. The utility function (·) is twice
diﬀerentiable and concave, while (·) is an increasing, twice diﬀerentiable, cost function
measured in terms of goods. Consumption in each period is equal to revenues  [ |   ] =
 + ∗ net of the investment cost  ( ). Hence we have implicitly assumed that:
       () The agent cannot smooth consumption by borrowing and lending.
       () The action  is hidden.
       () Deterministic policies are optimal for the problem in (6), which is true if  () is
in the CARA class and if shocks to the agent’s income are permanent. Income shocks,
which reflect the history    will in turn be permanent because buyers are risk neutral and
because their beliefs have the martingale property.
       Taking {∗ }∞
                    = as given, Bayes rule and repeated substitution for  yields the following
incentive constraint:5
                                                                   ∙ 0        ¸

                                   0                           −   ( )
                                      (∗ )   =          ()                                     (7)
                                                    =+1           0 ( )

The left-hand side is the marginal cost, and the right-hand side is the discounted ben-
efit because a deviation from ∗ to ∗ + 1 would raise the posterior mean at date  by
   4
       We will show that optimal actions on and oﬀ the equilibrium path are a function of time only (See
lemmata 9 and 10 in the technical Appendix A.4). Hence (i) given the law of motion of beliefs derived
in the previous subsection, equilibrium strategies maximize the agent’s utility; (ii) given the equilibrium
actions, beliefs are updated via Bayes rule. Bayesian updating is always well defined since all output
levels occur with positive probability. Solutions to problem (6) are therefore optimal.
   5
     Condition (7) rules out one-shot deviations but does not guarantee that multiple deviations are not
profitable. Whenever the agent deviates, he drives a persistent wedge between his belief and that of the
market. Thus a deviation that is not attractive on the equilibrium path might nonetheless be profitable
oﬀ path. In other words, the FOC (7) is necessary but not always suﬃcient. We show in the technical
Appendix A.4 that suﬃciency is not a concern for the models studied in this paper because optimal
strategies on and oﬀ the equilibrium path are deterministic. A recent paper by Cisternas (2016) provides
bounds guaranteeing suﬃciency in more general settings in which optimal actions may depend on .


                                                               6
  = (1 − ) −−1 , for all   .6 Since  is increasing in  and  is a martingale,
expected consumption depends on the agent’s current reputation. Hence the optimality
condition (7) varies with  and in general so would ∗  contrary to our assumption that
∗ depends on  only. To ensure that  [ 0 ( )  0 ( )] is not aﬀected by  , we have to
neutralize the wealth eﬀect.
        The wealth eﬀect is easier to eliminate in general equilibrium where we assume that
a representative family insures its members against wealth shocks. There we shall work
with CRRA preferences. In partial equilibrium, however, we deal with one agent who
cannot insure his income, and we shall assume that the agent’s utility function is CARA.
With either assumption, the agent’s discount factor no longer depends on .


3         Cycles in partial equilibrium
Following the discussion above, in this section we assume that utility is CARA:

                                    () = − exp(−) with   0                                     (8)

Inserting (8) and (5) in (7), the term  cancels out from the expression of  [ 0 ( )  0 ( )]
because it is the forecastable component of  . We obtain an incentive constraint that is
consistent with deterministic actions since (7) becomes equivalent to

Note that    because consumption is stochastic and because  000 (·)  0. Consumption
volatility thus raises expected marginal utility in future periods, especially when  is large.
To ensure that expected returns are bounded, we focus on cases where   1.


3.1         Linear costs
Steady-state and 2-period cycles.–Suppose that () = , with  ∈ (0 1) to ensure
that investment raises output. We rule out infinite output levels by imposing an upper-
bound ̄ on the feasible set A = [0 ̄]. With linear costs, optimality can only be restored

Taking expectations about ∗+1 as given, ∗ adjusts until the equality above is satisfied.
The equilibrium path is fully determined by the ratio of marginal costs to discounted
marginal returns on the right-hand side of (10). Since this ratio is constant, all paths
converge towards ̄ when it is lower than one or, conversely, converge to zero when it is
higher than one. To illustrate the dynamics with a phase portrait, we use (8) to rewrite
(10) as                                                         µ                   ¶

The law of motion is given by a line parallel to the 45 degree line with an intercept equal
to the constant on the right-hand side of (11). As shown in Figure 1, in the knife-edge
case where the intercept is zero, i.e., when  = (1 − )(−1 − ), the dynamic map and 45
degree line coincide so that any action in A is a potential rest point. Besides this singular
case, investment converges to ̄ when the intercept is positive and converges to zero when
it is negative. Hence investment can only be constant at the boundary of the action set.
       If marginal costs are low, so that   (1−)(−1 −), agents are tempted to raise their
investment above that of the rest point ̂. Hence ̂ is sustainable only if such deviations
are not feasible, that is if ̂ = ̄.8 This solution is also eﬃcient because the cost parameter
  1 while marginal productivity is one.
       Conversely, when marginal costs are high (  (1−)(−1 −)), reputational concerns
are too weak and ̂ = 0 is the only incentive-compatible steady-state. This market failure
arises even though consumers update their beliefs in each period. It is therefore of a
diﬀerent nature than the one in Holmström’s (1999) model which was caused by the
absence of learning in the long-run. Another important diﬀerence is that risk aversion

       Eq. (10) is a particular case of the recursive incentive constraint (13) where () =  The posterior
 does not aﬀect the ratio on the LHS of (10) because utility is CARA.
  8
    Formally, the incentive constraint (9) does not have to hold as an equality at the bounds of the
feasibility set. When ̂ = ̄ and   (1 − )(−1 − ), the RHS exceeds the LHS of (9) and the agent is
constrained by the requirement that  ≤ ̄.

can give rise to deterministic solutions where ∗ varies over time. In particular, welfare
enhancing cycles of period 2 can be sustained.

state ̂ = 0 is Pareto dominated by 2-period cycles in which investment oscillates between
0 and ̄.

   Cycles arise because the discount factor fluctuates procyclically. High  = ̄ entails
above-normal output and consumption, leading to a low marginal utility  0 ( ). The
opposite is true next period as +1 = 0 delivers low consumption and relatively high
marginal utility  0 (+1 ). Thus  [ 0 (+1 )  0 ( )] is large today, and this justifies the
higher investment in reputation building. A similar but opposite mechanism operates in
the next period, making low investment optimal. The oscillations of the discount factor
capture the willingness of the agent to smooth consumption. Since the benefits of his
action only accrue in the following period, he finds it optimal to transfer resources from
good to bad times by overinvesting.



                                                 9
       It is insightful to rewrite the incentive constraint at the upper-bound ̄ as9

Reputational returns are on the right-hand side of (12), and they are increasing in in-
vestment ̄ because it raises the ratio of marginal utilities between bad and good times.
Quite intuitively, smaller oscillations become sustainable when the power of incentives is
strengthened. Take for example an increase in the discount factor . It raises  as patient
agents tend to be more concerned by their reputation. Hence the required wedge between
marginal utilities is decreasing in  which allows the model to generate cycles for lower
values of ̄. A similar mechanism is triggered by changes in the degree of risk aversion
because the eﬀective rate of time preference  is increasing in . This eﬀect is reinforced
by the positive impact that  has on the curvature of the utility function. When agents
are more risk averse, similar oscillations in consumption generate greater swings in the
discount factor, which lowers the value of ̄ that restores incentive compatibility.

       Asymmetric cycles.–The model can generate cycles with more than two states. As
an illustration, Fig. 2 describes incentive-compatible cycles of period 3 where investment
grows for two successive periods and then drops back to its initial level. This is the simplest
instance of asymmetric cycles featuring protracted booms and sudden busts. A tendency
for a time series to show large negative growth rates followed by several smaller positive
growth rates is known as “steep asymmetry.” The empirical counterpart of Fig. 2 is Fig. 8
which shows that steep asymmetry appears to be present in the U.S. consumption series.
Moreover, the long-run frequency distribution of  places equal weight on the points 0
071, and 1, and thus has longer left tail. A tendency for a detrended time series to have
negative skew is known as “deep” asymmetry and it too is present in U.S. data.10
       The longer period of growth is sustainable because investment costs  are low, i.e., less
than (1−)(−1 −).11 As explained before, when this inequality holds, the steady-state

       See Fig. 4 in Jovanovic (2006) for a graphical distinction between the two types of asymmetry, and
Fig 1 for evidence of deep asymmetry in the GDP and industrial production series.
  11
     By contrast, asymmetric cycles with protracted slumps and sudden booms can be constructed when
the steady-state is ineﬃcient, so that   (1 − )(−1 − ).

is eﬃcient because firms always find it profitable to raise their investment. But now they
are discouraged from doing so by the fact that the marginal utility of consumption will
be lower tomorrow than it is today. We show in the technical Appendix A.5 that this
feature gives rise to asymmetric cycles similar to the one depicted in Fig. 2 whenever:
(i) ̄ is high enough, and (ii)  ∈ ( (1 − )(−1 − )) for some   0. The logic of the
proof can be extended to cycles with more than 3 states. Instead of investigating such
variations, we turn our attention to cost functions that are not linear.


3.2    Convex costs
Assume now that () is strictly convex with 0 (0) = 0. This ensures that, when A = R+ ,
the incentive constraint (7) admits an interior solution for ∗ . Thus we can substitute in

                                       ( )
The recursive incentive constraint highlights that adding a unit of investment to ∗ has
two benefits:
   () It raises  + 1 earnings by (1 − ), and

                                             11
       () it enables the firm to reduce its investment in period  + 1 by  in order to undo
the deviation, thereby restoring the reputation associated to the equilibrium path in  + 2
and beyond.
       Both benefits are converted into today’s utils through multiplication by the stochas-
tic discount factor  [ 0 (+1 )  0 ( )]. When the utility function is CARA, (13) is
equivalent to
                              ¡ £               ¡                 ¢¤¢ ¡           ¡     ¢¢

Setting ∗+1 equal to ∗ yields the rest point solution

                                                  −1 − 

Eﬃcient investment would require instead that  =  0−1 (1). Thus, when  is smaller
than one, ̂   0−1 (1) and investment at the steady-state is suboptimal because costs are
paid up-front, whereas reputational benefits accrue slowly over time. This is why the gap
between optimal and actual investment is larger when agents are more impatient.

       Stability of the steady-state.–Under risk neutrality, the steady-state is always unstable
and any other action than ̂ generates diverging trajectories.12 In other words, ̂ is the
unique rational expectation solution. By contrast, when the agent is risk averse, the
steady-state can be locally stable. Then, for any initial action 0 in the neighborhood of
̂, the solution path  converges back to ̂ so that the equilibrium is not unique. The
condition under which equilibrium multiplicity arises is laid-out in Proposition 2.

Proposition 2 Assume that () is strictly convex with  0 (0) = 0. Then the steady-state
̂ is locally stable, and the model’s equilibrium is indeterminate, if and only if

    This is not obvious from (15) because  aﬀects ̂ through its impact on . However, since  converges

to  when  goes to zero, lim→0 ̂ () =  0−1 (1 − )   −1 −  . Hence the LHS of (15) converges to
a positive value, whereas the RHS goes to zero, showing that (15) never holds in the limit.

right hand side of (15), is proportional to 1 − 0 (̂). Thus risk aversion is irrelevant when
1 = 0 (̂), that is when the steady state and the first best coincide. Intuitively, the
curvature of the utility function matters only to the extent that changes in investment
aﬀect consumption. At the first best, benefits and costs are set equal and a marginal
increase in  leaves consumption unchanged. But we have seen that ̂ is suboptimal
whenever agents discount future consumption. Then raising investment is beneficial as it
increases output and reduces the agent’s marginal utility. This makes it more attractive
to invest today in order to raise tomorrow’s consumption, which explains why an increase
in investment is followed by a drop and a return to the steady state when the utility
function has enough curvature.

   Deterministic cycles.–Besides the continuum of converging paths in the neighborhood
of the steady-state, the model also features global cycles of period 2.

Proposition 3 When the costs function is quadratic, i.e., () = 2 2, deterministic
2-period cycles are sustainable whenever the steady-state is locally stable.

   The intuition why cycles are sustainable is the same as in the model with linear costs:
Procyclical cycles in the discount factor make it optimal to invest during booms and to
reduce expenses during busts. This mechanism is closely related to the one rendering the
steady-state locally stable. Proposition 3 shows that the two phenomena are indeed driven
by the same forces. Combining Propositions 2 and 3, we see that cycles arise whenever
the agent is suﬃciently risk averse.
   Looking at the phase portrait generated by the incentive constraint (13) helps one
understand how cycles arise. We highlight the impact of risk aversion by also illustrating
the model’s dynamics when agents are risk neutral. Then, as shown in the left panel of
Fig. 3, the mapping between ∗ and ∗+1 is linear with a slope greater than one. Hence
the rest point ̂ is the only rational expectation solution that does not generate diverging
action paths.
   We introduce risk aversion in the right panel of Fig. 3. The dynamic map solves
the recursive equation (14) with a quadratic cost function () = 2 2, and is therefore
equivalent to

Figure 3: Phase portraits with linear and CARA utility. Parameters:  =

   Let us first explain why small values for ∗ can never be incentive compatible. Letting
∗ go to zero, we see that the expression on the left-hand side of (16) also converges to
zero. By contrast, the expression on the right-hand side of (16) has a positive minimum.
By continuity, there always exists an ∗  0 such that (16) cannot hold whenever
∗ ∈ [0 ∗ ]. In economic terms, there is no expectation about ∗+1 that sustains an in-
vestment level smaller than ∗ . Intuitively, today’s marginal loss converges to 0 whereas
tomorrow’s marginal returns are bounded below by 1−, which explains why the dynamic
map in Fig. 3 is empty close to the origin.
   Besides this empty interval, we see that, instead of the one-to-one mapping prevail-
ing under risk neutrality, the dynamic map is a correspondence that associates a pair of
incentive compatible ∗+1 to any ∗ . The incentive constraint is satisfied by two diﬀerent
∗+1 because tomorrow’s investment shifts the discount factor and marginal costs in oppo-
site directions. Increasing ∗+1 raises tomorrow’s consumption, which lowers the discount
factor and counteracts the increase in marginal costs  0 (∗+1 ). When the elasticity of the
discount factor with respect to ∗+1 is higher than that of the marginal costs, it is possible
to perturb a pair of sustainable actions and restore incentive compatibility by adjusting


                                                      14
∗+1 until its eﬀect on the discount factor oﬀsets the change in marginal costs.
       For the economy to settle down at the rest point ̂, the expectation-formation mech-
anism has to select the lower branch of the phase portrait. By contrast, 2-period cycles
are regime switching equilibria since expectations oscillate between the upper and lower
branch.

       Other equilibria.–We have focused on deterministic cycles of period 2, but our model
has a continuum of equilibria, i.e., a continuum of sequences { } solving (14). Instead
of alternating selection of branches, one could assume other patterns of regime switching
including sunspots.14 We leave a comprehensive investigation of all equilibrium outcomes
to further research and focus instead on the simplest form of regime switching cycles. We
evaluate their ability to match aggregate business cycles in the next section where we
embed our model into a general equilibrium setting.


4        Cycles in general equilibrium
We now move to general equilibrium. We keep the production technology (1) and the
assumptions about ( ) summarized by (2)-(5). We also keep assumptions A1 and A2
but we drop A3 which is not needed in GE, and replace A4 with the requirement that the
economy is closed. Cycles are now in aggregate consumption and since there is no access
to outside finance, agents cannot smooth them.15


4.1        Set-up
Firms’ aggregate distribution.–We continue to assume that firms draw their s from
N (̄ ̄2 ), with ̄2 being equal to the stationary precision given in (4). Then posterior
precision remains constant over time so that a firm’s individual state is just .16
  14
       There are of course models in which an extrinsic or even intrinsic shock acts so as to shift an economy
from one regime to another (e.g., Hamilton, 1990). See also Christiano and Harrison (1999) for a model
with stochastic regime switching where consumption satisfies the Euler equation. Here we assume that
such switches of regime alternate in a deterministic manner.
  15
     This assumption fails for a small open economy facing an exogenous interest rate.
  16
     Restricting our attention to stationary priors ensures that precision, and thus investment, do not
vary across firms of diﬀerent vintages.




                                                      15
   To obtain a stationary distribution for , we also assume that firms are randomly hit
by a death shock with probability  per period. As  = ̄ is a constant, (5) implies
that a firm’s state  follows a random walk with constant incremental variance. Since a
firm’s lifetime is a geometrically distributed random variable and an additional period of
life adds (1 − )2 (2 + ̄2 ) to the variance of , the time-invariant distribution of types
Υ () is a mixture of normal distributions with mean ̄ and stationary variance

   Product markets.–The risk-averse household fully diversifies its purchases of goods
over firms so as to eliminate the risk in the random variable  −  + . Any firm’s product
is marginal to the family, and it pays up front the expected value of output for it. Since
all market participants observe the history of outputs, and the sequence of equilibrium
actions ∗ is common knowledge, firm  has revenue  + ∗ and profit

                                      () =  + ∗ −  ()                             (17)

where  (·) is measured in output units. The firm pays its profits to the manager’s family.

   Preferences and assets.–The only store of value are one period bonds in zero net
supply. The price of the bonds then is

                                         1 +      ( )
which is today’s value of a unit of income next period. Today’s value of a unit of income
                              0

                                        , and so on. Thus in units of current consumption, the
                                                  P∞ −  0 (+ )

   The representative family has the option of borrowing and lending at the risk-free
rate, but rejects that option because every family is identical. Then the consumption of
the family is simply the average profit of its members

The stationary distribution Υ exists because of the death rate  among the managers.
A manager’s reputation dies with him and he is replaced by a newborn drawn from the
stationary distribution N (̄ ̄2 ).

                                                  16
       A firm’s decision problem.–A manager maximizes the discounted value of his family’s
consumption. Since the family owns many firms, idiosyncratic variations in eﬃciency
and reputation wash out. This is why we no longer need CARA preferences to derive
deterministic policies.17

       Definition of equilibrium.–An equilibrium consists of functions (  ∗     ), where
∗ solves (7) and (  ) clear the asset and goods markets. That is,   and ∗ are de-
terministic sequences, whereas  depends on  and . A simpler definition of equilibrium
uses only the firms’ first-order condition and the bond-price equation:

Definition 4 An equilibrium path is a pair of sequences {∗   }∞
                                                                   =0 that solves the Incentive-
Constraint and bond-pricing equations

If (·) is linear then (     ) = (̂ ̂ ̂) for all .

       The model has a unique equilibrium when consumers are risk neutral. By contrast,
when  00 (·)  0, the model has other equilibria, some of which are cyclical.


4.2        Stability and cycles
The structure of incentives is not fundamentally aﬀected by whether the problem is formu-
lated in partial or general equilibrium. Hence the results on stability and cycles presented
in Section 3 continue to hold in our macro setting. If anything, they hold more generally
  17
       The exogeneity of aggregate consumption implies that the manager’s payoﬀ is linear in investment.
Since this is also true in Holmström (1999), both models share important features. In particular, optimal
investment is deterministic and, as shown in the technical Appendix A.4, the necessary condition (19) is
also suﬃcient.


                                                                  17
because the representative family runs many firms and is insured against firm-level shock-
s. The lack of idiosyncratic risk implies that: (i) utility does not have to be CARA for
optimal investment to be deterministic; (ii) steady-state consumption does not depend on
the degree of risk aversion.

       Stability.–Using (i) we can generalize Proposition 2 to arbitrary utility functions.
Replacing the coeﬃcient of absolute risk aversion, , with a potentially consumption-
dependent measure,  () ≡ − 00 () 0 (), we find that the steady-state ̂ is locally
stable18 if and only if
                  µ                   ¶
                    1 −  + 2 0 (̂)  00 (̂)
                                                  2 (̂ − (̂))(1 −  0 (̂))                (22)
                     1 −  +  0 (̂)  0 (̂)
Condition (22), aside from being more general than its partial equilibrium counterpart
(15), is also more informative because ̂ does not depend anymore on risk aversion. This
is why (22) allows us to derive parametric restrictions under which the steady-state is
stable, as done in Proposition 5 for the most common classes of utility functions.19

Proposition 5 Assume that the utility function is either CARA, i.e., () = − exp(−),
or CRRA, i.e., () = 1− (1 − ). Then there exists a function ̃( ) such that the
steady-state is locally stable whenever   ̃( ).


       Cycles.–As in partial equilibrium, the model features global cycles of period 2. Final-
ly, as in partial equilibrium, local stability and global cycles are concomitant phenomena.
Propositions 5 and 6 confirm the intuition that cycles become sustainable when risk aver-
sion is strong enough.

Proposition 6 Assume that: (i) the equilibrium conditions in Definition 4 with ̄ =
0 are satisfied; (ii) the utility function is either CARA or CRRA; (iii) and the cost
function is quadratic, i.e., () = 2 2. Then deterministic 2-period cycles are sustainable
whenever the steady-state is locally stable.


       Cyclical properties of key variables–Among other properties of cycles, the following
have some empirical support.
  18
       See proof of Proposition 2.
  19
       See technical Appendix A.6 for an analysis of the eﬀect of  on equilibrium stability under both
CARA and CRRA preferences.

                                                   18
    1. Output is more volatile than consumption but less than investment: Ag-
      gregate output  is by definition equal to the sum of consumption  = ̄ +  −  ()
      and investment  (). Thus it is certainly smoother than investment since the latter
      is a convex function of . Consumption being given by the diﬀerence between the
      two, it has to fluctuate less than output.

    2. Product quality is pro-cyclical: Product quality is just  plus the average value
      of  and, since the latter is fixed, quality is procyclical as recently documented by
      Broda and Weinstein (2010) and Jaimovich, Rebelo and Wong (2015).

    3. Interest rates and consumption growth are positively related at low fre-
      quencies: The model implies that the rate of interest at  should be positively
      correlated with consumption growth between  and  + 1. Related to this, Brainard,
      Nelson, and Shapiro (1991) and Parker and Julliard (2005, Fig. 2) found that
      the Consumption-based Asset-Pricing Model performs better at a horizon of 2 or
      3 years. Our own calculations and figures, shown in Appendix A.3, provide more
      detailed empirical support for correlation at business-cycle frequencies and at the
      5-year frequency.


5     Calibration to micro data

5.1     Parametrization
We now show that the model produces realistic cycles when parameters are chosen to fit
micro data. The most important of these is period length, which depends on how fast a
firm’s history becomes public. We discuss this parameter last after all other dimensions
of the model have been parametrized.

    Choosing (   ).–These parameters determine the volatility of firms’ sales. Since
the same amount ∗ of input is used by all firms, they actually correspond to production
units and changes in sales are observationally equivalent to changes in revenues based
Total Factor Productivity (TFP).
    Estimates of the volatility of TFP are readily available in the empirical literature on
industry dynamics. Castro, Clementi and Lee (2015) use the Annual Survey and Census



                                            19
of Manufactures, for the years 1972 through 1997, to estimate the following equation

where  is the log-TFP for plant  at time  as estimated from a first stage regression
of real sales on capital, labor and materials. X is a vector of observables that are sys-
tematically related to innovations in TFP.20 Equation (23) is the empirical counterpart21

where   is the vintage of firm .22 Since the survival probability of firms follows a
geometric distribution, the cross-sectional variance of  is given by
                          "                       #              ∙             ¸

As  only depends on  and  , one can use the autocorrelation coeﬃcient  and the con-
ditional standard deviation of TFP growth to identify both volatility coeﬃcients. More
precisely, we estimate (   ) by solving two equations involving    and its autocor-
relation as follows:

                                                + ̄

where ̄−2 is given in (4). Castro, Clementi and Lee (2011) find that the condition-
al standard deviation of TFP across all manufacturing plants is equal to 2053% while

      Choosing ̄.–Having solved for (   ), we relax the normalization to zero of the
average firm eﬃciency ̄. Adding this extra degree of freedom allows the model to
generate recessions of similar magnitude and frequency to the ones observed in the data.
The NBER measure shows that, from 1854 to 2009, the duration between US recessions
averaged 56 months with a loss in GDP from peak to through of around 8%.23 For a
quadratic cost function, () = 2 2, these two targets are perfectly matched when the
average eﬃciency of firms ̄ = 106.24 For this average eﬃciency, the normality of output
is not a concern anymore because the share of firms with negative valuation is negligible.25

      Choosing ( ) –In today’s consumption, the value of a firm with market posterior
 is given recursively by
                         ∙ 0                                         ¸

This would be the stock price of such a firm if it were traded. Jarrell and Peltzman
(1985) estimate the stock-price impact of a product recall, and they estimate the “direct
costs ”of a product recall by assuming that all of the defective units become worthless on
recall. We interpret a recall as a negative surprise amounting to an output drop equal
to the direct cost. The direct cost is then a subtraction from today’s dividend, and eq.

 (1 − ) where  =  (1 − ). Jarrell and Peltzman, p. 521, estimate this ratio to be
12 which is matched by our values for  and . Our choice of parameters is summarized
in Table 1. Since we refer to    in annual data, the parameters are also reported at
yearly frequencies.


5.2    Period length
The speed of learning determines the length of the period and, hence, time between booms
and recessions. For the set of parameters summarized in Table 1, the bifurcation point ̃
has a value of 0708. Whether or not this is a reasonable discount factor depends on the
frequency at which consumers update their beliefs, i.e., the speed with which information
about a firm’s performance leaks out to the general public.
  Let  denote the duration of the model’s period in years, so that  =  +  +
P                          P
 =1 + and  = −1 +  =1 −1+ . The standard deviations of output and pro-
ductivity are both linearly increasing in the period’s duration and so is the dispersion of
posteriors ̄ , since its expression in (4) is homogeneous of degree 1 in (2  2 ). Hence,
raising  leaves the gain parameter  unchanged. In other words, the speed of information
acquisition aﬀects the model’s solution solely through its impact on the discount factor
. It follows that ̃ = (̃) ((1 − )) = 427 is the period length above which
endogenous cycles can occur.
   Fig. 4 illustrates the eﬀect that the speed of learning — i.e., period length — has on
cycles. Investment in the low and high phases of the cycle, as well as in the steady-
state, is reported in the left side panel. As the period duration rises the amplitude of the
oscillation increases and, as can be seen in the right side panel, generates larger cycles in
consumption.
   Using our yearly estimates for both  and  reported in Table 1, one can directly infer
the yearly updating frequency. The time distance between peak and trough is 56 months
or 5612 = 47 years. Since this exceeds the threshold value of ̃ = 427, the model is
capable of generating cycles at this frequency. Then the 47-year discount factor is ̃ =
                                                                  56
.975612 = 087, and the 47-year exit rate is ̃ = 1 − (1 − 005) 12 = 021 At this updating
frequency, cycles raise average reputational investment by 41%. The output gain nearly
compensates the cost of income volatility as welfare decreases by only 07%, a loss that
is equivalent to a compensating variation of 025% in consumption.
   Micro evidence shows reputation-diﬀusion lags can be on either side of the 4.7 years

threshold, depending on what type of product or service is involved. In other words, the
4.7 diﬀusion lag that the macro data call for is well within the range of what the micro
data say. We now discuss these pieces of evidence and explain how they can be gathered
from micro data.

5.2.1      Product age at recall as a measure of period length

Using data on automobile and drug recalls, Jarrell and Peltzman (1985) find that a firm’s
stock price plunges when it recalls one of its products, roughly at the same time. Thus
information about the firm’s quality (implied by the recall) spreads no faster and no slower
than the product recall.26
      We updated the auto recall data from the Department of Transportation, obtaining
48,000 cases. We measure the diﬀerence between the “start of manufacture” of the product
and the product’s recall date to be 4.14 years. This number is within 41447 = 88%
of the peak-to-trough business cycle distance. Details are in Appendix A.2 with Fig. 7
showing the frequency distribution of the ages of the products — there is considerable

heterogeneity in the products’ ages at recall, suggesting diﬀerences in the speed at which
information spreads.

   Cyclical behavior of recalls.–If low quality products are more likely to be produced
when  is low, i.e., in a recession, then product recalls should be higher in the boom,
one period later. That is what our model predicts: Recalls and consumption should be
positively correlated, and they are. We construct a time series of recalls and correlate it
with aggregate consumption — both series logged and detrended. Over the period 1978-
2007 the correlation is 0.30, and the series are shown in Fig. 6 in Appendix A.2.

5.2.2   Diﬀusion of innovations

Product-adoption lags are estimated in the marketing literature and a popular formulation
is the Bass model which can be summarized by is market-penetration function  , with
 = 1 denoting full penetration
                                  
                                     = ( +  ) (1 −  ) 
                                  
Sultan, Farley and Lehmann (1990) look at a broad range of product innovations and
estimate that  = 0.03, and  = 0.38, leading to a solution to the equation  ( ) = 12
of  = 65. Thus for the average product innovation, 50% of potential customers have
adopted it after 6.5 years.
   Process-diﬀusion lags are slightly longer. Consistent with the evidence on technology
adoption (Comin and Hobijn, 2010; Cox and Alm, 1996), Anzoategui et al. (2015) cal-
ibrate the mean technology diﬀusion lag to 7 years for the U.S. These delays would be
caused by a combination of awareness lags and switching costs. Such estimates overstate
the lags in customer response at the intensive margin — a customer can just buy less
without switching to a new supplier.

5.2.3   Sluggish growth of new plants

Foster, Haltiwanger and Syverson (2016) find that new plants have much lower demand
than incumbents in their industries, in spite of being at least as eﬃcient as incumbents.
They attribute it to sluggishness in new firms’ customer base, and argue that it is unlikely
that capital adjustment costs could explain the bulk of the 15+ years that it takes for



                                             24
plants in their sample to close their measured idiosyncratic demand gaps. Entrants (busi-
nesses 0-4 years old) have demand that is about 60% lower than that of “old” incumbents
(i.e., businesses over 15 years old). By the time plants are “medium” aged (10-14 years
old), their demand is only about 30% lower than incumbents. So it appears that it takes
5-10 years for half of the demand gap to be closed.
       In our model entrants come in as a representative draw of  from the stationary
distribution. Eq. (24) then gives the law of morion of beliefs conditional on the initial
draw of , but since  is a random walk this too is the expected long-run value of the
firm’s quality. Then our estimate of  = 05 implies that the half-life between starting
belief and long-run belief is just one period, which for us is close to 5 years.27


5.3        Micro and macro uncertainty
It is well documented (e.g., Comin and Philippon, 2005) that macro and micro volatility
moved in opposite directions during the great moderation. According to our model, this
negative correlation can be explained by an increase in the noisiness of the technology.
Although aggregate cycles are driven by the learning process, and thus depend on the
degree of idiosyncratic uncertainty, higher volatility at the micro level does not necessary
translate into greater cycles at the macro level. The sign of the relationship depends on
whether higher firm volatility is due to more innovations in fundamental productivity, as
measured by  , or to more noisiness in output, as measured by  .
       These two sources of idiosyncratic uncertainty have opposite eﬀects on , i.e., on
the inertia of the updating process. More weight is put on recent observations when
 is higher because types are more volatile. Then reputation is more responsive to
investment which strengthens the power of incentives. On the other hand,  lowers the
power of incentives because recent observations are less informative when output quality is
noisier. This explains why the two parameters aﬀect steady-state investment in opposite
directions.

Proposition 7 The steady-state level of investment ̂ is increasing in the volatility of
productivity  but decreasing in the volatility of output  .
  27
       In eq. (5) a deviation  raises beliefs next period by the factor 1 − . The value was obtained not
from the peak-trough interval lengths, but from the estimate in eq. (25).

reported in Table 1.


      The proposition is illustrated in Fig. 5. Firms’ reputations become more sluggish as 
increases which lowers their reputational concerns, resulting in less investment, and thus
consumption, at the steady-state. Fig. 5 also shows that a similar conclusion holds for
cycles: their amplitude declines when  goes up. And since  is increasing in  , more
noisiness in output quality lowers macro-volatility but increases micro-volatility.


6       Related models
In contrasting to other work, it helps to recall why reputation, an intangible, diﬀers from
other types of capital, human or physical. Our model oﬀers two reasons:
      () investment in reputation raises current consumption, and
      () investment today does not raise future output or aggregate consumption.
We now discuss related models, with special reference to () and ().

      1. Learning by doing.–LBD is the closest-related line of research because it shares
with our model the feature that higher eﬀort today raises an agent’s income in the future.
Here is a version of LBD that compares closely to our model.28 Let  denote the stock
 28
      In-depth discussions of LBD are in Chang, Gomes and Schorfheide (2002), Qureshi (2008), and Gunn

                                                                26
of firm-specific human capital and  the investment in human capital, again measured in
terms of goods. Assume that

                                =  +  − () and,                                           (27)
                              0 = (1 − ) +  with  ∈ (0 1)                              (28)

Property () does not hold because firms set  beyond the point where  is maximized29
and therefore increasing  reduces current consumption instead of raising it. Property ()
does not hold either because in (28), higher investment raises 0 , and so increases output
and consumption tomorrow. Thus higher values of  lower the discount factor and LBD
exerts a stabilizing force which prevents the emergence of deterministic cycles.
   2. Discount-factor shocks.–Our model generates discount factor movements. One can
also shock the discount factor exogenously as do Werning (2012), or Albertini and Poirier
(2014), and obtain cycles with procyclical incentives to invest. But unless the shocked
model features property (), cycles would be mitigated by a rise in current  0 () that
would arise as  drops.
   3. Other pecuniary externalities.–Our model features a strategic complementarity in
 induced by a pecuniary external eﬀect. Cycles in Shleifer (1986) also originate in a
pecuniary external eﬀect, but one that is due to simultaneous product introductions by
monopolists. One needs risk aversion to be low ( ≤ 1) for his model to yield cycles. In
the same vein, Judd (1985) and Matsuyama (1999) feature cycles with alternating periods
of competition and monopoly.

switching in a model whose geometric structure is related to ours and where, as in Ben-

production.

     Current output is maximized when  =  −1 (1). Thus the observation that investment exceeds its
output-maximizing level directly follows from the firm’s FOC

enough, investment can have echo eﬀects that take a long time to die out (See Boucekkine,
Germain and Licandro, 1997; Mitra, Ray and Roy, 1990). Permanent investment cycles
arise only if utility is linear. In a two sector model in which production of the consumption
good is capital intensive compared to that of the capital good, an abundance of capital
today raises current consumption and lowers investment and capital tomorrow, at which
point the process is reversed. Benhabib and Nishimura (1985) show that this mechanism
works if factor intensities diﬀer suﬃciently, and if the utility function is not too concave.
These models all entail a counterfactual negative correlation between consumption and
investment over time.
    Finally, the literature on reputation concerns has seemingly not addressed cycles. Kon-
do and Papanikolaou (2013) study how the value of future business acts as a (productive)
discipline device — a firm that expropriates the knowledge of a partner acquires a bad rep-
utation and it is precluded from partnering with others in the future. One can imagine
time-dependent punishments that would generate movements in aggregate activity.


7     Conclusion
We have shown that deterministic cycles may arise when contracts are incomplete —
one cannot condition payment on output — and when products are experience goods.
Calibrated to fit some micro facts, the model produces realistic cycles in terms of peak-
to-trough movements in consumption and the spacing of time between recessions. The
frequency of booms and recessions depends on the speed with which reputations spread
— the slower the diﬀusion, the longer is the inter-arrival time of recessions.
    For the mechanism to work the economy must be closed or, at the micro level, borrow-
ing and lending must not be possible. A promising avenue for future research would be
to relax these assumptions. Adding a storable commodity would allow agents to smooth
consumption and thus partially dampen fluctuations. Then risk aversion should have an
ambiguous eﬀect on the sustainability of cycles since the consumption-smoothing motive
is increasing in the curvature of the utility function. Oscillatory behavior will probably
continue to arise for intermediate degree of risk aversion, especially if regime switches are
allowed to be stochastic. Another interesting extension would be to let firms adjust the
size of their observable output. Enriching the technology of production so that both quan-
tity and hidden quality are optimally set would make it possible to embed our mechanism


                                             28
within otherwise standard macro models, thereby providing a new microfoundation for
intangible capital as well as more elaborate tests for the relevance of reputation cycles.

A      Appendix

A.1     Proofs
Proof. Proposition 1: We are interested in 2-period cycles where ∗ = ̄ when  is
even, and ∗ = 0 when  is odd. Using the notation

                                         () ≡ exp ( (1 − ) )                                            (30)

and taking into account the feasibility constraint  ∈ [0 ̄], we see that the Kuhn-Tucker
conditions resulting from the incentive compatibility constraint (7) are
                ⎛                                     ⎞

and
                ⎛                                                        ⎞
           1−⎝           X

These two conditions can be re-written as
                                                              "           #
             1                                                  1 − ()2
                  ≤ (  ) ≤ (̄), where  (  ) ≡                −                              (31)

The following cases have to be distinguished:

           2 −()2
  1.  ≤    1−()2
                      :   Then  (  ) ≤ 0 and, since (̄)  0, the first inequality in (31)
      cannot be satisfied. Intuitively, the costs  are so low that it is never optimal to set
     ∗ = 0.

  2.  ∈  1−()  2  1−
                              : Then  (  ) ∈ (0 1] and, using the definition of ()
      in (30), we find that the first inequality in (31), 1(̄) ≤ (  ), is satisfied
      whenever ̄ ≥ − log((  ))[ (1 − )]. As for the second inequality, it follows
     from 1(̄) ≤ 1 that (̄) ≥ 1 ≥ (  ).
         ³        ´
           (1−)
  3.  ∈ 1−  1 : Then (  )  1 and the second inequality in (31),  (  ) ≤
      (̄), is satisfied whenever ̄ ≥ log((  ))[ (1 − )]. The first inequality im-
      mediately follows from (̄) ≥  (  )  1  1(̄).

                                                        33
   Proposition 1 focuses on case 3. It also compares it to the steady-state solution. To
show that ̂ = 0 is the unique steady-state when  ∈ ((1 − )(−1 − ) 1), set ∗ = ̂ for
all  ≥  in (9). The resulting incentive constraint reads  =  (1 −  + ), a requirement
that cannot be satisfied since we are focusing on cases where   (1 − )(−1 − ). Hence
̂  0 cannot be incentive compatible as the agent would like to deviate by investing less
than ̂. However, such deviations are not feasible when ∗ = 0 for all , and so ̂ = 0 is
indeed the only rest point.

Proof. Proposition 2: We want to characterize deterministic dynamics near the steady-
state ̂. Let  ( ) = +1 denote the implicit map so that  () =  ( ()), where
 () ≡ 0 ()  0 ( −  ()) and  () ≡  0 ( −  ()) [1 −  + 0 ()]. Diﬀerentiating the
incentive constraint (13) at the steady-state, we find that
                            ¯
             0       +1 ¯¯             (̂) −  (̂ −  (̂)) [1 − 0 ()]
            (̂) ≡               =                                                        (32)
                       ¯ =̂      0
                                      (̂)
                                           0   (̂) −  (̂ −  (̂)) [1 − 0 ()]
                                      1−+ (̂)

where  () = − 00 () 0 () and  () = 00 ()  0 ().
   The steady-state ̂ is locally stable if |0 (̂) | ∈ [0 1). Since the numerator in (32) is
always higher than the denominator, the stability condition can be satisfied solely if the
denominator is negative. Let us focus first on cases where the numerator is positive while
the denominator is negative. Then it is easy to verify that 0 (̂) ∈ (−1 0] whenever (15)
is satisfied. The other possibility is that both numerator and denominator are negative,
then
                     0 (̂) ∈ [0 1) ⇔  (̂)   (̂ −  (̂))(1 − 0 (̂))            (33)

a condition that is actually more stringent than (15).

   Proposition 3 can be proved in a similar way to Proposition 1. Thus we first use a
direct approach by changing variable and defining a new fixed point problem.

Lemma 8 Let
                                              (1 − )
                                    () ≡             ( + ) 
                                             1 − ()2
2-period cycles are sustainable when the fixed point problem
                                                     0 (((1)))
                                    = () ≡                                               (34)
                                                      0 ((()))
admits a solution ∗ .

                                                    34
Proof. Lemma 8: We focus on 2-period cycles and denote this period action by , next
period by 0  the period after by , and so on. In other words, we have the discount factors
from today til tomorrow and from tomorrow til the day after, respectively,

                                 ≡  ( 0 ) =  0 ((0 )) 0 (())                          (35)
                                 0 ≡  (0  ) = 1 ( 0 )                                   (36)

Therefore, if we start at  = 0, so that  is the action at  = 0 2 4 6 and 0 the action
for  = 1 3 5 7  then the incentive constraint (7) is satisfied when ( 0 ) solve the

These simplify to

                                         1 − ()
Thus there are 4 equations (35), (36), (37), and (38), and 4 unknowns, ( 0    0 )  One
solution is (̂ ̂ 1 1) where ̂ = (1 − )(−1 − ), which is a version of Holmström’s
(1999) Proposition 1. Now let’s treat  as a parameter to begin with. Investment as a
function of  = ( 0 ) is given by
                         (1 − )                  0       (1 − ) ¡      −1
                                                                              ¢
                () =             ( + )  and   () =            +      
                         1 − ()2                         1 − ()2
Thus our problem is equivalent to looking for a fixed point in  of the function  ()
defined in (34).

Proof. Proposition 3: Since  () = −exp(−), it follows from the definition in (34)
                                               2

have  (̄)  1. By continuity of the mapping  (·), there will be a fixed point  ∈ (1 ̄)
if 0 (1)  1 Diﬀerentiating  (·), we obtain

and so

This expression can be simplified as (1) = ̂ = (1 − )(−1 − ) so that

                                 (1 − )      ̂   (1)

                                1 − ()    1 +  1 + 

Reinserting this equality into the previous equation we get

                           0 (1)  1 ⇔ 2 [1 − (1)] (1)  1 + 

which implies in turn that
                                   1
                                 (1)

                                        −  (1 − (1))

This allows us to conclude that the steady-state is stable since equation (32) with quadrat-
ic costs and CARA utility reads

where the last equality follows from expression of the rest-point (1) = (1 − )(−1 − ).



Proof. Corollary 5: The corollary immediately follows from the fact that investment
at the steady-state ̂ = (1 − )(−1 − ) does not depend on the degree of risk aversion.
Since  (̂ − (̂)) = (̂ − (̂)) when the function is CRRA, and  () =  when the
function is CARA, it is easily seen that, in both cases, (22) is equivalent to imposing a
lower bound on .

Proof. Proposition 6: When the utility function is CARA, the proof is similar to the one
of Proposition 3 with  replacing . When the utility is CRRA, so that () = 1− (1−),
                                                                                          2
it follows from the definition (34) of  (·) that  (1) = 1 Let ̄ ≡ 2 1−()

Proof. Proposition 7: Since   1, the ratio (1 − )(−1 − ) is decreasing in . Then,
given that  0 (̂) is increasing in ̂, the definition of ̂ =  0−1 ((1 − )(−1 − )) implies
that the rest-point is decreasing in . To see how this gain parameter varies with the
variance coeﬃcients 2 and 2 , note that

so that   0 while   0. Hence the variance coeﬃcients have opposite
eﬀect on , and thus ̂.



A.2     Product recall data and calculations
The product recall data are taken from the National Highway Traﬃc Safety Adminis-
tration of the Department of Transportation (NHTSA). The data contain all NHTSA
safety-related information on defects and compliance from the late 1960s. This includes
report-received date, record-creation date, model of the car, and the date of manufacture.
We construct the quarterly recall data as follows: We
   1. removed the observations with missing report-received date, and/or date of the
start of manufacture and/or date of the end of manufacture. We ended up with 48014
product-recall cases in total.

    2. sorted the cases by the report-received date, and created quarterly bins from 1966Q4
to 2012Q3.
    3. calculated the number of total recalls in each bin.
    4. further removed the bins with consecutive zero observations and ended up with the
final sample spanning from 1978Q1 to 2007Q3.
    5. took logs and time-detrended the observations in each remaining bin.
    The time series plot of resulting recalls is in Fig. 6. The two series are positively
correlated as the 2-period cycle equilibrium implies; faulty products are made in recessions
and recalled the next period, i.e., in the boom.
    Fig. 7 shows the frequency distribution of the ages of the products at the time of
recall.

A.3        Consumption growth and the real rate
Fig. 8 reports real consumption growth and real interest rates over the 14 peak-trough or
through-peak episodes that our data cover. The correlation between the two series (both
are annualized) is 0.11.30 For example, the two data points for 2001 mean the following:
       () Nominal personal consumption expenditure growth 1991-2001 (annualized),
       () the annualized nominal 10-year bond rate realized in 1991,
       () the annualized inflation rate from 1991-2001 was substracted from both.
The model prediction is given by the formula

                                           1 +  =  − 

where  is the time interval between the peak and trough or trough and peak as the case
may be, and where  = 097 and  = 4 as in the calibration. Interest rates are smoother

       For real consumption we use the monthly total personal consumption expenditure (PCE), deflated
by the PCE deflator. The sample interest rates consists of 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and 10-year treasury
constant maturity rate. By matching — as closely as possible — the gap between each recession date with
the maturity of the bond, the sample includes nine 1-year rates, one 3-year rate, two 5-year rates and
three 10-year rates. The real interest rate is obtained by deflating the nominal rate by the PCE deflator.
Neither real consumption growth nor real interest rates are annualized. The sample includes 8 NBER
recession dates from 1960:03 to 2009:06.

       More generally, and as discussed below, the empirically relevant frequency for aggre-
gate cycles is 4.7 years. Thus we are referring to 4.7-year bond rates predicting 4.7-year
consumption growth. Table 2 reports some supporting evidence that uses the 5-year
frequency for both consumption growth and bond returns.31

Forecasting Regression

We regress 5-year nominal consumption growth +5 on the 5-year bond nominal return
+5 and on five lagged inflation rates −1  −2 ,..., −5 . Regression results are reported
with and without a constant in column (1) and (2) of Table 2 respectively.
       Data Sources.– All series are annual. Consumption is Personal Consumption Ex-
penditures in Billions of Dollars (PCE on FRED). The 5-year bond yield is the 5-Year
Treasury Constant Maturity Rate (GS5 on FRED). Past inflation is calculated from the
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPIAUCSL_PCH on FRED).

                        TECHNICAL APPENDIX

A.4     Suﬃciency of necessary conditions.
The problem analyzed in Holmström (1999) is extremely tractable because returns are
linear in eﬀort. In order to allow for concave returns, we first recursively derive the agent’s
problem both on and oﬀ the equilibrium path. Hence we consider arbitrary strategies and
let  ≡  − ∗ denote the deviation from equilibrium eﬀort at each date. We wish to
relate the agent’s and market’s posteriors about , which we denote  and  respectively.
Bayes rule implies that

                                 1 −  X − ¡           1 −  X −
                                                                      
                                                     ¢
              +1   − +1   =              −  = −                               (40)
                                    =0                     =0

   Let ∆ denote the following weighted mean of past deviations

                          ∆ = ∆−1 + (1 − )−1 with ∆0 = 0                             (41)

It follows from (40) that
                                        =  − ∆ 

We can use this relationship to specify the agent’s expectations about the law of motion of
beliefs. First notice that  −  =  −  +  +  . Since  −  is normally distributed
with mean 0 and variance ̄2 , the innovation process from the agent’s standpoint is a
normally distributed variable,  ∼ N (0 ̄2 + 2 ), such that  =  +  +  . Reinserting
this decomposition into the law of motion of market’s beliefs, we find that

+1 =  + (1 − ) =  + (1 − )[ − ∗ −  ] =  + (1 − )[ − ∗ +  −  +  ]
      =  + (1 − )[ − ∆ +  ]                                                        (42)

The normality of  implies that the distribution of the posterior is
                                          µ                                 ¶
                                            +1 − [ + (1 − )( − ∆ )]
              (+1 |   ∆   ) = Φ                                     

where Φ(·) is the standard normal CDF.
   Given the per-period utility function  ( ∗  ), and the deterministic but potentially
time-varying discount factor  , the agent’s value function on and oﬀ the equilibrium path

                                               42

   Partial equilibrium model.–In Section 3, the discount factor  is constant over time
and the utility function reads  ( ∗  ) = − exp(−[ + ∗ −  (∗ + )]). We first show
that the value function is log-linear in .

Lemma 9 The value function of the partial equilibrium model with CARA utility is of
the form
                               ( ∆) = exp(−) (0 ∆)                                  (44)

and the agent’s policy function is deterministic.

Proof. To verify the conjecture, we change the variable of integration of the Bellman eq.

The second equality follows reinserting our guess (44), while the third equality follows
directly from the Bellman equation (43) defining  . Since the functional equation is a
contraction mapping, the value function is unique and its policy function  identical across
all market’s beliefs .
   Hence, the agent chooses a sequence of deterministic actions that only depend on the
cumulative stock of past deviations ∆. In other words, optimal policies are deterministic
on and oﬀ the equilibrium path. We can therefore focus, without loss of generality, on
sequences of deterministic solutions, which allows us to directly establish the suﬃciency
of the FOC.

The second equality holds true because the Bayesian map (45) is linear in , while the
inequality is a direct consequence of the concavity of the per-period utility function com-
bined with the convexity of the cost function. We can conclude from (46) that U is a
strictly concave functional in the space of action sequences. Thus any local maximum of
U is also a global maximum. A necessary condition for U to have a maximum at ∗ is
that its Gateaux derivative U(∗ ; ) = 0 for all  ∈ A∞ . This requirement yields the
necessary FOC (9) which, by strict concavity of the objective, is also suﬃcient.

   General equilibrium model.–In Section 4, the objective of the manager is linear as
 ( ∗  ) =  + ∗ − (∗ + ), but the discount factor,  =  0 (+1 )  0 ( ), follows
the changes in aggregate consumption.

Lemma 10 The agent’s value function in the general equilibrium model reads

                                       ( ∆) = 0 + 1  + 2 ∆                                (47)

                                                        44
where 0 , 1 and 2 are time-varying coeﬃcients whose expressions are given in (49),
(50) and (51), respectively. The deterministic equilibrium path ∗ is incentive compatible
if the necessary condition (19) is satisfied for all  ≥ 0.

Proof. The Bellman equation reads

The second equality follows using our guess (47) for the next period value function and
replacing ∆0 by its law of motion (41). Reinserting (47) on the left-hand side of the
Bellman equation, we find that the conjecture is verified when  = 0 and

which is indeed equivalent to the incentive constraint (19).
    When  is constant over time, the discount factor  remains fixed and (52) is equiva-
lent to the incentive constraint (22) in Holmström (1999), where  and  stands for  and

                                                    45
 in our notation. Lemma 10 shows that adding a discount factor that varies over time
in a deterministic fashion does not modify the structure of the problem. An additional
insight is that agents with private information about their types take the same action
than those that are on the equilibrium path. Hence, multiple deviations are never opti-
mal when returns are linear. By contrast, in the partial equilibrium model with CARA
utility, optimal strategies on and oﬀ the equilibrium path did not coincide.


A.5       Asymmetric cycles.
Proposition 11 derives conditions under which cycles of period 3 can be constructed using
the partial equilibrium model with linear costs described in Subsection 3.1. It focuses on
asymmetric cycles with protracted booms and sudden busts. The logic of the proof can be
applied to study reverse cases and to show that cycles with protracted slumps and sudden
booms can be sustained when   (1 − )(−1 − ). Furthermore, it is cumbersome but
relatively straightforward to extend the proof so as to construct cycles with more than 3
states.

Proposition 11 Consider the partial equilibrium model with CARA utility and linear
costs, i.e., () = . Assume that  satisfies the compatible conditions

Proof. Proposition 11: We propose a constructive proof. We study each action in turn
and prove their incentive compatibility

   1. ∗ = ̄: Since we are focusing on cases where   (1 − )(1 − ), we have

                      1−        X
                                 ∞

                                                      

                                                 46
  The last inequality follows from the definition of (·) in (30) because ̄ ≥ ∗+ for all
  , and so (̄ − ∗+ ) ≥ 1, with strict inequality for some . Since the last expression
  in (54) measures the discounted returns from investment at date , the feasibility
  constraint binds and ∗ = ̄ is indeed incentive compatible.

2. ∗ = 0: At the lower-bound of the feasibility set, costs must exceed returns so that

  The last equality follows from the fact that the incentive constraint must hold with
  equality in the next period because ∗+1 = ̃ ∈ (0 ̄). The condition is satisfied
  whenever                                         ³                 ´

3. ∗ = ̃ ∈ (0 ̄): First, we assume that condition (55) holds as an equality and we
  show that there exists a unique value of ̄ which renders ̃ incentive compatible.
  Since ̃ is interior, the incentive constraint has to hold exactly, i.e.,
               1− X

             =  (̃ − ̄)  ⎝1 −  +  ⎣                            ()−1 (̄ − ∗+ )⎦⎠

                (̃ − ̄)  (1 −  + )   (̃ − ̄) 

  The first inequality follows from step 1 above, while the second one holds true
  because   (1 − )(1 − ). It shows that  (̃ − ̄) has to be inferior to one,

        there exists a unique value, which we denote ̄ , such that ̃ = ̃ and (56) is
        satisfied. To verify that (57) is consistent with (1 − )(1 − )  , notice that
                           ∙                                ¸           ∙                   ¸

        This inequality is equivalent to   2 (1 − ) [1 +  − ()2 ], which yields a
        lower-bound that is inferior to the term on the right-hand side of (53) as well as to
        (1 − )(1 − ). Hence the two conditions in (53) are compatible since they define
        a non-empty interval. As with period-2 cycles, low levels of investment can never
        be incentive compatible when costs are too small.

      We still have to prove that our cycles are sustainable when ̄  ̄ . Diﬀerentiating
(56) with respect to both ̄ and ̃, one finds that ̃̄ ∈ (0 1). The derivative being
positive, ̃  ̃ if ̄  ̄ , and the condition (55) for incentive compatibility of ∗ = 0
is satisfied. Furthermore, the derivative being smaller than one ensures that ̃ remains
within the interior of the feasible set as ̄ increases.


A.6       Eﬀect of discount factor  on stability of the steady-state.
Proposition 12 Assume that: (i) the equilibrium conditions in Definition 4 are satisfied;
(ii) the utility function is CRRA; (iii) costs are quadratic, i.e., () = 2 . There exists a
unique bifurcation point ̃( ) ∈ (0 1) such that the steady-state is locally stable if and
only if   ̃( ). The bifurcation point ̃ is increasing in the coeﬃcient of risk aversion
. Moreover, productivity volatility,  , and output volatility,  , have opposite eﬀects on

   The model exhibits a flip bifurcation so that a period 2 cycle coexists with the steady
state solution as  gets close enough to the critical value ̃. At the bifurcation point ̃, the
rest point becomes unstable and there are no other stable solutions in its neighborhood.
Fig. 9 separates the ( ) plane into a stable and an unstable region. As stated in
Proposition 5, there exists a value of  above which the steady-state is always stable.
The discount factor  has an opposite impact to  since, as stated in Proposition 12, the
equilibrium is stable when  is smaller than some threshold. This is intuitive because
an increase in  lowers the degree of absolute risk aversion through its positive eﬀect
on output. Patient firms invest more in their reputation, which raises consumption and
generates a wealth eﬀect that renders agents less risk averse. This mechanism is not

operative when preferences are CARA and not CRRA. Then, the absolute degree of risk
aversion remains constant and, as shown in Proposition 13, the relationship between the
discount factor and the stability of the equilibrium becomes ambiguous.

Proposition 13 Assume that: (i) the equilibrium conditions in Definition 4 are satisfied;
(ii) the utility function is CARA; (iii) costs are quadratic, i.e., () = 2 . The steady-
state is always unstable when   42 . By contrast, when   4(2 − ), there exists
a non empty interval ( ( )  ( )) such that the steady-state is locally stable if and
only if  ∈ ( ( )  ( )).

where the last equality follows from the expression of the rest-point ̂ = (1 − )(1 −
). The steady-state ̂ is locally stable if |0 (̂) | ∈ [0 1). We now study under which
conditions this requirement is satisfied:

    (i) If   42 , the denominator (̂) in (59) is always positive. Since the numerator
(̂)  (̂), we have 0 (̂) = (̂)(̂)  1, and the steady-state is locally unstable.

                                                                  50
   (ii) If  ∈ (42  4), the numerator (̂) is always positive while the denominator (̂)
might be negative. Thus the steady-state is stable when 0 (̂) ∈ (−1 0), i.e., when

                                                    (1 − )
                             () ≡ 2(1 − )                − (1 + )  0               (60)
                                                   (1 − )2

As  goes from 0 to 1, the first term of (60) starts at 0 and converges again to 0, while
the second term goes from −1 to −(1 + ). Hence, the number of roots of (·) has to be
even. Diﬀerentiating (·) twice, one finds that

                                                     1 − 2 +  
                                  0 () = 2(1 − )               − 

                                                      (1 − )4


   We distinguish two cases:

  1.   12: Then  00 ()  0 for all  ∈ (0 1) and  0 (·) can be positive solely if
       0 (0) = 2(1 − ) −   0, i.e., if   [2(1 − )]. Since  (0) = −1, there is no root
      when   12 and   [2(1 − )]. Conversely,  0 (·) may have some roots when
        [2(1 − )]. However, the strict concavity of (·), along with the terminal
      conditions  (0) = −1  (1) = −1 − , ensure that (·) has either zero or two roots
      in (0 1).

   2.   12: Then  00 () ≷ 0 ⇔ (2 − 1)(2 − 2 ) ≷ , and so the function  (·) has a
      unique inflection point in (0 1). This implies in turn that the terminal conditions
      (0) = −1  (1) = −1 −  can be satisfied solely if  (·) has either zero or two
      roots in (0 1).

   Having shown that (·) has at most two roots, we now establish a suﬃcient condition
for their existence. The continuity of (·), and the fact that it is negative at both ends of
the unit interval, imply that it is suﬃcient to identify a parametric restriction under which
 (·) reaches positive values within (0 1). A tractable expression is obtained focusing on
̂ = 12, since

Thus, provided that   4(2−),  (·) has two roots ( ()  ()) ∈ (0 1)2 . Furthermore,
 ( )  0, and so the steady-state is stable for all  ∈ ( ()  ()).

   (iii) If   4, the numerator (̂) and denominator (̂) may become negative.
However, the inequality (̂)  (̂) ensures that 0 (̂) = (̂)(̂) ∈ (0 1) whenever
(̂)  0, which implies in turn that  must belong to ( ()  ()). Since 0 (̂) is
continuous over the interval [̂( ()) ̂( ())], we know that |0 (̂) | ∈ (0 1), implying
that the steady-state is stable for all  ∈ ( ()  ()).
   Fig. 10 shows how the risk aversion coeﬃcient  widens the stable interval described
in Proposition 13. Eventually, stability is always ensured for high enough values of .
