                                            ABSTRACT

New goods play a central role in many trade and growth models. We use detailed trade and firm-level
data from a large developing economy—India—to investigate the relationship between declines in
trade costs, the imports of intermediate inputs and domestic firm product scope. We estimate substantial
static gains from trade through access to new imported inputs. Accounting for new imported varieties
lowers the import price index for intermediate goods on average by an additional 4.7 percent per year
relative to conventional gains through lower prices of existing imports. Moreover, we find that lower
input tariffs account on average for 31 percent of the new products introduced by domestic firms, which
implies potentially large dynamic gains from trade. This expansion in firms' product scope is driven
to a large extent by international trade increasing access of firms to new input varieties rather than
by simply making existing imported inputs cheaper. Hence, our findings suggest that an important
consequence of the input tariff liberalization was to relax technological constraints through firms’
access to new imported inputs that were unavailable prior to the liberalization.

1.   Introduction
         New intermediate inputs play a central role in many trade and growth models. These
models predict that firms benefit from international trade through their increased access to
previously unavailable inputs, and this process generates static gains from trade. Access to these
new imported inputs in turn enables firms to expand their domestic product scope through the
introduction of new varieties which generates dynamic gains from trade. Despite the prominence
of these models, we have surprisingly little evidence to date on the relevance of the underlying
microeconomic mechanisms.
         In this paper we take a step towards bridging the gap between theory and evidence by
examining the relationship between new imported inputs and the introduction of new products by
domestic firms in a large and fast growing developing economy: India. During the 1990’s, India
experienced an explosion in the number of products manufactured by Indian firms, and these new
products accounted for a quarter of India’s manufacturing growth (Goldberg, Khandelwal, Pavcnik
and Topalova, henceforth GKPT, forthcoming). During the same period, India also experienced a
surge in imported inputs, with more than two-thirds of the intermediate import growth occurring in
new varieties. The goal of this paper is to determine if the increase in Indian firms’ access to new
imported inputs can explain the introduction of new products in the domestic economy by these
firms.
         One of the challenges in addressing this question is the potential reverse causality between
imports of inputs and new domestic products. For instance, firms may decide to introduce new
products for reasons unrelated to international trade. Once the manufacturing of such products
begins, the demand for imported inputs, both existing and new varieties, may increase. This would
lead to a classic reverse causality problem: the growth of domestic products could lead to the
import of new varieties and not vice versa. To identify the relationship between changes in imports
of intermediates and introduction of new products by domestic firms, we exploit the particular
nature of India’s trade reform. The reform reduced input tariffs differentially across sectors and was
not subject to the usual political economy pressures because the reform was unanticipated by
Indian firms.
         Our analysis proceeds in two steps. We first offer strong reduced-form evidence that
declines in input tariffs resulted in an expansion of firms’ product scope: industries that experienced
the largest declines in input tariffs contributed relatively more to the introduction of new products

                                                   2
by domestic firms.2 The relationship is also economically significant: lower input tariffs account on
average for 31 percent of the observed increase in firms' product scope over this period. Moreover,
the relationship is robust to specifications that control for pre-existing industry- and firm-specific
trends. We also find that lower input tariffs improved the performance of firms in other dimensions
including output, TFP and research and development (R&D) activity that are consistent with the link
between trade and growth.
         In order to investigate the channels through which input tariff liberalization affected
domestic product growth in India, we then impose additional structure guided by the methods of
Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein (2006) and use India’s Input-Output (IO) Table to
construct exact input price indices for each sector. The exact input price index is composed of two
parts: a part that captures changes in prices of existing inputs and a part that quantifies the impact
of new imported varieties on the exact price index. Thus, we can separate the changes in the exact
input price indices faced by firms into a “price” and “variety” channel. This methodology reveals
substantial gains from trade through access to new imported input varieties: accounting for new
imported varieties lowers the import price index for intermediate goods on average by an
additional 4.7 percent per year relative to conventional gains through lower prices of existing
imports.
         We relate the two components of the input price indices to changes in firm product scope.
The results suggest an important role for the extensive margin of imported inputs. Greater access to
imported varieties increases firm scope. This relationship is robust to an instrumental variable
strategy that accounts for the potential endogeneity of input price indices using input tariffs and
proximity of India's trading partners as instruments. Hence, we conclude that input tariff
liberalization contributed to domestic product growth not simply by making available imported
inputs cheaper, but, more importantly, by relaxing technological constraints facing such producers
via access to new imported input varieties that were unavailable prior to the liberalization.3


2
  Recent theoretical work by Bernard, Redding and Schott (2006), Eckel and Neary (forthcoming) and Nocke and
Yeaple (2006) shows that trade liberalizations should lead firms to rationalize their product scope. These
theoretical models focus on the role of final goods and tariffs on output, while the analysis of this paper focuses on
input tariffs and the role of intermediates.
3
  The importance of increased access to imported inputs has been noted by Indian policy makers. In a recent
speech, the managing director of the Indian Reserve Bank Rakesh Mohan argued that “trade liberalization and
tariff reforms have provided increased access to Indian companies to the best inputs available globally at almost
world prices” (Mohan 2008).
                                                          3
         These findings relate to two distinct, yet related, literatures. First, endogenous growth
models, such as the ones developed by Romer (1987, 1990) and Rivera-Batiz and Romer (1991),
emphasize the static and dynamic gains arising from the import of new varieties. Not only do such
varieties lead to productivity gains in the short and medium run, the resulting growth fosters the
creation of new domestic varieties that further contribute to growth. The first source of (static)
gains has been addressed in the empirical literature before. Existing studies document a large
expansion in new imported varieties [Feenstra (1994), Broda and Weinstein (2006), Arkolakis,
Demidova, Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (2008), Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997)], which,
depending on the overall importance of new imported varieties in the total volume of trade, can
generate substantial gains from trade [see, for example, Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein
(2006)].4 Our evidence points to large static gains from trade because of increased access to
imported inputs.
         The second (dynamic) source of gains from trade has been empirically elusive, partly
because data on the introduction of domestic varieties produced in each country have been difficult
to obtain.5 The two studies that are closest to ours [Broda, Greenfield and Weinstein (2006) and
Feenstra, Madani, Yang, and Liang (1999)] resort to export data to overcome this difficulty. They
use the fraction of the economy devoted to exports and industry-specific measures of export
varieties as proxies for domestic R&D and domestic variety creation, respectively. The advantage of
our data is that we directly observe the creation of new varieties by domestic firms. This enables us
to link the creation of new domestic varieties to changes in imported inputs. In our framework,
trade encourages creation of new domestic varieties because Indian trade liberalization significantly
reduces tariffs on imported inputs. This leads to imports of new varieties of intermediate products,
which in turn enables the creation of new domestic varieties. Hence, new imported varieties of
intermediate products go hand-in-hand in our context with new varieties of domestic products.
         Our study also relates to the literature on the effects of trade liberalization on total factor
productivity. Several theoretical papers have emphasized the importance of intermediate inputs for
productivity growth [e.g., Ethier (1979, 1982), Markusen (1989), Romer (1987, 1990), Grossman and
Helpman (1991)]. Empirically, most recent studies have found imports of intermediates or declines

4
  Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997) and Arkolakis, Demidova, Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (2008) find small
variety gains following the Costa-Rican trade liberalization, which they attribute to the fact that the new varieties
were imported in small quantities, thus contributing little to welfare.
5
  Brambilla (2006) is an exception.

                                                          4
in input tariffs to be associated with sizeable productivity gains [see Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008),
Amiti and Konings (2007), Halpern, Koren and Szeidl (2006)], with Muendler (2004) being an
exception. Our findings are in line with the majority of the empirical literature on this subject, as we
too document positive effects of input trade liberalization and imported intermediates. However, in
contrast to earlier work, our main focus is not on TFP, but rather on the domestic product margin.6
As noted by Erdem and Tybout (2003) and De Loecker (2007), a potential problem with the
interpretation of the TFP findings, is that the use of revenue data to calculate TFP implies that it is
not possible to identify the effects of trade liberalization on physical efficiency separately from its
effects on firm markups, product quality, and in the case of multi-product firms, the range of
products produced by the firm. In light of this argument, one can interpret our findings as speaking
to the effects of trade reform on one particular component of TFP which is clearly identified in our
data: the range of products manufactured by the firm.7
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide a brief overview
of the data we use in our analysis and the Indian trade liberalization of the 1990s. We next discuss
the reduced-form evidence. Section 3 organizes our results in two subsections. In Section 3.1, we
provide descriptive evidence linking the expansion of the intermediate import extensive margin to
tariff declines. In Section 3.2, we provide reduced-form evidence that lower input tariffs caused
firms to expand product scope and conduct a series of robustness checks. While these regressions
establish our main empirical findings, they are unable to inform our understanding of the particular
channels that are at work. In Section 4, we therefore impose more structure and develop a
framework that allows us to interpret the reduced form results and identify the relevant
mechanisms. Subsections 4.1 and 4.2 present the framework and our identification assumptions;
subsections 4.3 and 4.4 discuss the empirical implementation of the structural approach and our
results, respectively. Section 5 concludes.


6
  Nevertheless, we also provide evidence that conventionally measured TFP increases with input trade
liberalization in our context. See also Topalova (2007).
7
  Exploring the relationship between the number of new products and TFP is beyond the scope of this analysis. The
theoretical literature offers arguments for both a positive [Bernard, Redding and Schott (2006)] and a negative
(Nocke and Yeaple (2007)] relationship between these two variables. We note however, that while the effect of
new products on firm-level TFP may depend on the particular theoretical model one adopts, there is substantial
empirical evidence that new product additions by domestic firms account for a sizable share of sales growth in
several countries [Bernard, Redding and Schott (forthcoming), Navarro (2008), GKPT (forthcoming)].

2. Data and Policy Background
2.1 Data Description
         The firm-level data used in the analysis are constructed from the Prowess database which is
collected by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE). Prowess has important
advantages over the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), India’s manufacturing census, for our study.
First, unlike the repeated cross section in the ASI, the Prowess data is a panel of firms which enables
us to track firm performance over time. Second, Prowess records detailed product-level information
at the firm level and can track changes in firm scope over the sample. Finally, the data span the
period of the India’s trade liberalization from 1989-2003. Prowess is therefore particularly well
suited for understanding how firms adjust their product lines over time in response to increased
access to intermediate inputs.8
         Prowess enables us to track firms’ product mix over time because Indian firms are required
by the 1956 Companies Act to disclose product-level information on capacities, production and
sales in their annual reports. As discussed extensively in GKPT (forthcoming), several features of the
database give us confidence in its quality. Product-level information is available for 85 percent of
the manufacturing firms, who collectively account for more than 90 percent of Prowess’
manufacturing output and exports. More importantly, product-level sales comprise 99 percent of
the (independently) reported manufacturing sales. We refer the reader to GKTP (forthcoming) for a
detailed summary statistics. Our database contains 2,927 manufacturing firms that report product-
level information and span the period from 1989-1997.
         We complement the product-level data with disaggregated information on India’s imports
and tariffs. The tariff data, reported at the six-digit HS (HS6) level, are available from 1987 to 2001




8
  Prowess accounts for 60 to 70 percent of the economic activity in the organized industrial sector and comprise 75
percent of corporate taxes and 95 percent of excise duty collected by the Government of India (CMIE). The
Prowess is not well suited for understanding firm entry and exit because firms are under no legal obligation to
report to the data collecting agency. However, since Prowess contains only relatively large Indian firms, entry and
exit is not necessarily an important margin for understanding the process of adjustment to increased openness
within this subset of the manufacturing sector. Very few firms exit from our sample during this period (7%) and we
observe no statistical difference in initial firm scope, output, TFP and R&D activity between continuing and exiting
firms. Using a nationally representative data covering Indian plants, Sivadasan (2008) finds that reallocation across
firms played a minor role in aggregate TFP gains following India’s reforms. Our analysis below relies on within-firm
variation in firm outcomes, rather than across-firm variation.

                                                         6
and they are obtained from Topalova (2007). We use a concordance by Debroy and Santhanam
(1993) to aggregate tariffs to the National Industrial Classification (NIC) level.
         Input tariffs, the key policy variable in this paper, are computed by running the industry-
level tariffs through India’s input-output matrix for 1993-94. For each industry, we create an input
tariff for that industry as the weighted average of tariffs on inputs used in the production of the
final output of that industry. The weights are constructed as the input industry’s share of the output
                                                                                 inp
industry’s total output value. Formally, input tariffs are defined as 𝜏𝑞𝑡 =               𝑖   𝛼𝑖𝑞 𝜏𝑖𝑡 , where 𝛼𝑖𝑞 is the
value share of input i in industry q. For example, if a final good uses two intermediates with tariffs
of 10 and 20 percent and value shares of .25 and .75, respectively, the input tariff for this good is
17.5 percent.9 The weights in the IO table are also used to construct the components of the input
exact price index.
         Official Indian import data are obtained from Tips Software Services. The data classify
products at the eight-digit HS (HS8) level and record transactions for approximately 10,000
manufacturing products imported from 160 countries between 1987 and 2000. For the purposes of
descriptive analysis in Section 3.1, we assign products according to their end use into two
classifications: intermediate goods (basic, capital, intermediates) and final goods (consumer
durables and non-durables).10 This classification is adopted from Nouroz’s (2001) classification of
India’s IO matrix. The codes from the IO matrix are then matched to the four-digit HS (HS4) level
following Nouroz (2001), which enables us to classify imports broadly into final and intermediate
goods.
2.2 India’s Trade Liberalization
         India’s post-independence development strategy was one of national self-sufficiency and
    heavy government regulation of the economy. India’s trade regime was amongst the most
    restrictive in Asia, with high nominal tariffs and non-tariff barriers. The emphasis on import
    substitution resulted in relatively rapid industrialization, the creation of domestic heavy


9
  The IO table includes weights for manufacturing and non-tradeables (e.g., labor, electricity, utilities, labor, etc.),
but tariffs, of course, only exist for manufacturing. Therefore, the calculation of input tariffs implicitly assumes a
zero tariff for non-tradeables. All of our regressions rely on changes in tariffs over time and not cross-sectional
comparisons.
10
   What constitutes an input for one industry may be an output for another industry, though there are many
products for which their most common use justifies this distinction (e.g., jewelry and clothing) is usually considered
a final good, whereas steel is considered an intermediate product).

                                                           7
     industry and an economy that was highly diversified for its level of development [Kochhar et al.
     (2006)].

         In August 1991, in the aftermath of a balance-of-payments crisis, India launched a dramatic
liberalization of the economy as part of an IMF adjustment program. An important part of this
reform was to abandon the extremely restrictive trade policies.11 The average tariffs fell from more
than 80 percent in 1990 to 39 percent by 1996. Non-tariff barriers (NTBs) were reduced from 87
percent in 1987 to 45 percent in 1994 (Topalova (2007)]. There were some differences in the
magnitude of tariff changes (and especially NTBs) according to final and intermediate industries
with NTBs declining at a later stage for consumer goods. Overall, the structure of industrial
protection changed, as tariffs across sectors were brought to a more uniform level reflecting the
guidelines of the tariff reform spelled out in the IMF conditions [Chopra et al. (1995)].
         Several features of the trade reform are crucial to our study. First, the external crisis of
1991, which came as a surprise, opened the way for market oriented reforms [Hasan et al.
(2007)].12 The liberalization of the trade policy was therefore unanticipated by firms in India.
Moreover, reforms were passed quickly as sort of a “shock therapy” with little debate or analysis to
avoid the inevitable political opposition [Goyal (1996)]. Industries with the highest tariffs received
the largest tariff cuts implying that both the average and standard deviation of tariffs across
industries fell. Consequently, while there was significant variation in the tariff changes across
industries, Topalova (2007) has shown that output and input tariff changes were uncorrelated with
pre-reform firm and industry characteristics such as productivity, size, output growth during the
1980s and capital intensity.13 The tariff liberalization does not appear to have been targeted
towards specific industries and appear free of usual political economy pressures.
         India remained committed to further trade liberalization beyond the Eighth Plan (1992-97).
However, following an election in 1997, Topalova (2007) finds evidence that tariff under the Ninth
Plan (1997-2002) changed in ways that were correlated with firm and industry performance in the

11
    The structural reforms of the early 1990s also included a stepped-up dismantling of the “license raj,” the
extensive system of licensing requirements for establishing and expanding capacity in the manufacturing sector,
which had been the cornerstone of India’s regulatory regime. See GKPT (forthcoming).
12
   This crisis was in part triggered by the sudden increase in the oil prices due to the Gulf War in 1990, the drop in
remittances from Indian workers in the Middle East, and the political uncertainty surrounding the fall of a coalition
government and assassination of Rajiv Gandhi which undermined investor’s confidence.
13
    This finding is consistent with Gang and Pandey (1996) who argue that political and economic factors cannot
explain tariff levels at the time of the reform.

                                                          8
previous years. This indicates that unlike the initial tariff changes following the reform, after 1997,
tariff changes were subject to political influence. This concern leads us to restrict our analysis in this
paper to the sample period that spans 1989-1997.
        We extend Topalova’s (2007) analysis by providing additional evidence that the input tariff
changes from 1992-1997 were uncorrelated with pre-reform changes in the firm performance
measures that we consider in this paper. Column 1 of Table 1 regresses the pre-reform (1989-1991)
growth in firm scope on the subsequent input tariff changes between 1992 and 1997. If the tariff
changes were influenced by lobbying pressures, or targeted towards specific industries based on
pre-reform performance, we would expect a statistically significant correlation. However, the
correlation is statistically insignificant suggesting that the government did not take into account
pre-reform trends in firm scope while cutting tariffs. Columns 2-4 of Table 1 report the correlations
of the input tariff changes with the pre-reform growth in firm output, TFP and R&D. As before,
there is no statistically significant correlation between changes in these firm outcomes and input
tariff changes. This table provides additional assurance that the tariff liberalization was
unanticipated by firms.


3.   Reduced Form Results
        This section presents some descriptive and reduced-form evidence on the relationship
between tariff liberalization and product scope. Before we review the evidence, it is instructive to
briefly explain the reasons we expect tariffs to affect the development of new products in the
domestic market. Section 4 provides a more formal analysis of specific channels.
        Suppose that the production technology of a product q in the final goods sector of the
economy has the general form:
                                                             𝐼
                                        𝑌𝑞 = 𝑓 𝐴, 𝐿, 𝑆, 𝑋𝑖   𝑖=1                                       (1)
where Y denotes output, 𝐴 is the product-specific productivity, and L and S are labor and non-
tradeable inputs (e.g., electricity, water, warehousing, etc). The input vectors 𝑋𝑖 = 𝑋𝑖𝐷 , 𝑋𝑖𝐹 are
comprised of domestic (𝑋𝑖𝐷 ) and imported inputs(𝑋𝑖𝐹 ), respectively. This production technology is
general and for now does not commit us to any particular functional form. Suppose further that
production of q requires a fixed cost 𝐹𝑞 . The firm will choose inputs optimally so as to maximize
profits and will produce product q as long as the variable profits are greater than or equal to the
fixed cost.

                                                    9
        Even without making any particular assumptions about market structure or functional
forms, it is easy to see how a reduction in input tariffs would affect a firm’s decision to introduce a
new product. First, input tariff reductions lower the prices of existing imported inputs. The increase
in variable profits resulting from lower input tariffs raises the likelihood that a firm can manufacture
previously unprofitable products. Second, liberalization may lead to the import of new varieties
[e.g., see Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997)], therefore expanding the set of intermediate inputs
available to the firm. The significance of this second effect will depend on the particular form of the
production technology, and in particular on the substitutability between domestic and imported
inputs, as well as the substitutability between different varieties of imported intermediates.
                                                                                         𝐼
        Suppose, for example, that some of the intermediate inputs included in 𝑋𝑖𝐹       𝑖=1   are
essential, so that if one of these inputs falls to zero, product q cannot be produced. Then the effect
of trade liberalization on the introduction of new products is expected to be large, as it will relax
technological constraints facing domestic firms. On the other extreme, if the new imported varieties
were perfect substitutes to domestic, or previously imported, varieties there would be no effect
through the extensive margin of imports. The importance of the extensive margin relative to the
pure price effects of trade liberalization is therefore an empirical question.
        The reduced form evidence we present in this section does not allow us to distinguish
between these two channels. That is, even if we find that tariff liberalization led to an increase in
domestically produced varieties, this increase could have resulted solely from a decline in prices of
existing imported inputs; the reform would then have operated only through price effects on
existing imports. Nevertheless, the descriptive evidence we present here indicates an enormous
contribution of the extensive margin to import growth, which suggests that the reform is unlikely to
have operated solely through the price channel. In section 4, we place additional structure on the
firm’s production function in order to quantify the specific channels generating the reduced form
findings.
3.1 Descriptive Evidence: Trade Liberalization and Import Data
        Before analyzing the relationship between input tariff declines and firm scope, we first
examine India’s import data. We show that imports increased following the trade liberalization, and
decompose the margins of aggregate import adjustment during the 1990s. Next, we examine the
impact of trade liberalization on key trade variables in our empirical framework: total imports,
imports of intermediates, unit values and the number of imported varieties. The goal of this analysis

                                                   10
is to show that the extensive product margin was an important component of import growth
(especially for intermediates) and that trade liberalization affected the variables relevant in our
framework in expected ways.
3.1.1   Import Decomposition
        We begin by examining the growth of imports into India during the 1990s. Total import
growth reflects the contribution of two margins: growth in HS6 products that existed in the
previous period (intensive margin) and growth in products that did not exist in the previous period
(extensive margin).
        There are two striking features that emerge from this decomposition reported in Table 2.
The first observation is that India experienced a surge in overall imports; column 1 indicates that
real imports (inclusive of tariffs) rose by 130 percent between 1987 and 2000.14 More interestingly,
intermediate imports increased by 227 percent while final goods increased by 90 percent. In other
words, the overall import growth was dominated by an increase in intermediate imported
products.15
        The second fact that emerges from Table 2 is that the relative contribution of the extensive
margin to overall growth was substantially larger in the intermediate imports. Intermediate
products unavailable prior to the reform accounted for about 66 percent of the overall intermediate
import growth while the intensive margin accounted for the remaining third. Moreover, the net
contribution of the extensive margin is driven entirely by gross product entry. There are very few
products that cease to be imported over this period. In contrast, the relative importance of each
margin in the final goods sectors is reversed; the extensive margin accounted only for 37 percent of
the growth in imports, while the intensive margin contributed 63 percent of the growth. In GKPT
(2009), we provide evidence that the majority of the growth in the extensive margin is driven by
imports from OECD countries, which presumably are relatively high quality imports. Table 2
therefore suggests that imports increased substantially during our sample period and that this
increase was largely driven by the growth in the number of intermediate products that were
imported.


14
   Nominal imports, inclusive of tariffs, grew 516 percent over this period. Excluding tariffs, real and nominal
import growth was 228 and 781 percent, respectively. The reason the growth numbers excluding tariffs are higher
is because tariffs were very high prior to the reform.
15
   As discussed above, we rely on the Nourez (2001) classification of products to final and intermediate goods in
this section only. The results in Section 4 rely on input-output matrices to construct the input price indices.
                                                       11
3.1.2    Import Volumes, Prices and Varieties
         We next examine whether the expansion in trade noted in Table 2 was systematically
related to the tariff reductions induced by India's trade liberalization. To summarize our findings,
we find that: (a) lower tariffs led to an overall increase in imports, (b) lower tariffs resulted in lower
unit values of existing product lines and (c), lower tariffs led to an increase in the imports of new
varieties. Moreover, this expansion of varieties in response to tariff declines was particularly
pronounced for intermediate products.
         We begin by examining the responsiveness of import volumes to tariffs by regressing the
(log) import value (exclusive of tariffs) of an HS6 product on the HS6-level tariff16, a HS6 level fixed
effect and year fixed effects, and restrict the analysis to 1987-1997 (see Section 2.2). We should
emphasize that we interpret these regressions strictly as reduced form regressions. In particular,
unlike Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997), we are not assuming complete tariff pass-through on
import prices, so that the tariff coefficients in our regressions cannot be used to back out structural
parameters.17 Table 3a reports the coefficient estimates on tariffs for all sectors (column 1),
intermediate sectors (column 2) and final goods sectors (column 3). In all cases, declines in tariffs
are associated with higher import volumes. This analysis therefore confirms that the trade reform
played an important role in the expansion of imports documented in Table 2.
         Traditional trade theory usually emphasizes the benefits from trade that occur through
increased imports of existing products/varieties at lower prices. This channel also plays a role in our
context. We explore the impact of tariff declines on the tariff-inclusive unit values of HS8-country
varieties by regressing the variety’s unit value on the tariff, a year fixed effect and a variety (HS8-
country) fixed effect. Note that by including the variety fixed effect, we implicitly investigate how
tariffs affected the prices of continuing varieties. The results are reported in Table 3b. Overall,
lower tariffs are associated with declines in the unit values of existing varieties (column 1). Columns
2 and 3 report the coefficients for the intermediate and final goods sectors, respectively. While the
coefficient is positive and significant for both sectors, the magnitude of the coefficient is larger for
the intermediate sectors. This suggests that to the extent imported inputs are used in the

    We use the tariff measure lagged one period in all specifications because the trade reform was implemented
towards the end of 1991 (initiated in August 1991).
17
   Incomplete pass-through can arise even with a CES utility function if the market structure is oligopolistic and/or
non-traded local costs are present.

                                                         12
production process by domestic firms, the observed declines in unit values of existing products will
lower the marginal cost of production for Indian firms.
         The aggregate decomposition in Table 2 suggests that new imported varieties played an
important role in the expansion of overall imports, particularly for the intermediate sectors. This is
consistent with Romer (1994), who shows that if there are fixed cost of importing a product, a
country will import the product only if the profits from importing exceed the fixed costs. This
means that high tariffs not only limit the quantity but also the range of goods imported. To provide
direct evidence of the effect of tariffs on the extensive margin of imports we estimate the following
specification:
                                         ln 𝑣ℎ𝑡 = 𝛼ℎ + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛽𝜏ℎ𝑡 + 𝜀ℎ𝑡                                                (2)
where 𝑣ℎ𝑡 is the number of varieties within a HS6 product h at time t, 𝜏ℎ𝑡 is the HS6 tariff, 𝛼ℎ is a
HS6 fixed effect and 𝛼𝑡 is year fixed effect. The results are reported in Table 3c. To show that our
results are not sensitive to the definition of a variety, the table reports equation (2) with different
definitions of a “variety” as the dependent variable: HS6 -country (panel A), HS8 codes (panel B),
and HS8 category-country (panel C). Since our results are robust to alternative definitions of a
variety, we focus our discussion on the results in Panel A.18 Column 1 estimates equation (7) for all
products and shows that tariff declines were associated with an increased number of imported
varieties. This result confirms the importance of the new variety margin during a trade reform
emphasized in Romer (1994).
         We re-run regression (2) for the intermediate and final products in columns 2 and 3 of each
panel, respectively. Consistent with the evidence in Table 2, the relationship between tariff declines
and the extensive margin is particularly pronounced for intermediate products. The coefficient on
tariffs for the intermediate products in column 2 is more than twice as large as the tariff coefficient
for the final goods. Moreover, the results for intermediate products are robust to the alternative
definitions of a variety in panels B and C, while the results for final products are more sensitive to
the definition of varieties.19
         Our results are generally consistent with the evidence in Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997)
and Arkolakis et al. (2008), who also find that the range of imported varieties expands as a result of

   We obtain qualitatively similar results using a Poisson regression, and if we balance the data to account for HS 6
codes with no initial imports. Results are available upon request.
19
   One explanation for the lack of robust findings for final goods is the fact that NTBs still existed in these HS lines.

the tariff declines in Costa Rica. However, there is one important difference. In India, Table 2
indicates that new imported intermediate varieties accounted for a sizable share of total imports. In
contrast, in Costa Rica, newly imported varieties accounted for a small share of total imports and
thus generate relatively small gains from trade [Arkolakis et al. (2008)]. Thus, the evidence so far
suggests that gains from new import varieties, particularly from the intermediate sectors, may be
potentially large in the context of the Indian trade liberalization.
        In sum, a first look at the import data demonstrates that tariff declines led to increases in
import values, reductions in the import prices of existing products and expansion of new varieties.
These responses were particularly pronounced for imports of intermediate products. Thus, Indian
firms may have benefited from the trade reform not only via cheaper imports of existing
intermediate inputs, but also by having access to new intermediate inputs. In the next section, we
quantify the overall impact of input tariff reductions on firm-level outcomes.
3.2 Reduced From Evidence
3.2.1 Input Tariffs and Domestic Varieties
        In this section, we relate input tariffs to the number of new products introduced in the
market by domestic Indian firms. We then examine the relationship between input tariff reductions
and other variables that are relevant in endogenous growth models, such as firm sales, total factor
productivity, and R&D.
        To explore the impact of input tariffs on the extensive product margin, we estimate the
following equation:
                                         𝑞                   inp
                                    ln 𝑛𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛽𝜏𝑞𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡                                       (3)

where 𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑞 is the number of products manufactured by firm i operating in industry q at time t and
 inp
𝜏𝑞𝑡  is the input tariff that corresponds to the main industry in which firm i operates. This regression
also includes firm fixed effects to control for time-invariant firm characteristics, and year fixed
effects to capture unobserved aggregate shocks. The coefficient of interest is 𝛽 which captures the
semi-elasticity of firm scope with respect to tariffs on intermediate inputs. Standard errors are
clustered at the industry level.
        In GKPT (forthcoming), we found virtually no evidence that firms dropped product lines
during this period; 53 percent of firms report product additions during the 1990s and very few firms




                                                   14
dropped any product lines. Thus, the net changes in firm scope during this period can effectively be
interpreted as gross product additions.
        Table 4a presents the main results in column 1. The coefficient on the input tariff is
negative and statistically significant: declines in input tariffs are associated with an increase in the
scope of production by domestic firms. The point estimate implies that a 10 percentage point fall in
tariffs results in a 3.2% expansion of a firm’s product scope. During the period of our analysis, input
tariffs declined on average by 24 percentage points implying that within-firm product scope
expanded 7.7 percent. Firms increased their product scope on average by 25 percent between
1989 and 1997, so our estimates therefore imply that declines in input tariffs accounted for 31
percent of the observed expansion in firms' product scope.
        In GKPT (forthcoming), we find that the (net) product extensive margin accounted for 25
percent of India's manufacturing output growth during our sample. If India's trade liberalization
impacted growth only through the increase in product scope, our estimates imply that the lower
input tariffs contributed 7.8 percent (.25*.31) to the overall manufacturing growth. This back-of-
the-envelope calculation suggests a sizeable effect of increased access to imported inputs for
manufacturing output growth.
        As discussed in Section 2.2, the trade liberalization coincided with additional market
reforms. In the remaining columns of Table 4a, we control for these additional policy variables.
Column 2 introduces output tariffs to control for pro-competitive effects associated with the tariff
reduction. The coefficient on output tariffs is not statistically significant, while the input tariff
coefficient hardly changes and remains negative and statistically significant. While it may appear
puzzling that the output tariff declines did not result in, for instance, a rationalization of firm scope,
we refer the reader to GKPT (forthcoming) for explanations of this finding. In column 3, we include a
dummy variable for industries delicensed (obtained from Aghion et al. (2008)) during our sample,
and the input tariff coefficient remains robust. Finally, column 4 includes a measure of FDI
liberalization taken from Topalova (2007). The coefficient implies that firms in industries with FDI
liberalization increased scope, but the coefficient is not statistically significant. The input tariff
remains negative and significant indicating that even after conditioning on other market reforms
during this period, input tariff declines led to an expansion of firm product scope.
        In Table 4b, we run a number of robustness checks to examine the sensitivity of our main
results to alternative specifications of the main estimating equation, most importantly to controlling

                                                     15
for pre-existing sector and firm trends. Specifications 1 and 2 of Table 4b introduce NIC2-year and
NIC3-year pair fixed effects, respectively, to control for pre-existing sector-specific trends. These
controls capture several factors, such as sector-specific technological progress, that may be
correlated with input tariff changes. Not only do the input tariff coefficients in each column remain
statistically significant, the magnitude of the point estimates hardly changes. This is further
evidence that input tariffs are not correlated with potentially omitted variables. Specifications 3-6
control for industry-specific trends by interacting year fixed effects with the pre-reform (1989-1991)
growth in the number of products by industry (3), output growth (4), and TFP growth (5).
Specifications 6-10 control for a number of pre-existing firm trends. Specification 6 reports the
coefficient on input tariffs by augmenting equation (3) with year fixed effects interacted with a
dummy that indicates if the firm manufactured multiple products in its initial year. Specification 7
presents more flexible controls by interacting year fixed effects with the number of initial products
manufactured by the firm. Specifications 8 and 9 place firms into output and TFP deciles, based on
their initial year, and interacts the deciles with year dummies. This specification controls for shocks
to firms of similar sizes over time. Specification 10 interacts a dummy indicating if the firm had
positive R&D expenditures in its initial with year dummies. The input tariff coefficient is robust to
including all these flexible industry and firm controls. More importantly, the magnitude of the input
tariff coefficient is remarkably stable across specifications, which provides further reassurance that
the baseline results are not driven by omitted variable bias or pre-existing trends. Specification 11
reports the input tariff coefficient using a Poisson specification which uses the number of products
as the dependent variable. Finally, specification 12 addresses potential concerns about entry and
exit by re-running specification (3) on a set of constant firms that appear in each year of the sample
period from 1989 to 1997. As before, the input tariff coefficient remains stable and statistically
significant.
          The bottom panel of Table 4b reports robustness checks using long differences. The first
check (specification 13) regresses changes in firm scope on changes in input tariffs between 1989
and 1997. The standard error is now larger (p-value: 19%), but the coefficient is remarkably close to
the annual regression results in Table 4a and the previous regressions in Table 4b. Specification 14
                                                              𝑞              𝑞
reports a double-difference specification by regressing Δ ln 𝑛𝑖,97−91 − Δln⁡𝑛𝑖,91−89 on
    inp           inp
 Δ𝜏𝑞,97−91 − Δ𝜏𝑞,91−89 . This double-difference specification removes firm-specific trends
throughout the sample period. While not statistically significant, the input tariff coefficient is again
                                                   16
very close to the previous regressions. The finding that the long-difference specifications do not
substantially attenuate the input tariff coefficient suggests that omitted variables are not biasing
our main results in Table 4a.
3.2.2. Input Tariffs and Other Firm Outcomes
In Table 4c, we estimate variants of equation (3) that use other firm outcome variables as
dependent variables. These variable—firm sales, productivity, and R&D—were chosen based on
their relevance to the mechanisms emphasized in endogenous growth models. We find that
declines in input tariffs were associated with increased firm sales (column 2) and higher firm
productivity (column 3).20 This evidence is consistent with predictions of theoretical papers that
have emphasized the importance of intermediate inputs for productivity growth [e.g., Ethier (1979,
1982), Markusen (1989), Romer (1987, 1990), Rivera-Batiz and Romer (1991), and Grossman and
Helpman (1991)]. It is also in line with recent empirical studies that find imports of intermediates
or declines in input tariffs to be associated with sizeable measured productivity gains [see Kasahara
and Rodrigue (2008), Amiti and Konings (2007), Topalova (2007), Halpern, Koren and Szeidl (2009)].
Finally, we find that lower input tariffs are associated with increased R&D expenditures (column 3),
although the coefficient is imprecisely estimated. The imprecision might in part reflect
heterogeneity in the R&D response across firms. In column 4, we allow the effect of input tariffs to
differ across firms that are above and below the median value of initial sales, and the coefficient on
the interaction between input tariffs and the size indicator is negative and statistically significant.
Thus, lower input tariffs are associated with increased R&D participation, but only in initially larger
firms. Overall, the above results provide further support for the effects emphasized in the
endogenous growth literature.
        Our earlier findings in GKPT (forthcoming) indicate no systematic relationship between
India’s liberalization of output tariffs on domestic product scope. In sharp contrast, here we find
strong and robust evidence that the reductions of input tariffs were associated with an increase in
the range of products manufactured by Indian firms. Moreover, we also observe that lower input



20
  We obtain TFP for our sample of firms from Topalova (2007). We should emphasize that the interpretation of the
TFP findings is difficult in our setting for reasons discussed in Erdem and Tybout (2003). The presence of
multiproduct firms further complicates the interpretation of TFP obtained from Olley and Pakes (1996)
methodology [see De Loecker (2007)]. We therefore view these results simply as a robustness check that allows us
to compare our findings to those of the existing literature.

                                                      17
tariffs are associated with an increase in firm output, total factor productivity and R&D expenditure
among (initially) larger firms.


4      Mechanisms
           The results presented in the previous section quantify the overall impact of access to
imported inputs on firm scope and other outcomes. A limitation of this analysis is that it cannot
uncover the mechanisms through which lower input tariffs influence product scope. In particular, it
does not tell us whether the effects operate through lower prices for existing imported
intermediate products or through increases in the variety of available inputs. This section explores
and quantifies the relative importance of the price and variety channels.
4.1 Theoretical Framework
           We first provide the theoretical foundation for understanding the mechanisms through
which imported inputs lead to growth in domestic varieties. This necessitates introducing functional
form assumptions for the production function of producing product q in equation (1). The
functional forms we choose are motivated by the nature of our data, and importantly, the model
provides a specification that is easy to implement empirically.
           We start by specifying a Cobb-Douglas production function:
                                                                               𝐼

                                                                             𝑖=1

Feenstra (1994) shows that the price index of these foreign varieties in equation (11) can be
modified to account for the role of new imported varieties as long as there is some overlap in the
varieties available between periods (𝐼𝑖𝐹 ≠ ∅). The exact price index adjusted for new imported
varieties is

                                                               19

Equation (13) states that the exact price index from purchasing the basket of imported varieties in
equation (9) is the conventional price index multiplied by a variety index, Λ𝑖𝐹 , that captures the role
of new and disappearing varieties:

        As has been noted in the literature, Λ𝑖𝐹 has an intuitive interpretation. Suppose there are no
disappearing varieties (Table 2) so that the denominator of (14) is one, then Λ𝑖𝐹 measures the
expenditure on the varieties that are available in both periods relative to the expenditure on the set
of varieties available in the current period. The more important the new varieties are (i.e., higher
expenditure share), the lower will be Λ𝑖𝐹 and the smaller the exact price index will be relative to the
conventional index. Equation (14) also shows Λ𝑖𝐹 depends on the substitutability of the foreign
varieties captured by the elasticity of substitution 𝜎𝑖 . The more substitutable the varieties are, the
lower is the term 1 (𝜎𝑖 − 1) and the lower is the difference between the exact and conventional
price indices. In the limit case of an infinite elasticity of substitution, the second term becomes
unity indicating that changes in the available varieties have no effect on the price index.
        Substituting equation (13) into equation (7) indicates that the overall input price index for
                              𝜔                 𝜔 𝑖𝐹
input industry i is 𝑃𝑖 = Π𝑖𝐷𝑖𝐷 𝑃𝑖𝐹conv Λ𝑖𝐹             . Substituting this expression back into the minimum cost
function in equation (5) and taking logs yields

The second bracket captures the importance of new imported inputs:
                                                                𝐼

As discussed above, the term in (18) adjust the price index to reflect new (or disappearing)
imported varieties available to firms; a lower value indicates larger gains from variety.
        We adopt a semi-structural empirical specification in order to identify the mechanisms. Our
approach relates the change (between 1997 and 1989) in firms’ product scope to the observable
input price indices [equations (17) and (18)] in the firms’ minimum cost function:
                                                   𝑞                      inp,conv            inp
                                        Δ ln 𝑛𝑓 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 ln 𝑃𝑞                       + 𝛽2 ln Λ𝑞𝐹 + 𝜀𝑓   (19)

Equation (19) separates the total impact of the reform in equation (3) into the two channels. The
theoretical framework suggests that both coefficients should be negative, but it is agnostic on the
relative magnitude of the signs. Firm scope could be responsive to either or both channels.
4.2 Identification Strategy
        The error term in (19) captures unobservable factors that might influence changes in firm
scope. These factors include the unobserved components in 𝜈 as well as potential demand shocks.
Specification (19) clearly illustrates the endogeneity issues that arise in estimating how imported
inputs affect firm scope. For instance, suppose firms expand the set of domestic varieties in
response to lower price and variety indices for imported inputs. The expansion of domestic varieties
will affect the exact price index of domestic inputs (contained in the unobserved 𝜀). This domestic
variety expansion will further drive down (depending on parameters) the minimum cost of
production, thereby increasingly the likelihood of more domestic variety expansion. This feedback
between the foreign and domestic price indices creates a correlation between the error term and
the observable input price indices in (19); in the absence of a shock to changes in the input indices,
it is difficult to separate cause and effect. Alternatively, suppose that firms introduce new domestic
varieties due to demand shocks, and manufacturing these new varieties requires more imported
inputs. The imports and domestic input indices will both adjust in response to the demand shock,
                                                               21
further influencing the minimum cost of production. This reverse causality concern is precisely the
econometric complication that has limited previous research from identifying the impact between
imported inputs and domestic variety growth.
        Equation (19) therefore highlights the importance of the policy change (i.e., the tariff
liberalization) we exploit. Section 2 established that declines in India’s tariffs were plausibly
unanticipated and not correlated with firms’ and industry characteristics prior to the reform, so
tariff changes are a natural instrument for identifying the channels. The exogenous reform allows
us to establish a casual chain of the following events. A sharp and unanticipated decline in tariffs led
to lower prices of existing inputs (as seen in Table 3b), and hence a lower conventional price index
for imports. Tariff declines also resulted in increased imported varieties (Table 3c); this finding is
consistent with models with fixed costs of exporting where lower variable exporting costs increase
variable profits and make it more likely that the returns to exporting exceed the fixed cost of
entering the foreign market. Thus, changes in tariffs will be correlated with the input price and
variety indices in equation (19), satisfying a necessary condition for valid instruments.
        Although the price index of domestic inputs changes as firms introduce new domestic
varieties, this phenomenon is an indirect effect of the trade reform affecting imported inputs. This
point reflects our main identification assumption: input tariffs affect the price index of domestic
inputs and TFP only through their impact on imported input prices and varieties, which we capture
through the right hand side variables in (19). That is, there is no direct effect of changes in input
tariffs on the unobserved components of (19). Perhaps the most controversial component of this
identification strategy is that the unobservable components in (19) include total factor productivity
since there is a evidence that trade liberalizations lead to productivity improvements. However,
most of this evidence pertains to productivity improvements that result from reallocation effects
associated with output tariff liberalization [e.g., Pavcnik (2002) and Melitz (2003)]; these findings
are not pertinent to our analysis since we focus on changes within firms over time,22 that we argue
are the result of input tariff liberalization. More relevant to our study are findings from recent
empirical studies that report within-firm (measured) productivity improvements following trade




22
  Recall that Prowess contains relatively large firms for which entry and exit are not important margins of
adjustment. Moreover, Sivadasan (2008) finds very little support for the reallocation mechanism in context of
India’s market reforms.

                                                        22
reforms.23 The three prevailing arguments why trade reforms affect within-firm measured
productivity are a) product rationalization, b) improved access to imported inputs and c) elimination
of x-inefficiencies through managerial restructuring. From Table 4a [see also GKPT (forthcoming)],
there is no evidence that Indian firms dropped relatively unproductive product lines to improve
measured TFP; this rules out point (a) in the Indian context. The input channel [argument (b)] is
precisely the focus of our analysis: the trade reform affects productivity through the intermediate
input channels in (19), which are captured by the observable part of this equation. Elimination of x-
inefficiency is a plausible argument, but it is important to note that our policy instruments are input
tariffs. One would expect elimination of x-inefficiency to be driven by pro-competitive output
tariffs, rather than changes in input tariffs.24 Hence, our identification assumption is supported by
existing theoretical and empirical research.
           Since equation (19) contains two endogenous variables, we need a second instrument to
identify the coefficients. Our second instrument is motivated by the insights of Helpman, Melitz and
Rubinstein (2008) and is based on the idea that the potential for exporting to India following the
liberalization may be larger for those countries with “stronger ties” or proximity to India.25 Tariff
declines lower the conventional price index and the variety index, but since India sets a common
tariff to all countries, tariff declines alone cannot explain which countries are more likely to start
exporting products to India after the reform. In other words, tariffs alone are not sufficient to
instrument for the increase in varieties, defined as export country/product pairs. Our second
instrument is based on common language between India and its potential trading partners in a
given industry and attempts to explain, for a given decline in tariffs, which industries experience a
larger growth in new countries that begin exporting to India (i.e., new imported varieties).
        The instrument is constructed as follow. We first identify the set of countries that speak
English (English is an official language of India). These countries plausibly possess a lower fixed cost
of exporting to India [Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008)]. 26 Next, for each HS4 industry of the
English-speaking exporters, we identify those with a revealed comparative advantage (RCA) in that

23
   See Topalova (2007), Amiti and Konings (2007), Sividasan (2008), and Halpern et al. (2009). For theoretical
evidence, see Bernard, Redding and Schott (2006), Eckel and Neary (forthcoming) and Nocke and Yeaple (2006).
24
   We can control for this channel by controlling for changes in output tariffs in equation (19).
25
   We are grateful to a referee for suggesting the idea of this instrumentation strategy.
26
   Other possible fixed cost proxies might include common religion, border and colonial origin. Common religion
and border are not very good fixed cost proxies in the Indian context, and a colonial origin dummy is co-linear with
the English language dummy.

                                                        23
HS4 industry. We identify countries’ RCA using Comtrade data that provide countries’ HS4-level
exports to the world (excluding India) in 1989 (prior to India’s reform). Countries with a RCA are
more likely to respond to the trade liberalization than countries that do not have a RCA. We
construct a GDP-weighted average of the indicator that identify the English-speaking and RCA
countries for each HS4 industry; industries with a higher average are likely to experience a larger
increase in the extensive margin following trade liberalization. Thus, we use country-specific
differences in fixed costs of exporting to India (as captured by language), combined with
information on RCA, to construct a proxy for fixed costs that varies across industries. We then pass
this measure variable through the input-output matrix and use the concordances described above
to obtain an NIC-level measure of language proximity of potential trading partners to India. This
industry-specific measure therefore reflects the lower fixed cost of exporting intermediates to
India. Finally, we interact this measure of proximity of potential trading partners in a given NIC
code with the change in input tariffs. This interaction serves as our second instrument.
4.3 Empirical Implementation
        We use the formulas from the theoretical model to guide our empirical implementation. We
begin by constructing the import indices, Π𝑖𝐹 and Λ𝑖𝐹 . We calculate these indices from India’s
import data according to equations (11) and (14) at the HS4-level of aggregation. We chose this
level of aggregation because while the method proposed by Feenstra (1994) and Broda and
Weinstein (2006) is designed to quantify the gains from new varieties within existing codes, the
method is unable to quantify the introduction of entirely new codes.27 We obtain estimates for the
elasticity of substitution 𝜎𝑖 from Broda, Greenfield and Weinstein (2006) who estimate India’s
elasticities of substitution at the HS-3 level.
        Table 5 reports Λ𝑖𝐹 computed between 1989 and 1997. 28 Row 1 reports the mean of each
component across all HS4 codes. The mean variety index between 1989 and 1997 is .899 implying


27
   This is because index decomposition relies on a set of overlapping varieties across time periods. Between 1989
and 1997, the Indian import data indicate that the number of imported HS6 codes increased from 2,958 to 4,115,
which means that computing indices at the HS6 level would ignore this substantial increase in new products. We
therefore chose to compute indices at the HS4 level (although we still are unable to compute indices for the 220
(out of 1145 HS4 codes) that appear between 1989 and 1997).
28
    For HS4 codes that enter the import data after 1989, we assign a variety index of one. This is a conservative
estimate of the gains from variety. For HS4 codes with missing price and variety indices in 1997 (for instance,
because there is no overlap in varieties or units for prices are missing), we assign average values of coarser HS
codes.

                                                        24
that the exact import price index adjusted for variety growth fell about 10 percent faster than the
conventional import price index. There is a considerable heterogeneity in the impact of variety
growth across HS4 price indices [for examples of HS4 codes, see GKPT (2009)]. Column 3
aggregates across all HS4 codes to compute the overall import price index. Accounting for the
introduction of new varieties lowers the conventional import price index by 31 percent over nine
years, or by 3.9 percent per year. This contribution of the extensive margin to the import price
index is substantially larger than estimates obtained for Costa Rica [Arkolakis et al. (2008)]. It is also
larger than the estimates for the United States, where aggregate import prices are on average 1.2
percent lower per year due to new imported varieties [Broda and Weinstein (2004)]. This large
contribution of the extensive margin in India reaffirms the evidence from the raw data in Section 3
and reflects the restrictive nature of the Indian trade policy prior to the 1991 liberalization.
        The second and third rows of Table 5 report the price index computed separately for the
HS4 codes classified by intermediate and final goods, respectively. Consistent with the import
decompositions in Table 2 and the import variety regressions in Table 3c, we observe that new
variety growth was more substantial in the intermediate sectors than in the final goods sectors. The
mean variety index for the intermediate sectors was .881 between 1989 and 1997 compared to
.904 for final goods sectors. The difference in the overall aggregate price index is even starker.
Variety growth deflated the conventional price index by 38 percent for intermediate sectors,
compared to 15 percent for final sectors. This figure implies that the import price index for
intermediates is on average 4.75 percent lower per year due to new varieties. Table 5 clearly
highlights the gains from new imported varieties, particularly for intermediate inputs.
        Having established that variety growth has a substantial impact on the import price index,
and that this effect is particularly pronounced in the intermediate goods sector, we next turn to
quantifying the relative importance of the price and variety margins in the expansion of domestic
product scope. We construct the two components of price index from (17) and (18) that capture
the price and variety channels. This requires several pieces of information in addition to the
conventional import price and import variety indices discussed above. We calculate the nominal
wage index (𝑃𝐿 ) from the ASI by taking the ratio of the total industry wage bill between 1997 and




                                                    25
1989. We use the wholesale price index (WPI) for the non-tradeable price index(𝑃𝑆 ).29 Finally, we
need the two sets of weights: the Cobb-Douglas shares,𝛼𝑖𝑞 , and the share of foreign imports, 𝜔𝑖𝐹 .
India’s IO matrix provides estimates of 𝛼𝑖𝑞 . We obtain 𝜔𝑖𝐹 using equation (8) from the information
on the share of imports in total domestic consumption for each sector in India’s IO matrix. We
collapse the import indices to the level of aggregation in India’s IO matrix and combine it with the
additional variables described above, to construct the indices using (17) and (18). We then map
these indices to industry level NIC codes associated with the main product a firm produces prior to
reform.
4.4 Results
          We begin by reporting the OLS estimates of equation (19) in Table 6a. Table 6a offers a
preliminary lens to the mechanisms driving the reduced form results in Section 3. Columns 1 and 2
estimate equation (19) with the conventional input price and variety index separately. A negative
coefficient on the conventional input price index in column 1 suggests that lower prices of existing
inputs are associated with higher product scope, although the coefficient is not statistically
significant. The coefficient on the input variety index in column 2 is negative and statistically
significant suggesting that an increase in input variety (captured by a lower index number) is
associated with an expansion of firm scope. This finding continues to hold in column 3, when we
estimate equation (19) with both indices as independent variables. Thus, the OLS results indicate
that an increase in input variety is correlated with firm scope expansion.
          The theoretical section showed that the import indices may be correlated with the error
term of the estimating equation. This would bias the OLS coefficients in Table 6a. We therefore turn
to the IV results next.
          Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6b report the coefficients from first stage regressions. Column 1
reports first stage results with the conventional input price index as the dependent variable. As
expected, a decline in tariffs leads to a decline in the conventional input price index. The coefficient
on the interaction of the input tariff with language proximity to India is not significant, indicating no
differential decline in the conventional input price index across sectors that vary in their language
proximity to India. Column 2 reports first stage results for the input variety price index. Lower input


29
  A separate price index for electricity is available, so we separate the non-tradeable inputs into electricity and
other inputs (e.g., warehousing, communication, water, gas, etc.) for which we do not have detailed price indices
(and assign the WPI).

                                                         26
tariffs result in more imported input varieties (i.e. a decline in the variety component) particularly in
industries where countries with RCA share language with India (i.e., a higher value of proximity
cost variable). This is consistent with the interpretation that industries with closer language
proximity to India experience a larger increase in varieties for a given decline in input tariffs.
        The remaining columns of Table 6b report IV estimates of equation (19). The first-stage F
statistics on excluded instruments are reported at the bottom of each column. Column 3 reports
the results using only the conventional input price index; this is the IV version of column 1 in Table
6a. As with OLS, the result is not significant, but the sign of the coefficient suggests that lower input
prices of existing inputs are associated with increases in firm scope. Column 4 presents the IV result
for the input variety index. The coefficient on the variety index is negative and significant. Column
5 presents the results when equation (19) is estimated with IV and both indices are included; this
equation is just identified with the two instruments and two endogenous regressors. The coefficient
on the variety index is not statistically significant at conventional levels (p-value is 20%), which is
not surprising given the well known problems associated with efficiency of IV estimators. However,
the point estimates are very close to the IV results in column 4 that do not condition on the
conventional input price index. The results in columns 4 and 5 suggest that more imported variety
(i.e. a lower variety index) is associated with expansion in product scope.
        Note that the IV estimates of the variety effect in columns 4 and 5 are lower (larger in
magnitude) than the OLS estimates. A priori, it is difficult to sign the bias of the OLS estimates. As
noted earlier, the error term in equation (19) contains the (unobserved) price index of domestic
inputs (Π𝑖𝐷 ) as well as unobserved demand shocks. If the correlation between the error term and
Λinp
 𝑞𝐹 is positive, the OLS estimates are biased downwards (i.e., too negative). If the correlation is

negative, the OLS estimates are biased upwards (i.e., not negative enough). In order to understand
why the bias is ambiguous, suppose there is an increase in (unobserved) demand. The demand
shock will likely raise the demand for foreign inputs resulting in a lower Λinp
                                                                            𝑞𝐹 . The shock may also

induce domestic input suppliers to manufacture new varieties which will cause downward pressure
on Π𝑖𝐷 since more varieties lower the price index. This effect suggests a positive correlation
between Λinp
         𝑞𝐹 and the error term in (19). However, the domestic shock will also induce an increase

in the prices of existing domestic inputs therefore causing Π𝑖𝐷 to increase. If the price increase of
existing domestic inputs outweighs the downward pressure on Π𝑖𝐷 due to new varieties, there will


                                                    27
be an overall negative correlation between Λinp
                                            𝑞𝐹 and the error term in (19). Thus, the potential bias

of the OLS estimates is, a priori, ambiguous. The IV coefficients on the variety index are lower than
the OLS estimates suggesting that the negative correlation dominates.
        We estimate additional variants of equation (19). Our analysis so far has relied on the
1993-94 IO table for India. This IO table likely reflects India’s production technology across
industries at the start of the reform period. At that time, industries may not have relied heavily
on inputs of machinery that were subject to high tariffs. Such an IO matrix may thus provide a
more noisy measure of the potential to benefit from trade in inputs. As a robustness check, we re-
constructed the conventional and variety input price indices using India’s 1998-99 IO matrix. In
column 6 of Table 6b, we report IV results based on these measures. We find that the point
estimates are similar to column 5 but are, not surprisingly, more precisely estimated.
        In column 7 we use a third-order polynomial expansion of input tariffs and language-
proximity as instruments for the conventional and variety input price index. We estimate equation
(19) with a continuous-updating GMM estimator. This estimator is more efficient than the two
stage least squares estimator (TSLS) and also less prone to potential problems with weak
instruments when there are multiple instruments [see Baum et al. (2007) and Stock et al. (2002)].
We again find that lower input variety is associated with expanded product scope and that the
magnitudes of the coefficients are similar to previous columns. Finally, we re-estimate equation
(19) controlling for changes in output tariffs. This specification directly controls for the possibility
that trade liberalization affected TFP of domestic firms through declines in output tariffs. These
regressions (available upon request) yield very similar coefficients to those reported in columns 4-7,
suggesting that our assumption that input tariffs affect firms’ product scope only through the
conventional input price and variety index is valid.
        Overall, the analysis suggests that the increase in imported variety enabled Indian firms to
expand their product scope. The magnitudes of the coefficients on the imported variety index in
columns 3-7 are also economically significant, and consistent with the reduced form results in
Section 3. Consider the coefficient in column 5. The coefficient implies that a 1% decline in the
variety index leads to a 13.4% increase in firm scope. This elasticity is large, but it is important to
note that the input variety index has been weighed by import shares (see equation 18) and so the
import-share-weighted variety indices are orders of magnitude smaller than the numbers in Table 5.
During the period of our analysis, input tariffs declined on average by 24 percentage points, and
                                                    28
from column 2, the decline in input tariffs led to a .25% decline in input variety index on average.
The IV point estimate therefore implies a 3.4% increase in scope for the average firm due to the
increased availability of imported varieties.
        To conclude, the results in Tables 6a and 6b provide insight into the mechanisms generating
the reduced form results we presented earlier.30 Given that new product additions accounted for
about 25% of growth in Indian manufacturing output during our sample, the results suggest that the
availability of new imported intermediates played an important role in the growth of Indian
manufacturing in the 1990s.


5. Conclusion
        After decades of import substitution policies, Indian firms responded to the 1991 trade
liberalization by increasing their imports of inputs. Importantly, two-thirds of the intermediate
import growth occurred in products that had not been imported prior to the reforms. During the
same period India also experienced an explosion in the number of products manufactured by Indian
firms. In this paper, we use a unique firm-level database that spans the period of India’s trade
liberalization to demonstrate that the expansion in domestic product scope can be explained in
large part by the increased access of firms to new imported intermediate varieties.
        Our approach relies on detailed product-level information on all Indian imports to measure
the input price and variety changes. Since similar data are readily available for many countries, our
approach can in principle be used by other researchers interested in the consequences of trade and
imported inputs. Additionally, disaggregate data on the use of imported intermediates at the firm
level may be available for some countries. However, we believe that relying on aggregate product-
specific import data rather than firm-level data on input use offers a few advantages. First, because
the data on product imports is a census, we can say with confidence that the varieties classified as
“new” were not available anywhere in India prior to the reform: their total imports were zero.
Second, firms frequently access imported inputs through intermediary channels rather than direct
imports; hence, it is possible that a firm that reports zero imported intermediates is in fact using


30
   We estimated equation (19) for output, TFP and R&D activity. The analysis confirms that access to more varieties
resulted in higher firm output and R&D activity, but lower TFP (although these results are not statistically
significant). The counterintuitive sign on TFP could in part reflect the difficulties associated with measuring TFP
noted in the introduction.

                                                        29
imported intermediates that have been purchased through a domestic intermediary. This implies
that there are advantages to using products or sectors as the appropriate units of aggregation.
Third, the level of aggregation we use in this study allows us to take advantage of the tariff reforms
in our identification strategy. Nevertheless, firm-level data with detailed information on imported
inputs by firm may strengthen our understanding of the mechanisms that we highlight. More
detailed data would enable us, for example, to study the determinants and consequences of
differential adoption of imported inputs by Indian firms, although such a study would need to
address the endogeneity of this differential adoption of imported inputs by firms – the trade policy
changes we exploit as a source of identification do not vary by firm.
        Our findings relate to growth models that highlight the importance of access to new
imported inputs for economic growth and to recent cross-country evidence that lower tariffs on
intermediate inputs are associated with income growth [Estevadeordal and Taylor (2008)]. Our
firm-level analysis offers insights into the microeconomic mechanisms underlying growth by
focusing on one particular channel, access to imported intermediates, and one particular margin of
firm adjustment: product scope. While we do not concentrate on aggregate growth, the fact that
the creation of new domestic products accounted for nearly 25 percent of total Indian
manufacturing output growth during our sample period suggests that the implications of access to
new imported intermediate products for growth are potentially important. In future work we plan
to further explore the contribution of these new products to TFP by exploiting product-level
information on prices and sales available in our data. This will allow us to ultimately provide a direct
estimate of the dynamic gains from trade.

Notes: The dependent variables in each column are the pre-reform 1989-1991 growth in firm-level outcomes.
The variables are regressed on post-reform changes in input tariffs between 1992 and 1997. Column 1 is the
pre-reform firm-level change in (log) number of products. Columns 2-4 are the pre-reform changes in (log)
firm output, TFP and R&D expenditure. The number of observations varies in each column because the
coverage of firm outcomes varies. Standard errors clustered at the industry level. Significance: * 10 percent,

Notes: The table decomposes real import growth into the extensive and intensive margins between 1987 and
2000. Imports are deflated by the wholesale price index. Column 1 reports overall import growth. Column 2
and column 5 report the contribution of the extensive and intensive margins, respectively. The extensive
margin is growth in imports due to new six-digit HS codes not imported in the 1987. The intensive margin
measures import growth within products that India had imported in 1987. The gross contributions are
reported in columns 3 and 4 for the extensive margin, and columns 7 and 8 for the intensive margin. Rows 2
and 3 decompose import growth in the intermediate (basic, capital and intermediates) and final (consumer
durables and non-durables) products. The HS codes have been standardized to remove any issues due to
changes in the Indian HS classification system.

Notes: The table reports coefficients on tariffs from product-level regressions of (log)
number of varieties on output tariffs, HS6 product fixed effects, and year effects. The
regressions are run at the HS6-year level and each panel uses at alternative definition
of a variety. A variety is defined as an HS6-country pair in panel A, an HS8 code in
panel B, and an HS8-country pair in panel C. Within each panel, the first column
pools across all sectors while columns 2 and 3 report coefficients for the intermediate
and final goods, respectively. As in the previous tables, tariffs are at the HS6 level and
the regressions are run from 1987-1997. Standard errors clustered at the HS6 level.

Notes: The dependent variable in each regression is (log) number of products manufactured by the firm. Each row
reports the coefficient on the input tariff with the additional controls beyond firm and year fixed effects.
Specifications 1-12 have approximately 14,000 observations. Specifications 1-2 includes two-digit NIC-year and
three-digit NIC-year fixed effects, respectively. Specification 3 interacts the firms' initial multiple-product status
with year fixed effects. Specification 4 interacts the firms' initial number of products with year fixed effects.
Specifications 5-6 include interactions of year fixed effects with deciles of initial firm output and TFP.
Specification 7 includes firms' initial R&D status with year dummies. Specifications 8-10 include interactions of
year dummies with pre-reform (1989-1991) industry product, output and TFP growth, respectively. Specification 11
runs equation (3) using a poisson regression using product scope (rather than log product scope) as the dependent
variable. Specification 12 re-runs equation (3) on a constant set of firms. The bottom panel reports long-difference
specifications. Specification 13 runs a long difference regression of the change in (log) scope on the change in
input tariffs between 1989-1997. Specification 14 runs a long difference regression which controls for firm-specific
trends by running the change in log scope between 1991-1997 and 1989-1991 on the equivalent double-difference
in input tariffs. All regressions include firm and year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the industry level.

           Notes: Table reports the variety index computed at the HS4 level using
           elasticities of substitution from Broda, Greenfield, and Weinstein
           (2006) for India. The indices use HS6-country pairs as the definition of
           a variety. Columns 1 and 2 report the median and mean variety index
           across HS4 groups. Column 3 aggregates the HS4 indices to the
           overall economy level using equation (13) in Broda and Weinstein
           (2006). The first row reports the variety index over all imported
           sectors. The second and third row compute the indices for the
           intermediate and final sectors. The numbers are computed using data
           between 1989 and 1997.

Notes: Table reports IV regressions of firm scope on the imported input price indices. The instruments are changes in input tariffs and changes in input
tariffs interacted with the fixed cost measure described in the text. Columns 1 and 2 report the first stage regressions for the conventional price and
variety indices, respectively. Column 3-7 report the second stage regressions. Column 6 uses the 1998/99 input-output matrix. Column 7 includes third-
order polynomials of the instruments and are estimated using a continuously-updated GMM estimator. The regressions are run for years 1989 and 1997.
Standard errors clustered at the industry level. Significance: * 10 percent, ** 5 percent, *** 1 percent.
