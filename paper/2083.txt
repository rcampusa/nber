       This   paper summarizes a number of studies which use patent data to
examine different aspects of technological change. It describes our finn
level data set construction effort; reports on the relationship between R&D
expenditures and the level of patenting; analyzes the relationship between

patents, R&D, and the stock market value of firms; reports on the estimation

of the value of patent rights based on European patent renewal data; and

describes the use of patent data to estimate the importance of R&D spillovers.

It   concludes that patent data represent a valuable resource for the analysis
of technological change. They can      be   used to study longer-run interfirm
differences in inventive activity and       as a substitute   for R&D data where they
are not available in the desired detail. It is possible also to use a firm's
distribution of patenting by field to infer its position in "technological
space"   and use it in turn to study how R&D spills over from one firm to      another.
Moreover,     patent renewal data, which are also becoming available in the U.S.,

allow one to construct more relevant "quality weighted" inventive t•outputu

measures.

1. Introduction

     In this paper we present an overview of a series of studies pursued at

the NBER during the last decade which used patent statistics to study

different aspects of the economics of technological change. It consists of

five substantive sections: A description of our firm level data; a report

on the relationship between R&D expenditures and the level of patenting; a

report on the relationship between patents, the stock market value of

firms, and their R&D expenditures; a summary of work on the estimation of

the value of patent rights based on patent renewal data; and a description

of the use of patent data to estimate the importance of R&D spillovers. A

brief set of conclusions closes the paper.



2. The NBER-R&D Data Base and the Growth of U.S. Firms in the 1970s

       A major achievement of the NBER project has been the development and

construction of a large data set covering the economic and technological

performance of most of publicly traded U.S. manufacturing companies from

the early 1960s through the early 1980s. It is the result of a detailed

match of publicly available sales, employment, investment, R&D, and balance

sheet information from the Compustat tapes (based on company 10-K filings

with the SEC) with data acquired from the U.S. Patent Office on patents

issued to all organizations between 1969 and 1982. Three major tasks had

to be accomplished to make these data useable: (1) The Patent Office data


                               1
on the number of patents granted to various organizations had to be matched

with our list of manufacturing corporations.   (2) The balance sheet items

in the Compustat record had to be converted from historical to either

current replacement or constant dollar prices. And (3) detailed sales

price indexes had to be imported into these files to allow the computation

of output and productivity measures for these companies.

     To assemble our data set we started with the population of firms

listed in the 1978 Compustat Industrial Tape, to which we added those firms

that still existed in 1976 from the Research Tape, firms in the Compustat

Over-the-Counter tape and firms in the Compustat Full Coverage tape. This

yielded an approximate total of 2700 manufacturing firms in 1976.   (See

Cummins et al, 1985 and sound, et al, 1984 for a description of this

sample and the Appendix for more detail on on the match procedures). We

then matched to this firm data set the detailed information on patents

granted from the Office of Technology Assessment and Forecast (OTAF) tapes

and found that approximately two-thirds of these firms received at least

one patent between 1969 and 1982.

     A preliminary analysis of aggregate trends in these data revealed

changing lags due to fluctuations in the delays at the Patent Office in

processing the applications. Because patents are recorded by date granted

while we are interested, primarily, in patent counts by date of

application, such delays have implications for the completeness of our

series in the later years.

     Table 1 provides a distribution of U.S. patents by date granted and by

date applied for and shows both the degree of completeness of the data at

any point of time and the fluctuations in the lag between the application

any point of time and the fluctuations in the lag between the application

and granting dates. About 97 percent of all patent applications which will

be ultimately granted are granted within the first four years of the

application date (but only about 70 to 80 percent are granted within the

first three years). Hence, our sample of patents by date of application

extends effectively only through 1979.

     In Bound et al (1984) we looked primarily at the cross-sectional

aspect of these data. We found that about two-thirds of our sample were

granted at least one patent between 1965 and 1979 and that the smaller

firms (less than ten million dollars in sales) account for a slightly

larger fraction of patents than of R&D or sales. The industries with a

higher than average ratio of patents to R&D were the chemical, drug,

petroleum, engine, farm and construction machinery, electrical equipment,

and aircraft industries. Although technology based, firms in the

communications equipment and computer industries patent less than the

average of firms doing the same amount of R&D. (See Table 2.)

     Turning to the scale question, we found very little evidence that

larger firms or firms doing more R&D were more productive in patenting

(Figure 1). The answer to this question is clouded by conflicting results

from alternative specifications of the relationship of patenting to R&D and

by the sheer diversity of the firms in our sample. For the larger firms in

our sample patenting is approximately proportional to R&D. The smallest

fins do seem to show somewhat more patenting per R&D dollar but they are a

far more selected group, owing to the way we chose the sample. (A small

firm has to be in some sense more than usually successful to be listed on

one of the stock exchanges.)

               From:   Bound   et al   (1984).
     To look at time series aspects of our data, we have focused on a sub-

sample of manufacturing firms (excluding foreign-owned firms and wholly-

owned subsidiaries) which (1) existed in 1976 and (2) had at least three

years worth of good data on our major variables of interest: sales, book

value, and market value. This yielded a subset of about 1900 firms for

which we have constructed detailed market value data and revalued their

physical assets in current prices. About 1600 of them have data on sales,

market value, and book value of plant for the eight year period 1972-1980.

They accounted for about one trillion dollars of sales in 1976 and employed

approximately sixteen million workers. Although we sacrifice the pre-1972

history of R&D for some of these firms in enlarging the sample, this sample

is more representative of the whole of u.S. manufacturing and we have the

complete patenting history since about 1967 for these firms. They account

for about fifteen billion dollars of R&D in 1976 (approximately 88 percent

of the total of company-financed R&D reported by the National Science

Foundation) and received about nineteen thousand patents -   These are the

basic data that were used subsequently by us in various analyses of market

value, R&D, patenting, and productivity. They were recently updated to

1981-1982 and the Quarterly Compustat Tape was used to recompute market

values and the stock market rate of return for the fiscal rather than the

calendar year to make these variables more comparable to the other data in

the record.

     Table 3 gives some more information on this panel. If we want

consistent and continuous data from 1972 through 1980, we have relatively

"clean" data on 968 fins, 525 of which were performing R&D consistently

while 235 reported no R&D effort throughout this period. Two things stand

 out from this table: (1) The R&D firms both grew faster throughout this

period, in terms of employment, and had a higher growth in
                                                               productivity,
deflated sales per employee, than non-R&D firms. And (2), there is much

variation across industries in this experience.       Employment in R&D

performing firms grew at about two percent per year while non-R&D firms

were almost not growing at all (0.2 percent per year).

        If one looks at the same numbers industry by industry, the results are

less clear. Only in three out of the eight industries where comparisons

can be made, was the growth in average employment unequivocally higher for

R&D firms. Nevertheless, this implication is confirmed by a more detailed

look at the growth in employment of individual firms during the 1976-79

period by Bronwyn Hall (1985). For a larger sample of 1524 firms she finds

that employment growth is related positively and significantly to R&D

intensity (the logarithm of R&D expenditures per employee in 1976) with a

coefficient of 0.018 (0.03) and moreover, that the effect of an R&D dollar

on employment growth is higher than of a similar conventional investment in

physical assets. Inclusion of 20 industry dummy variables and an

adjustment for selective mortality between 1976 and 1979 leave these

conclusions unchanged.

        Another interesting aspect of Table 3 is its indication that the

overall industry growth rates (of both employment and productivity) are

lower than the average rates experienced by the firms in our sample. In

part this reflects the selectivity of our sample. To be present in 1976 a

firm,    other   things equal, must have been growing faster before 1976. To

survive to 1980 also required above average growth. These issues of

selective mortality have been investigated by Addanki (1986) and Hall


                                   5
(1985). Addanki shows that firms that exited between 1976 and 1984 were

small on average and less R&D intensive, though with slightly more patents

per R&D dollar. The major difference between the numbers at the aggregate

and the firm levels arises from differences in weighting. Because the firm

level averages are unweighted, they are dominated by the small firms which

survived throughout the whole period. They did indeed grow faster (see

Hall, 1985). The average firm in the sample was, therefore, during this

period growing faster than the corres-ponding industry total.

     The data sets we have constructed contain a large number of

interesting variables only some of which have been explored in our own

work. The major available variables are: Cross and net value of plant in

historical, constant, and current prices, total sales in current and

constant prices, operating income, dividends, market value of the firm,

number of employees, investment and R&D expenditures in current and

constant prices, inventories, advertising and pension expense, number of

patents received by date of grant and date of application, stock market

rate of return (calendar and fiscal year), and the various relevant price

indexes used in the construction of the "constant price" series. These

data are a major research asset which is also available for use by others.


3. Patents and R&D

     Much of our work was devoted to using the assembled patent data to

study the R&D process and its contribution to economic growth. This is one

way of assessing the usefulness of such statistics as indicators of

inventive activity. Our work in this area can be divided, roughly, into

four categories: (1) Charac-terizing the cross-sectional and time series



                               6
(2) Using patent renewal data to infer the distribution of patent right

values, obtain a measure of their quality and estimate their rate of

obsolescence.   (3) Using stock market valuation data and data on R&D and

patents to study the effectiveness of patents as an indicator of inventive

activity. And, (4), using patent statistics in constructing and validating

measures of R&D spillovers.

     Our first papers in this area were based on an earlier, smaller (but

longer) sample of firms. Pakes and Griliches (1980, l984a) estimate

something like a patent production function, focusing especially on the

degree of correlation between patent applications and past R&D expenditures

and on the lag structure of this relationship. Their main finding is a

statistically significant relationship between R&D expenditures and patent

applications. This relationship is very strong in the cross-sectional

dimension. It is weaker but still significant in the within-firm time-

series dimension (Table 4). Not only do firms that spend more on R&D

receive more patents, but also when a firm   changes   its R&D expenditures,

parallel changes occur in its level of patenting. The bulk of the

relationship in the within-f iS dimension between R&D and patent

applications appears to be close to contemporaneous. The lag effects are

significant but relatively small and not well estimated (Table 5). The

significant coefficient for R&D five years back indicates, however, the

probability of a long unseen "tail" to the effect of past R&D on the level

of patenting. Pakes and Griliches interpret their estimates as implying

that patents are a fairly good indicator of differences in inventive

activity across firms, but that short-term fluctuations in their numbers

within firms have a large noise component in them. They also find that,

  From: Pakes and Griljches (1980)
 except for drug firms, there has been a consistent, negative trend in the

number of patents applied for and granted relative to R&D expenditures

during their period of observation, 1968-1975.

     In analyzing the relationship between patents and R&D we encountered a

number of serious substantive and econometric problems. The first and, at

least in retrospect, most important problem is that the size or value of

the "output" associated with a particular patent varies enormously over

different patents. We shall come back to this problem below and present

some estimates of its magnitude and its consequences for our work. The

second is that patents do not represent all of the output of R&D. Only a

fraction of it is patentable or patented. Moreover, this
                                                           fraction may vary
considerably over industry, firm, and time. We tried to control for such

differences in the firms' propensity to patent by using covariance (fixed-

effects) techniques, estimating conditionally on the overall patenting

performance of the firm, or treating them as unobservables in a multi-

equation context. We also included year effects as a partial solution to

the problem of the changing effectiveness of patents as a tool of

appropriability over time.

     Two other problems required the development of new econometric tools:

(1) Our Large panel is rather short becausepublic reporting of R&D

expenditures became prevalent only after 1972. Thus we have only about six

to eight years worth of data and this may be too short a time period to

elicit a good estimate of the R&D to patents lag structure. And (2), the

dependent variable, patent counts, is an integer with many zeroes and is

subject to significant heteroskedasticity due to the wide size range of our

firms. In Pakes and Criliches (l984b) we suggest a specific procedure for



                               8
dealing with the first problem: truncation bias in the estimation of

distributed lag models in short panels. It is based on an explicit

modelling of the unseen pre-1972 R&D history. The integer dependent

variable problem was attacked in Hausman, Hall, and Criliches (1984) by

extending, developing, and estimating a Poisson-type stochastic

specification for our data.   (This methodology was also applied in Bound et

al, 1984.) The heteroskedasticity and integer problem was also approached

via consistent non-linear estimation with robust standard errors.

     Our most recent paper on the relationship between patents and R&D

(Hall, Criliches, Hausman, 1986) updates the earlier Pakes-Criliches and

Hausman-Hall-Criliches work on the Patents and R&D relationship using a

more recent and larger (but shorter) sample of firms. It uses patenting

data for 642 firms for the five years 1975-1979, and associated R&D data

for the eight years 1972-1979, and reaches one positive, one mixed, and two

essentially negative conclusions: (1) There is a strong, largely

contemporaneous relationship between R&D expenditures and patenting with an

estimated elasticity of about 0.3, which does not disappear when one

controls for the size of the firm, its permanent patenting policy, or even

the effects of its R&D history. (2) There does appear to be a small effect

of past R&D history on current patenting, on the order of 0.1-0.2, but

given the large randomness in patenting from year to year and the relative

shortness and stability of the R&D series, it is not possible to pinpoint

the exact magnitude or the timing of this effect. (3) There does not seem

to be any significant feedback from past patenting successes to future R&D

expenditure changes above and beyond their contemporaneous correlation.

This too may, however reflect the high noise ratio in our patent data



                                9
 rather than the true absence of such a relationship. (4) An interesting

 finding that emerged from this study, and also Pakes' (1985) earlier work,

has nothing to say about patenting, although it provides one reason why it

 is difficult to measure this relationship within firms over time: The

pattern of R&D investment within a firm is essentially a random walk (or

more precisely, a martingale) with a relatively low error variance (Table

6). In other words, R&D budgets over this short horizon (eight years) are

roughly constant (in constant dollars) and therefore must be determined by

considerations other than short run patenting successes. (5) More

generally, the small number of patents taken out by most of the firms and

their intrinsically high variability from year to year makes the use of

patent counts as an indicator of inventive activity in the time dimension

suspect, especially for small firms. Moreover, the rough constancy of R&D

over time makes it rather difficult to make strong inferences about them.

This does not mean that there is no interesting information in these data,

only that one should not take small annual variations in small numbers too

seriously, a point to which we shall return below.



4. Patents, R&D, and Stock Market Values

     The second set of studies involving patents and related variables are

connected by their use of stock market values or the stock market rate of

return as indicators of the success of inventive activity and as the

driving force behind the investments in it. The use of stock market values

as an output indicator has one major advantage. because the public-good

characteristics of inventive output make it extremely difficult to market,

returns to innovation are earned mostly by embodying it in a tangible good

Notes:
1. R&D expenditures are in millions of 1972 dollars. The deflator is described in
    Cummins et al, Q985).
2. All equations contain a separate intercept for each year.
3. These are tests of the stationarity assumption. We have eight estimates of the
    variance, seven for the first order covariance, six for the second, and so forth.
    We have added 1/3 to the patents variable before taking the logarithm due to the
    presence of some zeroes.

                                                     information that can be so
 embodied. There are, therefore, no direct measures of the value of

 inventions, while indirect measures of current benefits (such as profits or

 productivity) are likely to react to the output of the firm's research

 laboratories only slowly and erratically. On the other hand, under

 simplifying assumptions, changes in the stock market value of the firm

 should reflect (possibly with error) changes in the expected discounted

 present value of the firm's entire uncertain net cash flow stream. Thus,

 if an event does occur that causes the market to reevaluate the accumulated

 output of the firm's research laboratories, its full effect on stock market

values ought to be recorded immediately. This, of course, need not be

equal to the effect that will eventually materialize. The fact that we are

measuring expectations rather than realizations, however, does have its

advantages. In particular, since expectations are a major determinant of

research expenditures the use of stock market values should allow one to

check whether the interpretations given to the parameter estimates is

consistent with the observed behavior of these series.

     Pakes (1985) uses an investment model and modern time series analysis

technique to interpret the dynamic relationship between patents, R&D, and

the stock market rate of return. In this model, events occur which affect

the market value of a firm's R&D program and what one estimates are the

reduced form relationships between the percentage increase in this value

and current and subsequent changes in the firm's R&D expenditures, its

patent applications, and the market rate of return on its stock. His

empirical results indicate that about five percent of the variance in the

stock market rate of return is caused by the events which change both R&D



                              11
and patent applications. This leads to a significant correlation between

movements in the stock market rate of return and unpredictable changes in

both patents and R&D expenditures, changes which could not be predicted

from past values of patents and R&D (See Table 7). Moreover, the parameter

values indicate that these changes in patents and R&D are associated with

large movements in stock market values. On average, an "unexpected"

increase in one patent is associated with an increase in the firm's market

value of $810,000, while an unexpected increase of $100 of R&D expenditures

is, again, on average, associated with a $1,870 increase in the value of

the firm. The R&D expenditure series appear to be almost error free in

this context. Patents, however, contain a significant noise component (a

component whose variance is not related to either the R&D or the stock

market rate of return series). This noise component accounts for only a

small fraction of the large differences in the number of patent

 applications of different firms (about 25%), but plays a much larger role

 among the smaller fluctuations that occur in the patent applications of a

 given firm over time (about 95%). Similarily, the effect of unexpected

 increases in patents on market value is highly variable. Nevertheless,

 there is still some information in the time-series dimension. If we were

 to observe, for example, a sudden large burst in the patent applications of

 a given firm, we could be quite sure that events have occurred to cause a

 large change in the market value of its R&D program; but smaller changes in

 the patent applications of a given firm are not likely to be very

 informative. This statement must be modified somewhat when we consider

 long-term differences in the patents of a given firm (say differences over

 aS- or 10-year interval), since a larger fraction of their variance is

caused by events that lead the market to reevaluate the firm's inventive

output during these periods.

     The timing of the response of patents and R&D to events which change

the value of a firm's R&D effort is quite similar. One gets the impression

from the estimates that such events cause a chain reaction, inducing an

increase in R&D expenditures far into the future, and that fins patent

around the links of this chain almost as quickly as they are completed,

resulting in a rather close relationship between R&D expenditures and the

number of patents applied for. Perhaps surprisingly, he finds no evidence

that independent changes in the number of patents applied for (independent

of current and earlier R&D expenditures) produce significant effects on the

market's valuation of the firm (this is reflected by a lack of an

independent effect of lagged p        r in the R&D equation and of q on p

in the patent equation in Table 7). The data cannot differentiate between

different kinds of events that change a firm's R&D level.

     In a related paper Mairesse and Siu (1984) analyze the time-series

interrelationship between changes in the market value of the firm, sales,

R&D, and physical investment using what they call the extended accelerator

model. This paper follows the Pakes paper both in approach and in the use

of essentially the same data. It differs by not focusing, on patents,

instead adding sales and investment to the list of the series whose

interrelationship is to be examined. They find that a relatively simple

 "causal" model fits their data: "innovations" in both market value and

sales "cause" subsequent R&D and investment changes without further

feedback from R&D or investment to either the stock market rate of returns

or sales. There is little evidence of a strong feedback relationship



                                 13
 between physical and R&D investment, though there is some evidence of

 contemporaneous interaction. An interesting conclusion of their paper is

 that independent changes in sales
                                     explain a significant fraction of the
 changs in R&D (and physical investment) above and beyond what is already

 explained by changes in the market value of the firm and by lagged

 movements in R&D itself, implying that by using different variables one

 might be able to separate out the effects of different kinds of shocks in

 the R&D process. This finding could, of
                                           course, be just a reflection of a
 substantial noise (error) level in the observed fluctuations of the stock

market rate of return, in the sense that not all of the changes in the

market value of a firm are relevant to investment decisions.

     Ben-Zion (1984) examines the cross-sectional determinants of market

value, following an approach similar to that outlined in Criliches (1981).

It differs by not allowing for specific firm constants and by including

other variables, such as earnings and physical investment, in the same

equation. He also finds that R&D and patents are significant in explaining

the variability of market value (relative to the book value of its assets),

in addition to such other variables as earnings. His most interest-ing

finding, from our point of view, is the relative importance of total

patents taken out in the industry as a whole on the firm's own market

value. In his interpretation, patents applied for indicate new

technological opportunities in the industry, and these overall

opportunities may be more important than a firm's own recent

accomplishments, though here again this could arise just from the high

error rate in the firm's own patent counts as an indicator of its own

inyentive potential.



                             14
    This set of papers clearly opens up an interesting research area but

still leaves many issues unresolved. Like the proverbial research on the

characteristics of an elephant, different papers approach this topic from

slightly different points of view. Pakes analyzes movements in patents,

R&D, and market value; Mairesse and Siu investigate the relationship

between R&D, investment, sales, and market value; while Ben-Zion (in his

change regressions) looks at R&D, earnings, and market value.

     In principle, one would like to use modern time series techniques

together with some of the testable implications of recent investment theory

to separate out the timing in the relationships between these variables and

to consider disturbances processes that intercede between them. One of the

conclusions of the Pakes paper, however, was that to separate out

successfully the effects of different kinds of events on inventive activity

will require a larger model and more indicator variables than were used

heretofore. Especially distressing was his inability to distinguish

between demand shocks, where demand shocks are loosely defined as events

which cause increases in patenting only through the R&D expenditures they

induce, and technological or supply shocks which may have a direct effect

on patents as well as an indirect effect via induced R&D demand. A model

 capable of distinguishing between these shocks requires the addition of

variables which react differently to such events.     A prototype of such a

 model is outlined in Griliches, Hall and Pakes (1986), where the results of

 a replication of some of Pakes (1985) computations for a larger sample and

 an expan-sion of his equation system to add equations for sales,

 employment, and investment are also reported. They indicate that the

 addition of the latter variables is helpful, in the sense that fluctuations



                               15
 in their growth rates are related to fluctuations in both the growth rate

 of R&D and the stock market rate of return and hence should help in

 identifying the relationships we are interested in. On the other hand, the

 expansion of the sample to include many small finns with low levels of

patenting, deteriorates significantly the informational content of this

variable, raising its noise to signal ratio, and making it hard to discern

a feedback from the independent variability in patenting to any of the

other variables. Thus, at the moment, it does not look as if the data can

sustain a model with two separate factors ("market" and
                                                          "technological"

innovations), even though in principle such a model should be identifiable

in this kind of data and with this number of variables.

     The difficulties in implementing such models arise to a large extent

from the large "noise" component in patents as indicators of R&D output in

the short-rim within-firm dimension. While we were aware of the problem

from the beginning, it was the work of Pakes and Schankerman (1984), which

we turn to next, and their estimates of the dispersion of patent values

which alerted us to its actual magnitude. Using their numbers
                                                                Griliches,
Hall, and Pakes (1986) estimate that though unexpected changes in the

present value of R&D output can account only for about one percent of the

variation in the stock market value of a firm from year to year and that

the proportion that is accountable by unexpected changes in the number of

patents is even smaller (less than 0.1 percent). Thus, it is not

surprising that it is difficult to use patent data to separate out demand

from supply shocks and follow these effects over time.



5. Patent Renewal Data



                              16
    In many countries and recently also in the U.S., holders of patents

must pay an annual renewal fee in order to keep their patents in force. If

the renewal fee is not paid in any single year the patent is permanently

cancelled. Assuming that renewal decisions are based on economic criteria,

agents will only renew their patents if the value of holding them over an

additional year exceeds the cost of such renewal. Observations on the

proportion of patents that are renewed at alternative ages, together with

the relevant renewal fee schedules, will then contain information on the

distribution of the holding values of patents, and on the evolution of this

distribution function over the lifespan of the patents. Since patent

rights are seldom marketed, this is one of the few sources of information

on their value. In a series of papers Fakes and Schanlcennan (1984), Fakes

(1986), and Schankerman and Fakes (1986) present and estimate models which

allow them to recover the distribution of returns from holding patents at

each age over their lifespan. Since the renewal decision is based on the

value of patent protection to the patentee, the procedure used in these

articles directly estimates the private value of the benefits derived from

the patent laws. Estimates of the distribution of these benefits at an

economy-wide level of aggregation, and of movements in them over the post-

1950 period are also obtained.

     In addition, these patent renewal models imply that ideas for which

patent protection is more valuable will tend to be protected by payment of

renewal fees for longer periods of time. This suggests using the patent

renewal data to construct an index of the average value, or quality, of the

ideas embodied in patents, and then using this index to supplement the

quantity-based patent count data in constructing more comprehensive and



                                 17
accurate measures of the value of patented output. There are two reasons

why an index of the value of patented ideas should prove useful. First,

the average value of patented inventions may differ among groups of

patentees or over time periods, so that differences in the number of

patents among groups or time periods will provide systematically biased

estimates of differences in their value. Second, both small sample case

studies and larger sample econometric evidence indicate that the

distribution of the value of patented ideas is very dispersed and highly

skewed (see below for details). This implies that the "noise to signal"

ratio in the patent count variable as a measure of the value of patented

ideas is large. Provided that differently valued patents are renewed for

different lengths of time, the renewal data allow us to construct an

indicator of the value of patented output with a lower noise to signal

ratio than that of the patent count index alone. We illustrate these two

uses of the renewal data below.

     In Pakes (1986) patent holders are allowed to be uncertain about the

sequence of returns that will accrue to the patent if it is to be kept in

force. This uncertainty is introducted to allow for the fact that agents

often apply for patents at an early stage in the innovation process, a

stage in which the agent is still exploring alternative opportunities for

earning returns from the information embodied in the patented idea. Early

patenting arises in part from the incentive structure created by the patent

system, since, if the agent does not patent the information available to

him, somebody else might. This incentive is reinforced by the fact that

the renewal fees in all countries studied are quite small during the early

years of a patent's life.



                             18
    A patent holder who pays the renewal fee obtains both the current

returns that accrue to the patent over the coming period, and the option to

pay the renewal fee and maintain the patent in force in the following

period should he desire to do so. An agent who acts optimally will pay the

renewal fee only if the sum of the current returns plus the value of this

option exceeds the renewal fee. It is assumed that the agent values the

option at the expected discounted value of future net returns (current

returns minus renewal fees), taking account of the fact that an optimal

policy will be followed in each future period, and conditional on the

information currently at the disposal of the agent. An optimal sequential

policy for the agent has the form of an optimal renewal (or stopping) rule;

a rule determining whether to pay the renewal fee at each age. The

proportion of patents which drop out at age a corresponds to the

proportion of patents which do not satisfy the renewal criteria at that age

but did so at age a-I. The drop out proportions predicted by the model are

a function of the model's parameter values and of the renewal fee schedule. The

data gives us the actual proportion of drop outs. The estimation problem

consists, roughly speaking, of finding those values of the model's

parameters which make the drop out proportions implied by the model as

"close" as possible to those we actually observe.

     The empirical results from the Pakes (1986) paper indicate that

patents are applied for at an early stage in the inventive process, a stage

in which there is still substantial uncertainty concerning both the returns

that will be earned from holding the patents, and the returns that will

accrue to the patented ideas. Gradually the patentors uncover more

information about the actual value of their patents. Most turn out to be



                              19
of little value, but the rare "winner" justifies the investments that were

made in developing them.   Ills estimates imply also that most of the

uncertainty with respect to the value of a patent is resolved during the

first three or four years of its life.    Using this result, Schankerman and

Pakes (1986) employ a simpler but more detailed model to examine changes in

the distribution of patent values over time and the correlates of these

changes. The substantive results from these papers imply that the average

value of a patent right is quite small, about $7,000 in the population of

patent applications in France and the UK. In Germany, where only about 35

percent of all patent applications are granted (about 93% and 83% were

granted in France and the UK respectively), the average value of a patent

right among grants was about $17,000. The distribution of these values,

however, is very dispersed and skewed. One percent of patent applications

in France and the 13K had values in excess of $70,000 while in Germany one

percent of patents granted had values in excess of $120,000. Moreover,

half of all the estimated value of patent rights accrues to between five

and ten percent of all the patents. The annual returns to patent

protection decay rather quickly over time, with rates of obsolescence on

the order of 10 to 20 percent per year. Since about 35,000 patent were

applied for per year in France and the UK and about 60,000 in Germany,

these figures imply that though the aggregate value of patent rights is

quite large, it is only on the order of ten to fifteen percent of the total

national expenditures on R&D. While these returns (which are the result of

the proprietary right created by the patent laws) may, depending on the

response elasticity of R&D investments to such incentives, stimulate a

large amount of R&D investment, it is clear that other means of



                              20
appropriating the benefits of R&D must be quite important.

     Even though the total number of patent applications fell during the

1970s, one should not take this decline in numbers as implying,

necessarily, the exhaustion of technological opportunities. Schankerman

and Pakes find that although the numbers of patents per scientist and

engineer fell sharply, their estimated "quality-adjusted" total value of

patent rights per scientist and engineer was remarkably stable over the

period examined by them (Table 8).       One final point. Disaggregated

patent renewal data are gathered by the International Patent Documentation

Center (INPADOC). These data would allow one to investigate the returns to

patent protection separately by technical field of the patent and by the

nationality and type of patentor (e.g., individuals and small business

enterprises vs large corporate entities). Issues related to which sectors

of a particular economy, and which economies, derive disproportionate

benefits from the patent laws lie at the heart of most discussions of cost

and benefits of alternative patent systems (see Scherer, 1965, Chapter 16,

and the literature cited there.) Moreover, inter-sectoral differences in

the patenting and R&D processes are central to the literature on market

structure, industrial policy, and technical progress. Thus, future studies

using these data could be very interesting and should be encouraged.



6. The Spillover Effects of R&D

    One of the major unresolved issues in this area of research is the

identification and measurement of R&D spillovers, the benefits that one

company or industry receives from the R&D activity of another. It is

difficult to trace such spillovers without having strong a priori notions

about who are the potential beneficiaries of whose research. One of the

ways we have been trying to approach this problem is by using the detailed

information on patenting by type of patent (patent class) to cluster firms

into common "technological activity" clusters and looking whether a firm's

variables are related to the overall activity levels of its cluster.

     In his thesis and several recent papers, Adam Jaffe (1983, 1984,

1985, 1986) has used firm level data on patenting by class of patent and on

the distribution of sales by 4-digit SIC to cluster 500+ of our panel firms

into 21 distinct technological clusters and 20 industry (sales orientation)

clusters. It turns out that these two clustering criteria lead to

different clusterings. Using the technological clusters Jaffe constructed

a measure of the total R&D "pool" available for spillovers (borrowing or

stealing) in a cluster. He then looked at three "outcome" variables: R&D

investment ratio for the firm (in 1976), patents received (average number

applied for during 1975-1977), and output growth between 1972 and 1977. In

each of these cases, his measure of the R&D pool contributed significantly

and positively to the explanation of the firm level "outcome" variables

even in the presence of industry dummies (based on the sales clustering).

Not surprisingly, perhaps, firms in technological clusters with large

overall R&D "pools" invested more intensively in R&D than would be

predicted just from their industrial (SIC) location. More interesting is

the finding that firms received more patents per R&D dollar in clusters

where more R&D was performed by others, again above and beyond any pure

industry differences (based on a classification of their sales). (See Table

9.) Similarly, his analysis of firm productivity growth during the 1972-

1977 period showed that it was related positively to both the average R&D

intensity of the individual firms and the change in the size of the R&D

pool available to these firms (Table 10). The magnitude and significance

of these effects is robust, allowing also for industry based differences in

average rates of productivity growth. In terms of profits, or market

value, however, there are both positive and negative effects of neighboring

firms' R&D. The net effect is positive for high R&D    firms,   but firms with

R&D about one standard deviation below the mean are made worse off overall

by the R&D of others. More generally, the idea of R&D spillovers is made

operational    by using the information in the patenting patterns of firms to
construct a measure of their position in "technological space" and of the
closeness   between them and it is shown that this position has an observable

impact on the fin's success.


7.   Summary

      In this paper we describe a number of studies whose common denominator

is the use of patent statistics to illuminate the process of innovation and

technical change. One of the main findings of this project was the

discovery of a strong relationship in the cross-sectional dimension.

Patents are a good indicator of differences in inventive activity across

different firms. While the propensity to patent differs significantly

across industries, the relationship between R&D and patents is close to

proportional, especially for firms above a minimal size. Small firms do

receive a significantly higher number of patents per R&D dollar but this

can be explained largely by their being a much more highly selected group.

(To be in our sample a small firm must be successful enough to have

publicly traded securities.) There is also a statistically significant

relationship between R&D and patents in the within-firm time-series

dimension, but it is weaker there. The bulk of the observable effect is

contemporeneous. There is some evidence that history also matters, that

there are some lagged effects, but they seem to be small and difficult to

estimate precisely. These findings can also be interpreted as implying

some reverse causality: successful research leads both to patents and to a

counnitment of additional funds for the development of resulting ideas.

     Using data on patent renewal rates and patent renewal fees in selected

European countries we have estimated the private value of patent rights,

their dispersion, and their decay over time. The average value of patent

rights is quite small, about $7,000 and $17,000 per patent in France and

Germany respectively. It is also very variable and its distribution is

quite skewed. While most patent rights were close to worthless, one

percent of them had values in excess of $70,000 and $120,000 per patent in

France and Germany respectively. These returns were estimated, however, to

decline rather rapidly over time, with rates of obsolesence between 10 and

20 percent per year. While the aggregate value of patent rights appears to

be quite high, it is estimated to be only on the order of 10 to 15 percent

of total national expenditures on R&D. Hence it is unlikely to be the

major factor in determining the overall level of such expenditures. Using

these newly developed methods of analysis we show that even though the

total number of patent applications fell during the 1970s, their estimated

"quality" rose, implying that one cannot take the observed decline in

numbers as indicating, necessarily, the exhaustion of technological

opportunities. The finding of extreme skewness in the distribution of the

value of patent rights has, however, pessimistic implications for the use

of patent counts as indicators of short run changes in the output of R&D.


                               24
     Nevertheless, patent data represent a valuable resource for the

analysis of the process of technical change. There are other ways of using

them besides simply counting them. It is possible to use a firm's

distribution of patenting by field to infer the position of its R&D program

in "technological space" and to use this information, in turn, to study how

the results of R&D spillover from one firm to another and to illuminate the

process of strategic rivalry that the firm finds itself in. If, as is now

happening also in the U.S., patent renewal information were to become

available at the individual patent and firm level, one could use these data

together with information on patent citations to construct more relevant

"quality weighted" inventive "output" measures. Even without going that

far, the currently available patent data can be used to study longer-run

interfirm differences in levels of inventive activity and as a substitute

for R&D data where they are not available in the desired detail.

                The Compustat-OTAF Patents Match



     In accomplishing this match the major problem we faced was that the

OTAF tapes do not have CUSIP numbers (the identifying corporation code on

the Compustat Tapes). They list only the names of individuals and

organizations, of which there were 66,000 or more distinct ones and among

which we needed to find our 2700 firm names. The work that had to be done

is described in more detail in Cummins et al (1985). Basically, we had

first to find all (or most) of the subsidiaries of our 2,700 companies and

enter all of their distinct names, 16,000 of them, into the computer; write

and run a lexicographical search and match computer program that would

assign OTAF names to the Compustat firms; check the results manually;

investigate the many discrepancies and resolve various conflicts. The

first round of the match yielded about 4,500 OTAF organizations to

associate with 1,500 of our firms. After checking the list of patenting

organizations with at least five patents in the 11 year period from 1969

through 1979 we found that approximately 8,000 organizations remained which

were not matched to the firms in our sample. Based on a sample, about a

third of those appeared to be foreign firms and another third remained

unidentified after looking them up in the 1981 Directory of Corporate

Affiliations.   To reduce the number of firms which had to be investigated

by hand, we restricted the sample of unmatched organizations to those with

more than 50 patents in the 11 year period or at least five patents in the

period 1975 to 1977. Of these 900 organizations, a third were matched to


                             30
our sample or otherwise disposed of. The remaining largest unmatched

organizations turned out to be agencies of the U.S. Government, several

privately-held companies, and a few service companies which obtained

patents for inventors.
