                                           ABSTRACT

We administered the FINRA Foundation's National Financial Capability Study questionnaire to
members of the RAND American Life Panel (ALP) in 2012 and 2018. Using this unique,
longitudinal data set, we investigate the evolution of financial literacy over time and shed light on
the causal effect of financial knowledge on financial outcomes. Over a six-year observation
period, financial literacy appears to be rather stable, with a slight tendency to decline at older
ages. Moreover and importantly, financial literacy has significant predictive power for future
financial outcomes, even after controlling for baseline outcomes and a wide set of demographics
and individual characteristics that influence financial decision making. This estimated
relationship is significantly stronger for older individuals, for women, and for those with lower
income than for their counterparts in the study. Altogether, our findings suggest that differences
in the stock of financial knowledge may lead to increasing inequality over the life course.

   1. Introduction

In most developed economies, changes in Social Security pension benefits and public health
provisions and the shift from defined-benefit to defined-contribution private pension plans have
placed more saving and investment responsibility on households. As a result, individuals have
been confronted with increasingly complex financial planning and decisions, while having to
navigate a financial landscape of sophisticated products. In such a scenario, it is crucial to know
how well-equipped individuals are to deal with complicated financial decisions, how this
capability differs across groups in the population, and how people can be helped to make good
choices.

       Academics and others are interested in acquiring this information, which requires reliable
measures of individuals' financial knowledge. Pioneering work by Lusardi and Mitchell (2008,
2011aa) has defined a standard approach to measuring financial literacy. In the United States,
financial literacy assessment questions have been administered in a number of national surveys:
the Health and Retirement Study (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011a), the National Longitudinal Survey
of Youth (Lusardi et al., 2010), the National Financial Capability Study (Lusardi and Mitchell,
2011), the RAND American Life Panel (Angrisani et al., 2016), and the Understanding America
Study (Angrisani and Casanova, 2019). National surveys in more than 15 countries have also used
the original Big Three financial literacy questions, designed by Lusardi and Mitchell, and an
international survey has collected similar financial literacy information in more than 140 countries
(Klapper and Lusardi, 2020).

       The available financial literacy measures reveal worrisomely low levels of financial
knowledge in the U.S. population at large, with substantial heterogeneity by age, sex, and
education (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). Importantly, these measures have been shown to correlate
strongly with financial behaviors and outcomes. While a substantial amount of work has examined
contemporaneous correlations, very little research has investigated how financial literacy changes
over time and predicts financial outcomes. We contribute to the literature in three important ways.
First, we collect longitudinal data and document how financial literacy evolves over time. Given
the paucity of panel data, this is an important and novel contribution and speaks to the quality of
the financial literacy data. We are the first to show the stability of financial literacy over time.
Second, we link financial literacy to future financial outcomes in a way that overcomes the reverse

                                                 2
causality concerns affecting much of the existing empirical work. Third, we are able to control for
a wide range of individual characteristics related to financial knowledge and outcomes that, if
omitted, could bias estimates, and to explore heterogeneous effects of financial literacy on
financial outcomes by demographics, such as gender, age, and income. It is important to do so,
given the many differences observed in micro data across segments of the population.

        The identification and estimation of the causal effect of financial literacy on financial
outcomes pose important empirical challenges. Individual traits, abilities, and circumstances may
impact the likelihood of financial skill acquisition. At the same time, it is plausible to think that
these traits and abilities directly affect financial outcomes. Because of this, it is likely that cross-
sectional estimates of the effect of financial literacy on financial outcomes suffer from omitted
variable bias. The availability of repeated observations on individuals' financial literacy score and
financial outcomes permits accounting for this heterogeneity through fixed-effects regressions.
However, fixed-effects estimates may still be biased due to reverse causality: Individuals with
higher wealth may have more opportunity and more incentives to acquire financial skills. This, in
turn, may increase their wealth (Lusardi, Michaud, and Mitchell, 2017). Such a mechanism makes
it hard to disentangle cause from effect.

        In this paper, we examine changes in individuals' financial literacy and outcomes over
time. For this purpose, we rely on two waves of the FINRA Foundation's National Financial
Capability Study (NFCS), which we administered as part of the ALP in 2012 and 2018 to a sample
of about 1,500 panel members representative of the U.S. adult population.2 Repeated observations
on the same individuals approximately six years apart allow us to analyze how financial knowledge
evolves over time and how levels of financial literacy influence future financial behaviors. Since
an individual's financial outcomes in 2018 cannot affect his/her level of financial knowledge in
2012, we can circumvent the reverse causality problem, which, as mentioned above, would
potentially bias both cross-sectional and fixed-effects estimates. At the same time, the richness of
our data allows us to control for many individual traits and characteristics that may drive financial
knowledge and financial outcomes, thereby reducing biases from omitted variables. Thus, with

  We have specialized knowledge on these surveys, having designed many of the questions, including the financial
literacy questions, for both the NFCS and the ALP.

                                                       3
reasonable confidence, we can interpret any observed, significant relationship between financial
literacy and financial outcomes as evidence of a causal effect of the former on the latter.

         Panel surveys on financial literacy are rare. This paper represents one of the few attempts
to collect and analyze longitudinal data on financial literacy and financial outcomes, and one of
the first to do so with U.S. data.3 Because the NFCS questionnaire provides comparable measures
of individuals' financial knowledge and financial behavior, we are able to offer further insights
into what shapes household saving and planning, with a specific focus on the role that financial
literacy plays in financial decisions and outcomes. While many studies find a positive relationship
between financial literacy and financial outcomes in cross-sectional data (Lusardi and Mitchell,
2014), it is largely unknown whether the gap in financial outcomes between those with low and
high financial literacy widens or narrows over time. Such knowledge is crucial for devising and
implementing programs that can effectively improve financial decision making and financial well-
being of households, particularly among those for whom resources are relatively scarce and/or
financial decisions are affected by psychological and other hurdles.4

         Our data show limited within-individual variation in financial literacy over our six-year
window of analysis. On a 0­5 scale, the average level of financial literacy in the panel is 3.53 in
2012 (wave 1) and 3.42 in 2018 (wave 2). Approximately half of the sample have the same
financial literacy score in both waves, and for about 90% of study participants, the score in 2018
is within one point of that in 2012. The correlation between financial literacy in 2012 and 2018 is
about 70%.5 This is a novel finding, indicating that financial literacy may be a rather fixed trait in
both young and middle-aged adults. The slight decline in financial literacy score observed in the
panel is mainly driven by individuals over the age of 65, a fact that may reflect cognitive aging,
which has been shown to affect the level of financial literacy (Finke et al., 2017), financial

   Alessie, Lusardi, and van Rooij (2011) use longitudinal data on financial knowledge drawn from the Dutch
CentERPanel, though limit analysis to effects on retirement planning.

  In the context of India, Carpena et al. (2019) find that the link between a higher level of financial literacy and better
financial outcomes is significantly stronger when financial education is accompanied with short-term achievable and
non-binding financial goals, as well as with financial counseling.
5
  Our results differ somewhat from Schmeiser and Seligman (2013), who find that individuals' answers to financial
literacy questions exhibit a great degree of inconsistency over time and that good performance in a financial literacy
quiz has little predictive power for future asset holdings. However, Schmeiser and Seligman (2013) focus on a set of
three questions that are unlikely to adequately capture financial literacy: two of the questions measure numeracy and
familiarity with probabilities and only one assesses understanding of interest compounding.

                                                            4
decision-making capability more generally (Gamble et al., 2015), and actual financial outcomes
(Angrisani and Lee, 2019).

        We regress 2018 financial outcome variables, all of which proxy for different dimensions
of financial well-being, on the level of financial literacy observed in 2012. We find that financial
literacy has significant predictive power for a set of future outcomes, including household
satisfaction with finances, ability to meet unexpected financial needs, and planning for retirement,
even after controlling for baseline outcomes. Thus, financial literacy matters for financial decision
making and financial security in both the short and medium term.

        We also analyze how the relationship between financial literacy and future outcomes varies
across distinct demographic groups. This reveals important heterogeneity, with financial literacy
affecting financial outcomes relatively more for older individuals, for women and for those with
lower income. In view of the strong contemporaneous correlation between financial literacy and
financial outcomes found in previous studies, our results indicate not only that individuals with
higher financial literacy have better current financial well-being but also that their well-being will
differentially improve in the future. Since we find that financial literacy is relatively stable at young
and middle ages, our findings suggest that differences in the relatively fixed stock of financial
knowledge contribute to increasing disparities in financial outcomes over the life cycle.

        The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the data used
for this study. Section 3 documents the evolution of financial literacy over time in the whole
sample and separately by age and cognitive ability. Section 4 investigates the extent to which
financial literacy is predictive of future financial outcomes, while Section 5 explores heterogeneity
in this relationship across distinct demographic groups. Section 6 concludes.



    2. Data

Our data come from two waves of the FINRA Foundation's National Financial Capability Study
(NFCS) fielded as part of the RAND ALP, which is a probability based, nationally representative
online panel of U.S. adults age 18 and above. The first wave was fielded in 2012 to a sample of
about 2,000 adults. In July 2018, we invited the 1,455 active ALP members who had answered the
2012 NFCS questionnaire to retake the survey. Of these respondents, 1,232 started the survey and

                                                   5
1,170 completed it. In the analyses that follow, we include respondents who participated in both
waves, even if they did not finish the survey, as long as they have a financial literacy score.6 The
final sample includes 1,197 individuals and 2,394 individual-time observations.7 The summary
statistics for the main demographic variables in the panel at baseline (in 2012) are shown in Table
1 below. An analysis of sample attrition, provided in the Appendix, shows that the probability of
participating in the second wave of the NFCS ALP is relatively higher for Whites, middle-aged
and older individuals, those with at least a Bachelor's degree, and with annual household incomes
greater than $60,000 in 2012 (these demographic characteristics will be controlled for in our
regression analysis).

    Individuals who participated in both NFCS ALP waves are also older, more educated, and with
higher incomes than the population at large.8 In our 2012 sample, average age is about 50, versus
47 in the population; the proportion of female respondents is 58%, versus 51% in the population;
and the proportion of White respondents is 73%, versus 67% in the population. Nearly half the

sample has a college degree; in the general population, this fraction is 30%. Our sample is more
closely representative of the population in terms of household income, with 54% of our sample
from households earning less than $60,000, versus 57% in the population at large. These
documented differences are consistent with the changes in the composition of the ALP population
over time, with younger, less educated, and less affluent respondents having shown higher attrition
and non-response rates. Over the six-year time span covered by our two waves of data, there are
no significant changes in the demographics shown in Table 1 (most of which are constant by
definition), except for a mechanical increase in age and a slight increase in household income.



    3. The Stability of Financial Literacy

In both waves, respondents were administered a set of five financial literacy questions covering
fundamental economics and finance concepts. These questions have become known as the Big
Five (Hastings, Madrian, and Skimmyhorn, 2013) and are one of several commonly used financial
literacy measures. The Big Five consist of three multiple choice questions assessing aptitude with
simple interest calculations (related to savings accounts and inflation) and understanding of the
relationship between interest rates and bond prices and two true/false questions testing individuals'
knowledge of the relationship between the length of a mortgage and the overall interest paid over
the life of the loan and the concept of risk diversification (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). The exact
wording of the questions is reported in Appendix B. We construct a financial literacy index by
summing the correct responses to the financial literacy questions.

         Over our six-year analysis timeframe, we find that financial literacy declines slightly in
aggregate, though remains quite stable overall. Differences between the proportion of correct
responses across survey waves are muted, with the largest difference being a five percentage point
decline in the fraction correctly answering the risk diversification question (p-value = 0.01, other
differences between correct responses are not statistically significant). Reduced correct responses
are largely driven by an increase in "don't know" responses. For all but the interest rate questions,
there were fewer incorrect responses in 2018 than 2012 (Table 2).9



9
 There is also a decline in financial literacy in the 2018 versus the 2012 wave of the NFCS, although the data is cross-
sectional and does not follow the same individuals over time.

                                                           7
       Figure 1 highlights the distribution of financial literacy scores (number of correct answers)
across the two waves. The average financial literacy level in 2012 is 3.53, and it drops slightly to
3.43 in 2018. Using a paired sample t-test, we reject the null that the average difference across
waves is zero at any conventional significance level (p-value = 0.000). There is little difference in
the proportion of respondents answering all questions correctly across the two years, though a
general leftward shift of the distribution between 2012 and 2018 for scores below five is observed.
Nearly half of the respondents (48%) have the same score in 2018 as in 2012, and 87% have a
score in 2018 that is within one point of their score in 2012.

                   Figure 1: Distribution of Financial Literacy across Years




       The slight decline in average financial literacy between the two survey waves is driven
primarily by reduced financial literacy among older adults. Table 3 documents the mean difference
in financial literacy score between waves by age/cohort. On average, financial literacy decreased
over the six-year observation period for all cohorts, with the largest, and only statistically
significant, decline (using a paired-sample t-test) occurring among adults above the age of 65. This
is consistent with cross-sectional evidence suggesting that financial literacy declines late in life,
and that the decline may be driven in part by cognitive aging (Finke et al., 2017).

         We have information on cognition from the ALP, but only at one point in time, elicited
between September 2012 and May 2013 for all participants. That information is in the form of test
scores on a series of computer-adaptive cognitive tests, which we aggregate in a comprehensive
cognition index by summing scores across all tests (we standardize this index to have mean 0 and
standard deviation 1 in the sample).10 We then assign respondents to four groups corresponding to
the quartiles of the index distribution in the sample. As can be seen in Table 4, we find a
relationship between cognition and future decline in financial literacy. Individuals in the bottom
three cognitive ability quartiles all experience slight declines in financial literacy, with the largest
decline experienced by those with the lowest cognition. Those in the highest cognitive ability
quartile have financial literacy scores that remain relatively unchanged across the survey waves.11

     4. Financial Literacy and Future Financial Outcomes

In addition to measuring changes over time, a key feature of our longitudinal data is that they allow
us to examine the predictive power of financial literacy many years into the future. The question
we explore is: Controlling for observable characteristics, individual-specific traits, and current
financial outcomes, does financial literacy predict future financial outcomes? The NFCS ALP

   The available tests are (i) the number series test, in which respondents are given a sequence of numbers with a blank
somewhere in the sequence and asked to provide the missing value; (ii) the verbal analogies test, in which respondents
are shown words that make up an analogy and, based on this relationship, are asked to fill in a missing word in a
second analogy; (iii) the picture vocabulary test, in which respondents are shown pictures and asked to name the object
they see; (iv) the abstract reasoning test, in which respondents are asked to solve various problems involving abstract
reasoning; and (v) the antonyms test, in which respondents are shown a word and asked to type another with the
opposite meaning.

   Wilson et al. (2016) find a positive relationship between financial and health literacy and cognitive health in a
sample of older Americans.

elicits a range of variables that can proxy for financial well-being, from subjective satisfaction
with current financial situation to the capacity to face a shock, as well as variables that capture
aspects of financial capability, such as retirement planning and credit/debt management. We divide
these variables into positive and negative financial outcomes. The positive set includes satisfaction
with overall financial situation, measured on a 10-point scale; lack or low level of financial
fragility, measured by one's confidence in their ability to come up with $2,000 if an unexpected
need arose within a month; and an indicator that respondents have (ever) tried to figure out how
much they need to save for their retirement, which is known to be a strong predictor of wealth
accumulation (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007). Among the negative or detrimental outcomes, we
consider whether respondents report having too much debt, whether they have used alternative
financial services (payday loans, pawn shops, tax-refund loans, car title loans, and rent-to-own
shops) in the past five years, and whether they use credit cards in an expensive way (paying the
minimum only, making a late payment, going over the limit, or using the card for a cash advance).
All of these latter measures capture, to a varying degree, financial distress and difficulties with
personal finances.

        We perform OLS regressions using each of these outcomes in 2018 as dependent variables
and financial literacy as observed in 2012 as the main explanatory variable of interest. Other
regressors include demographic characteristics measured in 2012 (gender, race, age, marital status,
education, income, and labor force status); a composite index score for cognitive ability
preferences and individual traits, namely aversion to risk and attitude toward planning; and the
dependent variable itself measured at baseline (in 2012).12 We use two specifications, a
parsimonious one, which only includes demographics and the lagged dependent variable, and one
that accounts for individual attitudes and preferences. The estimated relationship between financial
literacy and future financial outcomes is reported in Tables 5 and 6. To ensure that the sample size
remains the same across specifications, we exclude from the analysis respondents with missing
values of either the dependent variable or any of the explanatory variables used in the regressions.
Due to skip patterns within the questionnaire, information about retirement planning and credit



12
   Attitude toward planning is elicited by asking respondents to express, using a 5-point scale, their
agreement/disagreement with the statement "Before going on a vacation, I spend a great deal of time examining where
I would most like to go and what I would like to do." See Ameriks, Caplin, and Leahy (2003). This variable, which
can plausibly be thought of as a time-invariant individual trait, was elicited in 2018 but not in 2012.

                                                        11
card use is available for only about 80% of the original sample. Hence, the regressions featuring
these two outcomes as dependent variable show a reduced sample size.

        Overall, we find that financial literacy has significant predictive power for future financial
outcomes, even after controlling for current outcomes, a wide set of demographics, and individual-
specific traits. Specifically, those who have higher financial literacy are more likely to be satisfied
with their financial situation, more likely to be able to face a mid-size shock, and more likely to
plan for retirement in the future. Estimates are sizeable. For example, a one-unit increase in the
2012 financial literacy index is associated with a 0.13-point increase in financial satisfaction in
2018. This corresponds to an almost 2.5% increase relative to mean financial satisfaction in the
sample (about 6 on a 10-point scale). Thus, the effect is not only statistically significant but also
economically meaningful. Similarly, individuals with higher financial literacy are about 5
percentage points more likely to be able to meet an unexpected $2,000 shock, representing a
sizeable 8% increase relative to a sample proportion of 61%, consistent with the findings of Hasler,
Lusardi, and Oggero (2018). Finally, answering one more financial literacy question correctly in
2012 is associated with about a 3.5 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of having done any
retirement planning in 2018, a 6% positive change from a sample proportion of 57%.

        On the other hand, we find little effect of financial literacy on negative financial behavior,
mostly related to debt and debt management. This suggests that poor financial decision making
may be driven by factors like shocks and resource scarcity and not as much by lack of financial
knowledge. In view of previous research, there exists evidence that, irrespective of financial
literacy, the majority of people recognize that carrying a lot of debt, not making credit card
payments on time, or using alternative financial services (which tend to charge high interest rates
and fees) have negative consequences. Failure to avoid these behaviors is more plausibly driven
by behavioral factors (e.g., present bias), resource constraints, and financial shocks than by lack
of financial knowledge.13




13
  As shown in several papers, people with lower financial literacy can and do make mistakes about debt (see for
example Agarwal, Rosen, and Yao [2015]). Other papers show a link between financial literacy and debt (see a
summary in Lusardi and Mitchell (2014), but our variables are more geared toward measuring financial distress.

        In the interest of space and since our focus is on financial literacy, we will comment on
just a few other estimated coefficients (the complete set of estimated coefficients is provided in
Appendix C): Financial outcomes do not vary significantly by gender, with the exception of use
of alternative financial services, which is less likely among women, but outcomes are very
different by race, with White respondents faring much better than minorities. As might be
expected, financial outcomes are generally better for those with higher income, higher education,
and higher cognitive ability (although a higher cognition score in 2012 is associated with having
too much debt in 2018). Interestingly, financial outcomes are better for those who are older or
retired, but risk aversion and planning attitude are not statistically significant in our regressions.

           While our empirical approach addresses potential reverse causality from financial literacy
to financial outcomes and vice versa, we are unable to rule out all possible sources of bias
stemming from the omission of variables that correlate with financial knowledge and financial
outcomes. However, since we take into account some the traits most relevant for individual
financial decision making (e.g., attitude toward financial risk and planning and cognitive ability)
in our regressions, we interpret our results as evidence of a causal link between financial literacy
and financial outcomes. As noted above, considerable prior research has documented that higher
levels of financial literacy are associated with higher levels of contemporaneously measured
financial outcomes.14 Our finding that financial literacy is relatively fixed over our six-year
observation period indicates that differences in the stock of financial knowledge lead to increasing
disparities through the life cycle. Individuals with higher levels of current financial knowledge
tend to have higher current and future levels of financial well-being relative to those with lower




14
     We find similar associations in our data in unreported regressions.

current levels of financial knowledge. Thus, financial literacy may be a key driver of widening
inequality.



   5. Heterogeneity in the Relationship between Financial Literacy and Future Financial
       Outcomes

Next, we investigate the extent to which the observed relationship between financial literacy and
future financial outcomes varies across distinct segments of the population. To do this, we use our
richer specification, including as explanatory variables demographics, cognitive ability,
individual-specific traits (risk aversion and planning attitude), the dependent variable and financial
literacy as of 2012, and estimate it separately by gender, age (individuals younger than 55 and
individuals age 55 or older in 2012), and income group (households with yearly income below
$60,000 and $60,000 or above in 2012). In Table 7, we report the estimated financial literacy
coefficients for men and women and for the two aforementioned age and income groups,
separately.

       The observed positive effect of financial literacy on an individual's future satisfaction with
their financial situation detected in the entire sample is mainly driven by men and by individuals
age 55 and older. For these two groups, one more financial literacy question answered correctly is
associated with a 0.22-point increase in the future level of satisfaction with financial situation.
While still positive, the corresponding coefficient is much smaller and not statistically different
from zero for women and individuals younger than 55. Due to relatively small sample sizes, we
cannot, however, reject the null that the effect of financial literacy on future financial satisfaction
is the same between groups. The relationship between financial literacy and future financial
satisfaction is similar for households with income below and above $60,000 per year, but is
statistically significant only for households with income below $60,000. The link between
financial literacy and future ability to meet an unexpected $2,000 expense is rather homogenous
between men and women and between age groups. On the other hand, it is substantially larger for
those with income below $60,000, for whom a higher financial literacy score increases the
probability of being able to meet a $2,000 expense by about 6 percentage points (a sizeable 14%
increase from the sample proportion of 42%), than it is for richer individuals (income greater than


                                                  15
$60k) for whom the estimated effect is smaller (about 3 percentage points) and not statistically
significant.

        Women, individuals age 55 and older, and high-income households seem to benefit the
most from better financial knowledge when it comes to retirement planning. For women, a one-
unit increase in the financial literacy score in 2012 results in a 4.5 percentage point increase in the
likelihood of planning for retirement (an effect significant at 5%) compared to only a 2 percentage


                                                       16
point increase for men (a non-statistically significant effect). These estimates correspond to a 9%
and 3% increase from the corresponding sample proportions of 51% and 63%. Similarly, the
estimated 2012 financial literacy coefficients indicate an increase of nearly 5.5 percentage points
in the probability of retirement planning among individuals age 55 or older (a 9% increase from
the sample proportion) and of barely 2 percentage points (3.5% increase from the sample
proportion) among those younger than 55. For individuals with income at or above $60,000, a
higher financial literacy score in 2012 is associated with a 5.6 percentage-point increase in the
likelihood of having done some retirement planning by 2018 (an 8% increase from the sample
proportion of 69%); for those with income below $60,000, the estimated increase is only 1.7
percentage points and is not statistically significant. Despite such large differences, we fail to reject
the null that these effects are the same between groups due to relatively large standard errors.

        Concerning negative outcomes, we find evidence of some heterogeneous effects.
Consistent with most of the patterns already described, women, older, and less affluent individuals
appear to benefit the most from increasing levels of financial knowledge. For women, answering
one more financial literacy question correctly in 2012 results in a decrease of 0.13 points on the
1­7 scale measuring having too much debt in 2018. This corresponds to a 4% decrease from a
sample mean of 3.6. Conversely, there is little effect for men. Similarly, among individuals age 55
or older, a one-point increase in the financial literacy score in 2012 is associated with a decrease
of 0.19 points on the having too much debt scale in 2018, representing a negative 7% change from
the sample mean of 2.6. For individuals younger than 55, financial literacy is not linked to future
debt management. Among those with income below $60,000, a one-unit increase in the financial
literacy score in 2012 results in a decrease of 0.17 points on the having too much debt scale in
2018, which constitutes a negative 4.5% change from the sample mean of 3.8. Once again, because
of relatively large standard errors, the effects by gender and age are not statistically different. We
do reject the null that the effects of financial literacy on having too much debt are the same between
income groups at the 5% significance level. Finally, we do not find an effect of financial literacy
on either use of alternative financial services or expensive credit card behavior across demographic
groups, apart from when looking at distinct age groups. Overall, the estimated coefficients are
similar to those in the whole sample.

        In summary, the results presented in this section point to three main findings. One, higher
financial literacy benefits women more than men, which is consistent with the findings of previous
work by Lusardi and Mitchell (2008). Two, a higher level of financial knowledge benefits
individuals approaching retirement age more than their younger counterparts, confirming the key
role that financial knowledge plays in planning for the future and accumulating wealth over the
life cycle. Three, financial knowledge is more beneficial for low-income individuals, especially in
the domains of satisfaction with finances, emergency savings, and debt management. Our
empirical evidence highlights the importance of taking heterogeneity into account when assessing
the effects of financial literacy, and of considering distinct financial behaviors and outcomes,
which may be differentially affected by the level of financial knowledge.15



     6. Conclusions

We administered the NFCS questionnaire to members of the RAND ALP in 2012 and again in
2018. As a result, we have at our disposal longitudinal, individual-level information on financial
literacy and a broad set of financial outcomes, which is rarely found in other data sets. Importantly,
we are able to complement this information with a rich set of socio-economic variables, cognitive
ability measures, preference parameters and individual traits available in the ALP and that are
known to influence both financial knowledge and behavior.

        Exploiting this unique longitudinal data set, we investigate the evolution of financial
literacy over a six-year period and identify the causal effects of financial knowledge on a set of
financial outcomes that proxy for financial well-being. For this purpose, we regress financial
outcomes as measured in 2018 on the level of financial literacy observed in 2012, controlling for
baseline demographics, baseline financial outcomes, and individuals' traits. This empirical
approach allows us to rule out reverse causality from financial outcomes to financial literacy, and
to account for most of the individual-specific characteristics influencing financial decision making,
thereby reducing bias from the omission of relevant variables. While existing studies find a
positive correlation between financial literacy and financial outcomes in the cross-section, it is

and Mitchell (2014) and Carlin, Jiang, and Spiller (2017)

largely unknown whether the gap in financial outcomes between those with low and high financial
literacy widens or narrows over time. Our study tackles this question and provides empirical
evidence on this issue, which has important policy implications.

       Over our relatively long (2012 to 2018) observation period, financial literacy exhibits very
limited within-individual variation. It appears to be rather stable, with a slight tendency to decline
at older ages only. There is good news and bad news about this finding. The good news is that the
Big Five Financial Literacy questions are a robust measure of financial literacy, which remains
stable over time. The bad news is that financial literacy improves very little over time. The finding
also indicates that experience is not a great teacher, as levels of financial literacy are low even
among older individuals, who have presumably made many financial decisions.

       We find that financial literacy has significant predictive power for future financial
outcomes, especially satisfaction with one's own financial situation, the ability to face shocks, and
planning for retirement, even after controlling for baseline levels of these outcomes. These results,
combined with the observed stability of financial literacy over time, suggest that differences in the
stock of financial knowledge among individuals can lead to increasing disparities in financial well-
being over the life course. Thus, differential levels of financial literacy may contribute to widening
inequality among distinct segments of the population.

       We investigate how the general relationship between financial literacy and future financial
well-being varies across distinct demographic groups. We document a significantly stronger effect
of financial literacy on future outcomes for older individuals than for their younger counterparts.
This highlights the importance of equipping the young to make critical financial decisions so that
they can continue down a path toward financial security. We also observe that women who have
higher financial literacy experience better downstream financial outcomes than men. This indicates
that higher levels of financial literacy for women may help close the gender gap in financial well-
being. Similarly, we find that low-income individuals who have higher levels of financial literacy
are better able to meet unexpected shocks and manage debt.

       Our study represents progress toward a better understanding of the ways in which
household financial behavior and financial literacy are linked. This knowledge is crucial for
devising and implementing programs that can effectively improve household financial decision
making and financial well-being, particularly among more disadvantaged and vulnerable groups

                                                 19
in the population. Our results also suggest that financial knowledge may be an important
contributor to increasing disparities over the life course.

The number of individuals who answered the NFCS questionnaire in 2012 and were still active
ALP members in 2018 is 1,455. All these individuals were invited to re-take the NFCS

                                                     23
questionnaire in 2018. Considering this pool of potential respondents, we create an indicator taking
the value of 1 if the invited ALP member answered the 2018 NFCS questionnaire and 0 otherwise.
We then estimate a Probit model using this indicator as a dependent variable and the following set
of regressors measured in 2012: gender, age, education, marital status, labor force status,
household income, financial literacy score, and cognitive ability score. Table A1 presents average
marginal effects from this estimation exercise.

           As can be seen, the probability of answering the second NFCS ALP wave, conditional on
having answered the first, is higher among White, middle-aged, and older respondents. It is around
6 percentage points higher among individuals with a bachelor's degree or more compared to those
with high school or less, and about 4 percentage points higher among households with income
greater than $60,000. In contrast, the likelihood of answering the 2018 NFCS questionnaire does
not correlate with gender, marital status, labor force status, financial literacy level, or cognitive
ability.

           We also perform an analysis of attrition from the ALP between 2012 and 2018. Besides
the 1,455 respondents who answered the NFCS questionnaire in 2012 and were still active ALP
members in 2018, another 620 dropped out of the ALP by the time we administered the second
wave of the NFCS. In Table A2, we estimate a Probit model for the probability of remaining an
active ALP member in 2018, conditional on having participated in the NFCS in 2012. This analysis
provides insights on which individual characteristics are associated with the likelihood of leaving
the ALP over time and, therefore, on how the composition of the panel may have changed during
the observation period of our study.

           As can be seen, the probability of remaining in the ALP between 2012 and 2018 is higher
for women and individuals with at least a bachelor's degree. It is significantly lower among those
age 18­32 than among their older counterparts. Unlike the NFCS attrition documented above, ALP
attrition is associated with financial literacy. Specifically, one more financial literacy question
answered correctly in 2012 increases the chances of remaining in the panel by about 3 percentage
points. There is no correlation between the probability of attrition and individuals' cognitive
ability.
