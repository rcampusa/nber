                         Tax Policy and Stock Prices




                                  ABSTRACT




      Windfall profits and losses accrue to investors only when expected

after—tax returns or discount rates change, and major tax policy shifts are

likely to alter these variables. This study introduces a cashflow valuation

model for estimating the windfalls to owners of U.S. nonfinancial corporations

caused by the enactment of tax changes. The model is illustrated by analysis

of two reform packages, the Treasury Proposal of November 1984 and the Tax

Reform Act of 1986.

      We find that the original Treasury plan would have boosted stock prices

by 20 to 30 percent; an increase of 10 to 12 percent is computed for the Tax

Reform Act of 1986. This anomalous result —— a $125 to $140 billion dollar

corporate tax increase (over five years) raising stock prices ——   occurs because
the tax increase is on new capital, not old capital. The stock market largely

values expected returns on the existing capital stock, and these returns

benefit from the adverse treatment of new investment.

       Windfall profits and losses accrue to investors only when expected

 after—tax returns or discount rates change, and major tax policy shifts are

 likely to alter these variables. This study introduces a cashflow valuation

 model for estimating the windfalls to owners of U.S. nonfinancial corporations

 caused by the enactment of tax changes. The model is illustrated
                                                                        by analysis
 of two reform packages, the Treasury Proposal of November 1984 and the Tax

 Reform Act of 1986.

      The valuation model, introduced in Section 1, calculates fundamental

value of equity as the discounted sum of the expected residual cashf low stream.

This stream depends on tax parameters and the rental price of capital, and the

resultant fundamental value will, in an efficient capital market, determine

 (equal) the level of stock prices. In Section 2 we compute fundamental equity

value for the nonfinancial corporate sector at the end of 1984.        We then

recompute, in Section 3, value using the tax parameters and rental prices

contained in or derived from the tax reforms. The shareholder's windfall

profit or loss ——   the   anticipated change in the stock prices ——   equals the
change in fundamental equity value.

      We find that the original Treasury plan would have boosted stock prices

by 20 to 30 percent; an increase of 10 to 12 percent is computed for the Tax

Reform Act of 1986. This anomalous result —— a $125 to $140 billion dollar

corporate tax increase (over five years) raising stock prices —— occurs because

the tax increase is on new capital, not old capital. The stock market largely

values expected returns on the existing capital stock, and these returns

benefit from the adverse treatment of new investment.1
                      1. Determining Fundamental Equity Value

         Gross cashflows received by a firm represent reimbursement for its

operating and financial production costs. In principle, gross cashflows are

distributed among the different factors of production in proportion to the

share of the factor's contribution to the final product. Some of the cashflows

go to labor, some to raw material suppliers, and other cashf lows go to pay

interest and taxes. The residual goes to equity, and the present value of the

expected residual cashflows is the fundamental value of equity. In efficient

markets, the firm's stock value is an unbiased estimate of the fundamental

value.

         Let Rt be the residual cashflow that factor j is expected to produce at

time s+t, where that expectation is formed at time s based upon all available

information. The value of shareholders' claims against productive factor j,

denoted V, is

               V =   tl(e)t,t,                                       (1)



where e is the nominal required return on equity. Computing the total equity

value of the firm as the sum of V across all j requires specification both of

the residual cashf low stream expected from all factors of production and the

equity rate.

         Almost by definition, only capital is a store of value and so only

capital generates residual cashflows. Suppliers of variable factor inputs such

as labor and energy, are reimbursed an amount just equal to the value of their

productive services and therefore these factors do not pass any cashflows

through to shareholders. Residual cashflows are produced by all the firm's

capital: current assets, fixed assets, land and intangibles. Given the short
                                          —3—



 lives of existing current assets (e.g., inventories and trade credit), their

 residual cashflows are largely invarient to tax policy changes and thus will

 not deliver significant windfalls.

       Say fixed asset type j is expected to produce earnings before

 depreciation, interest, and taxes equal to NOI, tax depreciation deductions

 equal to TAXD, and interest and principal costs associated with debt financing

 equal to INT and DEBT. The residual cashflow is

             Rt = (l—t)NOI        + TTAXD — (l—r)INT + DEBT,       (2)


 where T is the corporate profits tax rate.

       The sum of fundamental equity (Va) and debt (D) values equals the

discounted sum of the NOl and TAXD streams, where the discount rate is the

weighted average cost of debt and equity financing, r (Modigliani and Miller,

1963). This sum, denoted by W, is fixed asset type j's total fundamental

value and is computed as

            W =
             S
                      VS   + D5

                  =
                      t=s(l)        [(lt)NQI + tTAXD}.            (3)




      Given that debt is a constant fraction, b, of firm wealth, the

fundamental value of shareholder claims against fixed asset type j can be

estimated directly from the NOl and TAXD streams as

            V=
             S
               (l—b)WS

              =               (l+r) t—S)[(l)NoIj + TTAXD).
                   (1_b)t                                         (4)


      Notice that NOIt and TAXDt are expectations about time s+t cashflows and

are formed at time s using all available information. These cashf lows are

attributable both to assets in place at time s surviving until time s+t and to
                                        —4-.




investments made between time s and s+t, net of the incremental acquisition

costs of these future investments. Brainard, Shoven, and Weiss (1980) compute

alternative estimates of fundamental value over the 1968—1977 sample period,

one of which includes the net present value of growth opportunities (the value

of intangible capital) and another that does not. The estimate including

growth opportunities is a stable 1.5 percent larger than the estimate which

assumes future investments have zero net present value. Thus, even if an

anti—investment tax reform were to eliminate growth opportunities completely,

the market value of equities would decline by only 1.5 percent. In light of

this small difference, we model future investments as zero net present value

ventures.

        Every dollar of type j capital provides NOI equal to the rental price of

capital, c. Thus, the NOI expected at time s to be produced at time s+t is


              NOI =   cK_1,                                           (5)



where       is the capital stock replacement cost of asset type j.2 Following

Hall and Jorgenson (1967), the rental price is computed as


              c (r+—ii) (l—v—TZ)/(l—T) ,                              (6)

where it is the expected inflation rate,       is the economic depreciation rate,

v3 is the effective rate of the investment tax credit, and Z is the present

value of tax depreciation deductions on a one dollar investment in asset type

3.

        The replacement cost that time s capital is expected to have at s+t is

              Kt = (l_J+it)tKJ,
                             0

where K is the replacement cost of the capital stock at time s. K is

computed as

              K = q1[ L(l_oi)uIRi J.
               o   sul          s—u
                                          —5—



 The term in brackets is the real capital stock at time s, and qJ is the supply

price of new capital goods. IR is real investment in capital type j, and L is

the capital's productive service life.

      Future tax deductions promised by the existing stock, TAXD, are

predetermined by historic investment flows and the tax depreciation laws in

effect at the time the capital was put in place. Let Zs,u be the percent of

the gross nominal investment        which, given the tax laws in effect at time s,

is deducted u years after acquisition. The tax depreciation deduction that the

time s capital stock promises at time s+t is

            TAXD =
                t
                      L         z
                     u=t s+t—u 5+t—u,u
                                          .
                                                                      (7)

Fundamental equity value may be estimated by substituting the expressions for

TAXD and NOl into equation 43

      The discount rate r is the weighted average after—tax cost of debt and

equity financing:

            r = b(l—T)± +   (l—b)e,                                   (8)

where a portfolio equilibrium can be used to infer the equity rate from

interest and tax rates. With equity returns taxed at the rate T, the after—

tax return to shareholders is


            (l—i )e = R + p ,                                        (9)
                e      m   e

where Rm is the yield on risk—free tax—exempt securities and 'e is the risk

premium required on investment in corporate equity. The tax exempt rate, in

turn, can be related to the taxable interest rate and corporate and personal

tax rates via a Miller equilibrium (1977).

                        2. Fundamental Value Estimates

      Generating our estimate of V(P&E) requires that we model the NOl and TAXD

streams for plant and equipment as specified in equations 5 and 7. The length

of the cashf low streams for plant and equipment equals the productive life of

the capital assets, which we assume to be 50 and 20 years, respectively. The

empirical results are not sensitive to the asset life selected because the bulk

of all discounted returns are received during the early years; over 95 percent

are received within 9 years for equipment and 19 years for plant. Although we

estimate separate streams for plant and equipment, the discussion below usually

refers to the sum of the two series or, where appropriate, their weighted

average.

      The NOl stream depends upon the productive size of the asset base

generating the revenues. Column 1 of Table 1 lists the proportion of the 1984

real capital stock surviving into the future. By the ninth year, 1993, the

surviving stock is capable of producing only half of its original product.

After the twentieth year, the stock of equipment is totally expired, and after

the twenty—fifth year, 2009, all but 17 percent of the 1984 real stock of plant

and equipment has expired.4 Discounted cashf lows beyond 2009 (not shown)

account for less than one percent of the existing capital's fundamental value.

      The NOl equals the product of the replacement cost, listed in column 2,

and the rental price. Over time, inflation exerts an upward force on NOI5,

tending to offset the decline induced by losses in productive capacity. A

dollar of equipment generates $0.2261 of NOl, the rental price of equipment,

whereas a dollar of plant generates $0.15l0 of NOl, the rental price of plant.5

Column 3 lists the NOI stream.

      More than half of the NOIs during the first five years of the return

stream are free from taxation because of the shield provided by depreciation

deductions. We depreciate historic investments with the tax depreciation
                                          —7—



  practices in effect at their time of acquisition (as specified in equation 7).

  Tax lives from the U.S. Federal Reserve Board Quarterly Econometric Model

  (FRBQM, 1983) are used to obtain estimates of the tax shield that assets

 existing at year—end 1984 were expected to provide over their remaining lives.

         Half of all equipment investments prior to 1981 are depreciated by sum—

 of—year's digits and half by double declining balance with an optimal switch to

 straight line. In and after 1981, ninety—five percent of equipment investments

 are depreciated in the 5—year ACRS class and five percent in the 3—year class.

 For plant investments prior to 1981, we employ the FRBQM weight "proportion of

 structure's investment depreciated by accelerated methods" and depreciate half

 of those by sum—of—year's digits and half by one—hundred fifty percent

 declining balance with the optimal switch to straight line. The plant

 investments not depreciated by accelerated methods are depreciated by straight

 line.

         The stream of tax depreciation deductions promised by the 1984 existing

 stock is listed in column 4 of Table 1. The most remote deductions promised by

the existing stock are scheduled to be taken in 2021 and accrue from plant

investment made in 1980. Investments after 1980 are depreciated more quickly

owing to the introduction of ACRS. The sum      of   all deductions is $1423 billion,
which is about two—thirds the capital stock's current replacement cost of $2145

billion. Total deductions are less than replacement cost because tax lives are

less than service lives and because tax deductions are based on historic prices

instead of current prices. The present value of the expected depreciation

deductions stream is $752 billion or thirty—five cents per dollar of vintage

capital, substantially less than the sixty—three cents of discounted

depreciation deductions offered by a dollar of new capital (the Z term used in

our rental price).
                                      —8—



      In constructing r, we give the after—tax debt rate a weight of one—third

and the equity rate a weight of two—thirds. For our prereform values, we set

the pre—tax debt rate equal to 0.10 and the equity rate to 0.1542 (see

Hendershott, 1986). Our corporate tax rate is 0.4924 (a marginal federal tax

of 0.46 plus a federally—deductible state and local tax rate of 0.06). The

resulting weighted average cost of capital is 0.120, and the estimate of

W(P&E), the market value of debt and equity claims against nonfinancial

corporate plant and equipment, is $1596 billion. The value of equity, V(P&E),

is two—thirds times that or $1064 billion.


                         3. The Effects of Tax Reform

      To illustrate our model, impacts on stock values are computed for the

original Treasury proposal and the Tax Reform Act of 1986.6 The key parameters

relevant for both current law and the alternative reforms are listed in Table

2. Both proposals lower the corporate tax rate, remove the investment tax

credit, generally lengthen tax depreciation schedules and remove the capital

gains exclusion which increases the personal tax rate on equity. The Treasury

plan also includes substantial inflation indexation (capital gains,

depreciation base, and interest income and expense) and provides a deduction

for half of dividends paid out. We have modeled only the general tax changes

contained in the reforms. The reforms also include a number of industry

specific changes that are almost uniformly negative. To the extent that these

affect new investments, rental prices, and thus equity values, will rise; to

the extent the changes impact existing capital stock, equity values will fall.

      Our results are reported in three parts. The first reflects the impact

of the statutory changes holding rental prices and the level of taxable

interest rates constant. These results would hold if (1) investment adjustment

costs were prohibitively large (and thus no changes in business investment and
                                                 —9—



 NOIs on vintage capital occurred) and (2) international capital flows and world

 saving were infinitely elastic (and thus taxable debt rates were fixed) .        The
 second part allows rental prices to change; in the extreme, investment costs

 are assumed to be zero and the NOIs on vintage capital are
                                                                   instantaneously
 shifted in line with the new equilibrium rental prices.7 The third part

 explores the effect of macroeconomic influences on taxable interest rates and

 stock prices.8 All reforms substantially reduce aggregate investment demand

 and raise the after—tax returns to savers (both at prereform interest rate

 levels) .   Interest   rates would thus be expected to decline.

Constant Corporate Fixed Investment and Taxable Debt Rates

       The first set of calculations in Table 3 (rows 1—3) reports the change in

fundamental equity value, and thus stock prices, assuming no change in

corporate fixed investment (and thus the NOIs) or in taxable debt rates. Row I

simulates the impact of a cut in the corporate tax rate and an increase in the

taxation of equity at the personal level. While the cut in the corporate tax

rate leads directly to an increase in after—tax NOIs, the tax rate changes also

raise the tax exempt rate (given a fixed taxable rate) and thus the equity

rate. More specifically, the equity rate increases by 170 basis points with

the Treasury plan and 141 basis points with the 1986 Act. The net result is a

minor 3% windfall gain to equity with either plan.

       The Treasury proposal changes the rules regarding the deductibility of

financing costs: corporations are allowed to deduct 50% of dividends from

their pre—tax profit, and the proportion of interest that may be deducted is

indexed to the inflation rate. The weighted average after—tax cost of

financing becomes

              r =   b(1—t)i   + (1—b) (l—Ty)e,

where 8 and y are the proportions of interest and dividends deductible from the

tax base.
                                     —10—




      As listed in Table 3 under the Treasury proposal, fundamental equity

value rises from $1069 billion to $1162 (row 1) billion because of the tax rate

reductions, and it rises to $1391 billion (row 2) because of the 50% dividend

exclusion. With the interest indexation provision, both the debt and equity

components of the cost of financing rise, the equity component because of the

reduced tax wedge in the tax—exempt rate vis—a—vis the still—constant taxable

debt rate i. The net result of the higher discount rate is a halving of the

increase in fundamental equity value stemming from the other provisions (row

3)



Variable Corporate Fixed Investment, Constant Taxable Debt Rate

      The marginal rental prices rise so modestly in response to the tax rate

changes in each proposal that the impact on stock values when these prices are

endogenous (row 4) is virtually identical to when they are exogenous (row 1)

On the other hand, the deceleration of depreciation schedules on new

investments, the removal of the investment tax credit, and the only partial

deduction of interest sharply raise rental prices for both plant and equipment,

although the partial deductibility of dividends mitigates the impact of the

Treasury proposal. With the Treasury proposal, rental prices rise to 0.2941

for equipment (from 0.2261) and 0.1859 for plant (from 0.1510) .   With the 1986

Tax Act, the increases are to 0.2649 and 0.1651, respectively. With the NOIs

adjusting with these values, stock prices rise by 13% with the 1986 Act and 30%

with the Treasury proposal.


Variable Corporate Fixed Investment, Constant Aggregate Investment

      As noted, both reforms tend to lower interest rates. The interest

indexation feature of the Treasury plan is the most obvious source of lower

rates. With only partial taxation of interest income and deductibility of

interest expense, both the supply—of and demand—for funds schedules shift
                                      —11—



 downward. The 1986 Tax Act, too, will lower both schedules: removal of the

 investment tax credit and lengthening of depreciation tax lives lower the

 demand—for—funds schedule, and the cut in personal tax rates lowers the supply

 schedule. To illustrate the impact of a decrease in the level of interest

 rates, we employ an estimate of how much the level would have to decline to

 maintain the level of aggregate investment (noncorporate, including owner—

 occupied housing, as well as corporate) constant at prereform values

 (Hendershott, 1986). The lower interest rate levels and the equity rate

 associated with them are listed in Table 2. The taxable debt rate is found to

decline by 1.4 percentage points with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and 2.6 points

with the Treasury plan.

      The reduction in required financing rates reduces the discounting effect

and thus increases fundamental equity value. Row 6 of Table 3 allows all

parameters, including the taxable interest rate, to reflect their post—reform

values, except for the rental prices which are held constant. Rental prices

would be constant if investment adjustment costs were large enough to prevent

any change in investment outlays. The net result is a 23 percent windfall gain

to equity from the Treasury proposal and a 10 percent gain with the enacted

legislation. A comparison of rows 3 and 6 shows that the interest rate

reduction has a substantial positive impact on equity value.

      In row 7 the rental prices are allowed to adjust to reflect all features

of the tax reforms, as would happen in the absence of adjustment costs. These

adjustments have a marginally positive impact on fundamental equity value, with

the Treasury plan providing shareholders with a 26 percent windfall and the Tax

Reform Act a 12 percent gain.

                                 4. Conclusion

      In the past decade, shifts in tax policy have produced significant

windfall gains and losses. This study has introduced a cashf low model for

computing windfalls accruing to equity shareholders. Predictions about

windfalls enable policymakers to better analyze the distributional impacts of

their actions and allow investors to better appreciate their exposure to

unexpected policy changes.

      Our model was applied to both the original Treasury tax reform proposal

and the enacted Tax Reform Act of 1986. Both of these would cut the corporate

tax rate, the latter a little less than the former, and both would raise the

tax rate on equity income. These changes should raise equity values by about 3

percent. The 50 percent dividend exclusion of The Treasury plan would raise

share values by another 14 percent, but most of this gain would be offset by

the only partial deductibility of interest expense (the real component). With

allowance for possible changes in interest rates and rental prices (NOIs) ,   our
best estimates are that the Treasury plan would raise share values by 25

percent and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 would raise them by about 10 percent.

While the latter percentage move is not large in a historic perspective, and

thus could be swamped by other events, a 10 percent windfall is hardly trivial.

In both cases, the rise in stock prices follows from the heavier taxation of

new capital and the resulting rise in returns on existing capital.

    Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1983) deduce that stock prices should have declined

 in response to the shortening tax depreciation lives in ERTA because new

capital was favored over old. Downs and Tehranian (1986) report evidence in

support of this conclusion.



2
    A capital stock's replacement cost is the amount it would cost to replace all

existing capital with new capital, leaving the current productive capacity

unchanged. The stock's fundamental value is the present value of its expected

cashflows. The two are the same when the duration of the cashflow stream from

new capital equals the duration of the cashflow stream from vintage assets

(Downs, 1986).




    If firms keep old capital on the old depreciation schedules, the change in

value due to the tax depreciation change is (assuming a constant r)



                 =
                     jt (l+r) (l—t)Kc3.
                                    5 S
Using equations 5—7 with L approaching infinity, this reduces to

                       =   —




With a single capital type, the change in value per dollar of capital is simply

tZ, Auerbach and Kotlikoff's (1983) equation 4.12.

    We are grateful to Kenneth Rogers and John Musgrave at the Bureau of Economic

Analysis for discussions on the construction of capital stock estimates and for

supplying unpublished investment data. In our estimates, the depreciation

rates for plant and equipment (6) are 0.04 and 0.15, respectively. Our

estimate of K, the replacement cost of nonfinancial corporate plant and

equipment at year—end 1984, is $2145 billion and is virtually identical to the

BEA estimate of $2142 billion.



    Our rental prices are from Hendershott (1986) .   The plant rental price is a

weighted average of those computed for 10—year utility structures, 15—year

utility structures, and industrial structures, the weights being 0.15, 0.30,

and 0.55, respectively. These weights are also used to construct the ACRS tax

depreciation schedules for plant investments after 1980.



6
    Our simulation computes the impact on share prices as if the pre—reform tax

regime had been expected to persist indefinitely into the future and the post—

reform tax parameters are now expected forever. Our results would be dampened

to the extent that investors either anticipated the trend that tax reform has

taken or expect the eventual reversal of some of the reform features (Auerbach

and Hines, 1986)



    The impacts on capital of changes in tax policy when adjustment costs exist

has been modeled by Summers (1981) and Auerbach and Hines (1986). The primary

effect of adjustment costs is that policy changes move rental prices gradually,

rather than instantaneously, to the new steady state. Thus the stock market

change with these costs would lie between those with no change in rental prices

and with an immediate change.

    The level of interest rates has been found to respond to both business tax

changes that alter investment demand [Feldstein and Sumners (1978)) and

personal tax changes that shift personal saving [Peek and Wilcox (1984) J. For

a general analysis of the impact of tax reform proposals on financial markets,

see Hendershott (1985).
