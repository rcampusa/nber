                                   ABSTRACT

This paper develops a model of an open economy which employs distortionary

taxes to finance public consumption, and with an access to the world capital

market. The paper examines the efficiency of quantity restrictions on capital

exports and the accompanying set of taxes. A distinction is made between a

benchmark case where the government can fully tax foreign-source income and a

more realistic case where the government cannot effectively tax
                                                                  foreign-source
income.

                                  Summary

     This paper examines the efficiency of quantity restrictions on

capital exports. When the government can effectively tax foreign-source

income, then it is not efficient to impose restrictions on capital exports

and the optimal tax rates on foreign-source income and domestic-source

income are the same. Such a policy equates the marginal productivity of

domestic capital to the world rate of interest, insuring an efficient

allocation of domestic savings between investment at home and investment

abroad.




     However, when the government cannot effectively tax foreign-source

income, as is often the case in practice, then with free capital mobility

the rate-of-return arbitrage must equate the after-tax rate of return on

domestic capital to the world rate of interest. Such an equalization

implies that the before-tax rate of return on domestic capital exceeds the

world rate of interest. Thus, free exports of capital result in an

underinvestrnent in capital at home and an overinvestment in capital

abroad. In this distorted world it would be efficient policy to restrict

capital exports to a point where the marginal productivity of domestic

capital falls below the world rate of interest. At this point the stock

of domestic capital, induced by the restrictive policy, exceeds the level

of domestic capital which would have been optimal under the circumstances

where the government can fully tax foreign-source income.

     Evidently,   the case where governments can effectively tax
                                                                   foreign-
source income and need impose no restrictions on capital exports is

preferable from the country point of view to the case where the
                                                                   government
cannot effectively tax foreign-source income and thus having to resort to

quantity restrictions on capital exports. This may explain why the

European Community which is moving towards a single capital market in

1992, also searches for ways to enforce taxation of foreign-source

income, so as to eliminate incentives to locate capital abroad.
                             I. Introduction



     The fundamental result of the theory of second-best suggests that

adding distortions to already existing ones may very well enhance

efficiency and welfare. To put it differently, reducing the number of

distortions in the economy may well lower well-being. Thus, even though

there are in general gains from international trade, some restrictions on

free trade may be called for in a distortion-ridden economy.

evertheless, in a recent paper (Razin and Sadka (1989)), we showed that

opening-up an economy to international capital movements enhances

efficiency and welfare, even in the presence of distortionary taxes

(taxes which affect margins of substitution between labor and leisure,

between consumption and savings, etc.), provided these taxes are designed

optimally. )j The setup employed in that analysis assumed that the

government can tax residents on their income from abroad.



     However, there is now substantial evidence that governments encounter

severe enforcement difficulties in attempting to tax foreign-source

income. Dooley (1987) estimates that in the 1980-82 time period as much

as $250 billion may be classified as capital flight by U.S. residents.

Tanzi (1987) reports that tax experts were concerned that lowering the

U.S. individual and corporate tax rates in the U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986

would induce capital drain from other countries by providing a tax


  )J The reader who is familiar with the optimal-tax literature will no
doubt recognize that this result is consistent with the aggregate
production-efficiency proposition in a closed economy (see, for instance,
Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) and Sadka (1977)).
                                   -2-


advantage to investments in the U.S.. These concerns are based on an

implicit assumption that the governments of these countries cannot

effectively tax their residents on their U.S. income so as to wipe out the

U.S. tax advantage. The issue of capital flight is even more relevant for

developing countries. Cumby and Levich (1987) estimate that a significant

portion of the external debt in developing countries is channelled into

investments abroad through overinvoicing of imports and uriderinvoicing of

exports. Dooley (1988) estimates that capital flight from a large number

of developing countries amounts to about one-third of their external debt

in the time period 1977-1984.



     The purpose of this paper is to examine the efficiency (from a

social viewpoint) of free international capital movements in the presence

of severe difficulties of taxing foreign-source income due to capital

flight. Specifically, we investigate the appropriateness of controls on

capital exports or imports. The paper is organized as follows.

Section II presents a stylized model of an open economy which is

integrated in the world capital market and uses an optimal set of taxes to

finance public consumption. Section III analyzes a benchmark case where

income from abroad can be fully taxed. The central section of the paper,

Section IV, examines the case where governments cannot effectively tax

foreign-source income. A special attention is paid to the design of

optimal incentives for investment at home and to the design of efficient

restrictions on capital exports. Section V concludes the paper. In order

to facilitate the exposition in the text, we relegate technical

derivations of the main propositions to the appendices.

                       II. The Analytical Framework



      Consider a stylized two-period model of a small open economy with

one composite good, serving both for (private and public) consumption and

for investment. In the first period the economy possesses an initial

endowment of the good and individuals can decide how much of it to consume

and how much of it to save. Savings are allocated either to investment at

home or to investment abroad. In the second period, output (produced by

capital and labor) and income from foreign investment are allocated

between private and public consumption. To finance optimally its (public)

consumption the government employs taxes on labor, taxes on income from

investment at home, and taxes on income from investment abroad. For the

sake of simplicity, we assume that the government is active only in the

second period.



      In practice, governments encounter severe enforcement difficulties in

attempting to impose taxes on foreign-source income. For instance, many

foreign experts worried that lowering the individual and corporate tax

rates in the U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 would induce a "capital drain"

from other countries since it would increase the net return to capital in

the U.S.. They implicitly assume that governments cannot effectively tax

capital invested abroad and thus cannot reduce the net return on that

capital to the level of the domestic rate of return (see Tanzi (1987)).

Dooley (1988) estimated that a significant fraction of external claims and

of external liabilities in various developing countries is unaccounted for

due to capital flight. L'   Therefore,   after briefly analyzing the case


  J    See also Dooley (1987), Cwnby and Levich (1987) and Ciovartnini (1989)
                                    -4-


 where foreign-source income is fully taxable, we concentrate on the more

 realistic case where such income is effectively taxed only
                                                              partially.



     We consider a representative individual with a utility function of

 the form



      (1)      U(c1,c2,L,C) —   uP(c1,c2,L)   +   u(G),

where uP and u are the private and public components of the utility

function, respectively; c1, c2, and L are first-period consumption,

second-period consumption, and second period labor supply, respectively;

and C is second-period public consumption. )J



     Denote saving in the form of domestic capital by K and saving in the

form of foreign capital by B. Since the focus of our analysis is on the

case where income from capital invested abroad cannot be fully taxed, we

assume that the pattern of capital flows is such that the country is a

capital exporter (i.e., B   0). Hence, the amount of saving channeled

through domestic investment constitutes also the domestic stock of capital

in the second period.




  jJ To ensure diminishing marginal rates of substitution between private
and public commodities we assume, as usual, that uP and u are strictly
concave. Notice also that the separability between private and public
commodities embodied in equation (1) ensures that government spending on
public goods does not affect individual demand patterns for private goods
or the supply of labor.
                                             -5-


          The private-sector budget constraints in the first and second periods

are given, respectively, by:



          (2)          c1+K+B—I

          (3)          c2 — K [l+r(l-tD)1 + B [l+r*(ltF)1 +   (l-t)wL,

where:



      -   tax   on capital income from domestic sources;

tF -      tax   on capital income from foreign sources;

      -   tax   on labor income;

r     -   domestic rate of interest;
r* -      world   rate of interest (net of taxes levied abroad);

w -       wage rate;

and

I     -   Initial   endowment.



          Obviously, in the absence of quantity restrictions on capital flows,

the private sector must earn the same rate of return on domestic

investment and on investment abroad; that is:



          (4)          r(l-tD) —   r*(ltF)

          When quantity restrictions are imposed on investment abroad, the

arbitrage condition (4) becomes:
                                               -6-


        (4a)        r(l-tD) <       r*(ltF)

               As is common, we consolidate the periodic budget constraints in

equations (2) and (3) into a single (present value) budget constraint:



        (5)         c1 +   qc   —    I + B((l + r*(ltF))q   -
                                                                1),


where



        (6)        q — (1 +     (1   -
                                         tD)r)1

is the consumer (i.e., after-tax) price of second-period consumption in

present values. In order to highlight the issues associated with capital-

income taxation (i.e., saving and investment incentives and government

tax revenues), we abstract from issues pertaining to variable-labor supply

and assume that the labor supply is inelastic. Accordingly, after-tax

labor income is added to the initial endowment and their sum is denoted by

I in equation (5). jj




  1/    It
         is straightforward to show that efficiency considerations usually
require to tax the inelastic labor income first before moving on to taxing
capital income. We assume that the size of government is large enough so
that the tax on labor income does not suffice to finance government
consumption and thus a distortionary tax on capital income is also needed.
Formally, we conclude that I —            I.
                                          -7-


     The second term     on the right-hand side of equation (5), (namely

B ((I ÷ (1 -    t)r*)q    -
                               1)) plays a crucial role in the analysis. In case
there are no restrictions on capital exports, the arbitrage condition (4)

must hold, and this term vanishes. Otherwise (when capital exports are

restricted) condition (4a) applies and this term becomes positive,

representing irtframarginal gains to the savings of the private sector that

are channeled to investment abroad.



     A maximization of the utility function U, subject to the budget

constraint in equation (5) yields the consumption demand functions:



     (7)         Cj —    cj(q,    I + B((l + (l.tp.)r*)q -   1)),   i   1,2




The utility obtained from these demand functions (the indirect utility

function) is:



     (8)         V —    v(q,    I + B((l + (l.t)r*)q -   1)) + g (G)


     Domestic output (Y) is produced in the second period by capital and

labor, according to a production function which exhibits diminishing

marginal products. Suppressing the fixed labor input, we write the

production function as:



     (9)         Y — F(K)
                                                             -8-


      The firm's demand for capital is determined by the marginal

productivity condition:



       (10)          F'(K) —           r

      Equilibrium in the first period requires that the demand for domestic

capital (i.e., K) is equal to the supply of domestic capital (i.e.,

I -   c1   -
               B):


       (11)          K —   I   -
                                       c1   -   B




Similarly, equilibrium in the second period requires the equalization of

(private and public) demand for and supply of consumption goods 1/:



       (12)          c2 + G — F(K) + K + (1 +                         r*)B


      Substituting equation (11) into equation (12) yields the single

(consolidated) equilibrium condition:



       (13)          c2 + C        -
                                        F(I     -
                                                    c1   -
                                                             B)   -
                                                                      (I   -
                                                                               cj   -
                                                                                        B)   -   (1 +   r*)B   — 0




  j/ This condition must hold because obviously there will be no savings
and investment in the second (and last) period.
  Z/ The government budget constraint is rtDK + r*tFB + F(K)
                                                               -  rK — C.
Note that the term F(K) - rK represents the  revenue from taxes  on labor
income. notice also, that by Walras' Law this constraint is satisfied in
equilibrium.
                                      -9-


    As mentioned before, we employ the analytical framework to examine

two distinct regimes. The first regime, which we may term the optimum,

entails no constraints on the taxation of foreign-source income. This

regime is considered as a benchmark case. In the second, more realistic

regime, which we may term the suboptimuxn, foreign-source income cannot be

taxed as effectively as domestic-source income. To highlight the

distinction between the regimes we simply assume that in the second

regime no tax can be levied on foreign-source income (i.e., tF —   0).


                         III. The Optimal Regime



     This section deals with the case where the government can tax

foreign-source income as effectively as domestic-source income. The

question naturally arises whether it would be indeed optimal to levy the

same tax rate on the incomes from these two sources and abstain altogether

from quantity controls on capital exports.



     Since there are distortionary taxes as part of the optimal program,

the resource allocation is obviously not Pareto-efficient. In general,

the intertemporal allocation of consumption, the leisure-consumption

choice, and the private-public consumption tradeoffs are all distorted.

Nevertheless, we show in this section that the optimal program (namely,

the regime in which no constraints on taxation of foreign-source income

exist) requires an efficient allocation of capital between investment at

home and abroad, so that F1 —   r*.   That is, the marginal product of

domestic capital must be equated to the foreign rate of return on capital.
                                       10 -




      To derive the optimal program, the government maximizes the indirect

utility function in equation (8) subject to the equilibrium condition in

equation (13). The control (policy) variables at the government's

disposal are the   tax    rate on domestic interest income (tD) or, more

generally, the consumer price of future consumption (q), the tax rate on

interest income from abroad (tF), the level of public consumption (C), and

the quota on capital exports (B). Carrying out the optimization problem

indeed yields the efficiency condition



      (14)      F' —     r*


(see Razin and Sadka (1989) or Appendix 1).

Accordingly, savings of the private sector must be allocated efficiently

between investment at home and investment abroad. Since F' —      r,   the

arbitrage condition is satisfied if the two tax rates are equalized, that

is:




      (15)      tD —     tF


In such a case there is no need to impose any quantity restrictions on

capital exports. J




  jJ Evidently, this is an open-economy variant of the aggregate
efficiency theorem in optimal tax theory (e.g. Diamond and Mirrlees
(1971), Sadka (1977), and Dixit (1985)).
                                         - 11   -




                            IV. The     Suboptimal Regime



     We turn now to a more realistic case where the government cannot

effectively tax income from investment abroad. To highlight this

phenomenon we set tF — 0 and write tD —             t. In   this case, if the

government allows unlimited exports of capital, then capital will flow out

of the country up to the point where the net return on domestic investment

equals the net return on investment abroad:



     (16)      (1 -   t)r — r*

This means that F' —   r   >   r*,   so that the domestic stock of capital is

smaller than in the optimal regime (where F'                r*), given that the

marginal productivity of capital is diminishing. The mirror image of such

an underinvestment in capital at home is an overinvestment in capital

abroad.



     Therefore, an interesting issue that arises in this context is

whether it is now efficient from the society standpoint to restrict the

exports of capital, and if so, how severe should the restriction be? One

may rnask, for instance, whether the restriction on exports of capital

should bring the domestic capital stock all the way back to a level which

is even higher than in the optimal regime (i.e. , an overinvestment in

domestic capital). Furthermore, is it possible that capital exports

should be altogether banned when foreign-source income cannot be

effectively taxed? We address these issues below.
                                               - 12   -




     To derive the effects of a change in the capital-export quota on

welfare we totally differentiate the indirect utility function in equation

(8) with respect to B (see Appendix 2). This yields:



     (17)            —               +    v     ((1 +     r*)q   -   1),



where Vy    >0   is the marginal utility of income.



     Similarly, total differentiation of the market-clearing condition in

equation (13) yields the general-equilibrium effect of a change in the

    Consider now the point where no restrictions on capital exports are
imposed. We refer to this case as the laissez-faire case. The arbitrage

condition in equation (4) then implies that:




     (20)          q — (1 +     r*)
Hence, employing (17) and (18), we conclude that:



                   dv —                        -l
     (21)                  -v   K(r* -   r)A


Since r* <   r   and A <   0, it follows from equation (21) that dv/dB < 0 at
the laissez-faire point. This means that reducing B is welfare-improving.

Namely, the government should impose a binding quota on capital exports in

order to reduce the amount invested abroad. We show in Appendix 4 that,

as expected, such a quota usually increases the stock of domestic capital.



     Having established that some restrictions on capital exports are

desirable in the suboptimal regime (when the government cannot effectively

tax the income from the capital exported) we turn now to the question of

how severe the restrictions should be. As a benchmark consider K*, the

 stock of domestic capital exported under the optimal, regime defined by

  F'(K*) —   r*.   Given this benchmark we then investigate the question

whether the restrictions on exports of capital should be severe enough so

 as to bring the stock of domestic capital to a level which even exceeds
                                           - 14   -




K*; or whether the restrictions should not be so severe so that the level
of domestic capital remains still below K*.



    To do this, we evaluate the derivative of the indirect utility

function, dv/dB, at the point where K — K* (and consequently, r —           r*).
This derivative (see Appendix 5) is:




        (22)                           v((l ÷r*)q - 1)   A1 rt C1q
                    [   ]   K     K*




where   c°lq is the Hicks-Slutsky compensated effect of a change in the
price    of future consumption (q) on present consumption (c1). Since two

goods must always be net substitutes it follows that c°lq > 0.            Hence,


dv/dB < 0      at the point K — K*.        This means that reducing B further, beyond

the point where K — K*          (and r —   r*), enhances individual welfare. This
implies    that the stock of domestic capital rises to a level which exceeds

the corresponding level in the optimal regime, implying that r <           r*   (see

Appendix 6). Thus, when the government cannot effectively tax the income

from the capital invested abroad, it is efficient to overinvest capital at

home up to a point where the marginal product (r) falls below the world

rate of interest (r*).



        Finally,   we turn to investigate an extreme possibility: Should
capital    exports be altogether banned (i.e., B —0) when the government
                                      - 15   -




cannot effectively tax the income from the capital exported? Obviously,

if dv/dB < 0 at B —   0, then no capital exports should be allowed.


        It turns out that the latter is a real possibility. To see this,
                                                                         0 we
notice that equations (17)-(19) imply (see Appendix 7) that at B

have:




        (23)
                  [    ]   B —   —v   A1 (rtc°1q ((1+r*)q-l) -   c2(r*-r))


        Now, when r is sufficiently close to r*, then dv/dB < 0 because A < 0

and c°lq > 0.     In this case, a total ban on capital exports is called for.

The rationale for this result is straightforward. When r is close to r*,

there is very little gain for the society as a whole from investing

abroad, because this gain is equal only to the difference between r and

r* (though the private sector can still gain considerably from investing

 abroad if r(l-t) is considerably below r*). However, the government loses

 a significant amount of tax revenues from the outflow of capital.

 Therefore, in this case, it is not efficient to allow exports of capital.



                                  V. Conc1usifl



         This paper examines the efficiency of restrictions on capital

 exports. We show that when governments can tax the income from this

 capital no quantity restrictions should apply. This implies that before-

 tax rate of return on domestic capital (i.e. ,    the marginal productivity of
                                          - 16   -




domestic capital, denoted by r) should be equated to the world rate of
interest (denoted by r*). Such an equality insures an efficient

allocation of the country's savings between investment at home and

investment abroad (see Figure 1).



     When governments cannot effectively tax foreign-source income and

apply no restrictions on capital exports then the rate-of-return arbitrage

condition equates the after-tax rate of return on domestic capital (i.e.,

(l-t)r) to the world rate of interest (i.e., r*). This equality implies

that the before-tax rate of return on domestic capital exceeds the world

rate of interest (i.e. ,   r   >   r*).   We show that in this distorted world it

would be efficient to restrict capital exports and to increase the stock

of domestic capital up to a point where the before-tax rate of return on

domestic capital falls below the world rate of interest (i.e., r < r*).

This means that the stock of domestic capital induced by the restrictive

policy exceeds the level of capital that would have been optimal under

circumstances where the government is able to fully tax foreign-source

income.




     Obviously, the case where governments can effectively tax foreign-

source income and impose no restrictions on capital exports is preferable

for the country to the case where it cannot effectively tax foreign-source

income and thus having to resort to quantity restrictions on capital

exports. Indeed, this argument may explain why the European Community,

which is moving towards a single capital market in 1992, searches for

ways to enforce taxation of foreign-source income (by a proposed system of
                                   - 17   -




               taxation) so' as to eliminate incentives to locate capital
origin-based
abroad (see Giovannifli (1989)).

 then equation (18) follows from equation (C2) and equation (C3).



      It remains to show that the right-hand side of equation (19) is

 indeed negative. Denote the expression on the left-hand-side of the

 market-clearing condition in equation (13) by E. This expression is

 nothing else but the economy's excess demand for future consUxflPtion.

 Recall that q is the price of future consumption. For the equilibrium to

 be Wairas-stable, the excess demand curve must be downward slopping,

 namely dE/dq <    0.

     4.     We analyze in this appendix the effect on the domestic stock of

capital of a restriction on capital exports. Since K —                                I   -   C1 - B     (see

equation (11)), it follows that:




     (Dl)      —   -(c1q   +

Substituting equations (18) and (20) into equation (Dl) we conclude that

at the laissez-faire point we must have:



               —
                    (cq    +
                               Cly   B(l +   r*))(r*    -

            that present consumption is a normal good (i.e.                               Cj.y >     0) and
assuming
that present consumption and future consumption are gross substitutes

 (i.e., cq >0).



     Therefore, imposing a small binding quota on capital exports (i.e., a

 small reduction in B) increases the stock of domestic capital.

Since    K/q — c2   -
                            (1   + r*)           B, by equations (5) and (11), it follows from

      Substituting into equation (E4) the Hicks-Slutsky equations



           c1q —   cq       -
                                C2C1y.



and



           C2q —       Cq       c2c2y




where Cjq j — 1,2, is the Hicks-Slutsky compensated price effects, it

follows that:




                            — K* Vy ((1 + r*)q -          1.)   A1 ((1 + r) cq + cq)
      (E5) [       ]   K




      Since the Hicks-Slutsky compensated demand functions are homogerious

of degree zero in prices, it follows from the Euler's equation that:




       (E6) cjq + qcq — 0



Substituting q — (1 + (1 -               t)rY1-   into equation (E6) we conclude that:




       (E7) (1 + r)cq + cq —               rtcq    > 0,




because two commodities are always net substitutes. Finally substituting

 equation (E7) into equation (ES) yields equation (22).

    6.      In this appendix we investigate the effect of reducing B below

the point where K — K* (and r —                   r*)   on the stock of domestic capital.

Since K —   I   -
                    c1      -   B   (see equation (11)), it follows that




                                                                       ((1 + r*)q - 1)   -   1

                                                                  dy

Substituting r              r* into equation (18) we conclude that




     (F2) [             ]   K - K*
                                        -   ((1   ÷ r)dly + c2y)((l + r*)q -       l)A       > 0,




as we assume that present consumption and future consumption are normal

goods (i.e., Cj.y > 0 and C2y > 0). Thus, it                           follows from equations (Fl)

and (F2) that




         IdKl

Namely, reducing capital exports increases the stock of capital invested

 at home. Thus, it is efficient to overinvest at home.

    7.      In this appendix we derive equation (23).



    At B — 0, we have from equations (18) and (19):




            I        1         —   -((1   + r) Cly + C2y) ((1 + r*) g - 1) + r* -r

            [dBjBO                                 (l.s-r)clq+c2q


Since K/q = c2 at B — 0             (see equations (5) and (11)), we conclude from

equation (17) and equation (Cl) that



            Idvi                       -1
                                   Vy A ((i + r)(clq + c2cly)+ C2q + c2c2y)

where use is made, as in Appendix E, of the Hicks-Slutsky equations.

Substituting equation (E7) into equation (C2) yields equation (23).
