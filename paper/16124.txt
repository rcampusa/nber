                                            ABSTRACT

This paper compares the performance of economies with different monetary regimes during the last
quarter century. The conclusions include: (1) There is little evidence that inflation targeting affects
performance in advanced economies, but some evidence of benefits in emerging economies; (2) Europe’s
monetary union has increased intra-European trade and capital flows, but divergence in national price
levels may destabilize output in the future; (3) The “monetary analysis” of the European Central Bank
has little effect on the ECB’s policy decisions; and (4) Countries with hard currency pegs experience
unusually severe recessions when capital flight occurs.

I. INTRODUCTION

       The choice of monetary regime is a perennial issue in

economics.       For decades, advocates of discretionary or “just do

it” monetary policy have debated supporters of regimes that

constrain policymakers.             Such regimes range from money targeting,

advocated by Milton Friedman in the 1960s, to the inflation

targeting practiced by many countries today.

       This chapter compares monetary regimes that have been

popular in advanced and emerging economies during the last 25

years.     I examine countries with discretionary policy, such as

the United States, and countries with inflation targets. I also

examine countries that have given up national monetary policy,

either by forming a currency union or through a hard peg to a

foreign currency.          Finally, I examine a remnant of the once-

popular policy of money targeting: the European Central Bank’s

use of “monetary analysis” in setting interest rates.1



       1
          To keep this chapter manageable, I limit the analysis in two ways. First, while I
examine hard exchange rate pegs – currency boards and dollarization – I otherwise deemphasize
exchange-rate policy. I do not address the relative merits of flexible exchange rates, managed
floats, and adjustable pegs. Frankel’s chapter in this Handbook discusses these issues.
    Second, I examine both advanced economies and emerging economies, but not the world’s
poorest countries. Emerging economies include such countries as Brazil and the Czech
Republic; they do not include most countries in Africa. Many of the poorest countries target
monetary aggregates, a policy that has lost favor among richer countries (see IMF [2008] for a
list of money targeters).

                                              1
    Other chapters in this Handbook examine the theoretical

arguments for alternative policies (e.g. Svensson on inflation

targets).   This chapter deemphasizes theory and examines the

actual economic performance of countries that have adopted

alternative regimes.   I focus on the behavior of core

macroeconomic variables: output, inflation, and interest rates.

    Section II of this chapter examines two monetary regimes

adopted by many countries: inflation targeting (IT), and

membership in Europe’s currency union. I focus on advanced

economies and the period from 1985 to mid-2007 –- the Great

Moderation.   Simple statistical tests suggest that neither IT nor

the euro had major effects on economic performance, either good

or bad, during the sample period. An important topic for future

research is the performance of the two regimes during the recent

financial crisis.

    Section III reviews the previous literature on inflation

targeting. Many papers confirm my finding that IT does not have

major effects in advanced economies. Some authors report

beneficial effects, but their evidence is dubious. The story is

different when we turn to emerging economies: there is

substantial evidence that IT reduces average inflation in these

economies and stabilizes inflation and output. Even for emerging

economies, however, the effects of IT are not as clear-cut as


                                 2
some authors suggest.

    Section IV surveys research on the effects of the euro and

adds some new results.   The evidence to date suggests that the

currency union has produced a moderate increase in intra-European

trade and a larger increase in capital-market integration.    On

the downside, price levels in different countries have diverged,

causing changes in competitiveness.   This problem could

destabilize output in the future.

    Section V turns to the role of money in policymaking at the

European Central Bank.   On its face, the ECB’s reliance on a

“monetary pillar” of policy differs from the practices of most

central banks.   However, a review of history suggests that this

difference is largely an illusion.    ECB policymakers regularly

discuss the behavior of monetary aggregates, but these variables

rarely if ever influence their setting of interest rates.

    Finally, Section VI discusses hard exchange-rate pegs,

including currency boards and dollarization.    History suggests

that these policies are associated with substantial risk of

economic downturns. In most economies with hard pegs, episodes of

capital flight have produced deep recessions.

    Section VII concludes.




                                 3
II. SOME SIMPLE EVIDENCE

    In the past quarter century, two development in monetary

policy stand out: the spread of inflation targeting and the

creation of the euro. I estimate the effects of these regime

shifts on economic performance during the period from 1985 to

mid-2007–-an era of economic stability commonly known as the

Great Moderation. I examine 20 advanced economies, including

countries that adopted inflation targeting, joined the euro, did

neither, or did both (Spain and Finland adopted IT and then

switched to the euro). I find that neither of the two regimes has

substantially changed the behavior of output, inflation, or long-

term interest rates.

Background

    New Zealand and Canada pioneered inflation targeting in the

early 1990s.   Under this regime, the central bank’s primary goal

is to keep inflation near an announced target or within a target

range. This policy quickly gained popularity, and today

approximately 30 central banks are inflation targeters (IMF,

2008).

    In 1999, 11 European countries abolished their national

currencies and adopted the euro; 15 countries used the euro in

2009.    This currency union dwarfs all others in the world.   I

will interpret euro adoption as a choice of monetary regime:


                                  4
rather than choose discretionary policy or inflation targeting, a

country cedes control of its monetary policy to the ECB.

    I compare inflation targeting and euro membership to a group

of policy regimes that I call “traditional.”   This group includes

all regimes in advanced economies since 1985 that are not IT or

the euro. Some of these regimes, such as those of the United

States and Japan, fit the classic notion of discretion.    In

classifying policy regimes, the IMF (2008) categorizes the U.S.

and Japan as “other,” with a footnote saying they “have no

explicitly stated nominal anchor, but rather monitor various

indicators in conducting monetary policy.”

    Other regimes in the traditional category do involve some

nominal anchor, at least in theory.   These regimes include money

targeting in Germany and Switzerland in the 1980s and 1990s. They

also include the European Monetary System (EMS) of the same era,

which featured target ranges for exchange rates.

   In most cases, traditional monetary regimes are highly

flexible. Germany and Switzerland’s money targets were medium-run

guide-posts; policymakers had considerable discretion to adjust

policy from year to year (Bernanke and Mishkin, 1992). The EMS

also gave central banks substantial latitude in setting policy. A

country could belong to the System and adopt another regime:

Germany targeted money and Spain and Finland targeted inflation.


                                5
Exchange-rate bands were adjusted a number of times, and

countries could leave the System (the U.K. and Italy) and reenter

(Italy).

    Economists have suggested many effects of switching from

traditional policy regimes to IT or the euro. For example,

proponents of IT argue that this policy anchors inflation

expectations, making it easier to stabilize the economy (e.g.

King, 2005). Skeptics, on the other hand, suggest that IT

stabilizes inflation at the expense of more volatile output (e.g.

Kohn, 2005). Proponents argue that IT increases the

accountability of policymakers (e.g. Bernanke et al., 1999),

while skeptics argue that IT reduces accountability (Friedman,

2004).

    Many students of the euro cite both benefits and costs of

this regime (e.g. Lane, 2006, 2009). For example, a common

currency increases the integration of European economies,

promoting efficiency and growth. On the other hand, “one size

fits all” monetary policy produces sub-optimal responses to

country-specific shocks.

Methodology

    Here I seek to measure the effects of IT and the euro in

simple ways. I focus on basic measures of economic performance:

the means and standard deviations of inflation, output, and long-


                                6
term interest rates. The basic approach is “differences in

differences”: I compare changes in performance over time in

countries that adopted IT or the euro and countries that did not.

An important detail is that, following Ball and Sheridan (2005),

I control for the initial level of performance. This approach

addresses the problem that changes in policy regime are

endogenous.

     Gertler (2005) and Geraats (2010) criticize the Ball-

Sheridan methodology, suggesting that it produces misleading

estimates of the effects of regime changes. Here I present the

method and discuss informally why it eliminates the bias in pure

diffs-in-diffs estimates. Appendix 1 to this chapter formally

derives conditions under which the Ball-Sheridan estimator is

unbiased.

     Ball and Sheridan examine two time periods and two policy

regimes, inflation targeting and traditional policy. In this

chapter’s empirical work, I add a third regime, the euro, and

examine three time periods. To build intuition, I first discuss

estimation of the effects of IT in the two-period / two-regime

case, and then show how the approach generalizes.

     Two Periods and Two Regimes Let X be some measure of

economic performance, such as the average rate of inflation. Xi1

and Xi2 are the levels of X in country i and periods 1 and 2. In


                                7
period 1, all countries have traditional monetary policy; in

period 2, some countries switch to inflation targeting.

     At first blush, a natural way to estimate the effect of IT

on X is to run a diffs-in-diffs regression:

     (1)   Xi2 - Xi1 = a + bIi + ,i ,

where Ii is a dummy variable that equals one if country i adopted

IT in period 2. The coefficient b is the average difference in

the change in X between countries that switched to IT and

countries that did not. One might think that b captures the

effect of IT.

     Unfortunately, the dummy variable I is likely to be

correlated with the error term ,, causing bias in the OLS

estimate of b. To see this point, suppose for concreteness that X

is average inflation. The correlation of , and I has two

underlying sources:

     (A) Dissatisfaction with inflation performance in period 1

is one reason that a country might adopt IT in period 2. That is,

a high level of Xi1 makes it more likely that Ii=1.   The data

confirm this effect: the average Xi1 is significantly higher for

IT adopters than for non-adopters.

     (B) A high level of Xi1 has a negative effect on Xi2-Xi1. This

effect reflects the basic statistical phenomenon of regression to

the mean: high values of Xi1 are partly the result of transitory


                                   8
factors, so they imply that Xi is likely to fall in period 2.

This effect exists regardless of whether a country adopts IT;

thus a high Xi1 has a negative effect on the error term ,i in

equation (1).

     To summarize, Xi1 has a positive effect on Ii and a negative

effect on ,i. As a result, variation in Xi1 induces a negative

correlation between Ii and ,i, which biases downward the OLS

estimate of b. If IT has no true effect on inflation, the

estimate of b is likely to suggest a negative effect. For more on

this point, readers who like folksy intuition should see the

analogy to baseball batting averages in Ball and Sheridan (p.

256). Readers who prefer mathematical rigor should see Appendix 1

to this chapter.

     Ball and Sheridan address the problem with equation (1) by

adding Xi1:

     (2)   Xi2 - Xi1 = a + bIi + cXi1 + ,i

In this specification, ,i is the change in Xi that is not

explained by either Ii or Xi1. Variation in Xi1 does not affect

this term, so effect (B) discussed above does not arise. Xi1

still affects Ii (effect (A)), but this no longer induces

correlation between Ii and ,i. The bias in the OLS estimate of b

disappears.

     Again, Appendix 1 expands on this argument: it derives


                                   9
conditions under which OLS produces an unbiased estimate of b in

equation (2). The intuition is that adding Xi1 to the equation

controls for regression to the mean. Now if b is significant, it

means that adopting IT has an effect on inflation that is

unrelated to initial inflation.

     Three Periods and Three Regimes In this chapter’s empirical

work, I compare three policy regimes: traditional policy, IT, and

the euro. I also split the data into three time periods: t = 1,

2, 3; as detailed below, this is natural given the observed

timing of regime shifts. To capture these changes, I generalize

equation (2) to

   (3)   Xit - Xit-1

            = aD2t + bD3t + cIit + dEit

               + eXit-1(D2t) + fXit-1(D3t) + ,it , t=2,3

where D2t and D3t are dummy variables for periods 2 and 3. In this

regression, there are two observations for each country. For one

observation, the dependent variable is the change in X from

period 1 to period 2; in the other, it is the change from 2 to 3.

     On the right side of equation (3), the variables of interest

are Iit and Eit, which indicate changes in regime from period t-1

to period t.    These variables are defined by

   Iit = 1 if country i switched from traditional policy in

period t-1 to IT or the euro in period t;


                                    10
      = 0 otherwise .

   Eit = 1 if country i switched from traditional policy or IT in

period t-1 to the euro in period t;

      = 0 otherwise .

     To interpret these variables, it is helpful to look ahead to

the data. In period 1, all countries have traditional monetary

policy. In period 2, which starts in the early 1990s, some switch

to IT. In period 3, which starts in the late 1990s, additional

countries adopt IT, and some countries switch from their period-2

regime to the euro. In the entire sample, we observe three types

of regime changes: traditional to IT, IT to the euro, and

traditional to the euro.

     If country i switches from traditional policy to IT in

period t, then Iit=1 and Eit=0. The coefficient on I gives the

effect of this regime change. If a country switches from IT to

the euro, then Iit=0 and Eit=1; the coefficient on E gives the

effect. Finally, if a country switches from traditional policy to

the euro, then Iit=1 and Eit=1. Thus the effect of a traditional-

to-euro switch is the sum of the coefficients on I and E.

     The dummy variables D2t and D3t allow the constant in the

regression to differ across time periods. Similarly, the

interactions of the dummies with Xit-1 allow different regression-

to-the-mean effects. Appendix 1 discusses the interpretation of


                                11
these differences.

The Data

    I estimate equation (3) for 20 advanced economies: all

countries with populations above one million that were members of

the OECD in 1985. This choice of countries follows Ball and

Sheridan. Table 1 lists the countries and their policy regimes in

three time periods. In the 20 countries, regime shifts occurred

in two waves: seven countries adopted IT from 1990 to 1995, and

twelve adopted either IT or the euro from 1999 to 2001. Thus the

data break naturally into three periods: before the first wave of

regime changes, between the two waves, and after the second wave.

    The precise dating of the periods differs across countries.

In all cases, period 1 begins in 1985:1. For countries that

adopted IT in the early 1990s, period 2 starts in the first

quarter of the new policy. For countries that did not adopt IT in

the early 90s, period 2 begins at the average start date of

adopters (1993:3).   Similarly, for countries that switched

regimes between 1999 and 2001, period 3 starts in the first

quarter of the new policy, and the start date for non-switchers

is the average for switchers (1999:2). Period 3 ends in 2007:2

for all countries.

    I estimate equation (3) for six versions of the variable X:

the means and standard deviations of consumer price inflation,


                                12
real output growth, and nominal interest rates on long-term

government bonds.           The inflation data are from the IMF’s

International Financial Statistics; output and interest rates are

from the OECD. The inflation and interest-rate data are

quarterly. The output data are annual because accurate quarterly

data are not available for all countries. (In studying output

behavior, I include a year in the time period for a regime only

if all four quarters belong to the period under my quarterly

dating.)

       Appendix 2 to this chapter provides further details about

the data. It also provides complete results of the regressions

discussed here.

Main Results

       Table 2 summarizes the key coefficient estimates: the

coefficients on I and E for the six measures of performance. The

Table also shows the sum of the coefficients, which gives the

effect of a traditional-to-euro switch.2

       Effects of IT: The first row of Table 2 shows the effects of

switching from traditional policy to IT. There is only one


       2
         Table 2 reports OLS standard errors. It does not report robust standard errors that
account for heteroscedasticity or correlations between a country’s errors in periods 2 and 3. The
good properties of robust standard errors are asymptotic; with 40 observations, OLS standard
errors may be more accurate. (The folk wisdom of applied econometricians appears to support
OLS standard errors for small samples, but I have not found a citation.) In any case, I have also
computed robust standard errors for my estimates, and they do not change my qualitative results.

                                               13
beneficial effect: IT reduces average inflation by -0.7

percentage points (t=2.6). To interpret this result, note that

average inflation for IT countries is 1.7% in period 2 and 2.1%

in period 3. My estimate implies that these numbers would be 2.4%

and 2.8% without IT. This effect is not negligible but not

dramatic either.

    Point estimates imply that IT raises the mean and standard

deviation of long-term nominal interest rates. The statistical

significance of these effects is borderline, however, and they do

not have a compelling theoretical explanation; to the contrary,

if IT anchors inflation expectations, it ought to stabilize long-

term interest rates at a low level. I am inclined to dismiss the

interest-rate results as flukes. In any case, there is no

evidence whatsoever that IT improves the behavior of interest

rates or output.

    Effects of the Euro: The estimated effects of euro adoption

are shown in the second and third rows of Table 2. The second row

shows effects of an IT-euro switch; the third row, a traditional-

euro switch.

    Once again, the results do not point to large benefits of a

new regime. Euro adoption can reduce average interest rates–-but

the effect has borderline significance (t=2.0) and arises only

for an IT-euro switch, not a traditional-euro switch. A priori,


                               14
one might expect a larger effect for the second type of switch.

There is also an adverse, borderline-significant effect of a

traditional-euro switch on output volatility.

Robustness

    I have varied my estimation of equation (3) in several ways:

     C I have dropped countries from the sample to make the set

of “traditional” policy regimes more homogeneous. In one

variation, I eliminate Denmark, which fixes its exchange rate

against the euro. In another, I eliminate all countries that

belonged to the pre-1999 European Monetary System. (In this

variation I can estimate the effects of IT but not of the euro,

as only EMS members adopted the euro).

     C I have varied the dating of the three time periods, making

them the same for all countries. Specifically, periods 2 and 3

begin on the average dates of regime switches, 1993:3 and 1999:2.

Consistency in time periods has the cost of less precise dating

of individual regime changes.

     C Finally, I allow inflation targeting to have different

short-run and long-run effects. This could occur if it takes time

for expectations to adjust to a new regime. In equation (3), I

add a third dummy variable that equals one if a country is an

                                15
inflation targeter in both t-1 and t. In this specification, the

coefficient on I is the immediate effect of adopting IT, and the

sum of coefficients on I and the new dummy is the effect in the

second period of targeting.

    Appendix 2 gives the results of these robustness checks. To

summarize, the weak effects in Table 2 generally stay the same or

become even weaker. In some cases, the effect of IT on average

inflation becomes insignificant.

Future Research: Policy Regimes and the Financial Crisis

    It is not surprising that effects of regime changes are hard

to detect for the period from 1985 to 2007. During this period –-

the Great Moderation –- central banks in advanced economies faced

few adverse shocks. As a result, they found it relatively easy to

stabilize output and inflation with or without IT or the euro. An

important topic for future work is the performance of policy

regimes during the world financial crisis that ended the Great

Moderation period.

    A starting point for future work is the different behavior

of the Federal Reserve and other central banks. The Fed started

reducing interest rates in September 2007, after interbank

lending markets froze temporarily. In contrast, the ECB and most

                               16
IT central banks kept rates steady until October 2008, after the

failure of Lehman Brothers caused panic in financial markets.

Inflation targeters that kept rates steady include the U.K.,

whose financial system experienced problems over 2007-08 that

were arguably just as bad or worse than those in the U.S. An open

question is whether the Fed’s discretionary policy regime was

part of the reason for its quick reaction to the financial

crisis.



III. PREVIOUS WORK ON INFLATION TARGETING

    A large literature estimates the effects of inflation

targeting, with varying results. Much of the variation is

explained by which countries are examined. Inflation targeting

has spread from advanced economies to emerging economies, such as

Brazil, South Africa, and the Czech Republic. Table 3 lists

emerging-economy inflation targeters. Most work on advanced

economies, although not all, confirms the findings of Section II:

the effects of IT are weak. In contrast, papers that examine

emerging economies report significant benefits of IT. Most

researchers find that IT reduces average inflation in emerging

economies, and some also find effects on output and inflation

                               17
stability. Surveying the literature, Walsh (2009) concludes that

IT does not matter for advanced economies but does matter for

emerging economies.

       This conclusion makes sense, as pointed out by Goncalvez and

Salles (2008). Central banks in advanced economies are likely to

have higher levels of credibility and expertise than those in

emerging economies, and to face smaller shocks. These advantages

may allow policymakers to stabilize the economy without an

explicit nominal anchor, while emerging economies need the

discipline of IT.

       Here, I critically review past research on inflation

targeting. In choosing papers to examine, I have sought to

identify the most influential work in an objective way. To that

end, I searched Google Scholar in January 2010 for all papers

dated 2000 or later with “Inflation Targeting” or “Inflation

Targeter” in the title. Of those papers, I chose all that

satisfied two criteria: they contain empirical work comparing

countries with and without inflation targets, and they had at

least 20 citations. I ended up with 14 papers.3


       3
         I include two papers with fewer than 20 citations: Lin and Ye (2009) and Gurkaynak
(2008). These papers are helpful for interpreting other papers by the same authors with more

                                              18
       These papers address three broad topics: the effects of IT

on the means and variances of output and inflation; effects on

the persistence of shocks to inflation; and effects on inflation

expectations. Here I give an overview of this work; Appendix 3

provides further details. Unfortunately, a variety of problems

casts doubt on the conclusions of most studies.

Means and Variances

       Many papers ask how IT affects the first two moments of

inflation and output. As discussed earlier, it is tricky to

answer this question because IT adoption is endogenous. Studies

can be categorized by how they address this endogeneity problem.

       Differences-in-differences: Some early papers measure the

effects of IT with a pure differences-in-differences approach:

they estimate equation (1) or do something similar.                              This work

includes Cecchetti and Ehrman (2000), Hu (2003), and Neuman and

von Hagan (2002). These papers generally find that IT reduces the

mean and variance of inflation; they report mixed results about

the variance of output.



than 20 cites. I leave out one paper with more than 20 cites, Corbo et al. (2002). This paper
appears to be superceded by Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007), which has a common
coauthor and the same title.

                                                19
    These papers were natural first steps in studying the

effects of IT. However, subsequent work has established that

estimates of equation (1) are biased because initial conditions

affect IT adoption. Studies that ignore this problem do not

produce credible results.

    Controlling for Initial Conditions: As described above, Ball

and Sheridan (2005) address the endogeneity problem by estimating

equation (2), a diffs-in-diffs equation that controls for the

initial level of performance. They examine advanced economies

and, like the empirical work above, find no effects of IT except

a weak one on average inflation (a decrease of 0.6 percentage

points with a t-statistic of 1.6).

    Goncalvez and Salles estimate equation (2) for a sample of

36 emerging economies and find substantial effects of IT.

Switching to this policy reduces average inflation by 2.5

percentage points. It also reduces the standard deviation of

annual output growth by 1.4 percentage points. For the average IT

adopter, the standard deviation of output growth under IT is 2.2

percentage points; Goncalvez and Salles’s results imply that this

number would be 3.6 points without IT. The combination of these

results and Ball and Sheridan’s support the view that IT has

                               20
stronger effects in emerging economies than in advanced

economies.

    Goncalvez and Salles’s results are important, but they raise

questions of interpretation and robustness. Five of the non-IT

countries in the study, including Argentina and Bulgaria, have

hard currency pegs during parts of the sample period. As

discussed in Section VI, hard pegs can increase output

volatility. It is not clear how Goncalvez and Salles’s results

would change if the non-IT group included only countries with

flexible policy regimes.

    One can also question Goncalvez and Salles’s dating of

regime changes and their treatment of years with very high

inflation. These issues are discussed in Appendix 3. More work is

needed to test the validity of Goncalvez and Salles’s

conclusions.

    Instrumental Variables If inflation targeting is endogenous,

it might seem natural to estimate its effects by instrumental

variables. Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007) take this approach

with quarterly data for 21 advanced and 13 emerging economies. In

the equation they estimate, inflation depends on lagged inflation

and a dummy variable for IT. Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel find no

                               21
significant effect of IT for advanced economies, but a big effect

for emerging economies: in the long run, IT reduces inflation by

7.5 percentage points. This estimate is three times the effect

found by Goncalvez and Salles.

    Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel’s results are not credible,

however, because of the instrument they use for the IT dummy:

the lagged IT dummy. Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel motivate their

use of IV by arguing that the IT dummy is influenced by variables

that also affect inflation directly, such as central bank

independence and the fiscal surplus –- variables captured by the

error term in their equation. If these variables affect the IT

dummy, then they also affect the lagged IT dummy. For example,

the features of New Zealand that help explain why it targeted

inflation in the first quarter of 2000 also help explain why it

targeted inflation in the last quarter of 1999. Mishkin and

Schmidt-Hebbel’s instrument is correlated with the error in their

equation, making it invalid.

    Propensity Score Matching: A final approach to the

endogeneity problem is propensity score matching. This method is

relatively complex, but the idea is to compare the performance of

IT and non-IT countries that are similar along other dimensions.

                                 22
     Two papers by Lin and Ye (2007, 2009) take this approach.

Consistent with other work, they find that IT matters in emerging

economies but not advanced economies. For emerging economies,

they find that IT reduces average inflation by 3%, not far from

Goncalvez and Salles’s estimate. They also find that IT reduces

inflation volatility.

     Vega and Winkelreid (2005) also use propensity score

matching. They find that IT reduces the level and volatility of

inflation in both advanced and emerging economies. In my view,

there are several reasons to doubt the results for advanced

economies. The issues are somewhat arcane, so I leave them for

Appendix 3.4

Inflation Persistence

     Advocates of inflation targeting, such as Bernanke et al

(1999), argue that this policy reduces inflation persistence:

shocks to inflation die out more quickly.   The Ball-Sheridan and

Mishkin-Schmidt-Hebbel papers introduced above both test for such

an effect. For advanced economies, Ball and Sheridan find that IT



     4
       Duecker and Fischer (2006) match inflation targeters with
similar non-targeters informally. Like Lin and Ye, they find no
effects of IT in advanced economies.

                               23
has no effect on persistence in the univariate inflation process.

For emerging economies, Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel find that IT

reduces the persistence of inflation movements resulting from

oil-price and exchange-rate shocks. These results support the

distinction between advanced and emerging economies that runs

through the IT literature.

    Probably the best-known work on IT and inflation persistence

is Levin et al. (2004). This paper is unusual in reporting strong

effects of IT in advanced economies. Levin et al. estimate

quarterly AR processes for inflation and “core inflation” and

compute persistence measures such as the largest autoregressive

root. For the period 1994-2003, Levin et al. conclude that

persistence is “markedly lower” in five IT countries than in

seven non-IT countries.

    Once again, there are reasons to doubt the conclusion that

IT matters.   One is that the IT countries in the sample are

smaller and more open economies than the non-IT countries. This

difference, rather than the choice of policy regime, could

explain different inflation behavior in the two groups. Appendix

3 discusses this point and related questions about Levin et al.’s

results.

                                24
Inflation Expectations

    Four papers present evidence that IT affects either short

run or long run inflation expectations.

    Short Run Expectations: Johnson (2002) examines eleven

advanced economies that reduced inflation in the early 1990s.    He

compares countries that did and did not adopt inflation targets

near the start of disinflation.    Johnson measures expected

inflation with the one-year-ahead forecast from Consensus

Forecasts, and finds that this variable fell more quickly for

inflation targeters than for non-targeters.

    There are no obvious flaws in Johnson’s analysis, but it

raises a puzzle.   As Johnson points out, a standard Phillips

curve implies that a faster fall in expected inflation should

allow targeters to achieve greater disinflation for a given path

of output. In other words, the sacrifice ratio should fall.     Yet

other work finds that IT does not affect the sacrifice ratio, at

least in advanced economies (e.g. Bernanke et al. 1999).

    Long Run Expectations Proponents of IT argue that this

regime anchors long run inflation expectations (e.g. Bernanke et

al; King, 2005). Once IT is established, expectations remain at

the target even if actual inflation deviates from it temporarily.

                                  25
This effect makes it easier for policymakers to stabilize the

economy.

    Three papers present evidence for this effect. The first is

the Levin et al. paper introduced above. In addition to measuring

persistence in actual inflation, the paper examines professional

forecasters’ expectations of inflation from three to ten years in

the future. For each country in their sample, the authors

estimate an effect of past inflation on expected inflation.    The

estimates are close to zero for inflation targeters but

significant for non-targeters.

    Levin et al.’s regressions appear to uncover some difference

between targeters and non-targeters. Yet the specification and

results are odd. Levin et al. regress the change in expected

inflation from year t-1 to year t on the difference in actual

inflation between t and t-3 (although they do not write their

equation this way). One would expect the change in expectations

to depend more strongly on the current inflation change than the

three-year change. Yet Levin et al. find large effects of the

three-year change in non-IT countries (again, see Appendix 3 for

details).

    The other two papers on long-term expectations are Gurkaynak

                                 26
et al. (2006) and Gurkaynak et al. (2008). These papers estimate

the effects of news, including announcements of economic

statistics and policy interest rates, on expected inflation. They

measure expectations with daily data on interest rates for

nominal and indexed government bonds. Together, the two papers

find that news has significant effects on expectations in the

United States, a non-inflation-targeter, but not in three

targeters, Sweden, Canada, and Chile. For the U.K., a targeter,

they find effects before 1997, when the Bank of England became

independent, but not after.   Gurkaynek et al. (2006) conclude

that “a well-known and credible inflation target” helps anchor

expectations.

    These papers are among the more persuasive in the IT

literature. The worst I can say is that they examine only one

non-IT country, the United States, where bond markets may differ

from those of smaller countries in ways unrelated to inflation

targeting. Also, part of the U.S. data come from the first few

years after indexed bonds were created, when the market for these

bonds was thin. For those years, yield spreads may not be

accurate measures of expectations. Future research should extend

the Gurkaynak analysis to later time periods and more countries.

                                27
Summary

       Many papers find beneficial effects of IT in emerging

economies, but the evidence is not yet conclusive. For advanced

economies, most evidence is negative. However, IT may affect

long-term inflation expectations in bond markets.



IV. THE EURO

       How has the euro affected the countries that joined?                              We saw

earlier that, for the Great Moderation period, euro adoption had

no detectable effects on the level or volatility of output

growth, inflation, or interest rates (Table 2). Starting in 2008,

the euro area experienced a deep recession along with the rest of

the world. It is not obvious that currency union was either

beneficial or harmful during this episode.

       Yet the euro has not been irrelevant. Some of the effects

predicted when the currency was created have started to appear.

Here I review evidence for two widely-discussed effects: greater

economic integration, and costs of a “one size fits all” monetary

policy.5


       5
         As this chapter neared completion in early 2010, a crisis in Greece spurred controversy
about the euro. Greece found itself in the position of countries with hard pegs, which cannot use

                                               28
Economic Integration

       Euro proponents argue that a common currency promotes trade

and capital flows within the euro area. These effects follow from

lower transaction costs, more transparent price comparisons, and

the elimination of any risk of speculative attacks. Greater

integration should increase competition and the efficiency of

resource allocation, raising economic growth (see, e.g.,

Papademos [2009]).

       Trade: Previous Research A large literature estimates the

deteminants of trade with “gravity equations,” in which trade

between two countries depends on their size, distance from each

other, income, and so on –- and whether the countries use a

common currency.           Using this approach, Rose (2000) famously

estimated that a currency union increases trade among its members

by 200%.       This finding was based on data for small currency

unions that predate the euro; some used it to predict the effects

of euro adoption.

       In recent years, researchers have had enough data to



exchange rates as shock absorbers when capital flight occurs (see Section VI). The ultimate
effects on Greece and other euro countries are unclear, but they will likely influence future
assessments of the costs and benefits of currency unions.

                                                29
estimate the actual effects of the euro.   They report effects

that are much smaller than those found by Rose, but non-

negligible.   A survey by Baldwin (2006) concludes that the euro

has raised trade among members by 5-10%.   A survey by Frankel

(2010) says 10-15%.

    One might think the effects of a currency union grow over

time as trade patterns adjust to the new regime.   But Frankel

finds that the effects stop growing after five years or so, based

on data for both the euro and other currency unions.

    Trade: New Evidence I supplement previous research with some

simple new evidence. If a common currency promotes trade within

the euro area, this trade should increase relative to trade

between euro countries and other parts of the world.   Figure 1

looks for this effect in the DOTS data on bilateral trade from

the IMF.

    In the Figure, trade within the euro area is measured by all

exports from one euro country to another, as a percent of euro

area GDP.   Trade with another group of countries is measured by

exports from the euro area to the other countries plus imports

from the other countries, again as a percent of euro area GDP.

All variables are normalized to 100 in 1998, the year before the

                                30
euro was created.

    In Figure 1, one group of non-euro countries has just one

member, the United Kingdom.   The U.K. is the European Union’s

most prominent non-adopter of the euro.    Another group of

countries includes 11 advanced economies, specifically non-euro

countries that were members of the OECD in 1985.   The final group

is all 183 non-euro countries in the DOTS data set.

    The Figure suggests that the euro has boosted trade among

euro countries.   Trade with other regions rose more rapidly than

intra-euro trade from 1993 through 1998.    But starting in 1999,

the first year of the common currency, intra-euro trade rose

relative to trade with the U.K. and other advanced economies.

This divergence accelerated after 2002. In 2008, intra-euro trade

was almost 40% higher than it was in 1998. In contrast, euro-OECD

trade rose less than 10% from 1998 to 2008, and euro-UK trade was

almost unchanged.

    These results suggest a larger impact of the euro on trade

than the 5-15% reported in previous work.   They also suggest,

contrary to Frankel, that the effects of the euro were still

growing ten years after the currency was created. A caveat is

that my analysis does not control for time-varying determinants

                                31
of trade patterns, such as income levels and exchange-rate

volatility.

    Notice that trade among euro countries has not risen more

than trade with all DOTS countries. From 1998 to 2008, the

changes in intra-euro trade and in trade with the rest of the

world are almost identical. This fact reflects rising trade with

emerging economies such as India and China, which have become

larger parts of the world economy. One way to interpret the

euro’s influence is that it has helped intra-euro trade keep pace

with trade between Europe and emerging markets.

    Capital Markets: Lane (2009) surveys the effects of the euro

on capital market integration and finds they are large. He

discusses three types of evidence. The first are estimates of the

euro’s effects on cross-border asset holdings, which are based on

gravity equations like those in the trade literature. Papers such

as Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007, 2008) find that the euro has

roughly doubled cross-border holdings of bonds within the

currency union. It has increased cross-border holdings of equity

by two thirds. Other studies find smaller but significant effects

on foreign direct investment and cross-border bank loans.

    The second type of evidence is convergence of interest

                               32
rates. Money market rates have been almost identical in different

euro countries, except at the height of the financial crisis.

Cross-country dispersion in long-term interest rates has also

fallen, and the remaining differences can be explained by risk

and liquidity.6

       Finally, Lane presents scattered but intriguing evidence

that the integration of capital markets has contributed to

overall financial development. A striking fact is that the

quantity of bonds issued by euro-area corporations tripled

between 1998 and 2007. Papaioannou and Portes (2008) find that

joining the euro increases a country’s bank lending by 17% in the

long run. Using industry data, Dvorak finds that the euro has

increased physical investment, especially in countries with less-

developed financial systems.

Does One Size Fit All?

       When a country adopts the euro, it gives up independent

monetary policy.          It can no longer adjust interest rates to

offset country-specific shocks.                 Critics of monetary union (e.g.


       6
         Since Lane (2009) surveyed the evidence for interest-rate convergence, rates on
government bonds have diverged as a result of the Greek debt crisis of 2009-2010. However, this
development may be explained by default risk rather than decreased integration of capital
markets. The long-term effects of the Greek crisis on capital markets remain to be seen.

                                              33
Feldstein, 2009) suggest that the reduced scope for policy leads

to greater output volatility.

    As discussed by Blanchard (2006, 2007), this problem may be

exacerbated by the behavior of national price levels.   When a

country experiences an economic boom, its inflation rate is

likely to exceed the euro average. Higher prices make the economy

less competitive; in effect, it experiences a real appreciation

of its currency.   The loss of competitiveness eventually reduces

output.

    In this scenario, the return to long-run equilibrium is a

painful process. To reverse the divergence of price levels, an

economy that has experienced high inflation needs to push

inflation below the euro average temporarily. This disinflation

may require a deep recession. Based on this reasoning, Blanchard

predicts “long rotating slumps” as national price levels diverge

and are brought back in line. He calls the euro a “suboptimal

currency area.”

    Evidence on Output Fluctuations Is there evidence of these

effects?   Blanchard suggests that real appreciation has

contributed to recessions in Portugal and Italy. Yet the evidence

in Section II of this chapter suggests that, overall, the euro

                                34
has not increased output volatility.

    We can examine this issue another way. Currency union means

that monetary policy cannot be tailored to the circumstances of

individual countries.   In a given year, some countries will

experience booms and recessions that could be smoothed out if the

countries had separate monetary policies.   If this phenomenon is

important, currency union should create greater dispersion in

output growth across countries.

    There is no evidence of this effect. Figure 2 shows the

standard deviation of output growth across 11 euro members (all

countries that adopted the currency by 2000 except Luxembourg).

If there is any trend in this series since 1998, it is down

rather than up.

    Evidence on Price Levels On the other hand, there may be

reason to worry about larger output fluctuations in the future.

The euro era has seen a significant divergence in price levels

across countries, causing changes in competitiveness that may

destabilize output.

    The dispersion in inflation rates across euro countries has

fallen sharply since monetary union.   In recent years, this

dispersion has been comparable to inflation dispersion across

                                  35
regions in the United States –- where economists do not worry

about rotating slumps caused by a common currency.   Mongelli and

Wyploz (2009) call this phenomenon “price convergence.”

    However, as Lane (2006) points out, the serial correlation

of relative inflation rates is higher in European countries than

in U.S. regions. A possible explanation is that inflation

expectations depend on past inflation at the national level, even

in a currency union. In any event, higher serial correlation

means that inflation differences cumulate to larger price-level

differences in Europe than in the U.S.

    Figures 3 and 4 illustrate this point.   Figure 3 compares

the 11 major euro economies to 27 metropolitan areas in the U.S.

The Figure shows the standard deviation of inflation rates across

countries or metro areas and the standard deviation of price

levels.   All price levels are normalized to 100 in 1998, so the

standard deviation of price levels is zero in that year. The

Figure confirms that inflation differences within Europe have

fallen to U.S. levels.   At the same time, price levels are

diverging at a faster rate in Europe.

    Figure 4 compares four broad regions of the United States

to the four largest euro economies. Here, price level dispersion

                                36
in 2008 is more than three times as large in Europe as in the

U.S.

       Europe’s price-level dispersion may partly reflect changes

in equilibrium real exchange rates.   However, much of the

dispersion is likely due to demand-driven inflation differences.

For the period 1999-2004, Lane reports a correlation of 0.62

between the cumulative change in a country’s price level and

cumulative output growth. Both of these variables are highest in

Ireland and lowest in Germany. Lane interprets the correlation

between price and output changes as a “medium run Phillips

curve.”

       As of 2008, the spreading out of European price levels was

continuing.   This fact suggests that countries are building up

real exchange rate misalignments that must eventually be

reversed. This process could involve the rotating slumps that

Blanchard predicts.



V. THE ROLE OF MONETARY AGGREGATES

       A generation ago, any discussion of monetary regimes would

emphasize targeting of a monetary aggregate.   Versions of this

policy, advocated by Milton Friedman in the 1960s, were practiced

                                 37
by the U.S. during the “monetarist experiment” of 1979-82 and by

Germany and Switzerland during the 1980s and 90s.   Today,

however, most central banks in advanced and emerging economies

pay little attention to monetary aggregates.   They believe that

instability in money demand makes the aggregates uninformative

about economic activity and inflation. Policymakers rarely

mention the behavior of money in explaining their interest-rate

decisions (see Bernanke, 2008).

    The major exception is the European Central Bank, which says

that monetary aggregates play a significant role in its

policymaking.   Here I ask how the ECB’s attention to money has

affected policy decisions and economic outcomes.    The answer is

anti-climactic: the ECB’s attention to money does not matter.

While policymakers discuss monetary aggregates extensively, these

variables have rarely if ever influenced their choices of

interest rates.

The Two Pillars

    The primary goal of the ECB is price stability, defined as

inflation “below but close to 2%” (ECB, 2010).   The Governing

Council adjusts short-term interest rates to achieve this goal.

The ECB says that “two pillars” underlie its choices of rates.

                                  38
One is “economic analysis,” in which the ECB forecasts inflation

based on real activity and supply shocks.   This process is

similar to inflation forecasting at inflation-targeting central

banks.    The second pillar is “monetary analysis,” in which

policymakers examine measures of money and credit.   The primary

focus is the growth rate of the M3 aggregate (roughly equivalent

to M2 in the U.S.). The ECB compares M3 growth to a “reference

value” of 4.5%.   Policymakers say this comparison influences

their choices of interest rates; everything else equal, higher M3

growth may lead to tighter policy.

    The ECB argues that its monetary analysis helps it achieve

price stability because money growth is a signal of inflation at

medium to long horizons.   Many outsiders criticize the ECB’s

logic and argue that it should switch to pure inflation

targeting.   The ECB volume edited by Beyer and Reichlen (2008)

presents both sides of this debate (see the explanations of ECB

policy by Trichet and Issing and the critiques by Woodford and

Uhlig).

    I examine the roles of the ECB’s two pillars over its

history.   I find that economic analysis and monetary analysis

usually produce the same prescriptions for policy.   On the rare

                                 39
occasions when the two analyses conflict, economic analysis

appears to determine policy.   Therefore, the ECB’s policy

decisions have always been close to those it would have made if

economic analysis were its only pillar.

Collinearity

    I base my conclusions largely on editorials in the ECB

Monthly Bulletin, which explain the interest-rate decisions of

the Governing Council.    A typical editorial summarizes the ECB’s

current economic analysis and what it suggests for the direction

of policy.   The editorial then “cross-checks” this prescription

with monetary analysis.    Usually the monetary analysis confirms

the economic analysis.

    As an example, consider the Monthly Bulletin of July 2008,

which explains a decision to raise interest rates by a quarter

point.   The summary of the ECB’s economic analysis concludes that

“risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium horizon

remain clearly on the upside.”   This judgment reflects current

inflation above the 2% limit and fears about rising food and

energy prices. The economic analysis implies that a policy

tightening is warranted.

    The editorial goes on to say that “the monetary analysis

                                 40
confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at

medium-to-longer-term horizons.”      It notes that annual M3 growth

exceeds 10%. This number “overstates the underlying path of

monetary expansion, owing to the impact of the flat yield curve

and other temporary factors.”   Nonetheless, the monetary analysis

“confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth

remains strong.”    The monetary analysis points to the same need

for tightening as the economic analysis.

    ECB economists acknowledge that situations like July 2008

are typical.   At most policy meetings, the economic and monetary

analyses point to the same action. Fischer et al (2008) is

perhaps the ECB’s most detailed review of the role of money in

its policymaking.   That paper concludes “there is a high degree

of collinearity between the communication regarding the monetary

and economic analyses.”   This collinearity makes the role of

money “difficult to assess.”

Exceptions to Collinearity

    The ECB’s economic and monetary analyses do not always point

in the same direction.    Fischer et al and Trichet (2008) cite two

episodes in which the two pillars produced conflicting signals.

In my reading of the record, in one case policy followed the

                                 41
prescription of the economic analysis; in the other, the two

signals did not really differ by much.   Since Fischer et al and

Trichet wrote, there has been one clear case of conflicting

signals, and again the economic analysis prevailed.

    2001-2003: This period is one of the episodes identified by

Fischer et al. and Trichet. It was a period of low output growth

when the ECB eased policy. Fischer et al report:

Between mid-2001 and mid-2003, the monetary analysis... pointed
to relatively balanced risks to price stability, whereas the
economic analysis saw risks on the downside. Overall, the
successive cuts of interest rates of this period suggest that the
economic analysis played the decisive role in explaining monetary
policy decisions.

Fischer et al explain why policymakers disregarded their monetary

analysis. In 2001-03, M3 was growing rapidly, but this reflected

unusual temporary factors.   Savers were shifting to safe assets

in the wake of the global stock market decline and the September

11 terrorist attacks.   This shift did not necessarily indicate

inflationary pressures.

    Trichet (2008) interprets this episode differently than

Fischer et al.   He says “the underlying monetary expansion was

rather sustained” and “monetary analysis had a particularly

decisive influence” on policy.   In Trichet’s view, rapid money


                                 42
growth prevented the ECB from lowering interest rates more than

it did.   Yet the ECB eased aggressively: from May 2001 through

June 2003, it cut its interest-rate target seven times, taking it

from 4.75% to 2.0%. The June 2003 target was the lowest in the

ECB’s first decade. We do not know what would have happened over

2001-2003 if money growth were lower.    It seems dubious, however,

that the young ECB, eager to establish its credibility as an

inflation fighter, would have pushed interest rates much below

2%.

      December 2005: In this month the ECB raised its interest-

rate target from 2% to 2.25%; this increase was the first in a

series that reversed the easing of 2001-03. Both Fischer et al.

and Trichet say the ECB’s monetary and economic analyses gave

different signals in December 2005. They agree that monetary

analysis was decisive in this episode.

      Trichet gives this account:

In December 2005, when we first increased policy rates, many
commentators judged our move as premature against the background
of a seemingly fragile economic recovery. In fact, at that time
the signals coming from the economic analysis were not yet so
clear and strong. But the continued strong expansion of money
and credit through the course of 2005 gave an intensifying
indication of increasing risks to medium term price stability
which played a decisive role in our decision to start increasing
policy rates in late 2005.... Without our thorough monetary

                                43
analysis, we probably would have been in danger of falling behind
the curve...

Fischer et al. contrast the “degree of uncertainty” in the

economic analysis to the “stark signal” provided by monetary

analysis.

    In my reading, the real-time policy record does not support

this interpretation.   It suggests a typical case of collinearity

rather than a decisive role for money.    In the Monthly Bulletin

of December 2005, the editorial says the decision to raise rates

reflected “risks to price stability identified in the economic

analysis and confirmed by cross-checking with the monetary

analysis.”   After that, the editorial devotes six paragraphs to

summarizing the economic analysis, concluding that “the main

scenario for price stability emerging from the economic analysis

remains subject to upside risks.”     Then a single paragraph makes

the point that “evidence pointing to increased upside risks to

price stability over the medium to longer term comes from the

monetary analysis.”    The editorial concludes by repeating that

the economic analysis was “confirmed by cross-checking” with the

monetary analysis.

    Fall 2008 Like many central banks, the ECB lowered interest


                                 44
rates rapidly during the financial crisis following the failure

of Lehman Brothers. At least in the early stages, this easing was

motivated entirely by economic analysis.   Monetary analysis did

not support an easing, but it was disregarded.

    The ECB first cut rates by half a percent on October 8, in

between policy meetings.   The press release explaining this

action includes only economic analysis.    It discusses the

influence of falling output growth and other non-monetary factors

on inflation.   The 12-month growth rate of M3 was 8.8%% for

August (the last month for which data were available on October

8). M3 growth far exceeded the reference value of 4.5%, but the

press release ignores this fact.

    At its November meeting, the Governing Council cut rates by

another half percent.   In the Monthly Bulletin, this decision is

explained by economic analysis: as the world economy slumped, “a

number of downside risks to economic activity have materialized.”

The monetary analysis does not support a cut in interest rates.

To the contrary, “taking the appropriate medium-term perspective,

monetary data up to September confirm that upside risks to price

stability are diminishing but that they have not disappeared

completely.”    The 12-month growth rate of M3 was 8.6% for

                                 45
September. If policymakers put a significant weight on monetary

analysis, it is unlikely they would have cut interest rates as

sharply as they did.



VI. HARD CURRENCY PEGS

    The final monetary regime that I examine is a hard peg to a

foreign currency.   Under this policy, as in a currency union, a

country gives up independent monetary policy.   There are two

basic versions of a hard peg: dollarization and a currency board.

In the first, a country abolishes its national currency and uses

a foreign one.   In the second, the country maintains its currency

but seeks a permanently fixed exchange rate against a foreign

currency.   It pledges not to change the exchange rate, and it

maintains enough foreign-currency reserves to prevent a

speculative attack from forcing devaluation.

    Nine economies have adopted hard pegs since 1980 (eight

independent countries plus Hong Kong). Table 4 lists these

economies and when they began their pegs. The European countries

on the list pegged to the Deutschmark and switched to the euro

when it was created; the other countries pegged to the U.S.

dollar. The pegs are still in effect everywhere but Argentina,

                                46
which created a currency board in 1991 and ended it in 2002.7

       The Argentina example shows that a hard peg is not

guaranteed to last forever. Even if a country has enough reserves

to maintain the peg, doing so may be costly enough that political

leaders choose to change course. Argentina’s case also suggests,

however, that extreme circumstances are needed to break a hard

peg. Argentina ended its currency board only after economic

distress produced riots and three changes of governments in two

months. As we will see, other countries have maintained their

pegs despite huge recessions.

Why Hard Pegs?

       Countries have adopted hard pegs for two different reasons,

to reduce inflation and to increase integration with other

economies.

       Inflation Control: In seven of the countries in Table 4 (all

cases except Hong Kong and El Salvador), the peg was adopted


       7
        In categorizing countries as hard peggers, I generally follow the IMF (2008). The only
exception is Latvia, which the IMF counts as a “conventional fixed peg” – a softer policy than a
currency board. I count Latvia as a currency board because its central bank’s web site says,
“The exchange rate policy of the Bank of Latvia is similar to that of a currency board, and the
monetary base is backed by gold and foreign currency reserves.”
         A number of countries have hard pegs that predate 1980. Most are tiny (e.g. San
Marino and the Marshall Islands). The largest is Panama, which has used the U.S. dollar since
1903, when it ceded the Canal Zone to the United States.

                                               47
during a period of high inflation –- annual rates of three digits

or more. Policymakers sought to end inflation by tying their

currency to that of a low-inflation country, or by abolishing it.

    This approach to stopping inflation has always been

successful. As an example, Figure 5 shows what happened in

Bulgaria. The inflation rate was over 1000% when the country

introduced a currency board in 1997; a year later, inflation was

5%. In six of the high-inflation countries that adopted hard

pegs, inflation fell below 20% within three years; in the seventh

country, Estonia, it took five years. Once inflation was below

20%, it stayed there permanently, except in Argentina when its

currency board collapsed.

    On the other hand, a hard peg is far from essential for

stopping inflation. Many countries, including most in Latin

America and Eastern Europe, experienced high inflation in the

1980s or 1990s. Almost all have eliminated this problem (in 2008,

Zimbabwe was the only country with inflation over 100%.)

Countries stopped inflation with policies less drastic than a

hard peg, such as a temporary peg or a monetary tightening under

flexible exchange rates.

     Therefore, the argument for a hard peg must be political

                               48
rather than economic. Arguably, if some countries are left with

any discretion, they will not manage to reduce inflation.   A

conventional stabilization program will encounter opposition, and

policymakers will be replaced or forced to change course. A hard

peg is needed to prevent backsliding in countries with histories

of failed stabilizations, such as Argentina. (For more on this

point, see De la Torre et al. [2003], who compare Argentina’s

currency board to Hernan Cortes’s decision to burn his ships.)

    Economic Integration: Hong Kong and El Salvador had moderate

inflation rates when they adopted hard pegs (about 10% in Hong

Kong and 3% in El Salvador). Their motivation was to eliminate

exchange-rate fluctuations and increase integration with foreign

economies. Each economy had special reasons to value exchange-

rate stability. Hong Kong has an unusually high level of foreign

trade: imports and exports both exceed 100% of GDP. El Salvador

dollarized because it has high levels of trade with the United

States and Panama, which uses the dollar. In addition, prices are

often quoted in dollars in trade throughout Central America.

    While Hong Kong and El Salvador adopted hard pegs for

sensible reasons, it is difficult to isolate the effects on

economic integration. To my knowledge, no research has tried to

                               49
quantify the effects of the two countries’ pegs on trade or

capital flows.

The Costs of Capital Flight

    The primary disadvantage of a hard peg, like membership in a

currency union, is the inability to adjust monetary policy in

response to shocks. In the experience of hard peggers, one type

of shock has proved most problematic: capital flight. Countries

with hard pegs are emerging economies, which often experience

capital inflows followed by sudden stops. In many emerging

economies, the exchange rate serves as a “shock absorber”:

depreciation reduces the output losses following capital flight.

Lacking this shock absorber, hard peggers experience deeper

slumps.

    The crisis of the Argentine currency board is a classic

example. Capital flight started in the late 1990s as a result of

rising government debt and real appreciation; the latter occurred

because Argentine inflation exceeded U.S. inflation over the 90s

(see Hausmann and Velasco, 2002). The result was a severe

recession: cumulative output growth from 1999 through 2002 was -

29.5%, and the unemployment rate rose to 20%. As mentioned

before, the recession created enough political turmoil to break

                               50
the hard peg.

    In that case, capital flight was specific to one country. At

other times, capital flight has hit a region of the world. Within

the region, some countries had hard pegs and others did not. As a

result, we have episodes that approach natural experiments: we

can compare output losses in peggers and neighboring non-peggers

hit by similar shocks.

    I examine three episodes: the “Tequila crisis” that followed

Mexico’s debt default in 1994; the East Asian financial crisis of

1997-98; and the world financial crisis that began in 2008. In

the last case, I focus on emerging markets in Central and Eastern

Europe, where capital flight was most severe. For each of the

three crises, I examine countries’ output changes in the worst

year of the crisis and the following year.

    Table 5 presents the results. For the Tequila crisis, I

examine the six largest countries in Latin America. This group

includes one pegger, Argentina, which was in the middle of its

currency-board period. The hardest hit economy was Mexico, as one

would expect since the crisis started in Mexico. It is noteworthy

that the second-worst performer was Argentina. It was the only

country besides Mexico to experience a year of negative growth.

                               51
    For the East Asian crisis, I examine the four “Asian

tigers.” The one hard pegger, Hong Kong, was hardest-hit: it was

the only country with negative growth over two years. One symptom

of Hong Kong’s deep slump was deflation: its price level fell 15%

from 1998 to 2004.

    Finally, I examine seven European economies in 2009-2010

(using IMF output forecasts from Fall 2009). These seven are the

formerly Communist countries that now belong to the European

Union. They received capital inflows before 2008, but perceptions

of increased risk caused sudden stops (IMF, 2009).

   Four of the seven countries are hard peggers. As shown in

Table 5, these four have the largest forecasted output losses.

For three of them, the Baltic countries, cumulative output growth

is less than -15%.

   In all three episodes of capital flight, the currencies of

the non-pegging countries in Table 5 depreciated. As in the

textbook story, the exchange rate served as a shock absorber.

Countries with rigid exchange rates suffered more.

Summary

    On balance, the economic performance of hard peggers has

been poor. They have reduced inflation, but so have countries

                               52
without hard pegs. And capital flight has caused deep recessions

in six of the nine peggers. The only ones to escape so far are

Ecuador, El Salvador, and Bosnia. These countries are in regions

where capital flight was relatively mild in 2008 (Latin America

and the former Yugoslavia).



VII. CONCLUSION

    This chapter has reviewed the experiences of economies with

alternative monetary regimes.   The introduction lists the main

findings. Perhaps the clearest lesson is the risk of severe

recessions under hard exchange-rate pegs, which is illustrated

vividly by the experiences of Argentina and the Baltic countries.

One topic that deserves more research is inflation targeting in

emerging economies. The current literature suggests benefits, but

it is not conclusive.

    Most of the evidence in this chapter comes from the Great-

Moderation era that ended in 2007. In the coming years,

researchers should examine how different monetary regimes handled

the world financial crisis. This episode may reveal features of

regimes that were not apparent when economies were more tranquil.



                                53
APPENDIX 1: ESTIMATING THE EFFECTS OF REGIME SHIFTS

     This Appendix outlines the econometric justification for the

empirical work in Section II. I first consider the two-period,

two-regime case studied by Ball and Sheridan. I show that OLS

applied to equation (1) produces biased estimates of the effects

of regime shifts, but equation (2) produces unbiased estimates. I

then discuss generalizations to three regimes and three periods.

The Underlying Model

     Assume that Xit, a measure of economic performance in

country i and period t, is determined by

     (A1) Xit = bI*it + "i + (t + <it ,   t=1,2 ,

where I*it is a dummy that equals one if country i targets

inflation in period t, and the other terms on the right side are

country, time, and country-time effects that are independent of

each other. These effects capture all determinants of inflation

besides IT. I* is zero for all countries in period 1. We are

interested in estimating the coefficient b, which gives the

effect of IT on performance.

     Taking the difference in equation (A1) for t=2 and t=1

yields

     (A2) )Xi = a + bIi + <i2 - <i1 ,

                                  54
where )Xi is Xi2-Xi1, a=(2-(1, and Ii=I*i2-I*i1. Ii is a dummy that

equals one if country i adopts IT in period 2. Equation (A2) is

the same as equation (1) in the text with ,i=<i2-<i1.

       I assume that Ii depends on the initial level of inflation,

Xi1:

       (A3) Ii = u + dXi1 + 0i ,

where 0i captures other determinants of the decision to adopt IT.

I assume this error is independent of the three errors in

equation (A1).8

A Biased Estimator of b

       As discussed in the text, it seems natural to estimate

equation (1) by OLS. However, under my assumptions, the error

term ,i equals <i2-<i1. Substituting (A1) into (A3) shows that Ii

depends on <i1. Since both ,i and Ii depend on <i1, they are

correlated. This implies that OLS estimation of (1) produces a

biased estimate of b.

An Unbiased Estimator of b

       Ball and Sheridan run the regression

       (A4)     )Xi = a + wIi + cXi1 + ,i .


       8
        Equation (A3) is a linear probability model. I conjecture, but have not proven, that the
unbiasedness of my estimator extends to the general case of Ii=h(Xi1,0i).

                                               55
Notice that the coefficient on Ii is labeled w. Let the OLS

estimate of w be wO. We do not pre-judge the relationship between

w and the structural parameter b in equation (1). However, we can

show that E[wO] = b, so the Ball-Sheridan equation produces an

unbiased estimate of the parameter of interest.

     To establish this result, we “partial out” the terms a and

cXi1 from the right side of (A4):

     (A5)    )Xi = wI’i + ,i ,

where I’i is the residual from regressing Ii on a constant and Xi.

Equation (A3) implies

     (A6) I’i = 0i + (u-uO) + (d-dO)Xi1 ,

where uO and dO are OLS estimates of the coefficients in (A3).

The OLS estimate of w in equation (A5) is identical to wO, the

estimate from equation (A4). We need to show that the expected

value of this estimate is b.

     This result follows from algebra that I sketch. The OLS

estimate of w in (A5) is defined as [E(I’i )()Xi)]/[E(I’i )2],

where sums are taken over i. If we use (A2) to substitute for

for )Xi and break the result into three terms, we get

      (A7)     wO = b[E(I’i Ii)/E(I’i )2]

                      + [E(I’i )(<i2-<i1)]/[E(I’i)2]

                                   56
                     + a[E(I’i)]/[E(I’i)2] .

In this expression, the third term is zero.

     To find the expectations of the first two terms, I first

take expectations conditional on I’i. The conditional expectation

of the second term is zero because I’i is uncorrelated with the

<’s. This follows from the facts that (1) I’i is determined by 0i

and the 0’s for all observations, which determine u-uO and d-dO;

and (2) the 0’s are uncorrelated with the <’s.

     Turning to the first term in (A7), note that E(I’i Ii) =

[E(I’i)2]+[E(I’i)(Ii-I’i)] = [E(I’i)2] (because the products of a

regression’s fitted values and residuals sum to zero).

Substituting this result into the first term in (A7) establishes

that this term equals b.

     Combining all these results, the expectation of wO

conditional on I’i is b. Trivially, taking expectations over I’i

establishes that the unconditional expectation, E[wO], is b.

Three Time Periods

     In this paper’s empirical work, the data cover three time

periods rather than two. Here I sketch the generalization of the

Ball-Sheridan analysis to this case. For now, I continue to

assume there are only two policy regimes, IT and non-IT.

                                 57
     The underlying model is again given by equation (A1), but

with t=1,2,3. Differencing this equation yields

     (A8) )Xit = at + bIit + <it - <it-1 ,   t=2, 3 ,

where at=(t-(t-1 and Iit=I*it-I*it-1. Iit equals one if country i

switches from traditional policy to IT in period t.

     This model assumes that the policy regime, as measured by

the dummy variable I*, affects the level of performance X. It

follows that changes in regime, measured by I, affect the change

in performance )X.    The level of I* does not matter for )X. In

particular, if a country does not switch regimes between periods

2 and 3, it does not matter whether the country has traditional

policy in both periods or IT in both period. As discussed in the

text, this restriction is not valid if the adoption of IT has

different short-run and long-run effects. Therefore, one of the

robustness checks in my empirical work relaxes the restriction. I

allow different short-run and long-run effects of IT by

introducing a dummy that equals one in period t if a country is a

targeter in both t and t-1.

     With three time periods, one can pool data on )Xi3 and )Xi3

to estimate b, the effect of IT. Once again, OLS estimates of

(A2) are biased but the bias can be eliminated by adding Xit-1 to

                                   58
the equation. One can show that the proper specification allows

both at, which captures international changes in performance, and

the coefficient on Xit-1 to differ across periods. The coefficient

on Xit-1 depends on the relative importance of permanent and

transitory shocks to X, which can change over time.

Three Regimes

     Finally, consider the case of three policy regimes-

–traditional, IT, and the euro–-as well as three periods. In this

case, the underlying model can be written as

    (A9) Xit = I*it + (c+d)E*it + "i + (t + <it ,      t=1,2 3,

where E*it=1 if country i uses the euro in period t, and once

again I*it=1 if the country is an inflation targeter. In this

specification, the parameter c gives the effect of IT relative to

a baseline of traditional policy, and d is the effect of the euro

relative to IT. The effect of the euro relative to traditional

policy is b+c.

     Differencing (A9) yields

   (A10) )Xit = at + c(I*it-I*it-1)+ (c+d)(E*it-E*it-1) + <it + <it-1

                = at + cIit + dEit + <it + <it-1 ,

where again at=(t-(t-1 and the second line follows from the

definitions of Iit and Eit in the text. Once again, I add Xit-1 to

                                     59
the equation to eliminate bias in the coefficient estimates, and

allow at and the coefficient on Xit-1 to vary with t. The result is

equation (3), the main specification in my empirical work.



APPENDIX 2: DETAILS OF EMPIRICAL WORK

     The empirical work in Section II is based on the countries

and sample periods in Table 1. In quarterly data, the dating of

IT adoption follows Ball and Sheridan. The period of traditional

policy ends in either the last quarter before IT or the quarter

before that; if IT is adopted in the middle of a quarter, the

quarter is not included in either the IT or pre-IT period.

     For all countries that adopted the euro, the euro period

begins in 1999:1 and the pre-euro period ends in 1998:4.

     I use annual data in studying output behavior. With annual

data, a year belongs to a regime period only if all four quarters

belong under the quarterly dating.

     The central empirical results are estimates of equation (3)

for different measures of economic performance. Table 2 gives key

coefficients; Table A1 gives the full regression results.

     Table A2 presents the robustness exercises discussed in the

text. Mostly, the qualitative results do not change. One result

                                60
worth noting comes from Panel D of the table, where I estimate

short-run and long-run effects of inflation targeting. The short-

run effect on average inflation is significantly negative, but

the long-run effect (the sum of coefficients on I and R) is

insignificant with a positive point estimate. These results

suggest that the benefit of IT relative to traditional policy

declines over time.

   (An odd result pops up in Panel B: a strong positive effect

of IT on the standard deviation of the interest rate. A possible

explanation is that only seven countries belong to the sample and

Japan is an outlier. Japan is a non-ITer with a large fall in

interest rate volatility due to the zero bound on rates.)



APPENDIX 3: DETAILS ON PREVIOUS RESEARCH

    Here I give further details about some of the IT studies

reviewed in Section III:

    Goncalvez and Salles: This paper’s results are plausible,

but more work is needed to establish robustness. As discussed in

the text, we would like to know how things change if countries

with hard pegs are excluded from the sample. Other issues

include:

                               61
     C Goncalvez and Salles do not say how they choose the non-IT

countries in their sample. It is not obvious which countries

should be categorized as emerging markets. Future work might use

some objective criterion, such as a range for income per capita.

     C There is one significant mistake in the data: Peru’s IT

adoption year is listed as 1994, while the correct year is 2003.

Goncalvez and Salles’s dating follows Fraga et al. (2003);

evidently there is a typo in that paper.

     C The dates of IT adoption range from 1991 to 2003 (when

Peru’s date is corrected). Thus the pre- and post-IT time periods

differ substantially across countries. Future research might

break the data into three periods, with splits in the early

1990s, when Israel and Chile adopted targets, and around 2000,

when other emerging economies adopted targets.

     C For each country, Goncalvez and Salles drop years with

inflation above 50%, while leaving all other years. It is not

clear how this truncation of the data affects the results.

Vega and Winkelreid

    This paper reports beneficial effects of IT in both advanced

and emerging economies. One reason to doubt this conclusion is

the contrary findings of Lin and Ye (2009). Another is a feature

                               62
of Vega and Winkelreid’s specification: while they allow

different effects of IT in advanced and emerging economies, they

assume the equation determining IT adoption is the same. One

might think the variables in this equation, such as the fiscal

balance, have different effects on monetary policy in the two

groups.

     In addition, the paper’s results raise several related

puzzles:

    C The paper finds that “soft” inflation targeting reduces the

mean and standard deviation of inflation by more than “fully-

fledged” targeting, even though the latter is a bigger shift from

traditional policy.

    C The ten advanced-economy inflation targeters have a total

of seven years of soft IT. Usually these countries move quickly

from traditional policy to fully-fledged targeting. Yet the paper

reports precise estimates of the effects of soft IT in advanced

economies. Many t-statistics are near 4.

    C For advanced economies, estimates of the effects of soft IT

on average inflation are around -3 percentage points. These

estimates imply that most countries with traditional policy would

have negative inflation rates if they adopted soft IT.

                               63
Levin et al.: Inflation Persistence

     This paper estimates univariate time series models for five

IT countries and seven non-IT countries, plus the non-IT euro

area. Levin et al. report that, on average, inflation persistence

is lower in the IT countries: shocks to inflation die out more

quickly.

     There are several related reasons to doubt the paper’s

conclusion:

   C The results are sensitive to the choice of an inflation

variable. The persistence of core inflation (inflation excluding

food and energy) is lower for IT countries than for non-IT

countries. The persistence of total inflation, however, is

similar for the two groups.

   C The IT countries in the sample--Australia, Canada, Sweden,

New Zealand, and the UK--are on average smaller and more open

than the non-IT countries. In some of the analysis, the non-IT

group is four economies--the U.S., Japan, the euro area, and

Denmark–-of which three are the world’s largest and most closed.

Openness is likely to affect the behavior of inflation; for

example, fluctuations in exchange rates should cause larger

inflation movements in more open economies. Differences in

                               64
openness rather than policy regimes could explain the different

inflation behavior in IT and non-IT countries.9

   C Levin et al. find that inflation persistence is lower in IT

countries, but innovations in inflation are larger than in non-IT

countries. In fact, innovations are so much larger that the

unconditional variance of inflation is higher in IT countries

despite lower persistence. There is no reason to expect this

result if the adoption of IT is the cause of low persistence.

Instead, the result suggests that the shocks hitting IT and non-

IT countries are different. In particular, it is consistent with

the hypothesis that external shocks have larger effects in IT

countries because they are more open. If these shocks cause large

transitory movements in inflation, they can explain both low

persistence and a high variance of inflation.

Levin et al.: Expectations

     The Levin et al. paper also estimates the effects of

inflation on expected inflation, as measured by professional



     9
      Levin et al. report larger differences between IT and non-
IT countries when they exclude Denmark from the non-IT group. In
particular, there is some difference in the persistence of total
inflation as well as core inflation. However, excluding Denmark
magnifies the difference in openness between the two groups.

                               65
forecasts. For a given country, they estimate

      (A8)    )Bqt = 8 + $)B-t + ,t ,

where Bqt is the expectation in year t of inflation in year t+q

and B-t is a three-year moving average of inflation: B-t = (1/3)(Bt

+ Bt-1 + Bt-2). Equation (A8) can be rewritten as

      (A9) Bqt -Bqt-1 = ($/3)(Bt-Bt-3) .

That is, Levin et al. estimate the effect of a three-year change

in inflation on a one-year change in expectations. The rationale

for this specification is unclear.

     For non-IT countries and q between 3 and 10, the paper

reports estimates of $ in the neighborhood of 0.25. These

estimates imply that a one point change in (Bt-Bt-3) causes a 0.75

point change in Bqt -Bqt-1   ,   a surprisingly large effect.
