                                         ABSTRACT

We estimate the impact of mask mandates and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on
COVID-19 case growth in Canada, including regulations on businesses and gatherings, school
closures, travel and self-isolation, and long-term care homes. We partially account for behavioral
responses using Google mobility data. Our identification approach exploits variation in the timing
of indoor face mask mandates staggered over two months in the 34 public health regions in
Ontario, Canada's most populous province. We find that, in the first few weeks after
implementation, mask mandates are associated with a reduction of 25 percent in the weekly
number of new COVID-19 cases. Additional analysis with province-level data provides
corroborating evidence. Counterfactual policy simulations suggest that mandating indoor masks
nationwide in early July could have reduced the weekly number of new cases in Canada by 25 to
40 percent in mid-August, which translates into 700 to 1,100 fewer cases per week.

1       Introduction
When government policies to stem the spread of COVID-19 were introduced in early 2020,
the best available evidence supporting them was provided by studies of previous epidemics,
epidemiological modeling, and case studies (OECD, 2020). Even when the efficacy of a
given precaution in reducing COVID-19 transmission has been established, significant doubts
regarding the usefulness of specific policy measures may persist due to uncertainty regarding
adherence to the rules and other behavioral responses. For example, even though several
observational studies, mostly in medical setting, have shown that face masks reduce the
transmission of COVID-19 and similar respiratory illnesses (see Chu et al. (2020) for a
comprehensive review), a face mask mandate may not be effective in practice if it fails to
increase the prevalence of mask wearing (compliance), or if it leads to increased contacts due
to a false sense of security. It is therefore important to directly evaluate and quantify the
relationship between various policy measures and the rate of propagation of COVID-19.
    The low cost and high feasibility of mask mandates relative to other containment measures
for COVID-19 has generated keen interest worldwide for studying their effectiveness. This
attention has been compounded by substantial variation, across jurisdictions and over time,
in official advice regarding the use of masks. Figure B1 in the Appendix plots self-reported
mask usage in select countries (Canada, United States, Germany and Australia) in the left
panel, and across Canadian provinces in the right panel. The figure shows large differences
in mask usage, both across countries and within Canada.1
    We estimate and quantify the impact of mask mandates and other non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPI) on the growth of the number of COVID-19 cases in Canada. Canadian
data has the important advantage of allowing two complementary approaches to address
our objective. First, we estimate the effect of mask mandates by exploiting within-province
geographic variation in the timing of indoor face mask mandates across 34 public health
regions (PHUs) in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province with a population of nearly
15 million or roughly 39% of Canada’s population (Statistics Canada, 2020). The advantage
of this approach is that it exploits variation over a relatively small geographic scale (PHU),
holding all other province-level policies or events constant. In addition, the adoption of
indoor face mask mandates in these 34 sub-regions was staggered over approximately two
months, creating sufficient intertemporal policy variation across the PHUs.
    1
    We show mask usage for the U.S. and Germany because related work by Chernozhukov et al. (2020) and
Mitze et al. (2020) studies the effect of mask mandates in these countries respectively. We show Australia as
an example of a country which did not mandate mask usage, except for Melbourne in late July. See Hatzius
et al. (2020) for more cross-country comparisons of mask usage.



                                                     2
    Second, we evaluate the impact of NPIs in Canada as a whole, by exploiting variation
in the timing of policies across the country’s ten provinces. By studying inter-provincial
variation, we are able to analyze the impact of not only mask mandates, but also other NPIs,
for which there is little or no variation across Ontario’s PHUs (regulations on businesses and
gatherings, schooling, travel and long-term care). In addition, our province-level data include
both the closing period (March-April) and the gradual re-opening period (May-August),
providing variation from both the imposition and the relaxation of policies.
    Our panel-data estimation strategy broadly follows the approach of Chernozhukov, Kasa-
hara and Schrimpf (2020), hereafter CKS (2020), adapted to the Canadian context. We allow
for behavioural responses (using Google Community Mobility Reports geo-location data as
proxy for behaviour changes and trends), as well as lagged outcome responses to policy and
behavioral changes. Our empirical approach also allows current epidemiological outcomes to
depend on past outcomes, as an information variable affecting past policies or behaviour, or
directly, as in the SIR model framework.
    We find that, in the first few weeks after their introduction, mask mandates are associated
with an average reduction of 25 to 31% in the weekly number of newly diagnosed COVID-19
cases in Ontario, holding all else equal. We find corroborating evidence in the province-level
analysis, with a 36 to 46% reduction in weekly cases, depending on the empirical specification.
Furthermore, using survey data, we show that mask mandates increase self-reported mask
usage in Canada by 30 percentage points, suggesting that the policy has a significant impact
on behaviour. Jointly, these results suggest that mandating indoor mask wear in public
places is a powerful policy measure to slow the spread of COVID-19, with little associated
economic disruption at least in the short run.2
    Counterfactual policy simulations using our empirical estimates suggest that mandating
indoor masks nationwide in early July could have reduced weekly new cases in Canada by 25
to 40% on average by mid-August relative to the actually observed numbers, which translates
into 700 to 1,100 fewer cases per week.
    We also find that the most stringent restrictions on businesses and gatherings observed
in our data are associated with a decrease of 48 to 57% in weekly cases, relative to a lack of
restrictions. The business/gathering estimates are, however, noisier than our estimates for
mask mandates and do not retain statistical significance in all specifications; they appear
driven by the smaller provinces and the re-opening period (May to August). School closures
and travel restrictions are associated with a large decrease in weekly case growth in the
  2
    Hatzius et al. (2020) estimate that a national mask mandate in the USA could replace alternative
restrictions costing 5% of GDP.



                                                 3
closing period. Our results on business/gathering regulations and school closure suggest
that reduced restrictions and the associated increase in business or workplace activity and
gatherings or school re-opening can offset, in whole or in part, the estimated effect of mask
mandates on COVID-19 case growth, both in our sample and subsequently.
    An additional contribution of this research project is to assemble, from original official
sources only, and make publicly available a complete dataset of COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests
and policy measures in all 10 Canadian provinces.3 To this end, we constructed, based on
official public health orders and announcements, time series for 17 policy indicators regarding
face masks, regulations on businesses and gatherings, school closures, travel and self-isolation,
and long-term care homes.
    Our paper relates most closely to two recent empirical papers on the effects of mask man-
dates using observational data.4 CKS (2020) and Mitze et al. (2020) study the effect of mask
mandates in the United States and Germany, respectively. CKS (2020), whose estimation
strategy we follow, exploit U.S. state-level variation in the timing of mask mandates for em-
ployees in public-facing businesses, and find that these mandates are associated with 9 to 10
percentage points reduction in the weekly growth rate of cases. This is substantially smaller
that our estimates, possibly because the mask mandates that we study are much broader:
they apply to all persons rather than just employees, and most apply to all indoor public
spaces rather than just businesses. Mitze et al. (2020) use a synthetic control approach and
compare the city of Jena and six regions in Germany that adopted a face mask policy in
early to mid April 2020, before their respective state mandate. They find that mandatory
masks reduce the daily growth rate of cases by about 40%.
    Our paper has several advantages compared to the above two papers. First, we exploit
both regional variation within the same province (like Mitze et al., 2020) and provincial
variation in the whole country (like CKS, 2020), and find similar results, which strengthens
the validity of our findings. Second, we show that self-reported mask usage has increased after
introducing mask mandates. We view this “first-stage” result on mask usage as informative,
as the effectiveness of any NPI or public policy critically depends on the compliance rate.
Moreover, this result mitigates possible concerns that the estimated mask mandate effect
on COVID-19 case growth may be caused by factors other than mask policy. Third, a key

and tests data that we collected and use in this paper incorporate all official ex-post revisions as of mid-
August, unlike data from the Government of Canada COVID-19 website or other aggregator websites.
   4
     Howard et al. (2020), a comprehensive review of the medical literature, stresses that “no randomized
controlled trial (RCT) on the use of masks as source control for SARS-CoV-2 has been published.” It
is unlikely that an RCT on masks’ effectiveness against COVID-19 will be feasible or ethical during the
pandemic.


                                                     4
difference between our paper and CKS (2020) is that we evaluate the effect of universal
(or community) mandatory indoor mask wearing for the public rather than the effect of
mandatory mask wearing for employees only.5 While other factors such as differences in mask
wear compliance between Canada and the U.S. may contribute to the different estimated
magnitude of the policy impact, our results suggest that more comprehensive mask policies
can be more effective in reducing the case growth rate.
    Other Related Literature
Abaluck et al. (2020) discuss the effectiveness of universal adoption of homemade cloth
face masks and conclude that this policy could yield large benefits, in the $3,000–$6,000
per capita range, by slowing the spread of the virus. The analysis compares countries with
pre-existing norms that sick people should wear masks (South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong
and Taiwan) and countries without such norms.6
    In the medical literature, Prather et al. (2020) argue that masks can play an important
role in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Howard et al. (2020) survey the medical evidence
on mask efficiency and recommend public use of masks in conjunction with existing hygiene,
distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Greenhalgh et al. (2020) provide evidence on the
use of masks during non-COVID epidemics (influenza and SARS) and conclude that even
limited protection could prevent some transmission of COVID-19. Leung et al. (2020) study
exhaled breath and coughs of children and adults with acute respiratory illness and conclude
that the use of surgical face masks could prevent the transmission of the human coronavirus
and influenza virus from symptomatic individuals. Meyerowitz et al. (2020) present a recent
comprehensive review of the evidence on transmission of the virus and conclude that there
is strong evidence from case and cluster reports indicating that respiratory transmission is
dominant, with proximity and ventilation being key determinants of transmission risk, as
opposed to direct contact or fomite transmission.
    Our paper also complements recent work on COVID-19 policies in Canada. Mohammed
et al. (2020) use public opinion survey data to study the effect of changes in mask-wear
policy recommendations, from discouraged to mandatory, on the rates of mask adoption and
public trust in government institutions. They show that Canadians exhibit high compliance
with mask mandates and trust in public health officials remained consistent across time.
Yuksel et al. (2020) use an outcome variable constructed from Apple mobility data along

     Lyu and Wehby (2020) provide suggestive evidence that community mask mandates are more effective
than employees-only mandates.

     The authors report average daily case growth rate of 18% in countries with no pre-existing mask norms
vs. 10% in countries with such norms. On a weekly basis, this translates to a reduction of 49 log points
(100(log(1.187 ) − log(1.17 ))) in case growth, or 39% reduction in weekly cases.

compliance with social distancing measures.


2       Data
We use three main data sources, respectively for epidemiological variables, NPI and mask
mandates, and behavioral responses. The time period is from the start of detected commu-
nity transmission in Canada in March to mid-August, 2020.
    We located and accessed the original official sources to collect a complete dataset of
COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests and policy measures in all ten Canadian provinces.7 In
addition, our data include cases and policy measure indicators for each of the 34 public
health units (PHUs) in Ontario. A detailed description is provided in the data source files
shared at the project’s Github webpage.
    Implementation dates of NPIs and other public policies were collected from government
websites, announcements, public health orders and staged re-opening plans collected from
their official sources. In the national data, the raw policy measures data contain the dates or
enactment and relaxation (if applicable) of 17 policy indicators including: mandatory mask
wear; closure and re-opening of retail and non-essential businesses, restaurants, recreation
facilities, and places of worship; school closures; limits on events and gatherings; international
and domestic travel restrictions and self-isolation requirements; restrictions on visits and staff
movement in long-term care homes. All policy indicator variables are defined in Table C1
in the Appendix.8 Since many of these indicators are highly correlated with each other,
we combine them into five policy aggregates in the empirical analysis (see Table A17 and
Section 3.2). In the Ontario PHU data, the implementation dates of mask mandates and
the relaxation dates of policies for businesses and gatherings vary across PHUs. Decisions
about the former were made at the PHU level, while decisions about the latter were made
by the province, which classified PHUs into three groups, with some exceptions.
    Regarding behavioral responses, we use the Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Re-
ports, which summarize daily cellphone geo-location data for each province as indices cal-
culated relative to the median value for the same day of the week in the five-week baseline
    7
     The provinces differ in the ease of accessibility of their official time series of COVID-19 cases, deaths
and test numbers. In some cases, we located and used the hidden json sources feeding the public dashboard
charts. In few instances in which data were not available, we used the numbers reported in the daily
provincial government announcements. All COVID-19 outcome data sources are referenced and web-linked
in Appendix Table C3.
   8
     Additional survey data on mask usage is described and used in Section 4.4.

period January 3 to February 6, 2020.9 In Ontario, these location data are available for each
of the 51 first-level administrative divisions (counties, regional municipalities, single-tier mu-
nicipalities and districts).10


3       Empirical method
We follow the approach of CKS (2020), but modify and adapt it to the Canadian con-
text. The empirical strategy uses the panel structure of the outcome, policy and behavioral
proxy variables, and includes lags of outcomes as information, following the causal paths
suggested by the epidemiological SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927). Specifically,
we estimate the effect of policy interventions on COVID-19 outcomes while controlling for
information and behaviour. In contrast to CKS (2020) and Hsiang et al. (2020), who study
variation in NPIs across U.S. states or across countries, our identification strategy exploits
policy variation at the sub-provincial level (Ontario’s PHUs) in addition to cross-province
variation, and our data captures both the closing down and gradual re-opening stages of the
epidemic.


3.1     Estimation strategy
The main data used in our empirical analysis are summarized below; Section 3.2 describes
the variables in detail. Everywhere i denotes province for national analysis, and health region
(PHU) for Ontario analysis, and t denotes time measured in days.
    1. Outcomes, Yit – growth rate of weekly cases or deaths.

    2. Information, Iit – lagged outcomes, i.e. past levels or growth rate of cases (or deaths).
       We also consider a specification that includes the past cases/deaths and case/death
       growth at the national level as additional information variables.

    3. Behavioral responses, Bit – Google mobility data capturing changes in people’s geo-
       location relative to a baseline period in January-February.

    4. Policy/NPIs, Pit – for the national analysis, five policy aggregates by province and
       date; for the Ontario analysis, two policy variables (mask mandates and regulation on
       business and gathering) by PHU and date.
    9
    The reports are available for download at https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/.
  10
    Each of these divisions is either entirely (in most cases) or predominantly located within a single PHU.
In cases where a PHU corresponds to multiple divisions, 2016 Census population counts were used as weights
to compute the PHU’s mobility index.

                                                     7
   5. Controls, Wit – province or PHU fixed effects, growth rate of weekly new COVID-19
      tests, and a time trend.

   To assess and disentangle the impact of NPIs and behavioral responses on COVID-19
outcomes, we estimate the following equation:

                             Yit = αBit−l + πPit−l + µIit + δY Wit + εYit                               (1)

where l denotes a time lag measured in days. Equation (1) models the relationship between
COVID-19 outcomes, Yit , and lagged behaviour, Bit−l , lagged policy measures, Pit−l and
information (past outcomes), Iit = Yit−l . For case growth as the outcome, we use l = 14.
For deaths growth as the outcome, we use l = 28.11 The choice of these lags is discussed in
Appendix D.
    By including lagged outcomes, our approach allows for possible endogeneity of the policy
interventions Pit , that is, the introduction or relaxation of NPIs based on information on
the level or growth rate of cases or deaths. Also, past cases may be correlated with (lagged)
government policies or behaviors that may not be fully captured by the policy and behaviour
variables.
    In Appendix Table A18, we also report estimates of the following equation:

                                   Bit = βPit + γIit + δB Wit + εB
                                                                 it                                     (2)

which models the relationship between policies Pit , information, Iit (weekly levels or growth
of cases or deaths) and behaviour, Bit . It is assumed that behaviour reacts to the information
without a significant lag. We find strong correlation between policy measures and the Google
mobility behavioral proxy measure.
    Equation (1) captures both the direct effect of policies on outcomes, with the appropriate
lag, as well as the potential indirect effect on outcomes from changes in behaviour captured
by the changes in geo-location proxy Bit−l . In Appendix Tables A19 and A20, we also report
estimates of equation (1) without including the behavioral proxy, that is, capturing the total
effect of policies on outcomes. Since our estimates of the coefficient α in equation (1) are
not significantly different from zero, the results without controlling for the behavioral proxy
are very similar to those from estimating equation (1).
  11
     Our lag for deaths is one week longer than that used by CKS (2020). The difference is due to additional
evidence from the medical literature and the construction of the weekly variables (see Appendix D).

3.2     Variables and descriptive analysis
   Outcomes. Our main outcome of interest is the growth rate of weekly new positive
COVID-19 cases as defined below.12 We use weekly outcome data to correct for the strong
day-of-the-week effect present in COVID-19 outcome data.13 Weekly case growth is a metric
that can be helpful in assessing trends in the spread of COVID-19, and it is highlighted in
the World Health Organization’s weekly epidemiological updates (see, for example, World
Health Organization (2020)).
   Specifically, let Cit denote the cumulative case count up to day t and define ∆Cit as the
weekly COVID-19 cases reported for the 7-day period ending at day t:

                                           ∆Cit ≡ Cit − Cit−7 .

The weekly case (log) growth rate is then defined as:

                           Yit = ∆ log(∆Cit ) = log(∆Cit ) − log(∆Cit−7 ),                                (3)

that is, the week-over-week growth in cases in region i ending on day t.14 The weekly death
growth rate is defined analogously, using cumulative deaths data.

   Policy. In the Ontario analysis, we exploit regional variation in the timing of indoor
mask mandates staggered over two months in the province’s 34 regions (”public health units”
or PHUs). Figure 1 displays the gradual introduction of mask mandates across the 34 PHUs
in Ontario. The exact implementation dates of the mask mandates are reported in Table
C2. Mandatory indoor masks were introduced first in the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph PHU
on June 12 and last in the Northwestern PHU on August 17.15
  12
     We also report results using the growth rate of deaths as supplemental analysis in Section 4.5.
  13
     Figures B9 and B10 in the Appendix respectively display the weekly and daily cases, deaths and tests
in each Canadian province over time. There are markedly lower numbers reported on weekends or holidays.
  14
     To deal with zero weekly values, which mostly occur in the smaller regions, as in CKS (2020), we replace
log(0) with -1. We also check the robustness of our results by adding 1 to all ∆Cit observations before taking
logs, by replacing log(0) with 0, and by using population weighted least squares; see Tables A5 and A8.
  15
     There is no PHU-wide mask mandate in Lambton as of August 31, but its main city, Sarnia, enacted a
mask mandate on July 31.

Notes: There are a total of 34 public health units (PHU) in Ontario. See Table C2 for the exact date of
mask mandate implementation in each PHU.



    In the province-level analysis, we assign numerical values to each of the 17 policy indica-
tors listed in Table C1 in Appendix C. The values are on the interval [0,1], with 0 meaning
no or lowest level of restrictions and 1 meaning maximal restrictions. A policy value between
0 and 1 indicates partial restrictions, either in terms of intensity (see more detail and the
definitions in Table C1) or by geographical coverage (in large provinces). The numerical
values are assigned at the daily level for each region (PHU or province, respectively for the
Ontario and national results), while maintaining comparability across regions.
    Many NPIs were implemented at the same time, both relative to each other and/or
across regions (especially during the March closing-down period), which causes many of
the policy indicators to be highly correlated with each other (see Appendix Table A4). To
avoid multi-collinearity issues, we group the 17 policy indicators into 5 policy aggregates
via simple averaging: (i) travel, which includes international and domestic travel restrictions
and self-isolation rules; (ii) school, which is an indicator of provincial school closure; (iii)
business/gathering, which comprises regulations and restrictions on non-essential businesses
and retail, personal businesses, restaurants, bars and nightclubs, places of worship, events,

                                                                                                       10
gyms and recreation, and limits on gathering; (iv) long-term care (LTC), which includes NPIs
governing the operation of long-term care homes (visitor rules and whether staff are required
to work on a single site) and (v) mask which takes value 1 if an indoor mask mandate has
been introduced, 0 if not, or value between 0 and 1 if only part of a province has enacted
such policy.16
    The five policy aggregates are constructed at the daily level and capture both the closing-
down period (an increase in the numerical value from 0 toward 1) and the re-opening period
(decrease in the numerical value toward zero). In comparison, the policy indicators compiled
by Raifman (2020) for the USA used in CKS (2020) are binary “on (1)”/“off (0)” variables.17
For consistency with the weekly outcome and information variables and the empirical model
timing, we construct the policy aggregates Pitj used in the regressions (where j denotes policy
type) by taking a weekly moving average of the raw policy data, from date t − 6 to date t.
    Figure 2 plots the values of the 5 policy aggregates over time for each of the 10 provinces.
Travel restrictions, school closures (including Spring and Summer breaks) and business clo-
sures were implemented in a relatively short period in the middle of March. There is some
variation in the travel policy aggregate since some Canadian provinces (the Atlantic provinces
and Manitoba) implemented inter-provincial domestic travel or self-isolation restrictions in
addition to the federal regulations regarding international travel. Restrictions on long-term
care facilities were introduced more gradually. In the re-opening period (May-August), there
is also more policy intensity variation across the provinces, especially in the business and
gatherings category, as the different provinces implemented their own re-opening plans and
strategies. Mask mandates were first introduced in Ontario starting from June in some
smaller PHUs and early July in the most populous PHUs such as Toronto, Ottawa and Peel
(see Appendix Table C2). In Quebec, indoor masks were mandated province-wide on July
18. Nova Scotia and Alberta’s two main cities implemented mask mandates on July 31 and
August 1, respectively.

     We do not use provincial declarations of emergency in our analysis as they are mostly legal tools enabling
other restrictions rather than restrictions per se.

     The daily numerical values for each of the 17 basic policy indicators and the 5 policy aggregates for each
province and date are available on the project’s Github repository.

   There are two empirical challenges specific to our Canadian context and data. The first
challenge is the presence of small provinces and sub-regions with very few COVID-19 cases
or deaths. In Section 4.3, we perform a number of robustness checks using different ways
of handling the observations with very few cases (in particular zero cases). The second
data limitation is that there are only 10 provinces in Canada and 34 public health units in
Ontario, unlike the 51 U.S. jurisdictions in CKS (2020). To account for the resulting small
number of clusters in the estimation, we compute and report wild bootstrap standard errors
and p-values, as proposed by Cameron et al. (2008).18 On the flip side, our data has the
advantage of a longer time horizon (March to August) and non-binary, more detailed policy
variables compared to Raifman et al. (2020).
    Behaviour proxy. We follow CKS (2020) and other authors in interpreting the loca-
tion change indices from the Google Community Mobility reports as proxies for changes in
people’s behaviour during the pandemic, keeping in mind that location is only one aspect
of behaviour relevant to COVID-19. The general pattern in the data (see Figure B3) shows
sharply reduced frequency of recorded geo-locations in shops, workplaces and transit early in
the pandemic (March), with a subsequent gradual increase back toward the baseline (except
for transit), and a flattening out in July and August.
    Several of the six location indicators (retail, grocery and pharmacy, workplaces, transit,
parks and residential) are highly correlated with each other (see Tables A1 and A2) and/or
contain many missing observations for the smaller provinces. To address these data limita-
tions and the possible impact of collinearity on the estimation results, we use as proxy for
behavioral changes the simple average of the following three mobility indicators: “retail”,
“grocery and pharmacy” and “workplaces”. To be consistent with the weekly outcome vari-
ables and to mitigate day-of-week behavioural variation, we construct the Behaviour proxy
Bit by taking a weekly moving average of the 31 (retail + grocery and pharmacy + work-
places) data, from date t − 6 to date t.19,20 As a result, our empirical analysis uses weekly
totals (for cases, tests and deaths) or weekly moving averages (for policies and the behaviour
proxy) of all variables recorded on daily basis.21
  18
     Alternative methods for computing the standard errors are explored in Section 4.3.
  19
     We drop the “transit”, “parks”, and “residential” location indicators because, respectively, 10.6%, 13.7%,
and 2.8% of the observations are missing in the provincial data, and 20.7%, 52.1%, and 11.1% are missing
in the Ontario data. The “transit” and “residential” variables are also highly correlated with the three
indicators we include in our aggregate behaviour proxy Bit . Furthermore, the “parks” indicator does not
have clear implication for COVID-19 outcomes.
  20
     In the Ontario analysis, 1.4% of the Bit values are imputed via linear interpolation.
  21
     In estimation equation (1), we take moving average from date t − 14 to date t − 20 for policies and
behaviour when the outcome is weekly case growth, and from date t − 28 to date t − 34 if the outcome is

   Tables A3 and A4 display the correlation between our behaviour proxy Bit and the five
NPI policy aggregates Pitj . Importantly, the behaviour proxy and mask mandate variables are
not highly correlated, suggesting that the effect of mask mandates on COVID-19 outcomes
should be independent of location behaviour changes.
    Information. We use the weekly cases and case growth variables defined above, ∆Cit
and Yit , to construct the information variables Iit in equation (1). Specifically, we use as
information the lagged value of the weekly case growth rate Yit−l (= ∆ log(∆Cit−l ) and the
log of past weekly cases, log(∆Cit−l ). We also use the lagged provincial (Ontario analysis) or
national (Canada analysis) case growth rate and log of weekly cases as additional information
variables in some specifications. A two-week information lag l = 14 is used in the baseline
results. In the supplementary regressions using the death growth rate as the outcome, we
use information on past deaths and a four-week lag (see Section 4.5).
    Control variables. In all regressions, we control for region fixed effects (PHU or
province) and the weekly COVID-19 tests growth rate ∆ log(∆Tit ), where Tit denotes cumu-
lative tests in region i until date t and ∆Tit is defined analogously to ∆Cit above. We include
a time trend: our baseline uses a cubic polynomial in days, but we also report results with
no time trend and with week fixed effects. Robustness checks also include news or weather
variables as controls (see Section 4.3).
    Time period. We use the period May 15 to August 13 for the analysis with Ontario PHU
level data and the period March 11 to August 13 for the national analysis with provincial
data. The end date reflects data availability at the time of empirical analysis and writing.
The start date for the Ontario sample (May 15) is approximately two weeks after the last
restrictive measures were implemented and four weeks before the first mask mandate was
introduced in Ontario. Robustness checks with different initial dates (May 1, June 1 and
June 15) are reported in Section 4.3, with our results remaining stable. The initial date for
the national sample (March 11) was chosen as the first date on which each province reported
at least one COVID-19 test (so that cases could be potentially reported). Again, alternative
initial dates are explored in Section 4.3.

We start with a simple graphical illustration of the effect of mask mandates on COVID-19
cases growth. Figure 3 displays the average log case growth, Yit = ∆ log(∆Cit ) in Ontario
PHUs with or without mask mandates. It shows that, on average, the PHUs with a mask
mandate two weeks prior have lower case growth than the PHUs without a mask mandate
two weeks prior.

    Table 1 shows the estimates of equation (1), in which we control for other policies,
behaviour and information, as explained in Section 3.1.22 We report wild bootstrap p-values
clustered at the PHU level to account for the small number of clusters.23 The odd-numbered

     Mask mandates and regulations on business and gatherings vary at the PHU level. Long-term care
policy changed only province-wide. The other policies (schooling and travel) do not vary during the sample
period and hence are omitted from the regressions with Ontario PHU data.

columns in Table 1 use lagged cases and lagged cases growth at the PHU level as information;
the even-numbered columns also include lagged cases and lagged case growth at the province
level as additional information variables. In the tables, Variable 14 indicates a 14-day lag of
Variable.
    We present estimates of equation (1) from three specifications that handle possible time
effects differently. Columns (1) and (2) in Table 1 are the most basic specifications, without
including a time trend. The estimates in columns (1) and (2) suggest that, controlling for
behavioural changes, mandatory indoor face masks reduce the growth rate of infections by
29–32 log points (p < 0.05), which is equivalent to a 25–28% reduction in weekly cases.24
    In order to control for potential province-wide factors affecting the spread of COVID-19
such as income support policies or adaptation to the pandemic over time (so-called COVID
fatigue), we also estimate (1) with a cubic time trend in days from the beginning of the
sample, in columns (3) and (4) of Table 1, and with week fixed effects, in columns (5) and
(6). Columns (3)-(6) show that our estimates of the mask mandate policy remain robust to
the inclusion of a cubic time trend or week fixed effects. The results indicate that, depending
on the specification, mask mandates are associated with a reduction of up to 38 log points in
weekly case growth or, equivalently, a 31% reduction in weekly cases. The magnitude of the
mask policy estimate is not very sensitive to whether lagged province-level data are included
as additional information.
    The results in Table 1 suggest that indoor mask mandates can be a powerful preventative
measure in the COVID-19 context. Our estimates of the mask mandate impact across
Ontario’s PHUs are equivalent to a 25–31% reduction in weekly cases. This estimate is larger
than the 9–10% reduction estimated by CKS (2020) for the U.S. One possible explanation is
that Ontario’s mask policy is more comprehensive: we evaluate the effect of universal indoor
mask-wearing for the public rather than the effect of mask wearing for employees only in
CKS (2020). Differences in the compliance rate may also contribute to this difference; we
discuss this potential channel in Section 4.4.
    The results in Table 1 also show a statistically significant negative association between
information (log of past cases, log(∆C) 14) and current weekly case growth (p < 0.01 in all
specifications), indicating that a higher level of cases two weeks prior is correlated with lower
current case growth. While Bit allows for behavioural responses to information, the negative
estimate on log(∆C) 14 in Table 1 suggests that our location-based proxy does not capture
bootstrap standard errors clustered by both PHU and date. Our results are robust to alternative ways of
calculating standard errors.
  24
     Using equation (3), a coefficient of x translates into a 1 − exp(x) reduction in weekly cases ∆Cit /∆Cit−7 .

  fact, our coefficient estimate on the behavioral proxy Bit is very close to zero (both in Table

A18, we find strong contemporaneous correlations between the policy measures, log cases,
and the Google mobility behavioral proxy from estimating equation (2). This suggests that
the information (lagged cases) and the lagged policy variables included in equation (1) may
absorb lagged behavioral responses proxied by Bit−l or other latent behavioral changes not
captured by Bit−l .

We next evaluate the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 cases growth in Canada as a whole by
exploiting variation in the timing of policies across the 10 provinces. Here, we examine NPIs
for which there is no variation across Ontario’s PHUs (i.e., schooling, travel, and LTC) in
addition to mask mandates. Also, provincial data contain variation in the timing of policy
changes in both the closing and re-opening phases, allowing us to study both the imposition
and relaxation of restrictions.

    As in the Ontario analysis, we begin with a graphical illustration of mask mandates and
COVID-19 case growth across Canadian provinces, in the period March 11 to August 13,
2020. Figure 4 plots the average log weekly case growth in the provinces with vs. without
mask mandates. While mask mandates are implemented relatively late in our sample period,
average case growth in the provinces with a mask mandate (Ontario and Quebec) diverged
from the average case growth in the provinces without a mandate begin roughly four weeks
after the mandates are imposed.26
    Table 2 displays the estimates of equation (1) for weekly case growth, along with wild
bootstrap p-values, clustered at the province level (see Table A9 for other methods of com-
puting the standard errors). The odd-numbered columns use lagged cases and lagged case
growth at the provincial level as information while the even-numbered columns include in
addition lagged cases and case growth at the national level as additional information vari-
ables.
    As in the Ontario analysis, we present in Table 2 estimates from three specifications:
no time trend (columns (1)-(2)), including cubic time trend in days (columns (3)-(4)) and
including week fixed effects (columns (5)-(6)). The most robust result is the estimated effect
of mask mandates: they are associated with a large reduction in weekly case growth of 45
to 62 log points, which is equivalent to a 36 to 46% reduction in weekly cases across the
different specifications. The estimates are statistically significantly different from zero in all
cases, with a p-value of less than 0.001 in columns (1)-(4). It is reassuring that these results
regarding mask mandates are consistent with the Ontario analysis in the previous section.
    Table 2 further shows that restrictions on businesses and gatherings are associated with
a reduction in the weekly case growth of 65 to 85 log points or, vice versa, that relaxing
business/gathering restrictions is associated with higher case growth. The estimate is equiv-
alent to a 48 to 57% decrease in weekly cases in our sample period. The business/gathering
estimates are, however, more noisy than our estimates for mask mandates and do not retain
statistical significance in the specifications with week fixed effects (p = 0.15 and 0.14). Ta-
bles A8 and A15 further suggest that the results on business and gathering NPIs are driven
by the smaller provinces and the re-opening period (May to August). Still, these results
suggest that lowered restrictions and the associated increase in business/workplace activity
or gatherings can be an important offsetting factor for the estimated effect of mask mandates
on COVID-19 case growth, both in our sample and in the future.
    We also find that school closures (the School 14 variable in Table 2) can be negatively
  26
     Figure 4 assumes a July 7 mask mandate implementation date for Ontario (when its most populous PHU,
Toronto, adopted a mask mandate, along with Ottawa), and July 18 for Quebec (province-wide mandate).

 associated with case growth. However, the estimates are statistically significant from zero
 only in the specifications with cubic time trend (columns (3) and (4)). As seen in Figure

                                                     20
2, provincial school closures occurred in a very short time interval during March, so we
may lack statistical power to separately identify its effect from other NPIs (especially the
travel-related). Hence, we interpret this result with caution.
   As in Table 1, the level of past cases, log(∆C), is negatively and statistically significantly
associated with current weekly case growth in columns (1)-(4).
   Since the specification with cubic time trend in Tables 1 and 2 allows for possible non-
monotonic aggregate time trends in case growth in a parsimonious way, we choose it as our
baseline specification with which to perform robustness checks in the next section. Robust-
ness checks with the other specifications are available upon request.


4.3     Robustness
   Policy collinearity
A possible concern about our data for the national analysis is that some NPIs (e.g. in-
ternational travel restrictions or closing of schools) were implemented within a very short
time interval.27 Thus, we may lack enough regional variation to distinguish and identify the
separate effect of each policy.28 Collinearity could also affect the standard errors and the
signs of the estimated coefficients.
    To check robustness with respect to potential collinearity in the NPI policies, Tables A7
and A10 report estimates from our baseline specification, omitting one policy at a time, for
Ontario and Canada respectively. First, it is reassuring that the mask mandate estimates are
hardly affected by omitting any of the other policies. This is expected since mask mandates
were imposed during a period where other NPIs changed little (see Figure 2). Similarly, the
effects of business/gathering regulations and school closures in Table A10 are not sensitive
to omitting other policies one at a time, which suggests that there is sufficient statistical
power and variation to identify them in the national analysis.
   Treatment of zero weekly cases
Another concern for our empirical strategy is that the usual formula for our dependent
variable, ∆ log(∆Cit ), cannot be applied when the weekly case total ∆Cit is zero. We follow
CKS (2020) and replace ln(0) with -1 in our baseline specifications in Tables 1 and 2. We
now check the robustness of our estimates to alternative treatments of zero weekly cases.
   For easier comparison, the first two columns in Table A5 repeat columns (3) and (4)
  27
    For example, Table A4 shows a correlation of 0.61 between the Travel and School policy aggregates.
  28
    Aggregating the 17 basic policy indicators into five groups mitigates this issue. Here, we test whether
any remaining collinearity poses a problem.



                                                    21
from Table 1 for Ontario.29 Our main results on mask mandates across Ontario PHUs are
robust to replacing log(0) with 0 and to adding 1 to all ∆Cit observations before taking logs,
as shown in columns (3)-(6) of Table A5. Another way to mitigate the issue of PHUs with
very few cases is to estimate a weighted least squares regression where PHUs are weighted
by population. Columns (7) and (8) in Table A5 show that the resulting mask estimate has
a slightly smaller magnitude and, due to the reduced effective sample size, weaker statistical
significance.
    Similarly, Table A8 shows that our province-level estimates, in particular for mask man-
dates, are also robust to the same manipulations as above.30 In columns (9) and (10) of
Table A8, we restrict the sample to only the largest 4 provinces (British Columbia, Ontario,
Quebec and Alberta), which have only 0.3% (2 out of 624) zero observation cases. Again,
the estimated mask effects are little changed.
   Alternative dates
Figure B4 shows that our estimates and confidence intervals for the effect of mask mandates
in the Ontario baseline regressions do not vary much by the initial date of the sample.
Similarly, Figure B5 shows that, in the national analysis, our results about mask mandates
and business/gathering restrictions are also robust to alternative sample start dates.
   Alternative lags
We explore alternative time lags, either shorter or longer in duration, centered around the
baseline value of 14 days. Figure B6 (with Ontario data) and Figure B7 (with province-level
data) plot the estimates and confidence intervals from the baseline regressions and show that
our mask effect estimates remain fairly consistent for different lags.
   Omitted variables
Our behaviour proxy variable (Google geo-location trends) likely misses some aspects of
behaviour relevant for COVID-19 transmission. One factor that may meaningfully impact
behaviour is weather. For example, good weather could entice more people to spend time
outside, lowering the chance of viral transmission. Columns (3) and (4) in Table A11 report
national estimates with lagged weather variables (daily maximum and minimum tempera-
tures and precipitation for the largest city in each province31 ) as additional regressors. Our
NPI estimates, in particular mask mandates, are little changed from the baseline results in
columns (1) and (2).

    535 out of 3,094 observations (17%) had to be replaced.

    230 out of 1,560 observations (15%) had to be replaced.

                                              22
    Another possible concern is that our information variables, lagged cases and lagged case
growth, may not fully capture the information based on which people react or adjust their
behaviour, possibly affecting the observed weekly case growth. Columns (5) and (6) in Table
A11 add a national-level “news” variable to the baseline specification. The news variable
is defined as the number of daily search results from a news aggregator website (Proquest
Canadian Newsstream) for the terms “coronavirus” or “COVID-19” (see Appendix C for
more details). In column (6), the lagged news variable approaches the 10% significance level
(p = 0.103). Our estimates on masks and business/gathering remain very close to those in
the baseline.


4.4     Self-reported mask usage
The effectiveness of any NPI or public policy crucially depends on whether it affects be-
haviour. In this section, we use self-reported data on mask usage to examine whether mask
mandates indeed increase mask use in Canada (“first-stage” analysis).
    We use data from the YouGov COVID-19 Public Monitor, which includes multiple waves
of public opinion surveys fielded regularly since early April in many countries.32 Here, we
focus on inter-provincial comparison within Canada. Our variable of interest is based on
responses to the question “Thinking about the last 7 days, how often have you worn a face
mask outside your home (e.g. when on public transport, going to a supermarket, going to a
main road)?” The answer choices are “Always”, “Frequently”, “Sometimes”, “Rarely”, and
“Not at all”. We create a binary variable taking value 1 if the response is “Always” and
0 otherwise, as well as another variable taking value of 1 if the respondent answered either
“Always” or “Frequently” and 0 otherwise.
    We begin with a simple illustration of self-reported mask usage in Canada from April to
August 2020. Figure B2 plots the average self-reported mask usage (the response “Always”)
in the provinces with and without mask mandates.33 The figure clearly shows that self-
reported mask usage is higher, by up to 50 percentage points, in the provinces with a mask
mandate than in the provinces without mask mandates. Since Figure B2 does not account
for compositional changes in the data, we formally estimate equation (2), using self-reported
mask usage as the behavioral outcome.34
  32
     The YouGov data can be accessed at: https://yougov.co.uk/covid-19.
  33
     As on Figure 4, we use July 7 as the mask mandate implementation date in Ontario.
  34
     Since mask usage is reported only for specific dates within each survey wave, we use our mask policy
variable daily values for these same dates instead of the weekly moving average.

Notes: The data source is YouGov. The outcome is a binary variable taking value 1 if the respondent
respectively answered “Always” (in the left panel) or “Always” or “Frequently” (in the right panel) to
“Thinking about the last 7 days, how often have you worn a face mask outside your home?” The figure
plots the estimates from a version of equation (2) where the mask policy variable is replaced by the
interaction of the variables corresponding to being in the treatment group (imposed mask mandate) and a
series of dummies for each week, ranging from 6 weeks before the mask mandate to 6 weeks after (T = –6
to +5, where T = 0 is the mandate implementation date). The reference point is 1 week before the
implementation (T = –1). Wild bootstrap (cgmwildboot) standard errors clustered by province with 5000
repetitions are used to construct the confidence intervals. Sample weights are used.



    Figure 5 shows a graphical event study analysis on mask mandates and changes in mask
usage. The event study approach is appropriate for the mask usage outcome variable, since
the policy impact is expected to be immediate, unlike the other outcomes we study, for which
any impact is expected to occur with a lag and we use weekly totals or moving averages. We
replace the mask policy variable in equation (2) by the interaction of variables corresponding
to being in the treatment group (i.e. under a mask mandate), and a series of dummies for
each week, ranging from 6 weeks before the mask mandate to 5 weeks after the mask mandate
(T = –6 to +5, where T = 0 is the implementation date of the mask mandate). The reference
point is one week before the implementation of the mask mandate (T = –1), and we use the
same y-axis scale on both panels.
    The left and right panels of Figure 5 present the results from the event study analysis
for the “Always” and “Always” or “Frequently” mask usage answers, respectively. We make
several observations. First, neither panel shows a pre-trend – the estimates are close to
zero before the mask mandates. This addresses the potential concern that provinces that
implemented mask mandates may have had a different trend in mask usage than provinces
that did not. Second, the effect of mask mandates on mask usage is immediate: an increase


                                                                                                    24
of roughly 20 percentage points as soon as the mask policy is implemented at (T = 0). Third,
the effect appears persistent rather than transitory, since mask usage after T = 0 does not
revert to its level before T = 0.

standard errors clustered by province with 5000 repetitions are reported in the square brackets. NC denotes
national total cases. The data source is YouGov. The outcome is a dummy which takes value 1 if the
respondent answered “Always” to the survey question “Thinking about the last 7 days, how often have you
worn a face mask outside your home?” Sample weights are used. Individual characteristics include a gender
dummy, age dummy (in years), dummies for each household size, dummies for each number of children, and

    Table 3 displays the estimates on self-reported mask usage (answer “Always”) in equation
(2) along with wild bootstrap p-values clustered at the province level. The odd-numbered
columns use lagged cases and lagged case growth at the provincial level as information while
the even-numbered columns include in addition lagged cases and case growth at the national
level as additional information variables. As in Table 1 and Table 2, we present estimates


                                                    25
without time trend, including cubic time trend (in days), and including week fixed effects.
Our preferred specification with cubic time trend, column (4) of Table 3, shows that mask
mandates are associated with 31.5 percentage point increase in self-reported mask usage
(p < 0.001), from a base of self-reported mask usage without mask mandate of 29.8%.35,36
    These “first-stage” results show that mask mandates exhibit significant compliance in
Canada and establish a basis for the significant impact of mask mandates on the spread of
COVID-19 that we find. That said, given that mask mandates do not change everyone’s
behaviour, our estimates in Tables 1 and 2 represent intent-to-treat effects. The full effect
of the entire population shifting from not wearing to wearing masks is likely significantly
larger.37
    There is a heated debate on whether community use of masks may create a false sense
of security that reduces adherence to other preventive measures. We also investigate this
question using YouGov survey data. As Tables A13 and A14 indicate, we find no evidence
that mask mandates in Canada have had an offsetting effect on other preventive measures
such as hand washing, using sanitizer, avoiding gatherings, and avoiding touching objects in
public during the period we study. On the contrary, mask mandates may slightly increase
social distancing in one out of the eight precaution categories (avoiding crowded areas)
(p < 0.10).38


4.5     Counterfactuals
We evaluate several counterfactuals corresponding to replacing the actual mask policy in a
province or Canada-wide with a counterfactual policy, including absence of mask mandate.
    Letting t0 be the implementation date of a counterfactual policy, we set the counterfactual
weekly case count, ∆Citc , equal to ∆Cit for all t < t0 . For each date t ≥ t0 , using the definition
of Yit from (3), we then compute the counterfactual weekly cases, ∆Citc and the counterfactual

     Similarly, in Table A12, column (4) shows that “Always” or “Frequent” mask usage increases by 21.5
percentage points. The finding that the increase in mask usage among the “Always” respondents is larger
than among the “Always” or “Frequent” respondents is consistent with some people switching from wearing
masks “frequently” to “always.”
  36
     Hatzius et al. (2020) document that state mask mandates in the US increased mask usage roughly by
25 percentage points in 30 days. The compliance with mask mandates may differ across countries or regions
based on social norms, peer effects, political reasons or the consequences of noncompliance (e.g., fines).
  37
     If we take the increase of about 30 percentage points in reported mask usage induced by mask mandates
at face value, the full effect of mask wearing (treatment-on-the-treated effect) would be roughly triple our
estimates. It could be larger still if there is desirability bias in answering the mask usage survey question,
so that the actual increase in mask use may be smaller than our estimate.
  38
     Consistent with this result, Seres et al. (2020) find that wearing masks increased physical distancing
based on a randomized field experiment in stores in Germany.

where Yˆit is the regression-fitted value of weekly case growth; βM ask 14 is the coefficient
estimate on the mask mandate variable Mask 14 in baseline specification (4) in Table 1
or 2, depending on the counterfactual; Maskc 14 is the counterfactual mask policy (e.g.
different implementation date, wider geographic coverage or absence of mask mandate); and
βlog∆C 14 is the coefficient estimate (-0.227 or -0.209) on lagged cases log(∆C) 14 in Table 1
or 2, column 4. The coefficient βlog∆C 14 adjusts the counterfactual case growth rate for the
negative statistically significant association between the weekly case total two weeks prior
and time-t case growth. This effect may be due to people being more careful when they
perceive the risk of infection to be higher or less careful vice versa.

province. We use the mask estimate (-0.376) from column (4) of Table 1.

Notes: The left panel assumes that mask mandates were adopted in all provinces on July 7 (the adoption
date in Toronto and Ottawa). The right panel assumes that mask mandates were not adopted in any
province. We use the mask estimate (-0.613) from column (4) of Table 2.


                                                                                                                            28
    Figures 6, 7 and 8 show results from two counterfactual policy evaluations. The first
exercise, depicted in the left-hand side panel of the figures, assumes that masks are adopted
everywhere at the earliest date observed in the data. Specifically, Figure 6 considers the
counterfactual of all Ontario PHUs adopting mask mandates on June 12, while Figures 7
and 8 assume that all provinces adopt a mask mandate on July 7.39
    Using our mask policy estimate from Table 1, Figure 6 shows that an earlier face mask
mandate across Ontario PHUs could have lead to an average reduction of about 300 cases
per week as of August 13, holding all else equal. For Canada as a whole, a nation-wide
adoption of mask mandates in early July is predicted to reduce total cases per week in the
country by 700 to 1,100 cases on average as of August 13, depending on whether we use the
more conservative mask estimate (-0.376) from column (4) of Table 1 (see Figure 7) or the
larger estimate (-0.613) from column (4) of Table 2 (see Figure 8). In all cases, the indirect
feedback effect via βlog∆C 14 (lagged cases as information) starts moderating the decrease in
cases two weeks after the start of the counterfactual mask policy.
    In the right-hand side panel of Figures 6, 7 and 8, we perform the opposite exercise,
namely assuming instead that mask mandates were not adopted in any Ontario PHU or any
Canadian province. Our estimates imply that the counterfactual absence of mask mandates
would have led to a large increase in new cases, both in Ontario and Canada-wide, especially
when using the larger mask coefficient estimate from Table 2 (see Figure 8).
    Finally, in Figure B11 in the Appendix, we also evaluate the counterfactual in which
British Columbia and Alberta, the third and fourth largest Canadian provinces by popu-
lation, adopt province-wide mask mandates on July 15. The results, using the Mask 14
estimate from Table 2, suggest a reduction of about 300 cases per week in each province by
mid-August.
    The counterfactual simulations assume that all other variables, behaviour and policies
(except the mask policy and t − 14 cases) remain fixed, as observed in the data. This is
a strong assumption, but it may be plausible over the relatively short time period that we
analyze. Moreover, the counterfactuals assume that regions without a mask mandate would
react in the same way, on average, as the regions that imposed a mandate. Therefore, these
results should be interpreted with caution and only offer a rough illustration and projection
of the estimated effect of mask mandates on COVID-19 cases.
  39
    June 12 is the date of the earliest mask mandate in Ontario. For the national analysis, July 7, the effective
date for Toronto and Ottawa, is considered Ontario’s first significant date of mask mandate enactment: PHUs
with earlier mandates account for less than 10% of Ontario’s population.

4.6       Additional analysis
    Closing and re-opening sub-periods
We investigate whether policy impact varied in different phases of the pandemic by splitting
the full sample period into two sub-periods: “closing” (March 11 to May 14) and “re-
opening” (May 15 to August 13). The dividing date of May 15 (referring to the NPIs in
place around May 1) was chosen because very few policies were relaxed before May 1, and
very few non-mask policies were tightened after May 1 in our sample period (see Figure 2).
    In Table A15, we report estimates and wild bootstrap standard errors using our baseline
specification with cubic time trend, separately for the closing and re-opening periods. We
find that the imposition of school closures and travel restrictions early in the closing period
is associated with a very large subsequent reduction in weekly case growth, as can be also
seen on Figure B8 – the average observed log growth rate of cases ∆ log(∆C) falls from 2.4
(ten-fold growth in weekly cases) to −0.4 (33% decrease in weekly cases) between March 15
and April 5. Long-term care restrictions are also associated with reduced case growth two
weeks later during the March to May closing period. We interpret these results with caution,
however, since many of these policy measures and restrictions were enacted in a brief time
interval during March and there is not much inter-provincial variation (see Figure 2). No
mask mandates were present in the closing period.
    In the re-opening period, our results in Table A15 are in line with our full-sample re-
sults for mask mandates and business/gathering regulations (Table 2), with slightly larger
coefficient estimates and less statistically significant p-values, possibly due to the smaller
sample. Travel and school closures are not statistically significant in the re-opening period.
This is unsurprising: relaxation of travel policies was minor and endogenous (only re-open
to safe areas within Canada), and the schools that re-opened (in parts of Quebec and, on a
part-time basis, in British Columbia) did so on voluntary attendance basis, yielding smaller
class sizes.

    Deaths
We also examine the weekly death growth as an outcome. We only have access to disaggre-
gated deaths data at the province level (not at PHU levels in Ontario). We thus estimate
regression equation (1) using Yit = ∆ log(∆Dit ) for each province i as the dependent variable.
In addition, we use a 28-day lag for the policy, behaviour proxy, and information variables
to reflect the fact that deaths occur on average about two weeks after case detection; see
Appendix D for details and references.40
 40
      In Table 4, Variable 28 denotes the Variable lagged by 28 days.


                                                     30
   Table 4 reports the estimates from the same specifications as those for case growth in
Table 2. In all specifications, mask mandates are associated with a large reduction in the
observed weekly deaths growth rate four weeks later (more than 90 log points, or equivalently
more than 60% reduction in weekly deaths). These results are larger than our case growth
results, but consistent with them given the substantial uncertainty. See also Figure B12,
which plots the average weekly death growth in the provinces without a mask mandate four
weeks prior vs. that for Ontario, the only province with mask mandate four weeks prior in
our sample period.
   The robustness checks in Table A16, however, show that, unlike for case growth, the mask
mandate estimates in Table 4 are not robust to weighing by population or to restricting the
sample to the largest 4 provinces. This suggests that the estimated effect is largely driven
by observations from the small provinces, which have a disproportionately larger number of
zero or small weekly death totals.41 Furthermore, given the 28-day lag, there are only 9 days
with observations (from Ontario only) for which the mask mandate variable takes value of 1.
Due to these serious data limitations, the relation between mask mandates and COVID-19
deaths in Table 4 is suggestive at best, and we urge caution in interpreting or extrapolating
from these results.
   That said, our main findings about the growth in cases may have implications about
future growth in deaths, particularly if the affected demographics become less skewed toward
the young in later periods.

5    Conclusion
The wearing of face masks by the general public has been a very contentious policy issue
during the COVID-19 pandemic, with health authorities in many countries and the World
Health Organization giving inconsistent or contradictory recommendations over time. “Con-
spiracy theories” and misinformation surrounding mask wear abound in social media, fuelled
by some individuals’ perception that mask mandates constitute significant restrictions on
individual freedoms. Given the absence of large-scale randomized controlled trials or other
direct evidence on mask effectiveness in preventing the spread of COVID-19, quantitative
observational studies like ours are essential for informing both public policy and the public
opinion.
    We estimate the impact of mask mandates and other public policy measures on the spread
of COVID-19 in Canada. We use both within-province and cross-province variation in the
timing of mask mandates and find a robust and significantly negative association between
mask mandates and subsequent COVID-19 case growth – 25 to 46% average reduction in
weekly cases in the first several weeks after adoption, depending on the data sample and
empirical specification used. These results are supported by our analysis of survey data on
compliance with the mask mandates, which show that the mandates increase the proportion
of reporting as always wearing a mask in public by around 30 percentage points. However,
our sample period does not allow us to determine whether their effect lasts beyond the first
few weeks after implementation. We conclude that mask mandates can be a powerful policy
tool for at least temporarily reducing the spread of COVID-19.
    Mask mandates were introduced in Canada during a period where other policy measures
were relaxed, as part of the economy’s re-opening. Specifically, we find that relaxed restric-
tions on businesses or gatherings are positively associated with subsequent COVID-19 case
growth – a factor that could offset and obscure the health benefits of mask mandates. Past
case totals were also found to matter for subsequent COVID-19 outcomes, suggesting that
riskier behaviour based on favourable lagged information may limit how low mask mandates
and other restrictions – short of a lockdown – can push the number of new cases.
    We have deliberately abstained from studying the direct economic impacts of COVID-
19, focusing instead on the unique features of the Canadian data for identifying the effect of
NPIs, in particular mask mandates, on COVID-19 case growth. Future research combining

      Notes: The time period is March 11 to August 13, 2020. P-values from wild bootstrap (cgmwildboot) standard errors clustered by province with
      5000 repetitions in the square brackets. Columns (1) and (2) repeat columns (3) and (4) from Table 2 where we replace log(0) with -1. Columns
      (3) and (4) replace log(0) with 0, and columns (5) and (6) add 1 to all ∆Cit observations. Columns (7) and (8) report results from a weighted
      least squares regression with the province populations as weights. Finally, columns (9) and (10) restrict the sample to only the largest 4 provinces
      (BC, ON, QC, and AB) which have only 0.3% zero observation cases. ***, ** and * denote 10%, 5% and 1% significance level respectively.

Notes: The time period is April 2 to August 13, 2020. P-values from wild bootstrap (cgmwildboot)
standard errors clustered by province with 5000 repetitions are reported in the square brackets. NC
denotes national total cases. The data source is YouGov. The outcome is a dummy which takes one for the
respondent who answers “Always” or “Frequently” to the survey question “Thinking about the last 7 days,
how often have you worn a face mask outside your home?” Sample weights are used. Individual
characteristics include a gender dummy, dummies for each age (in years), dummies for each household size,
dummies for each number of children, and dummies for each employment status. ***, ** and * denote
10%, 5% and 1% significance level respectively.

   Weather – we downloaded historical weather data for the largest city in each province
from the Weather Canada website. The data provide daily information on 11 variables: max-
imum temperature (C), minimum temperature (C), mean temperature (C), heating degree-
days, cooling degree-days, total rain (mm), total snow (cm), total precipitation (mm), snow
on the ground (cm), direction of maximum wind gust (tens of degrees), and speed of maxi-
mum wind gust (km/h). We only use the temperature and precipitation data in Table A11
as possible factors determining outside vs. inside activity.
    News – we collected data from Proquest Canadian Newsstream, a subscription service to
all major and small-market daily or weekly Canadian news sources. We recorded the number
of search results for each day from Feb 1, 2020 to Aug 20, 2020 by searching the database
for the keywords “Coronavirus” or “COVID-19”. We only counted the results with source
listed as “newspaper” since other sources, such as blogs or podcasts, tend to duplicate the
same original content.

Notes: the data source is YouGov. Possible responses to each survey item are ”Always”, ”Frequently”,
”Sometimes”, ”Rarely”, and ”Not at all”. For Table A13, we create a binary variable taking value 1 if the
response is ”Always” and 0 otherwise. For Table A14, we create a binary variable taking value of 1 if the
respondent answered either ”Always” or ”Frequently” and 0 otherwise.

Appendix D. Lags Determination
As discussed in Section 3.1, we assume a lag of 14 days between a change in policy or
behaviour and its hypothesized effect on weekly case growth, and a lag of 28 days between
such a change and its effect on weekly death growth.
    First, we consider the lag between infection and a case being reported. As most identified
cases of COVID-19 in Canada are symptomatic, we focus on symptomatic individuals. For
most provinces cases are listed according to the date of report to public health. In provinces
where the dates instead refer to the public announcement, we shifted them back by one day,
as announcements typically contain the cases reported to public health on the previous day.
The relevant lag therefore has two components:

   1. Incubation period: Most studies suggest an average incubation period of 5-6 days (e.g.
      5.2 days in Li et al. (2020), 5.5 days in Lauer et al. (2020), 5.6 days in Linton et al.
      (2020), 6.4 days in Backer et al. (2020)).

   2. Time between symptoms onset and reporting of the case to public health: the Ontario
      data contain an estimate of the symptom onset date (”episode date”) for each case. For
      our sample period the average difference between the date of report and the episode
      date is 4.8 days (median: 4 days) including only values from 1 to 14 days, and 6.3

                                                   66
     days (median: 5 days) including only values from 2 to 28 days. We assume that the
     lags in Ontario and in other provinces are similar, and use a value of 5-6 days between
     symptom onset and report to public health authorities.

    Adding these together implies that the typical lag between infection and a positive case
being reported to public health is around 11 days.
    Second, we consider the effect of weekly averaging on the appropriate lag for our analysis.
Suppose a policy or behavioural change starts on date t, impacting the daily growth in
infections between dates t − 1 and t and in each subsequent day. Then, assuming a lag of 11
days between infection and case reporting, case counts C are affected from date t+11 onward.
Our outcome variable ∆ log(∆C) thus would react to the original policy or behavioral change
on date t + 11. The change is complete on t + 23, when the week from t + 17 to t + 23 is
compared to the week from t + 10 to t + 16. The midpoint of the change is t + 17.
    Choosing a lag of l days implies that the policy/behaviour variable phases in from t + l
to t + l + 6. To match the midpoint of this phase-in to the midpoint of the change in the
outcome variable, we set l = 14. The chosen lag matches the lag used by other authors who
study COVID-19 policy interventions, e.g., CKS (2020). We explore sensitivity to alternative
lags in Section 4.3.
    With respect to deaths, our data are, in most cases, backdated (revised by the authorities
ex-post) to the actual date of death. The medical literature suggests that the mean time
from symptom onset to death is around 19 days (20 days in Wu et al. (2020), 17.8 days in
Verity et al. (2020), 20.2 days when accounting for right truncation in Linton et al. (2020),
16.1 days in Sanche et al. (2020), etc.), that is, two weeks longer than our estimate of the
time from symptom onset to reporting of a positive test result. We correspondingly set the
lag used in our analysis of the death growth rate (Section 4.5) to 28 days.
