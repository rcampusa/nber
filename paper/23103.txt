                                            ABSTRACT

Powerful currents have reshaped the structure of families over the last century. There has been (i)
a dramatic drop in fertility and greater parental investment in children; (ii) a rise in married
female labor-force participation; (iii) a significant decline in marriage and a rise in divorce; (iv) a
higher degree of positive assortative mating; (v) more children living with a single mother; (vi)
shifts in social norms governing premarital sex and married women's roles in the workplace.
Macroeconomic models explaining these aggregate trends are surveyed. The relentless flow of
technological progress and its role in shaping family life are stressed.

            Powerful currents have reshaped the structure of families over the last century.
           There has been (i) a dramatic drop in fertility and greater parental investment
           in children; (ii) a rise in married female labor-force participation; (iii) a signif-
           icant decline in marriage and a rise in divorce; (iv) a higher degree of positive
           assortative mating; (v) more children living with a single mother; (vi) shifts in
           social norms governing premarital sex and married women’s roles in the work-
           place. Macroeconomic models explaining these aggregate trends are surveyed.
           The relentless flow of technological progress and its role in shaping family life
           are stressed.

since 0 < < 1. Hence, R.q/q is increasing in q. As a result, a lower q is associated with
an upward shift in the left-hand side of equation (A1). The right-hand side of equation (A1) is
increasing in q. Hence, a lower value of q is connected with a downward shift in the right-hand
side of equation (A1). Thus, the female labor supply must go up as a result of a lower q. It is
easy to deduce that l f is increasing in .

                                      A3.    Proof of Lemma 1 (Household Allocations)
  To start, define the size variable z as taking the value 1 for a single household and 2 for a
married one. Substitute out for c c and n in the objective functions for the single and married
households. Then maximize with respect to d and h to obtain the following two first-order
conditions (for z D 1; 2):

(The z subscript has been dropped on the endogenous variables to conserve on notation.) Next,
divide (A5) into (A4) and simplify to get
                                                                                 1=.     1/

Finally, by substituting (A6) and the household’s budget constraint into equation (A5), a single
equation in h arises (for z D 1; 2):

  Proof of the Lemma—Rewrite equation (A7) as

                                      =
      [ R.q/ C .1           /]1               h         h C .1          /.1             /[1 C q R.q/]z                    h

Now begin with Part (iii). If z increases by the factor > 1, then z c=w rises by the factor
      . z c=w/=.z c=w/ > . Now the right-hand side rises by the factor                    . Observe
that if h rises by the factor , then the left-hand side will increase by more than the factor     ,
because        >       when < 0. Therefore, to restore equality between the left-hand and right-
hand sides of the above equation, h must rise by less than the factor . Next, Part (ii) is implied
by equation (A6) and Part (iii). By using Parts (ii) and (iii), in conjunction with the household’s
budget constraint, Part (i) arises. Part (iv) follows from Part (i) by noting that .c2 c/ 2.c1 c/,
since [.2 c=w/=.1 c=w/] 2. Thus, .c2 c/=2 .c1 c/, which implies c2 > c1 . Now, it
is feasible for a married household to choose c2 D 2c1 , d2 D 2d1 , and h 2 D 2h 1 . The fact they
didn’t implies that M.w; q/ > S.w; q/. Hence, Part (v) holds.

Finally, by substituting equation (A9) and the household’s budget constraint into equation (A8),

         A8.     Proof of Proposition 12 (Productivity and the Quality-Quantity Tradeoff)



  Rearranging the first-order conditions (31) and (32), while making use of (30), gives

                        V1 .k/ =J1 .e/                              V1 .k/ =U1 .c/

                             e=k                                         c=k

Logging and then taking the total differential of the two expressions yields

                            .1=    ek        1/ d ln .e=k/ D                d .w=e/ ;
                                                                    1 C w=e
                                                                       1

This can be rearranged into

(A10)                     .1=     ek    1/ d ln .e=k/ D                   d ln .e=w/ ;
                                                                    e=w C
                                                                       1
(A11)                     .1=     ck    1/ d ln .c=k/ D                   d ln .c=w/ :
                                                                    1 c=w

Note also that

                            d ln .e=k/ D d ln .e=w/ C d ln .w/                     d ln .k/
                            d ln .c=k/ D d ln .c=w/ C d ln .w/                     d ln .k/ :

Thus, the system (A10)-(A11) can be rewritten as


(A12)      1=   ek    1C             d ln .e=w/         .1=      ek     1/ d ln .k/

                                                                                 D      .1=   ck        1/ d ln .w/ :

The budget constraint (30) can be used to write

                                     c=w                                e=w
(A14)                  d ln .k/ D         d ln .c=w/                        d ln .e=w/ :

Subsituting equation (A14) into the system (A12)-(A13) leads to the following formulation:

Let 1 denote the discriminant of this system. The second-order conditions of the optimization

The optimization problem then becomes equivalent to maxe H .gw Q .e//                ln .e C w/, with
the following first-order condition:

(A18)                          .gw/1       Q .e/   Q 1 .e/ D             :
                                                               eC w

Write this first-order condition as A .e; g/ B .e/ D 0, and note that the second-order condition
for a maximum implies A1 .e; g/ B1 .e/ < 0: Implicitly differentiating with respect to e and g
yields
                                    de           A2 .e; g/
                                        D                    ;
                                    dg      A1 .e; g/ B1 .e/
where A2 .e; g/ D .1        /g     w1 Q .e/ Q 1 .e/. Thus, the sign of de=dg, and hence
d Q.e/=dg D Q 1 .e/ de=dg, is the same as the sign of A2 .e; g/. The result for fertility follows
from the observation that k is decreasing in e, as indicated by equation (A17).

                                    A10.    Measures of Fertility
  There are many measures of fertility. To review them, define ki;t as the average number of
children born to a woman of age i during year t:

                                   Number of births to women of age i
                          ki;t D                                      :
                                      Number of women of age i
                                                                                 f
This is a first measure known as the Age-Specific Fertility Rate. Let pi;t denote the denominator
                                                                                          m denote
of this ratio, that is, the total number of women of age i during year t: Similarly, let pi:t
the total number of men. Another measure of fertility is the Crude Birth Rate
                                                       X          f
                                                            k p
                                                           i i;t i;t
                            Crude Birth Ratet D X                            ;
                                                             f       m
                                                       i
                                                           pi;t C pi;t

which is simply the number of birth per population during a particular period of time. A third
measure, the General Fertility Rate, reports births per women in their child-bearing period during
a particular time:
                                                        X49           f
                                                               k p
                                                          iD15 i;t i;t
                           General Fertility Ratet D X49                :
                                                                   f
                                                            iD15
                                                                 pi;t
FAMILY ECONOMICS WRIT LARGE                                                                     77


These are measures of contemporaneous fertility. Two additional measures deal with lifetime
fertility. The Total Fertility Rate measures the number of children a woman would have over the
course of her fertile life if she experienced the current Age-Specific Fertility Rates throughout
her life. For women 15 years of age at date t, the Total Fertility Rate is
                                                          X49
                                Total Fertility Ratet D        k :
                                                           iD15 i;t

Note, again, that the total fertility rate at time t is built from the Age-Specific Fertility Rate
observed at time t. A 15-year-old woman at time t may not experience at age 16—that is,
at date t C 1—the same Age-Specific Fertility Rate that a 16-year-old experiences at time t.
That is, kiC1;tC1 may differ from ki;t . Thus, the Total Fertility Rate measures the fertility of
an “imaginary” woman who would experience throughout the rest of her life the current Age-
Specific Fertility Rates of each age group. The Total Fertility Rate is useful to build projections
about the lifetime fertility of a young cohort, assuming that Age-Specific Fertility Rates will
remain constant. For women past their childbearing years, it is possible to construct a final
measure, the Completed Fertility Rate for a woman born at date t:
                                                           X49
                            Completed Fertility Ratet D             k
                                                                iD15 i;tCi:

This is a measure of realized lifetime fertility.
