Learning Capitalism the Hard Way--Evidence from German Reunification

                                            ABSTRACT

We develop a model of firm learning in volatile markets with noisy signals and test its predictions
using historical data from the Ifo Institute's Business Climate Survey. We find that firms' forecasts
improve as they age. We also exploit German Reunification as a natural experiment where firms in
the East are treated with ignorance about the distribution of market states. As theoretically predicted,
Eastern firms make larger forecast errors than Western ones, but this gap gradually closes over the
decade following Reunification. The slow convergence rate stems from differences in expectations
rather than market conditions. We also find evidence for the model's predictions that improvements
from learning are faster where market signals are noisier.

1. Introduction

Since firms’ decisions depend on their expectations of the future market state, how expectations
form is central to macroeconomics and its dynamic models—market actors’ aggregate decisions
today determine tomorrow’s economic state. For most of the last century a rich theoretical
literature debated the relative merits of adaptive expectations, in which firms’ backward looking
predictions do not reliably lead to equilibrium prices, versus rational expectations, in which
firms, on average, expect the true future market state. The latter model implies equilibrium
but requires that market actors understand the economy better than economists themselves. To
explain where such sophisticated rational expectations come from, theorists developed models
in which firms learn them. Empirically though, whether firms learn to forecast the market or
not remains open.
     We show that they do. Older firms make lower forecast errors, even including firm fixed effects
to rule out survivor bias as the primary explanation. But, as with individuals, firm age correlates
with many (unobservable) things besides experience that could affect forecast quality—new
firms are smaller, their employees tend to be younger, their markets tend to be newer and so
on. To overcome this identification problem, an ideal experiment would exogenously place a
cross-section of firms into a new market environment alongside otherwise similar counterparts
that are very experienced in the market and compare their forecasts of subsequently shared
market conditions.
     German Reunification was such an event.1 Figure 1 plots forecast error magnitudes by West-
ern firms since 1980 and Eastern ones after Reunification. Initially, Eastern firms made much
larger forecast errors than those in the West. Over time forecast errors in the East decrease and
converge to Western levels. Our controlled regressions confirm the coarse implications of Figure
1 and, in so doing, empirically support a seminal, theoretical advance in macroeconomics—firms
learn to forecast market conditions.
     However, our empirical findings come with a practical caution—this real world convergence
took a decade, despite the fact that market conditions themselves homogenized very quickly.
We live in a period of geopolitical upheaval unseen since the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the
Reunification of Germany. The lessons of this switch to democracy and capitalism may help set
the correct expectations for the hypothetical Reunification of other countries like Korea or the
political revolutions sweeping the Middle East, the accession of Turkey or departure of Britain
from the EU—learning capitalism or a new market may take much longer than building its

      July 1st of that year.

formal institutions.
  To structure our analysis we introduce a formal model of (Bayesian) firm learning. In the
model, the market state is drawn from a distribution whose parameters are initially unknown.
Over time firms learn the model parameters. The model distinguishes between three types of
market variance: (1) market volatility, (2) noise about signals of the future state, and (3) the
imprecision in firms’ subjective probability distribution of market states. We further show how
these unobservable, fundamental components can be extracted from observable, agglomerated
measures of uncertainty, like historical variance in firm-level states of business and forecast
disagreement between industry peers. We use the model to make empirical predictions about
the error magnitudes and learning as a function of these market features.
  The scarcity of data across a broad cross-section of firms has generally hampered analyses
of forecasting at the firm level. However, we use a unique micro data set compiled by the Ifo
Institute to test our theoretical predictions. Every month since 1949 the Ifo Institute’s Business
Climate Survey has collected the near term expectations and assessment of the current state of
business from a large cross section of German manufacturing establishments.
  Our study, although one of the first to examine market forecasting and learning at the firm




                                                                       2
level empirically, is not without limitations. Since the primary purpose of the Ifo survey is to
provide leading indicators of macro market health, large, established firms are oversampled, and
thus our estimates of learning over firm age may not adequately capture effects in the critical
infancy stage. Furthermore, although we measure the learning of Eastern firms that live through
Reunification, the mechanisms remain somewhat obscure. Given that our natural experiment
shocked not just Eastern firms, but the individuals and non-firm institutions of East Germany
quite radically, we cannot disentangle firm level learning from societal.2
     This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 develops
our formal model. Section 4 introduces our data. Section 5 and 6 present the empirical analysis,
and section 7 concludes.


2. Literature

In the macroeconomic literature, the theoretical question of how firms forecast future prices
extends from at least Nerlove (1958)’s model of adaptive expectations, where firms simply ex-
pect next period’s prices to be a weighted history of past prices, and set production quantity
accordingly. Since adaptive expectations do not always converge to equilibrium, in the sense
that average economic predictions may systematically differ from outcomes, Muth (1961) pro-
posed the theory of rational expectations, under which firms’ forecast errors are independently
and identically distributed with zero mean in each period. In other words, no firm is system-
atically wrong. Although, rational expectations consistently lead to equilibria, the theory does
not set out a process by which economic agents, who initially might be biased, arrive at them.
Turnovsky (1969) and Cyert and DeGroot (1974) proposed a process where initially agents’
subjective probability distribution differed from the objective distribution and agents updated
their beliefs following Bayes’ rule, eventually converging to rational expectations. Vives (1993)
showed, though, that this convergence is theoretically quite slow, a significant problem for
equilibrium if the underlying data generating process evolves. Related theoretical research in
industrial organization showed firms converge to equilibria via learning when strategic inter-
action matters (see Fudenberg and Levine (1998) for a review of learning in strategic games).
Our model builds upon this rich learning framework—firms’ initial, (incorrect) subjective prob-
ability distributions of markets states gradually converge to the (true) objective distribution
via Bayesian updating. Following the macro tradition, we consider firms to be so small that
strategic interaction plays no role. Our theoretical focus is on generating empirical predictions

      Heineck and Süssmuth, 2010; Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln, 2007).

about the relationship between forecast quality and several distinct types of market uncertainty,
together with convergence of firm beliefs to steady state.
     Empirical examinations of the firm-level expectation formation process are rare. In one excep-
tion, Nerlove (1983) empirically tests the expectations formation process using Ifo’s Business
Climate data for the period 1977/78 (an earlier subset of our data) and comparable French
data. He finds that a simple error-correction model, though being “devoid of economic content”
explains observed expectations “surprisingly well” (p. 1267). He proposed calculating forecast
errors similar to ours, but due to computational limitations of the era, computes associations
based on 2-way contingency tables for expectations and realizations instead. Bachmann and
Elstner (2015) use the Ifo’s Business Climate Survey data to investigate the impact of expecta-
tion biases on aggregate welfare. Despite the wide ranging theoretical literature on learning in
expectation formation, empirical evidence is limited to a recent working paper by Doraszelski
et al. (2014).3 They show that after the liberalization of the previously regulated market for
(electric power) frequency response in the UK, competing electricity suppliers’ prices converged
to the Nash equilibrium over three years. Ours is, as far as we know, the first multi-industry ex-
amination of firm-level forecasting using controlled regressions, and thus the first to disentangle
the role of market features in learning.


3. Theoretical Models

To structure our thinking we present stylized models of our data generating process under (1)
pure rational expectations and (2) learning. The two models are identical, except that in the
learning model, firms do not know one of the distributional parameters of the data generating
process—they learn it over time. These simple models, like the classical models of learning
in rational expectations developed by Townsend (1978) and Feldman (1987) and extended by
many others, (unrealistically) treat states as serially independent, and assume (improbably)
that firms know the distributional family of the underlying data generating processes. More
generally, these models should not be taken as trying to capture the complexities of the true
forecasting procedure that firms execute in predicting their future business conditions, but
rather to parsimoniously focus on the intuitive difference between pure rational expectations
and learning models under markets exhibiting various types of uncertainty.
     At the beginning of period t, nature draws two hidden states relevant for firm i’s change in

     A literature on professional forecasters examines biases due to career concerns and sponsoring institutions (e.g.
      Cho and Hersch, 1998), as well as individual-level correlates of forecasting ability (e.g. Kim et al., 2011) but
      not learning.

simply the sum of these variables: Sit = Xit + Yt . The information available at the beginning
of period t includes all previous state realizations Ωit = {Xit−1 , . . . , Xi1 , Yt−1 , . . . , Y1 } and a
firm specific signal of the current market state Ŷit = Yt + εit , where noise εit is, for all firms,

key difference between the rational expectations model and the learning model is that in the
latter, firms do not know the value of µY ; they must learn it. Under the learning model, firm
i holds prior beliefs about the mean of the market state variable, but these beliefs are updated
over time. We assume the prior beliefs of firm i about µY are normally distributed with mean

  Then, the firm makes a prediction about its state of business equal to the sum of conditional
forecasts about its idiosyncratic and market states.

  At the end of period t the realized state variables are revealed, and a directional forecast error
Sit − S̄it is computed. A positive value indicates that the firm was pessimistic—it predicted a
worse change in business state than actually occurred. A negative value indicates that the firm
was optimistic—it predicted a better change in state of business than actually occurred. We
are interested in the expected magnitude of this error or so-called mean squared error

3.1. Rational Expectations

When the distribution parameters of Yt are known, history Ωit is irrelevant to making predictions
about the future, but current market signals Ŷit are quite useful. It is well-known that the mean
and variance of correct (normally distributed) posterior beliefs over Yt are

Observe that these comparative statics converge precisely to those under rational expectations
as t → ∞. That is to say, our learning model, like many others before ours, converges to rational
expectations with experience.
     By taking the derivative of these statics with respect to time, we can also compute how
learning evolves with experience. (1) Learning slows over time, because the influence of each
new piece of information is smaller relative to the accumulated stock of knowledge:

The intuition for    dtdσε2
                            E        Sit − S̄it          < 0 is somewhat subtle. Early on, i.e. while a firm is
very uncertain about the learned parameter, it must rely heavily on the signal of the current
market state to forecast. Thus, early on, firms in industries with poor quality signals do very
poorly relative to those in industries with better signals. But, as time progresses, firms learn
the mean of the market state distribution, and thus, become less reliant on the signals alone.
Hence this learning is more important to firms in industries with noisy signals.

The sign of (9) turns on the square bracketed factor in the numerator, which depend on the
relative magnitude of market volatility σY2 and signal noise σε2 . However, in industries, which
are very volatile relative to the noisiness of their signals i.e. σY2 > σε2 , it is intuitive that
                                                                                         

learning will help less as the comparative static suggests. In such industries, firms must always
rely heavily on the market signal, even after the learned parameter is known with certainty.
Thus, learning is of limited value in such industries. This intuition is reflected in the complete
derivative.


3.3. Mapping to Data

Although we know of no other study using microdata to test whether and how firms learn to
forecast under uncertainty, several types of sample variance found in firm level forecast data
have been used to quantify the macro uncertainty facing markets or the economy generally. In
particular, others have used (1) longitudinal variation in realized states of business (e.g. Comin
and Mulani, 2006), and (2) contemporaneous variation in individual firm predictions about
the future state of business to characterize market uncertainty (Bachmann et al., 2013; Bloom,
2014). We will also take advantage of this variation to test the predictions of our learning model;
however, neither of these sample variances generically capture the independent variables of our
comparative statics: σY2 or σε2 .
  In our data, we observe every firm’s realized state of business Sit and associated forecast S̄it
in every period. We do not, though, directly observe market state Yt or each firm’s signal of




                                                               8
it Ŷit . Thus, we cannot directly observe σY2 or σε2 . However, we can observe quantities, which
under some additional structure asymptote to these unobservable parameters. In particular, we
assume industries are large enough that the average idiosyncratic firm state does not vary from
period to period. This is reasonable since, by definition, individual firm states are idiosyncratic
and independent from one another; with many firms, individual deviations from their individual
means wash out.
  First, we argue that under this assumption, the longitudinal sample variance of the realized
states of business volt is a sufficient statistic for volatility of the unobserved (by the econome-
trician) state of the market σY2 . We measure volt as follows:

                                                                   2

                            1X     1X         1X      1X
                     volt =            Six −             Sjτ 
                            T x=t n i=1       T τ =t n j=1
                                                                           2
                               T     n           T      n
                            1X     1X         1X      1X
                          =            Six −             (Xjτ + Yτ )
                            T x=t n i=1       T τ =t n j=1
                               T                     T
                                                                            !2
                            1X                    1X
                          =       E [Xix ] + Yx −        (E [Xiτ ] + Yτ )
                            T x=t                 T τ =t

Assuming n is large, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), E [Xit ] → µX . Hence,

                                         T          T
                                                              !2
                                      1X         1X
                               volt =       Yx −        Yτ         = σY2
                                      T x=t      T τ =t

  Notice that the second form of variation used in the literature, namely disagreement in predic-
tions, is really an agglomeration of at least three distinct sources of uncertainty: (1) market state
volatility σY2 , (2) signal noise σε2 , and (3) imprecision of beliefs about the learned parameter σiY
                                                                                                    2 .
                                                                                                       t

For example, two firms may receive identical signals in terms of both content and noise, but
they may incorporate them very differently in their forecast depending on the relative volatility
of their respective markets (or the confidence they have in their market understanding)—a firm
in a volatile market (or an inexperienced one) will weight its forecast toward the information in
the signal since its priors are less informative. Thus, although disagreement, dist , may indeed
be a generic measure of uncertainty, suitable in some empirical settings, it is too coarse for the
more precise forecasting model and associated comparative statics we have described above.
  We can extract σε2 for each industry from our observed measure of disagreement dist , using
volt and some assumptions. We measure disagreement, or the variance in firms’ predictions of

Notice that the relative weight a firm puts on its priors about the firm state relative to the
weight the firm puts on its signal depends not just on the volatility of the market state σY2
relative to the noisiness of the signal σε2 , but also on how sure the firm is that its estimate of
                                  2 . Since the imprecision of beliefs should only influence the
the learned parameter is correct σiY t

predictions of Eastern firms we measure industry level disagreement (and signal noise) using
Western firms only, who are confident in their understanding of the model. Hence, we take

market signal noise from the volatility of reported firm business conditions and the disagreement
in their predictions about future business conditions. These computed measures are used as
independent variables in our empirical tests.


4. Data

4.1. Forecast Errors

No doubt, the paucity of panel data about what firms think of future market conditions has
hampered empirical studies of firm-level forecasting. We test our predictions using data from the
Ifo Institute’s Business Climate Survey, which, to our best knowledge, is the oldest survey on firm
level, market expectations and realizations in existence. Since the data was collected to provide
leading indicators for the German economy rather than academic research, its use presents
some addressable challenges. The Ifo Institute began surveying firms in the Federal Republic of
Germany in November 1949; firms from former East Germany were added beginning in 1991.
Our sample is monthly from 1980 to 2014 for West Germany and from 1992 to 2014 for former
East Germany. We drop 1991 observations for the East, because administrative difficulties
render these earliest Eastern observations unreliable. The data is collected at the product level.
Initially, in 1980, we have more than 4000 products in the cross-section. By the end, in 2014,
about 2500 products remain in our sample.6 Our sample includes only manufacturing firms.
Following Nerlove (1983, footnote 15) we treat product-level observations as independent; there
are very few multi-product firms. The panel is unbalanced: firms enter, exit, and occasionally
do not respond to the survey. Table 1 provides summary statistics for our variables by region.
     Like most surveys of this kind, the responses are granular, in our case trichotomous (i.e. ‘+’,

     For comparison, the Business Outlook Survey of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia surveys about 100
      to 125 large manufacturing firms every month.




                                                                   11
‘=’ or ‘-’). But since the response categories are ordered, we can compare forecasts and realiza-
tions to construct forecast errors. However, a mismatch between time horizons for expectations
and realizations, as well as the fact that expectations are cast as changes but realizations are
in levels complicates the forecast error calculation. We now describe our calculation of forecast
errors over the state of business (Geschäftslage).
  The survey question regarding the realization of the current state of business reads:

        Current situation: We assess our business state for product X to be (a) good, (b)
     satisfactory, or (c) bad.

And the question about the expectation reads:

        Expectations for the next six months: Our business state for product X will be (a)
     better, (b) about the same, or (c) worse.

Taking the answer to the former question as the current business state St ∈ {l = −1, m = 0, h = +1},
the answer to the latter question as the prediction of future state of business, expressed as a
change from the current state, ∆t ∈ {“ − ”, “ = ”, “ + ”}, and the average states of business over

error measure using the following parameterizable formula:

We assume the following parameter restrictions: for all S, −1 ≤ LS ≤ H S ≤ 1, H m = −Lm
and H h = −Ll . Thus, a complete parameterization is defined by H h , H m and H l .
  The following intuition lies behind the formula. Relative to each current state of business, the
space of average future realizations is divided into three sequential intervals, which correspond
to the prediction possibilities: better, the same and worse. The span of these intervals varies
depending on the current state. For example, if the current state is h then reaching a better state



                                                     12
requires surpassing a much higher threshold than if the current state is l. Then the formula
computes 0 error if the predicted change ∆ matches the interval into which average future
realizations fall, a +1 error if the predicted change matches the interval one below the one in
which average future realizations fall, a +2 error if the predicted change matches the interval
two below the one in which average future realizations fall, and analogously for negative errors.
This means that a firm in a h state, predicting neutral (“=”) change, will make a +1 error if
                                                 h      i
average future realizations falls in the interval H h , 1 , say if all future realizations were h. One
could argue that this is not an error since we do not really know if observing the next six future
states in a row as h really means that the firm’s state of business improved—it was, after all, h
to begin with. To rule this out as an error one would set H h = 1. On the other hand, reporting
the next six states of business as h is unusual even for a firm currently reporting an h state of
business and could reasonably be interpreted as an improvement in business state. By setting
H h and H l to more moderate levels, one could, in theory, capture some of this information. In
our main specifications we use the following parameterization: H h = 32 , H m =       1
                                                                                      3   and H l = 0.
However, in the appendix we show that our results are robust to a number of parameter choices.
  Could low forecast errors be an artifact of firms reporting neutral expectations and neutral
realizations, simply as a lazy default for the survey respondent? About 57 percent of firm
expectations are neutral. Reporting a neutral expectation is not completely random. Estimates
from a probability model show that older firms, larger firms, and firms that have responded
frequently before are more likely to give a neutral expectation. Firms that self-report being
constrained and firms in markets with higher import penetration are less likely to give a neutral
response, as are those in more volatile markets and firms facing higher signal noise. There is no
statistically significant difference between East and West or exporters and non-exporters with
respect to forecasting neutral changes. Table 5 in the appendix gives the regression results. We
further show that our results are robust to excluding observations in which firms report neutral
expectations.


4.2. Market Attributes

We characterize the market by its current state, its volatility, its signal noise and import pene-
tration. First, we proxy for the current market state as the industry-period average response on
the survey question about the current state of business (Geschäftslage) as described in Section
3.3. Although individual firms report the state of business as good, satisfactory, or bad our
computed market state variable is continuous. We define industries at the two-digit level (using
the German WZ 2008 classification).




                                                 13
     Volatility describes that variance in market states. Ideally, we would measure current volatil-
ity (σY2 ) over the distribution of all possible states that the market can assume. But, of course,
in a cross-section only the realized market state is observed and not the distribution. Therefore,
we proxy for volatility as the time series variance of the first differences of the average state
of business for rolling, forward looking, 4 year windows.7 Making the window forward-looking
permits a volatility measure (vol) in the East immediately after Reunification, but it means
we have to truncate our sample at 2013, which is of little consequence, since the regions have
converged by then.
     Market signal noise (σε2 ) is calculated from market volatility (σY2 ) and disagreement (dis)
using our theoretical structure as described in Section 3.3. Disagreement is the industry-level
variance over firm-level forecasts for the state of business.
     Import penetration is given by the logarithm of the ratio of imports over production at the
industry level. The data is available in OECD’s STAN database of industrial production from
1990 only. As shown in Table 1 import penetration is lower in the West.

     The windows are necessarily shorter for the last four years of the sample. The results do not qualitatively
      change when dropping the four final years completely.

4.3. Firm attributes

Eastern industries were broadly restructured when the market economy was introduced. The
communist East had neither private property nor capitalist markets. Production units were
part of large Kombinate that replaced market transactions by bureaucracy. As we see in Table
1 firms in the East are smaller, despite having been much more integrated before Reunification.
In the West the average firm has about 480 employees but in the East only about 170 (though
as Figure 2 shows this size difference stems mostly from a few very large Western firms). For
the whole sample, the size distribution is skewed; about 75 percent of firms have less than
290 production employees. Eastern firms, on average, are only half as old as Western firms
(possibly due to a measurement problem for age as discussed below). East German firms,
though relatively well endowed compared to firms in other communist countries, had outdated
capital equipment and despite a high level of formal education, employee skills did not suit a
modern market economy and its division of labor (Fritsch and Mallok, 1998).
     Firms report whether they are (capital or labor) “constrained”. On average 47 percent of
firms in the East report being constrained, but only about 35 percent of Western firms do.
Since this question is asked only quarterly, except for the East in the years 1991 to 2000 where
it appeared monthly, we assume the constraint or lack thereof lasts the entire quarter. Previous
studies report that at Reunification the physical productivity of Eastern plants was at most 50
percent of the productivity of comparable Western manufacturing plants (Fritsch and Mallok,
1998). However, by the time our Eastern sample starts in 1992 the lowest productivity plants
had already exited and most other plants had been privatized. About 77 percent of Western
firms export, while only 58 percent of Eastern firms do.
     Level differences in the productivity of firms, whether between East and West or simply across
the street, should not obviously lead to differences in forecasts, since these idiosyncratic firm
capabilities are well-known within each firm making their own forecasts.


4.3.1. Firm Age

In our theory firms learn with experience. A natural proxy for experience is age, but our age
data has several shortcomings. In the West, the median firm age is 56 years and the median age
of first time respondents is 41 years, older than one would expect to find in a random sample
of firms. There are at least two plausible explanations for this deviation. First, because we
collected the foundation date more recently than the business state/forecast information, it is
likely biased by survivorship.8 Second, given the survey’s purpose, it may over sample mature

     We obtain the age variable from a recent search of the Amadeus database and a recent Ifo survey.

firms.
      In the East, our firm age data has an additional problem. A disproportionate number report
foundation coincident with Reunification, which is likely an artifact of privatization and does
not reflect the maturity of the firm, its employees or business. This view is supported by
the fact that although the age distributions between Eastern firms and Western firms differ
significantly immediately following Reunification in 1992, there is little difference in the firm
size distributions between the two regions (see Figure 2). In the East there is a spike in the
number of new firms in 1992.


5. Empirical Analysis

Our theoretical model assumes that (some) firms do not completely understand the process,
which generates future states of business, but it is agnostic about why—learning proceeds in
the same way, regardless of the cause of the imperfection in understanding. In this section,
we empirically test the generic theory under two different ignorance treatments. The first
treatment is youth: young firms have less experience than old ones. The second treatment
abruptly introduces firms operating in a master-planned economy to a free market—learning
to read demand from market signals instead of from state orders takes time. We discuss the
results from these empirical tests in the next two subsections respectively.


5.1. Learning with firm age

We estimate the following generic empirical model, which captures not only the effects of age
(experience), market volatility and signal noise, but the potential effects of firm size, exporter

where the forecast ability is measured by the forecast error magnitude (ErrMag). The dependent
variable is a cubic function of the firm’s age (Age) in (10). Next, we control for signal noise
(SigNoise) and market volatility (MktVol) to separate forecast ability from the observed forecast
error in (11). We include firm, αi and calendar month (or month-year) δm fixed effects. Lastly,
we control for firm attributes: size of the firm (Empl) as measured by the log of production
employees, an indicator for whether the firm exports (Exp), an indicator for whether the firm
self-reports being constrained (FrmState), and industry competitiveness as measured by import
penetration (ImpPen) in (12). The sample is Western firms only, the estimator is OLS, and
errors are clustered at the firm level.
  Table 2 gives the results. Column (1) concentrates on firm age as an explanatory variable
for forecast ability, using (10) and (11). Older firms make lower forecast errors; firms learn as
they age. On average, a firm reduces its forecast error by about 9 percent when it is 10 years
older. Admittedly, we lack a representative sample of firm ages. In particular, our founding date
reflects a sample bias: firm founding dates were collected from recent Amadeus databases. Thus,
failed firms, being dropped from the Amadeus data, disproportionately lack founding dates in
our sample. Hence, although firm fixed effects ensure that the observed learning does not merely
result from the fact that innately better forecasters survived, the estimates of learning are for
this rather select subsample, not the population of firms overall. Furthermore, the fact that
firms are undersampled in their youth, may, at least partially, explain why the higher order age
coefficients are insignificant—the bulk of our variation occurs for mature firms, after learning
rates have settled. As predicted by the theory, both signal noise and market volatility are
positively related to larger errors, in all models.
  Column (2) estimates the effect of firm level attributes besides age, (11) and (12), because age
introduces sample bias as discussed above. Larger firms make larger errors. Exporters’ forecast
errors do not differ significantly from non-exporters’. Firms reporting “constrained” production
make much larger errors. Although a number of ex post rationalizations are possible, it is
not obvious why a factor that the firm is fully aware of, such as self-reported constraints on its

production, should necessarily impair forecasting. Firms in industries where import penetration
is higher make larger forecast errors but the effect is not statistically significant at the 5 percent
level. One might expect import penetration, as a proxy for competitiveness, to increase the
incentives to forecast well, but import penetration also proxies for the trade openness of an
industry. The positive coefficient suggests that forecasting in open industries is harder.
  Column (3) combines all firm attributes, using (10)-(12). The results are similar.
  Although measuring firms’ learning by examining how forecast quality evolves over their
lifespans is intuitive, and we do indeed find evidence that firms learn as they age, detecting
more subtle evidence for the other predictions of our theory is limited by our data quality. For
example, (omitted) regressions including the second-order effects of age—interactions MktVol×
Age and SigNoise × Age—yields no significant results. This may be due to the oversampling of
older firms whose understanding of the market has largely settled before they enter our sample.
Furthermore, firm age may correlate with unobserved firm or market attributes affecting forecast
quality. For example, in addition to new firms being smaller (for which we can control), their
employees also tend to be younger and have different human capital, and their markets tend to
be newer and utilize different technologies. Therefore, in the next section, we look for evidence
of firm-level learning after a diverse subsample of firms receive a systemic to shock to their
understanding of the market.


5.2. Introduction to the free-market

Relatively homogeneous Germany was abruptly divided in 1949, and for four decades firms in
East Germany operated under a masterplanned, communist economy. For these firms of all sizes,
maturities, and across the spectrum of industries, market states were dictated, not predicted.
Then suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, with German Reunification in 1990, these firms were
thrust into the free market economy of the West. Uniquely among transition countries, East
Germany immediately received developed country institutions (e.g. legal system, property
rights, social welfare) as well as full global market access (Dornbusch et al., 1992). Nevertheless,
Eastern managers recognized a deficiency in their understanding of market economies. In 1991
West German firms hosted East German managers as interns. About 70 percent of these
interns self-reported having a poor knowledge of market economics; more than 85 percent of
their Western hosts shared that assessment (Icks, 1992).
  German Reunification offers a natural ignorance shock to East German firms’ understanding
of the market. However, there is a worry that Reunification left Eastern firms not only with
different understandings of the market, but different market conditions altogether, than Western




                                                 20
ones. Here we provide evidence that changes in market states did not differ fundamentally
between East and West. Differences in forecast errors stem from differences in expectations not
realizations.
     First, previous research suggests that after Reunification Eastern firms did not sell into dif-
ferent markets. Hitchens et al. (1993, p. 34) show that Eastern firms reoriented their exports
from planned to market economies. The reason is twofold. First, demand in transition coun-
tries generally collapsed. Second, suddenly these countries had to pay for their imports from
former East Germany in Deutschmarks, which they could not afford. The authors show that
just before and after Reunification just under 60 percent of Eastern firms’ sales were domestic.
Sales to former West Germany roughly doubled, while sales to eastern Europe and the former
USSR roughly halved in 1991.9
     Second, our data also indicates that the market states did not differ substantially between
the two regions. Figure 3 plots the time series for the Pearson correlation coefficients between
Eastern and Western aggregate realizations and expectations respectively (using 7 year rolling
windows). The correlation between Eastern and Western aggregate realizations rises rapidly
above 0.9 almost immediately after Reunification and increases only slightly thereafter. Cor-
relations between aggregate expectations reach similar strength only after 1997. This suggests
that markets between regions homogenized, and the convergence in forecast errors, which we
find in our subsequent regressions, does not come from alignment of actual market conditions
but rather expectations, which took longer to converge.

     This result is based on a survey of 32 firms in the East and 34 firms in the West in 1991. The firms are from
      the engineering, furniture, clothing, food, and misc. industry categories.

The dependent variable is the firm level forecast error magnitude. The first line (13) contains the
level effect of East and the first order effects of market volatility (MktVol) and the signal noise
(SigNoise). Our theory predicts that the average firm in the East makes larger forecast errors




                                                                                22
than in the West (β1 > 0), as do firms in volatile markets (β2 > 0) and those with noisy signals
(β3 > 0). We also control for industry (αj ) and calendar month (δm ) fixed effects. The period
fixed effects control for common temporal shocks in East and West. That is, identification is
in the cross-section within industries and months. The second line (14) includes learning in
the East independent of other covariates. Given higher forecast errors in the East initially this
implies φ1 < 0, φ2 > 0, and φ3 < 0. Convergence between East and West is modeled using
a cubic trend which captures the common experience of firms in the East after Reunification.
We do not include a time trend for the West as the theory predicts no significant change in
Western errors over time (our empirical counterfactual). Also, we include common period fixed
effects δm , which would be collinear with a trend for the West. (15) has learning in the East
over market volatility. The theory includes the δn s but makes no unambiguous prediction for
their signs. Learning over signal noise is captured in (16). Our theory predicts convergence
over signal noise: ρ1 < 0, ρ2 > 0, and ρ3 < 0. Learning reduces errors faster when signal
noise is high. Finally, (17) contains controls: an indicator if the firm self-reports production
constrains (FrmState), firm size (Empl), an indicator for whether the firm exports (Exp), import
penetration (ImpPen), the firm’s age (Age) and age squared (SqAge). As discussed above the
inclusion of these control variables (especially age) may introduce sampling bias. And in any
case reduces the sample size substantially. Therefore in our preferred specification we replace
(17) with a single variable: the square of the actual ex post realization of business state reported
by the firm. This variable isolates the effects of the firm’s predictions while controlling for any
idiosyncratic firm shocks.
  The monthly trend variable is divided by 12 and normalized to 1992 = 0 to facilitate the
interpretation of the estimated coefficients below. The estimator is OLS. For all models, stan-
dard errors are clustered at the firm level. We estimate several variations of the generic model
in (13)-(17).
  Table 3 reports the results for the evolution of forecast errors after the East is treated with a
new market state generating process or, alternatively, ignorance. All models control for market
volatility and signal noise. As predicted, both increase forecast errors in all models (see eqns.
(5) and (6) for predictions). Column (1) estimates the effect of learning over time without
independently measuring the dynamic effects of market volatility and signal noise, using (13)-
(14). We find broad support for the predictions of the theory: Eastern firms, shocked with
market ignorance forecast worse. After Reunification East and West converge, at a diminishing
rate (see eqns. (4) and (7)). In Column (2) we estimate the complete learning model, consisting
of (13),(15), and (16). We omit (14) because it is nested. The theory’s prediction for market




                                                23
volatility’s role in the rate of learning is ambiguous (see (9)), and indeed we find no consistent
or significant pattern in the volatility-time-east interaction across all models. We find support
for the theory’s prediction that noise in firm level signals of the future market state positively
affects the learning rate (see eqn. (8)). Column (3) adds the controls specified in (17) but
results do not change qualitatively. In Column (4) we replace these controls in favor of the
actual ex post realization of business state reported by the firm. Column (4) is our preferred
model, which we use as a benchmark for several robustness tests in the next section.
  From the coefficients in Column (4) we estimate that it takes approximately 10 years before
forecast errors in East and West converge, i.e. cannot be distinguished at a 5 percent level.
Figure 4a plots the predicted differences between forecast errors and their 95 percent confidence
intervals for years after Reunification. Our theory predicts that if signals within an industry
are noisier, errors will initially be larger for inexperienced firms, but learning in such industries
reduces forecast errors faster. In our sample, we observe the noisiest signals in the machinery
sector. Figure 4b gives the convergence results for this subsample. The speed of convergence
(as measured by the slope of the solid lines) is roughly twice the manufacturing average.

6. Robustness

Table 4 contains the results of several robustness tests. Column (1) is the same model as
Column (4) in Table 3 for reference. Despite the inclusion of industry fixed effects there might
be relevant, unobserved firm heterogeneity, and learning could occur both within the firm and at
market level due to better survival rates for good forecasters. In Column (2) we replace industry
fixed effects by firm level fixed effects (dropping the time-invariant East indicator). The effects
for learning over noise are qualitatively similar but smaller as they might be correlated with
unobserved heterogeneity. Our estimates with fixed effects do not include any learning that may
be due to poorer forecasting firms exiting the market. Nevertheless, learning could be identified
by poor forecasters that exit shortly after Reunification. Therefore, in Column (3) we restrict
our sample in the East to firms that first answered the survey in 1992 and answered at least
once more after 1999, which eliminates 75 percent of Eastern firms. Since the West is in steady
state, we do not similarly restrict the Western sample. Quantitatively, the learning effects are
similar to the effects in Column (2), providing more evidence that learning is not primarily
driven by exit. Our theory describes changes in mean squared error, but to ensure that our
results are not an artifact of the magnification of large errors through squaring, in Column (4)
we estimate a model using absolute value instead, yielding the same qualitative results. Fourth,
since as we discussed above, non-neutral forecasts correlate with firm attributes, we restrict our
sample to non-neutral forecasts in Column (5) to confirm robustness to unknown biases related
to neutral forecasts. Qualitatively, the results are the same but all the effects are larger. Firms
in the East initially make larger errors and the learning rate is higher.

  The forecast error calculation in section 4 is only one of many possible definitions. Above we
tested the robustness of our results to the absolute value of error, rather than squared error. In
section B in the appendix we also investigate the robustness of our results to different definitions
of the forecast error itself as well as the use of a nonlinear probability model. The economic and
statistical significance of individual coefficient estimates are largely robust to these alternative
specifications. The estimated time for convergence between Eastern and Western error size
varies by less than a year in all specifications.


7. Conclusion

Macroeconomic theory hinges on market actors being able to predict future market character-
istics. For nearly forty years, learning has been offered as a theoretical justification for the
dominant paradigm to describe expectation formation: rational expectations. In this pattern,
we also introduced a formal model of Bayesian learning, in which firms learn the distribution
of market states, and thereby improve their forecasting ability. Unlike previous models, which
prove equilibrium attainment, ours focuses on how several distinct types of uncertainty influ-
ence the quality and rate of improvement in forecasts. This theory predicts that firm’s forecasts
improve with experience, but at an ever decreasing rate. The model predicts that both mar-
ket volatility and signal noise make forecasting more difficult but that firms in noisier markets
reduce their forecast errors faster.
  We find that the theory’s first-order predictions over experience, when firm age is used as a
proxy, are borne out in firm-level forecasting data. However due to the correlation of age to a
number of other unobserved firm features that could plausibly explain forecast error differences,
and due to peculiar limitations in our data, we also conduct an alternative evaluation of the
theory. By comparing firms in former East and West Germany that survived the Reunification
of Germany, we can test whether Eastern firms learn how to predict market states. They do.
When time from Reunification proxies for experience, we find empirical support for all of the
theory’s predictions. Of particular importance, forecast quality between Eastern and Western
firms converges...after a decade. Our evidence suggests that this delay is not due to slow
convergence of the markets themselves, as these align quickly but due to gradual improvement
in predictions by Eastern firms.
  Although the patterns we observe in the data are consistent with the theory, the mechanisms
by which firms learn remain opaque. Neither the theory nor our empirics can distinguish between
institutional learning and the learning of individual Eastern managers. Although we have ruled
out survival of the fittest at the firm level as primary driver of the observed improvements, we



                                                    29
cannot rule out that better forecasting managers (perhaps Western ones) displace worse ones
within firms.
     Finally, although we have shown that the magnitude of Eastern firms’ forecast errors converge
to those of their Western counterparts, we have not shown that those Western firms’ expecta-
tions are rational. In fact, a t-test rejects the null hypothesis that Western forecast errors over
our entire sample period have zero mean with greater than 99.9% confidence. They are system-
atically overoptimistic—they predict that the future state of business will be better than they
actually report that it is when the time comes.10 Although we know of no economic theory to
explain systematic biases in firms’ expectation formation, optimism bias has been consistently
documented in healthy individuals. The consequences of such potential biases are subjects for
future research.

     Bachmann and Elstner (2015) also show that a majority of German firms are over overoptimistic.

B. Different Error Definitions
In this section we test the robustness of our results to different definitions of the forecast errors.
First, we eliminate the distinction between small and large errors, that is we only differentiate
between error (1) or no error (0). The results are in Table 6. Given this binary error definition
we also investigate the robustness of our results to the use of a probit estimator. The coefficient
estimates are in Table 7. Second, we maintain the distinction between small and large errors
but change the parametrization as introduced in section 4. Recall that the specifications in the
main text use the following parameterization when calculating the errors: H h = 23 , H m = 31
and H l = 0. To test robustness to this parameterization we make the requirements to obtain an
error more or less stringent. We make it harder to obtain a (large) error by defining: H h = 34 ,
H m = 13 and H l = − 13 . Table 8 gives the estimation results. And we can make it easier by
defining: H h = 21 , H m = 14 and H l = 0. Table 9 gives the results. Across these robustness
tests the magnitude of the coefficient estimates naturally varies. For instance, when it is harder
(easier) to make large forecast errors the coefficient estimates for the level effects are lower
(higher). Importantly, the estimated convergence date between East and West does not vary by
more than by one year. Like in the main text we used the models from Columns (4) to predict
the forecast errors and plot the differences between East and West in Figure 5.
