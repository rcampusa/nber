Can Mutual Fund Managers Pick Stocks? Evidence from the Trades Prior to Earnings

JEL No. G2

                                       ABSTRACT
We test whether fund managers have stock-picking skill by comparing their holdings and trades

prior to earnings announcements with the returns realized at those events. This approach largely

avoids the joint-hypothesis problem with long-horizon studies of fund performance. Consistent with

skilled trading, we find that, on average, stocks that funds buy earn significantly higher returns at

subsequent earnings announcements than stocks that they sell. Funds display persistence in our event

return-based metrics, and those that do well tend to have a growth objective, large size, high

turnover, and use incentive fees to motivate managers.

I.      Introduction

        Can mutual fund managers pick stocks that earn abnormal returns? This question

has long interested financial economists due to its practical importance for investors and

the light it sheds on market efficiency. Despite the many and varied approaches taken to

address this question, a common difficulty emerges: defining risk-adjusted returns.

Portfolio performance must be adjusted for risk, and the proper adjustment is unknown.

This joint hypothesis problem, articulated by Fama (1970), clouds the interpretation of

most fund manager performance studies and has led to prolonged debate about whether

fund managers can pick stocks.1

        In this paper, we introduce a new methodology to measure stock-selection ability

based on returns around earnings announcements. The core idea is to associate skill with

the tendency to hold stocks that are about to enjoy high earnings announcement returns

and likewise to avoid stocks that are about to suffer low announcement returns.

        An advantage of this methodology is that it largely avoids the joint-hypothesis

problem. As Brown and Warner (1985) show, inference based on daily returns around

announcement dates is relatively insensitive to the risk adjustment model. We apply this

insight to performance evaluation. Just as stock returns around earnings announcements

are mostly abnormal, regardless of the risk adjustment, a mutual fund’s returns from

holding that stock are also mostly abnormal. A related advantage of this approach is that

it makes intensive use of the segment of returns data—returns around earnings

announcements—that contains the most concentrated information about a firm’s


1
  Long-horizon studies that discuss or center on the risk-adjustment issue, reaching varying conclusions,
include Lehman and Modest (1987), Elton, Gruber, Das, and Hlavka (1993), Grinblatt and Titman (1993),
Malkiel (1995), Ferson and Schadt (1996), Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1997), Carhart (1997),
Metrick (1999), Pastor and Stambaugh (2002), and Lynch, Wachter, and Boudry (2004), among others.



                                                    1
fundamentals and hence about a fund manager’s skill at fundamental analysis. As a

result, our “earnings announcement alpha” methodology allows for fairly sharp new tests

for information-based trading.2

        The data set merges mutual funds’ portfolio holdings with the respective returns

that each holding realized at its next quarterly earnings announcement. The portfolio

holdings are drawn from mandatory, periodic SEC filings which have been tabulated by

Thompson Financial. These data have been used by Grinblatt and Titman (1989) and

Wermers (1999), among others. For each fund-date-holding observation in these data, we

merge in the return that that stock earned in the 3-day window around its next earnings

announcement. The sample covers 1980 through 2002 and contains 6.3 million fund-

report date-holding observations with associated earnings announcement returns.

        We start our analysis by following the earnings announcement returns of fund

holdings, but the cleanest results involve fund trades. In particular, for each fund, we

track the subsequent earnings announcement returns of the stocks on which it increases

portfolio weight over the prior period and the stocks on which it decreases the portfolio

weight. Our main finding is that the average mutual fund shows stock-picking skill in the

sense that the subsequent earnings announcement returns on its weight-increasing stocks

is significantly higher than that of its weight-decreasing stocks. The difference is about

12 basis points over the three-day window around the quarterly announcement, or,

multiplying by four, about 47 “annualized” basis points. The contrast between buys that

initiate a fund’s position in a stock, and sells that close out a position, is even larger.

2
 Previous researchers, following investors other than individual mutual fund managers, have also made use
of trading prior to earnings announcements to detect information-based trading. For instance, Seasholes
(2000) examines trading by foreign investors in emerging markets; Ali, Durtschi, Lev, and Trombley
(2004) examine trading patterns of categories of institutional investors; Ke, Huddart, and Petroni (2003)
follow trading by corporate insiders; and Christophe, Ferri, and Angel (2004) follow short sellers.



                                                   2
       In addition to comparing the earnings announcement returns of stocks that funds

buy and sell against each other, we also benchmark buys and sells against announcement

returns earned by stocks of similar size, book-to-market, and past earnings announcement

return momentum (to control for the Bernard and Thomas (1989) positive autocorrelation

in announcement returns) in the same calendar quarter. This experiment indicates that the

average fund displays some skill in both its buying and selling behavior. That is, stocks

bought by the average fund earn significantly higher subsequent announcement returns

than matching stocks, while stocks sold earn lower returns.

       Besides finding that the average mutual fund displays some skill, we also find

significant differences in skill in the cross-section of funds. For instance, there is

evidence of persistence in the earnings announcement alphas. Also, funds that do better

are more likely to have a growth than income style, consistent with Daniel, Grinblatt,

Titman, and Wermers (1997) and other long-horizon studies. We also find that larger

funds, higher turnover funds, and those that use incentive fees show better performance

by our metrics. These results lend important support to earlier long-horizon studies,

including Grinblatt and Titman (1994) on turnover and Elton, Gruber, and Blake (2003)

on fees. In contrast to these papers, our methodology allows us to connect these

differences in performance to information-based trading.

       In summary, using an “earnings announcement alpha” methodology, we find new

evidence that mutual fund managers have some stock-picking skill. This approach,

because it uses only a subset of the total returns data and a particular, well-defined notion

of skill, may not be suited to measuring the total returns earned by fund managers, or to

addressing whether active mutual fund managers earn abnormal returns that are large




                                               3
enough to exceed the fees they charge. (However, we find no relationship between our

measures of skill and expense ratios.) In essence, our measures of skill are designed to

establish a lower bound on the abnormal performance attributable to stock-selection

ability. We suggest that they are a useful complement to traditional performance metrics.

           The paper proceeds as follows. Section II presents data. Section III presents

empirical results. Section IV summarizes and concludes.



II.        Data

A.         Data set construction

           The backbone of our data set is the mutual fund holdings data from Thomson

Financial (also known as CDA/Spectrum S12). Thomson’s main source is the portfolio

snapshot contained in the N-30D form each fund periodically files with the SEC. Prior to

1985, the SEC required each fund to report its portfolio quarterly, but starting in 1985 it

required only semiannual reports.3 The exact report dates are set by the fund as suits its

fiscal year, and a few funds voluntarily report more often than required. At a minimum,

the Thomson data give us semiannual snapshots of all equity holdings for essentially all

mutual funds. A sample fund-report date-holding observation is as follows: Fidelity

Magellan, as of March 31, 1992, held 190,000 shares of Apple Computer. Wermers

(1999) describes this data set in detail.

           We extract all fund holdings data whose report date falls between the second

quarter of 1980 and the third quarter of 2002. We then add “liquidating” observations,

which are essentially placeholders to capture recent selling activity, to represent instances


3
    In February 2004, the SEC decided to return to a quarterly reporting requirement.



                                                       4
where the fund appears to have sold all of its holdings in a stock for which it reported

positive holdings at the previous report date. For example, Magellan did not report a

holding of Apple stock in its June 30, 1992 report, so we construct an observation with a

holding of zero Apple for this report date.

         To these holdings data, we merge in earnings announcement dates from the

CRSP/Compustat merged industrial quarterly database. Specifically, for each fund-report

date-holding observation, we merge in the first earnings announcement date that follows

that holding’s report date. We drop observations for which we can find no earnings

announcement date within 90 days after the report date.

         Next we add the stock returns around each earnings announcement. From CRSP,

we merge in the raw cumulative stock returns for the [-1,+1] trading day interval around

each announcement. We define a market-adjusted event return MAR as the raw

announcement return minus the contemporaneous return on the CRSP value-weighted

market index. We also define a benchmark-adjusted event return BAR as the raw return

minus the average [-1, +1] earnings announcement return on stocks of similar book-to-

market, size, and momentum that also announced earnings in the same calendar quarter

as the holding in question. Other than the fact that (for reasons described below) we take

“momentum” here as momentum in terms of prior earnings announcement returns, not

overall return, our approach is similar to that in Daniel et al. (1997).4 We exclude fund-


4
  Specifically, we form the value-weighted average earnings announcement return for each of 125
benchmark portfolios (5x5x5 sorts on book-to-market, size, and earnings announcement return momentum)
each calendar quarter. Book-to-market is defined following Fama and French (1995). Market value of
equity is computed using the CRSP monthly file as the close times shares outstanding as of December of
the calendar year preceding the fiscal year data. The book-to-market ratio is then matched from fiscal years
ending in year (t-1) to earnings announcement returns starting in July of year (t) and from fiscal years
ending in (t-2) to earnings announcement returns in January through June of year (t). Size is matched from
June of calendar year (t) to returns starting in July of year (t) through June of year (t+1). Momentum is the
average return over the past four earnings announcements. The breakpoints on book-to-market and size are


                                                     5
report dates that do not have at least one benchmark-adjusted earnings announcement

return; our results are unchanged if we restrict attention to fund-report dates containing at

least 10 or at least 20 such returns.

         For a subset of the remaining observations, we can obtain fund characteristics

data. Russ Wermers and WRDS provided links between the Thomson holdings data and

the CRSP mutual fund database. Wermers (2000) describes how those links are made.

Then, from the CRSP mutual fund data, we take investment objective codes from

CDA/Wiesenberger and Standard & Poor’s, as well as total net assets, turnover, and

expense ratios.5 From Christopher Blake, we obtain data on incentive fees as studied in

Elton, Gruber, and Blake (2003). These data are originally from Lipper and cover through

1999. Fee structures are generally similar across the funds that use them, and of lower

power than hedge fund incentives, for example, so we simply study an indicator variable

for whether the fund has an incentive fee in place.

         Finally, we apply some screens to narrow in on the most appropriate data set.

Based on keywords in the name of the fund and on reported investment objectives, we

exclude funds that cannot be predominantly characterized as actively managed U.S.

equity funds, such as index funds, bond funds, international funds, and precious metals

funds. We exclude funds with less than $10 million in net asset value. Finally, we




based on the NYSE as reported on Ken French’s website. The benchmark portfolios include only stocks
with positive book equity that are ordinary common stocks (CRSP share codes 10 or 11). It is impractical to
do a 5x5x5x5 sort and thus control for overall return momentum, but we have tried switching the earnings
announcement momentum control with an overall momentum control and have obtained similar results.
5
  Turnover data for 1991 is missing in the CRSP database. Also, CRSP sometimes reports several classes of
shares for a given fund, corresponding to different fee structures for the same portfolio of stocks (e.g. A, B,
C, institutional, no-load). In these cases, we take the highest reported value for turnover across all classes to
use as the value for turnover, and the value-weighted average of expenses across all classes as the value for
the expense ratio.



                                                       6
exclude each fund’s first report date, as some of our analysis requires lagged portfolio

weights.



B.       Summary statistics

         Our final sample consists of 6.3 million fund-report date-holding observations

with associated earnings announcement returns, spread across 75,263 fund-report dates.

Table 1 shows summary statistics. The first column shows that the number of funds filing

with the SEC has increased dramatically over the sample period. Almost half of the

useable fund-report dates are in the last five years of the sample.

         The next three columns show the distribution of investment objectives for these

fund-report dates. A consistent and comprehensive set of investment objectives is not

available. CDA classifications are available from 1980 through 1992, but change

methodology in 1990. S&P provide a broader set of objectives, but start in 1992. Using

the CDA and S&P objectives, we define a fairly consistent classification into growth,

growth & income, and income styles. The remainder includes balanced, sector, total

return, and other categories of actively managed, primarily U.S. equity mutual funds.6

         The next five columns show fund holdings and trading activity. For the average

fund-report date we are able to identify and benchmark a total of 84.0 holdings. Fund

6
  From 1980 through 1989, the CDA investment objective is available for 76 percent of the sample fund-
report dates. 92 percent of the non-missing observations are categorized as growth (44 percent), maximum
capital gains (21 percent), growth and income (19 percent), and income (9 percent). In 1990 and 1991, the
CDA investment objective is available for 79 percent of the sample. We group the first two into growth
funds. 86 percent of the non-missing observations are categorized as maximum capital gains (14 percent),
long-term growth (38 percent), small capitalization growth (4 percent), growth and current income (23
percent), equity income (4 percent), and flexible income (3 percent). We group the first three categories
into growth funds, and the last two into income funds. The other significant classifications are balanced and
sector. From 1992 through 2002, the S&P investment objective is available for 73 percent of the sample. 76
percent of the nonmissing observations are categorized as aggressive growth (22 percent), long-term
growth (32 percent), growth and income (18 percent) and income (5 percent). We group the first two
categories into growth funds. The other significant classifications are balanced, sector, and total return.



                                                     7
portfolio breadth has increased steadily over time. On average, 51.7 holdings receive an

increase in weight in the portfolio over that in the prior report, of which 20.5 are new first

buys. 50.8 holdings receive a decrease in weight, on average, and 18.5 of these decrease

to zero weight. We also distinguish the performance of first buys and last sells with the

view that these are likely to arise from a deliberate trading decision. By contrast, generic

weight shifts can be caused by changes in overall fund size.7

         The last columns summarize fund characteristics. Fund size is computed from the

holdings data as the total market capitalization of the reported equity holdings for which

also we have earnings announcement returns data. Average size peaks at $84.1 million in

2000. Turnover is available for 71 percent of the sample. In that subsample, it averages

95.1 percent per year and increases by 37 percentage points over the sample period. The

expense ratio is available for 76 percent of the sample. It averages 1.25 percent per year

and increases by 45 basis points over the period. The last column shows the percentage of

funds that use incentive fees. In the average year for which we have data, 2.2 percent of

funds use fees. Elton et al. (2003) report that these funds account for around 10 percent of

all mutual fund assets. Because some of these characteristics display clear trends, we will

sort funds into quintiles within each reporting period when we examine the relationship

between characteristics and performance.




7
  Another natural way to define trading activity is to track changes in reported shares across report dates
(adjusting for splits). Not surprisingly, the results for this measure tend to be bracketed by those for generic
weight shifts and teminal/initiating trades, and so we therefore omit them for brevity.

III.     Results

A.       Earnings announcement alphas based on holdings

         Table 2 starts by summarizing the average performance of mutual fund holdings

around earnings announcements. The first column considers the raw return over the

three-day window around earnings announcement dates. We take the equal-weighted

average earnings announcement return for each fund-report date, annualize it

(multiplying by 4 quarters), average these across all fund-report dates within that year,

and, finally, average the yearly averages.8 That is, the average return of 1.08 at the

bottom of the first column is given by:

         Return = 4 ⋅ 231 ∑1980 N1 ∑i K1i   ∑∑
                              2002                 1
                                               j
                                                       r ,
                                                   −1 ij ,t
                                                                                                         (1)

where i indexes mutual funds from 1 to N, j indexes the holdings of mutual fund i from 1

to Ki, and t measures days around the earnings announcement of stock ij.

         This treats each annual average as a single data point in computing an overall

average and standard error at the bottom of the table. In the spirit of Fama and MacBeth

(1973), this approach gives equal weight to each time period, and is a conservative way

to control for the correlation in earnings announcement returns across observations in

each period. (Taking simple averages across the pooled data, which gives more weight to

the last five years of the sample, leads to similar inferences.) The standard deviation is of

the annual averages is 1.34. Combining this with the average return of 1.08 and the

sample size of 23 gives a t-statistic of 3.9.




8
  Because the sample starts in the second quarter of 1980 and ends in the third quarter of 2002, the average
return for 1980 is for the last three quarters while the average return for 2002 is the first three quarters.



                                                       9
        The second and third columns adjust the raw returns. The second column reports

market-adjusted returns (MAR), where we subtract the CRSP value-weighted market

return over the earnings announcement window. The average MAR of 0.52 is:

        MAR = 4 ⋅ 231 ∑1980 N1 ∑i K1i   ∑ ∑ (r                  − rm,t ) .
                          2002                   1
                                             j   −1    ij ,t                             (2)

The t-statistic is 3.5.

        More interestingly, the third column shows a benchmark-adjusted return (BAR),

where each holding is matched to one of 125 benchmark portfolios by quintiles of size,

book-to-market, and earnings announcement return momentum. The benchmark

portfolios contain the value-weighted, matched-firm average earnings announcement

return in that calendar quarter. The average BAR of 0.01 is then:

        BAR = 4 ⋅ 231 ∑1980 N1 ∑i K1i   ∑ (∑           r − ∑l wl ∑s = −1 rl , sl ,   )
                          2002                   1                           1
                                         j       t = −1 ij ,t
                                                                                         (3)
                                                                                 l




where l indexes the characteristics-matched firms within the quarter where t is equal to

zero, wl is the market value weight of stock l in the characteristics-matched portfolio, and

sl measures days around the earnings announcement of stock l within the matched

quarter. Note that in Eq. (3) the earnings announcement return and the benchmark do not

overlap exactly.

        BAR controls for the known predictive power of firm characteristics and prior

earnings announcement returns for future earnings announcement returns. In particular,

La Porta et al. (1997) find that high book-to-market firms and small firms tend to have

higher earnings announcement returns than low book-to-market firms and large firms,

and Bernard and Thomas (1989) find that earnings announcement returns are positively

autocorrelated. In allowing the benchmark return to vary from quarter to quarter, BAR

also controls for a “good earnings quarter for small value stocks,” for example, and thus


                                                      10
may more precisely pick up individual stock-selection skill. Of course, it would also be a

valuable skill for a manager to be able to predict abnormal returns at the style level, as

well as to recognize and exploit the positive autocorrelation in abnormal announcement

returns or characteristics reliably associated with such abnormal returns. For these

reasons, BAR seems likely to be a conservative measure and to understate stock-picking

skill.

         Table 2 shows that mutual funds earn, on an equal-weighted average basis, 1.08

percent per year from the twelve trading days surrounding their holdings’ earnings

announcements. This exceeds the corresponding market return 52 basis points, and so is

clearly an outsize average return compared to non-announcement days. The raw

annualized announcement return earned by the average fund manager is not significantly

larger than that earned on a portfolio of firms with matching characteristics and prior

earnings announcements, however: the average BAR is an insignificant 6 basis points.

The second set of columns show that similar conclusions obtain when holdings are value-

weighted in each fund-report date.

         To the extent that the BAR accurately measures the unexpected release of

information, then the average mutual fund, as measured by its holdings, does not appear

to possess stock-picking ability. This would be consistent with the message of Jensen

(1968), Carhart (1997), and many studies in between. Of course, the conclusion that no

mutual fund manager has skill is clearly premature. A subset of managers may have skill,

even if the average one does not. Alternatively, funds may hold many stocks for which

they once had good information but now retain because of transaction costs or a capital




                                             11
gains tax overhang, an effect which would reduce the power of our tests. We turn to these

possibilities next.

        As an aside, the high average MAR—indicating that while funds’ holdings earn

above-market returns around earnings announcements, so does the average stock—raises

a question of the extent to which even an event-study approach is able to fully resolve the

joint-hypothesis problem. There are two interpretations. At one extreme, the high average

MAR might be a general inefficiency, an irrational discount on earnings announcers. Put

another way, returns around earnings announcements are in fact idiosyncratic in this

interpretation, but there is a high return nonetheless. In this case, the BAR separates

novel stock-picking skill from known mispricings related to size, book-to-market, and

past momentum. At the other extreme, the high MAR reflects the realization of a rational

risk premium. Namely, the earnings announcement return is systematic and echoed in

aggregate returns across a class of stocks or the market as a whole. Then, BAR is best

seen as a control for risk, and to the extent that it is imperfect, at least some joint-

hypothesis problem inevitably remains.

        We lean toward the first interpretation. The results of Ball and Kothari (1991) and

Bernard and Thomas (1989) suggest that the returns around earnings announcements are

largely idiosyncratic.9 And, Fama (1991) notes that the use of earnings-announcement

returns, while inevitably imperfect, is perhaps the closest one can come to solving the

joint hypothesis problem. We will return to this issue in our analysis of fund trades.




9
 In particular, Ball and Kothari show that betas increase only slightly around earnings announcements,
while the positive autocorrelation in returns shown by Bernard and Thomas suggests that a risk premium is
unlikely to be a complete explanation for announcement effects.



                                                   12
B.       Fund characteristics and alphas based on holdings

         We next look for regularities in the distribution of earnings announcement alphas.

Under the null of no stock-picking skill, no patterns will be apparent. We first look at

performance persistence, which has been studied in long-horizon returns by Hendricks,

Patel, and Zeckhauser (1993), Brown and Goetzmann (1995), and subsequent authors. Do

the same funds that had high earnings announcement alphas in the past continue to have

them in the future?10

         Table 3 shows the results of tests for persistence. Following Hendricks et al.

(1993) and Carhart (1997), we sort stocks each year from 1983 to 2002 into quintiles

based on the average announcement return, or the average BAR alpha, that they earned

over their previous eight announcements. We then compare the subsequent annualized

announcement returns and BAR alphas of funds in the top quintile of prior performance

to those in the bottom quintile.

         The first four columns show the mean subsequent equal-weighted returns and

BAR alpha, where the sorting variable is previous equal-weighted returns and BAR,

respectively. There appears to be a significant measure of persistence in earnings

announcement alphas both in raw and benchmark-adjusted returns. When sorted by prior

equal-weighted BAR, the subsequent equal-weighted BAR rises monotonically. The

difference between the top and bottom quintiles is a significant 43 basis points per year.

The fact that persistence is present in BAR, i.e., even after adjustments are made for size,

book-to-market, and announcement return momentum, indicates that performance


10
  Our tests operate at the level of funds rather than managers. Because it is possible that a manager has
changed over the interval that we measure persistence, our tests may understate the true level of persistence
in manager returns. Studies that control for changes in fund management include Baks, Metrick, and
Wachter (2001), Baks (2004), and Ding and Wermers (2004).



                                                     13
persistence cannot be explained by persistence in characteristics-adjusted announcement

returns alone.11 Value-weighted results display a similar but weaker pattern. Perhaps it is

easier to pick future earnings winners among smaller stocks.

         Table 4 looks at how performance is correlated with other fund characteristics.

Panel A considers fund objective, including growth, growth and income, and income

styles. A clear pattern emerges. Growth funds earn higher earnings announcement returns

than growth and income funds, which in turn earn higher returns than income funds. The

same pattern is as strong, or stronger, in BAR alphas. Indeed, the BAR on the portfolio of

growth funds is positive, while the BAR on income and growth and income funds is

negative. One Wald test (W1 in the table) strongly rejects that the average return for each

category is equal to zero, and a second (labeled W2) strongly rejects that fund categories

are equal to each other. Finally, comparing each style to the equal-weighted average of

the other two reveals that income funds perform significantly worse than growth and

growth and income categories. Similarly, growth funds perform significantly better.

These results confirm those of long-horizon studies by Grinblatt and Titman (1989, 1993)

and Daniel et al. (1997), who also find the strongest evidence of stock-selection ability

among growth and aggressive growth funds.

         Panel B examines returns by fund size quintiles. There is some evidence that

performance around earnings announcements increases with fund size; specifically, the

smallest quintile does worse than any of the larger quintiles. In unreported results, we

find that the significance of this pattern is higher if one uses the number of holdings to




11
  This is where it is crucial to control for prior earnings announcements. In the absence of such a control,
the Bernard and Thomas (1989) effect could lead to a spurious persistence.



                                                     14
measure fund size. Interestingly, the pattern here is opposite to the results of the long-

horizon study by Chen, Hong, Huang, and Kubik (2003).

       So far, we have seen that funds with high earnings announcement alphas can be

identified from past performance, style, and, to some extent, size. One possibility is that

differential performance is associated with, or perhaps facilitated by, higher expenses.

Panel C shows that this is not the case. Expenses bear little relation to performance. In

contrast, there is strong evidence that high earnings announcement alphas are associated

with high turnover. Panel D shows that across all four performance measures, funds in

the highest turnover quintile have significantly higher performance.

       Finally, Panel E considers the effect of incentive fees. By all measures of earnings

announcement alpha, funds with incentive fees earn higher returns around earnings

announcements. The difference is statistically significant in three cases. This pattern

reinforces the long-horizon results of Elton, Gruber, and Blake (2003).



C.     Earnings announcement alphas based on trades

       We now make more powerful use of these data by examining fund trades. Since

trading involves transaction costs and perhaps the realization of capital gains, trading

may be a stronger signal than simply continuing to hold. Table 5 repeats the analysis

from Table 2 but computes announcement returns only for holdings whose portfolio

weight changed between the current and the previous report dates. The first three pairs of

columns show equal-weighted raw and benchmark-adjusted returns for holdings whose

weight increased or decreased. The second three pairs of columns focus only on first




                                             15
buys, i.e., when a fund moves from zero to a positive holding of the stock, and last sells,

i.e., when a fund liquidated the holding.

       Table 5 contains the main results of the paper. Stocks in which funds have

increased their weight earn a significant 20 annualized basis points more around the next

earnings announcement than stocks of similar characteristics and prior announcement

returns. Moreover, stocks in which funds have decreased their weight earn a significant

21 annual basis points less than matched stocks. Initiating buys and terminal sells reflect

even stronger information: first buys earn 34 basis points more than matching stocks,

while last sells earn 29 basis points less. Thus, the stocks that funds buy perform

considerably better at subsequent announcements than those they sell.

       This analysis also helps to address any residual joint-hypothesis problem that

affects our BAR alphas based on holdings. The raw returns are large for both buys and

sells, suggesting there is either a generic mispricing surrounding the revelation of

idiosyncratic earnings announcement news or a rational risk premium. However, it is

more difficult to explain why funds would systematically buy (sell) stocks with higher

(lower) levels of risk. Rather, Table 5 appears to provide a clean demonstration that the

average mutual fund displays some stock-picking skill in both its buys and its sells.

       Another interesting pattern is that the difference in total announcement returns

between buys and sells is approximately the same as the difference in BARs. The raw

returns also include the benefit from a general tendency to rebalance toward the

characteristics associated with better subsequent announcement returns. It seems that the

bulk of the total difference between buys and sells is due to picking winners and losers

within stocks of similar characteristics and past announcement returns.




                                             16
        Overall, these results offer more convincing evidence of skill, in suggesting that

even the average fund manager trades as if he has superior information about the

earnings prospects of firms. While a direct comparison is not appropriate, the gist of our

results contrasts with the oft-cited message from Jensen (1968) that the average fund

underperforms. More broadly, our results complement the findings of Chen, Jegadeesh,

and Wermers (2000). Chen et al. document a gap between the long-horizon returns

between the stocks that mutual funds buy and those they sell. We show that at least a

portion of this gap can be tied to information-based trading.



D.      Fund characteristics and alphas based on trades

        The last analysis combines the power of sorting on fund characteristics and

following trades. We start again with persistence. Table 6 tests for persistence in each of

six trades-based BAR alpha measures and six raw return measures. For each measure, we

sort funds into quintiles based on their previous performance over the past two years, and

then tabulate their subsequent performance.

        We find evidence of performance persistence in alphas based on trades, in

particular weight increases, weight decreases, and the difference. The gap between the

BAR for the highest and lowest weight increase quintiles is a significant 37 basis points

per annum, and the gap for weight decreases is an even larger 60 basis points. (Recall that

sorting across quintiles has the opposite interpretation for weight increases and decreases.

For weight increases, high BAR indicate forecasting skill, while for decreases, low BAR

indicate skill.) There is little evidence of persistence in relative performance of first buys,

last sells, and first buys minus last sells. The likely explanation is that classifications




                                               17
based on the performance of past first buys or last sells are far less precise, there being far

fewer such trades than generic buys or sells. This does not affect the means in Table 5,

but does reduce the ability to classify a fund here based on past performance.

       Finally, Table 7 examines the relation between fund characteristics and alphas

based on trades. Panel A shows that growth funds again appears to outperform income

funds based on these measures. The Wald tests again reject the hypothesis of equality in

most cases. The remaining panels usually point in the same direction as the earlier results

based on holdings, but tend to be weaker. Larger funds tend to outperform smaller funds,

expense ratios do not matter at all, and turnover and incentive fees are weakly positively

correlated with performance. Given the stronger results of Table 5, the main takeaway

would appear to be that various categories of mutual funds buy subsequent earnings

winners and sell subsequent earnings losers, but there are also some differences in

performance across style and other characteristics.



IV.    Summary

       We develop a new methodology to measure the stock-picking skills of fund

managers which is based on their holdings and trades prior to earnings announcements.

Our approach has two key features. First, it uses the segment of returns data, returns at

earnings announcements, that contains the most concentrated information about whether

a manager held a correct view on the stock’s fundamentals. Second, to a large extent, it

allows us to avoid the joint-hypothesis problem arising from an incorrect model of

expected returns. We suggest that our “earnings announcement alpha” methodology

offers a useful complement to the standard, long-horizon measures of fund performance.




                                              18
       Using this methodology, we uncover new evidence that fund managers have at

least some stock-picking skill. In particular, the future earnings announcement returns on

stocks that funds are buying are, on average, considerably higher than the future earnings

announcement returns on stocks that they are selling. Very little of the difference reflects

a pattern in which fund managers move toward categories of stocks (size, book-to-

market, and prior announcement returns) that are about to earn higher announcement

returns. Instead, the bulk of the effect comes from picking stocks within these categories:

The stocks that funds are buying perform significantly better at future earnings

announcements than stocks with similar characteristics, and vice-versa with stocks that

funds are selling. We also confirm several cross-sectional patterns, such as the stronger

performance of funds with incentive fees, which had been suggested in long-horizon

studies but had yet to be closely tied to information-based trading.

Table 1. Summary statistics, 1980Q2 through 2002Q3. The sample is the intersection of the Spectrum Mutual Fund holdings database, Compustat, and CRSP.
To be included in the sample, a mutual fund holding must have matched earnings announcement date and book value from CRSP, and a valid return, market
value of equity (price times shares outstanding), past momentum (return from months t-12 through t-2), and three-day return in the earnings announcement
window from CRSP. We compute terminal holdings for stocks that exit the portfolio. Where possible, we include the investment objective from the CRSP
mutual fund database as determined by CDA Weisenberger or S&P. The investment objective growth includes codes G, MCG, and LTG from CDA and LG, and
AG from S&P. The investment objective growth and income includes G-I and GCI from CDA and GI and IN from S&P. The investment objective income
includes I, IEQ, and IFL from CDA and IN from S&P. We classify each holding as a weight increase or weight decrease. We also record those weight increases
that are first buy (from zero to positive weight), and those weight decreases that are last sells (from positive weight to zero). We measure fund size as the total
market value (price times shares outstanding) of its reported equity holdings; fund turnover and fund expense ratio from the CRSP mutual fund database; and
incentive fees (whether or not the fund has such a structure) from Blake, Elton, and Gruber (2003) and Lipper. Turnover is missing in CRSP in 1991 and
incentive fees are not available after 1999.

Table 2. Annualized announcement effects. For each periodic mutual fund holdings report, we compute the
average subsequent quarterly earnings announcement return: raw, market-adjusted, and benchmark-adjusted; and
equal- and value-weighted across all holdings by fund. The characteristics benchmark return is the corresponding
5x5x5 size, book-to-market, and momentum average earnings announcement return in the matched quarter.
Momentum here is defined as the return in the past 4 earnings announcements. We annualize these returns
(multiplying by four) and average across all funds within a year. Returns are Winsorized at the top and bottom one
percent.

Table 4. Annualized announcement effects: Fund characteristics. For each periodic mutual fund holdings report,
we compute the average subsequent quarterly earnings announcement return: raw and benchmark-adjusted; and
equal- and value-weighted across all holdings by fund. The characteristics benchmark return is the corresponding
5x5x5 size, book-to-market, and momentum average earnings announcement return in the matched quarter.
Momentum here is defined as the return in the past 4 earnings announcements. We annualize these returns
(multiplying by four) and average across all funds by investment objective (style), total market value of reported
holdings (fund size), expense ratio, turnover, and incentive fee structure for each report date. For size, expense ratio,
and turnover, quintiles go from lowest to highest. Returns are Winsorized at the top and bottom one percent. For the
style categories we perform Wald tests of the joint hypothesis that all three groups have returns equal to zero (W1)
or a constant (W2).

Table 7. Annualized announcement effects: Mutual fund trades and fund characteristics. For each periodic
mutual fund holdings report, we compute the average subsequent quarterly earnings announcement returns: raw and
benchmark-adjusted; and equal-weighted across weight increases, weight decreases, long weight increases and short
weight decreases, first buys, last sells, and long first buys and short last sells by fund. The characteristics benchmark
return is the corresponding 5x5x5 size, book-to-market, and momentum average earnings announcement return in
the matched quarter. Momentum here is defined as the return in the past 4 earnings announcements. We annualize
these returns (multiplying by four) and average across all funds by investment objective (style), total market value of
reported holdings (fund size), expense ratio, turnover, and incentive fee structure for each report date. For fund size,
expense ratio, and turnover, quintiles go from lowest to highest. Returns are Winsorized at the top and bottom one
percent. For the style categories we perform Wald tests of the joint hypothesis that all three groups have returns
equal to zero (W1) or a constant (W2).
