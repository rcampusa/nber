People who delay claiming Social Security receive higher lifelong benefits upon retirement. We
survey individuals on their willingness to delay claiming later, if they could receive a lump sum
in lieu of a higher annuity payment. Using a moment-matching approach, we calibrate a lifecycle
model tracking observed claiming patterns under current rules and predict optimal claiming
outcomes under the lump sum approach. Our model correctly predicts that early claimers under
current rules would delay claiming most when offered actuarially fair lump sums, and for lump
sums worth 87% as much, claiming ages would still be higher than at present.

           Optimal Social Security Claiming Behavior under Lump Sum
                     Incentives: Theory and Evidence


1    Introduction

         Deciding when to retire and claim Social Security benefits is one of the most

consequential financial decisions people can make in later life, inasmuch as delaying claiming

from age 62 to age 70, for instance, can boost old-age annuity payments as much as 75 percent.

Nevertheless, a majority of American retirees – 57 percent of men and 64 percent of women –

still claims benefits before the national “full retirement age” of 66 (Social Security

Administration 2015, Table 6.B5). When they exercise the option to claim, and what financial

incentives could induce them to delay claiming without making them worse off, are topics

deserving greater attention in the literature and of keen interest to policy reformers. 1

         In this paper, we first briefly report on an online survey where we ask people if they

might be willing to delay claiming, and how much, if they were offered a lump sum instead of

an actuarially-adjusted deferred annuity from Social Security. 2 Next, we develop a theoretical

model of a rational agent who optimally chooses lifecycle consumption and work effort

trajectories. 3 Using a moment-matching approach, we calibrate preference parameters such that

optimal average claiming behaviors under the current Social Security system are in line with

those observed in our data. Using this model, we then study optimal claiming behavior under

the lump sum alternative and compare our outcomes to what people report they would do in our



1
  Several studies examine retirement or claiming patterns under current Social Security rules (e.g., Coile, Diamond,
Gruber, and Jouston 2002; Gustman and Steinmeier 2005, 2015; Hubener, Maurer, and Mitchell 2016a; Shoven
and Slavov 2014; Yin 2015), and research examining workers’ decisions to claim company pensions include
Chalmers and Reuter (2012).
2
  The survey module is discussed in Maurer, Mitchell, Rogalla, and Schimetschek (2016a). A non-representative
ad-hoc analysis of how lump sum benefits could influence claiming decisions was discussed in Featherstonehaugh
and Ross (1999), while Orszag (2001) discussed design aspects of such a policy alternative.
3
  Brown, Kapteyn, Luttmer, and Mitchell (2016) took a behavioral finance perspective to examine whether people
might be willing to give up some of their benefit stream in exchange for a lump sum, but they did not develop a
rational consumer model as we do here. Chai, Maurer, Mitchell, and Rogalla (2013) developed a model of
consumers who could delay claiming Social Security if offered lump sum payments instead of an increase in
lifetime annuity benefits, but that study did not calibrate the model to empirical data as we do here.
                                                                                                2


survey. The model proves to be quite accurate in predicting the impact of the lump sum

treatment on claiming ages, indicating the usefulness of our framework for assessing the

financial incentives that can induce household to delay claiming without making them worse

off.

         Our findings show that the matching exercise in our life cycle setting replicates

empirically observed average claiming patterns under current Social Security rules with

realistic preference parameters. Based on this calibration, the model predicts an overall increase

of 0.41 years in the claiming age when respondents are offered the lump sum incentive, very

close to the average increase of 0.39 years found in the survey data. Furthermore, the model

produces reliable predictions of the average claiming age response to lump sum incentives not

only in aggregate, but also for key population subgroups. Overall, we predict and confirm that

offering rational workers actuarially fair lump sums would result in reasonable delays in

retirement benefit claiming.

         The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview

of the US Social Security system’s provisions regarding benefits under the current scheme and

the alternative lump sum structure we analyze. It also discusses the implied returns attainable

when delaying claiming benefits. Section 3 briefly reviews the survey we conducted to assess

how lump sum incentives could influence actual claiming decisions. Section 4 describes our

life cycle model framework. Preference parameters are calibrated to align model-predicted

claiming behavior with the survey data, described in Section 5. In Section 6 we show how the

model replicates claiming age intensions under the lump sum alternative. Section 7 studies the

sensitivity of claiming ages to the level of lump sum benefits, and Section 8 concludes.



2      Social Security Mechanics, Claiming Options, and their Financial Implications

         Social Security old-age benefits are based on a worker’s Average Indexed Monthly

Earnings (AIME), calculated by averaging his indexed 35 highest earning years. The AIME is
                                                                                                                 3


then converted into a Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) by applying a progressive benefit

formula; this replaces 90/32/15 percent of the first $816/next $4,101/any remaining dollar

amount of AIME up to a calendar-year-specific maximum taxable earnings (e.g. $117,000 in

2014). The PIA represents the monthly retirement benefit payable for life if the individual

claims his Social Security benefits at his Full Retirement Age (FRA); this is age 66 for birth

cohorts 1943–1954, rising to 67 for those born 1960 or later. 4

           In point of fact, Social Security permits workers to claim their old-age benefits at any

age between 62 and 70. 5 Under current rules, which we call the Status Quo, benefits for those
                                                                         5
claiming prior to their Full Retirement Age are reduced by               9
                                                                             percent per month, for up to 36

months of early claiming (i.e., 6.67 percent per year). For even earlier claiming, retirement

                                                  5
benefits are reduced by an additional 12 percent. Hence, an individual with a FRA of 67 would

                                                               5   5
receive a retirement benefit of �100 − 36 ⋅ 9 − 24 ⋅ 12� % ⋅ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 70% ⋅ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 when claiming

at age 62, i.e. 60 months earlier than his FRA. For those claiming later than their FRA, monthly
                                 8
benefits are increased by 12 percent per month of delayed claiming. Hence, an individual with

a FRA of 67 would receive a retirement benefit of 124% ⋅ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 when claiming at age 70.

           Taking the perspective of an individual age 62 contemplating whether to claim

immediately or delay benefits, the current Social Security mechanics can be reframed as

follows: he could claim at age 62 and receive his reduced benefit for life, or he could delay

claiming for a year or more, up to age 70. To illustrate, if he were entitled to $10,000 per year

at age 62, he could delay claiming one year and receive a higher annual benefit of $10,714 from

age 63 for life (see Table 1). 6 Delaying to age 70 would boost his annual benefit from the initial

$10,000 to $17,714.

  While it is technically possible to claim after age 70, under regular circumstances this is not beneficial to the
individual. Hence we do not consider it further here.

< Table 1 here>

         Our alternative approach that we examine in this paper would offer each individual a

deferred benefit in the form of an actuarially fair lump sum if he delayed claiming, plus his age

62 benefit from the later benefit start date onward. For instance, under this Lump Sum approach,

the individual in the above example would receive the cash value of his benefit increase upon

claiming in addition to his baseline amount of $10,000 for life. Using the Social Security

system’s parameters, the lump sum for delaying claiming to age 63 would amount to $11,556.7

Delaying claiming to age 70 would increase the lump sum payment to $102,300, on top of his

baseline annual payment of $10,000.

         From a financial perspective, therefore, deciding when to claim benefits must be seen

as a financial decision where the individual forgoes current benefits in exchange for a different

mix of higher future benefits. To illustrate the implications of this choice, we again consider

the example 62-year old contemplating his claiming options. Under the Status Quo, his decision

to delay claiming by one year is equivalent to purchasing a deferred life annuity paying $714

per year in exchange for a premium of $10,000. Subject to survival until age 63, the internal

rate of return of this investment is 4.0 percent over his expected lifetime. 8 By contrast, under

the Lump Sum alternative, the foregone benefit at age 62 of $10,000 buys him one-period future

cash amount of $11,556 at age 63, implying a one-year return of 15.6 percent conditional on

survival. Accordingly, delaying claiming could be valuable under either scenario.

         These calculations demonstrate the general appeal of delaying claiming, yet they do not

speak to whether delayed claiming would be relatively more attractive under the Lump Sum or

  This is calculated based on Social Security’s 2013 Trustees Report mortality table for the cohort 1951, converted
to a unisex table as in Bell, Bye, and Winters (2008), and using a discount rate of 2.9 percent, which is Social
Security’s best estimate in their intermediate cost scenario in the 2013 and 2014 Trustees Reports (Social Security
Administration 2013, 2014a).

  This computation relies on Social Security’s mortality table for the cohort 1951, converted to a unisex table (see
footnote 7). For returns from delaying claiming using sex-specific mortality rates and assuming a FRA of 66, see
Hubener, Maurer, and Mitchell (2016b).
                                                                                                                 5


the Status Quo regimes. This is because each person’s valuation of the tradeoff will also depend

on his time preference and risk aversion, as well as his subjective survival expectations.

Additionally, people might be subject to liquidity constraints, so they might need to work longer

to subsist during the delay period, reducing utility. 9 One must also analyze the retiree’s re-

investment opportunities before deciding which of the two investments with different maturities

would be preferred. To this end, it is useful to develop some evidence on the relative appeal of

the Lump Sum versus the Status Quo scenarios.



3    Survey Evidence on Claiming Ages Under the Status Quo and Lump Sum
     Approaches

         We have collected survey information on claiming patterns under the Status Quo and

Lump Sum alternatives using RAND’s online American Life Panel (ALP). Our nationally

representative sample consists of 2,428 respondents age 40-70. 10 To implement the survey, we

first computed each respondent’s anticipated monthly Social Security benefit if he were to claim

at each age from 62 to 70 (i.e., the earliest and latest claiming ages under the current system

rules) based on his earnings history. After being shown this information, the respondent was

asked to report his expected claiming age (i.e., the Status Quo claiming age). Next, we presented

the respondent with the Lump Sum scenario, again tailored to his earnings history, and we asked

him to report his expected claiming age under the new option. In the second case, he was told

to assume that he would receive lifelong monthly income in the amount of his age 62 Social

Security benefit from his claiming date forward, plus a lump sum payable as of the Lump Sum

claiming age. The lump sum amount was computed to be equal to the actuarial present value of



9
  We note, however, that Goda, Shoven, Ramnath, and Slavov (2015) found that one-third of Social Security early
retirees had financial assets in their Individual Retirement Accounts sufficient to finance at least two additional
years of deferral, and about one-quarter could self-finance at least four years of deferral. Other assets were not
included in that calculation, so that the likely impact of liquidity constraints is probably far lower.
10
   As noted above, the survey module is detailed in Maurer, Mitchell, Rogalla, and Schimetschek (2016a). Our
sample size here is slightly reduced from that studied previously due to the omission of 23 cases (<1 percent)
lacking wealth information, though average claiming ages are the same.
                                                                                               6


his delayed retirement credit. In addition, our survey module gathered information on financial

wealth, preferences, and attitudes. 11

           To summarize the results of this survey module, Table 2 provides sample means and

standard errors for claiming ages, work effort, financial wealth, and PIA for the full sample of

respondents. For the full sample, the lump sum option boosted expected claiming ages by about

0.4 years, from age 65.74 under the Status Quo to age 66.13, and the increase is highly

statistically significant.

<Table 2 here>

           We also disaggregated our ALP respondents into three subgroups according to their

Status Quo claiming age: the Early Claimers having an expected claiming age under age 65 (N

= 764); the Normal Claimers having an expected claiming age from 65 to 67 (N = 1074); and

the Late Claimers who expected to claim after age 67 (N = 590). Table 2 shows that the Lump

Sum offering induces deferred claiming among both Early and Normal Claimers. That is, Early

Claimers reported a baseline mean expected claiming age of 62.72, but the lump sum raised

their mean claiming age by about 1.2 years to age 63.89. For Normal Claimers, the mean

claiming age increased by about 0.4 years, from 65.87 under the Status Quo, to 66.29 under the

Lump Sum policy. These changes in claiming ages are highly statistically significant. By

contrast, people who were Late Claimers under the baseline reduced their mean expected

claiming age by about 0.7 years, from 69.43 under the baseline to 68.74. In sum, trading a

benefit increase for a lump sum would have the largest impact on delayed claiming for those

who, under the current rules, take their benefits before or at the Full Retirement Age. And since

the majority of Americans currently take their benefits young, this policy could have a marked

impact on behavior.

     See Appendix Table A 1 for a detailed list of variables and summary statistics.
                                                                                                              7


        Table 2 also provides information on household financial wealth and estimated monthly

retirement benefits at the Full Retirement Age (i.e., the PIA). Below we use these as state

variables in our life cycle model. In the full sample, mean household financial wealth was

$90,750, and the mean 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 was $1,650. For Early Claimers, mean financial wealth and PIAs –

at $83,910 and $1,590, respectively – are below the Normal Claimer values – at $94,710 and

$1,690. The mean financial wealth and PIA differences are not significant between the Late and

the Normal Claimers. 12

        Next we develop and calibrate a theoretical model of the claiming decision in the context

using the ALP data for the Status Quo claiming age distribution. Having done so, we simulate

the theoretical response to the Lump Sum alternative, which we can then compare to the survey

responses just described.



4    Our Life Cycle Framework

        In this section, we build a discrete-time lifecycle model for individuals maximizing

Epstein-Zin (1989) utility over a composite good of consumption and leisure. Given their initial

endowment of financial wealth and Social Security claims, they optimally choose consumption,

saving, and work effort trajectories, as well as the optimal claiming age for Social Security

benefits. We model each individual’s life cycle from age 62 (𝑡𝑡 = 1) to age 100 (T = 39),

assuming that people have a time budget of 100 hours per week (as in Chai, Horneff, Maurer,

and Mitchell 2011). Between age 62 and 70, individuals can decide to participate in the labor

market by choosing to work for a discrete number of hours 𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡 (∈ {0,10,20,30,40,50,60}) per

week, where we interpret 40 hours as full-time employment. The fraction of the time budget

                                                                     𝑤𝑤ℎ
not dedicated to work is assumed to be leisure 𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡 (= 1 − 100𝑡𝑡). From age 70 onward, the time

budget is fully devoted to leisure.


12
  A regression of expected Status Quo claiming ages on wealth and the base benefit level produces no significant
results. Results appear in Appendix Table A 2.
                                                                                                                      8


         Given a choice of how many hours to work, the individual receives a gross annual

income 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 of:

                                                    𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡                                                       (1)
                                       𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 =         ⋅ 12 ⋅ 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴.
                                                     40

The 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 term represents the individual’s average monthly full-time gross earnings, which we

derive from the 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 by inverting the Social Security benefit formula. For simplicity, we assume

that an individual’s 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 does not depend on work effort decisions after age 62. 13 Gross income

is adjusted according to current US tax laws to derive net annual income 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 . 14 Should the

individual choose not to work (𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡 = 0), he can either live off his financial wealth or retire

permanently and claim Social Security benefits.

         On claiming retirement benefits at age 𝑘𝑘 (= 61 + 𝑡𝑡), the individual will receive a

constant annual level of annuity payments (𝐴𝐴𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘 ) for life plus a single lump sum (𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘 ) as of

that age. This is calculated as:

                                           𝐴𝐴𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘 = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 ⋅ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃,                                          (2)

                                          𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑘𝑘 = 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 ⋅ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃,

where 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 and 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 are claiming-age-specific adjustment factors. 15 The lump sum benefit

factors 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 are calculated based on the Social Security 2013 Trustees Report mortality table

for the 1951 cohort, converted to a unisex table as in Bell, Bye, and Winters (2008), and a

discount rate of 2.9 percent, which is Social Security’s intermediate cost scenario (Social

Security Administration 2013, 2014a). Table 3 presents the 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 and 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 factors for all

claiming ages under the Status Quo (left panel) and for the Lump Sum scenario (right panel).

   Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2005), among others, show that labor income exhibits a hump-shaped profile
over the worklife, with earnings decreasing as people near retirement. The PIA is based on one’s highest 35 years
of earnings, which implies that late-life earnings have only a small impact on the typical worker’s PIA.

   In particular, we apply tax-brackets, tax rates, and standard deduction amounts as of 2014 (see Internal Revenue
Service 2014) to derive 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 . The tax brackets and associated tax rates are $0 to $9,075: 10%; $9,076 to $36,900:
15%; $36,901 to $89,350: 25%; $89,351 to $186,350: 28%; $186,351 to $405,100: 33%; $405,101 to $406,750:
35%; and $406,751 or more: 39.6%. We use a standard deduction amount of $6,200 to determine taxable income.
In addition, we deduct before retirement the Social Security payroll tax of 6.2%, Medicare tax of 1.45%, and a city
tax of 4%. After retirement, we set the tax rates equal zero, since due to generous deductions, most US households
pay no taxes on Social Security benefits (see Social Security Administration 2016).

   As there are no lump sum benefits in the Status Quo, 𝐿𝐿𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 is zero in this scenario.

           Savings are invested in the capital market and generate a gross return 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+1 , which we

set to 1.029 in line with our discount rate assumption. Hence, financial wealth in the subsequent

period is given by:

           The value function depends on a set of preference parameters including the preference

coefficient of relative risk aversion γ. Calibrating these parameters is the objective of the

moment-matching exercise in the next section.

       To maximize lifetime utility, the individual determines his optimal policies regarding

consumption, leisure, and claiming age, all of which depend on the continuous state variables

wealth and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, as well as on the discrete claiming age state variable. We solve the optimization

problem using backward induction over a discretized state space. Using the optimal life cycle

policies, we subsequently derive the expected model-based claiming behavior by conducting a

forward simulation for each individual in our empirical survey based on the individual’s sex,

initial combination wealth 𝑊𝑊1 , and Primary Insurance Amount 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃.



5   Calibrating Preference Parameters to Match Status Quo Claiming Behavior

       Using a moment-matching approach, we next calibrate key preference parameters for

leisure and time preference, risk aversion, and willingness to shift consumption across time.

Our goal is to ensure that our model generates optimal average claiming behaviors in line with

the empirically-observed patterns under the Status Quo described in Section 3.

       Two of the needed parameters, on risk attitudes and time preferences, are gathered using

relevant questions from the ALP module. Specifically we measure risk tolerance based on

respondents’ answers to survey questions regarding their willingness to take risk (as in Maurer,

Mitchell, Rogalla, and Schimetschek, 2016a, and Brown, Kapteyn, Luttmer, and Mitchell,

2016). We are also able to distinguish more patient from impatient individuals, since the former

indicated they had relatively long (versus short) planning horizon (i.e., they focused on a 5+

versus an under-5 year planning period when making financial decisions). Impatient individuals

also indicated they would immediately spend most of a $10,000 windfall if it were available.

       There is also some dispersion in baseline claiming ages: that is, claiming ages were

higher for the more patient and risk-averse respondents, while the less patient and risk-
                                                                                                                11


preferring respondents opted for younger claiming ages. 17 As a result, we concluded that

forcing a common risk aversion and time preference parameter across all respondents would be

inadequate to replicate the distribution of claiming ages in the data. Accordingly we assigned

distinct risk and time preference parameters to each of the three claiming age subgroups

introduced above. 18 In particular, Early Claimers were assigned a coefficient of relative risk

aversion of 𝛾𝛾 = 1.5 and a time preference rate of 𝛽𝛽 = 0.9. Normal Claimers were assigned a

coefficient of relative risk aversion of 𝛾𝛾 = 3 and a time preference rate of 𝛽𝛽 = 0.93. And Late

Claimers were assigned parameter values of 𝛾𝛾 = 5 and 𝛽𝛽 = 0.96. These values are in line with

those typically used in the literature on optimal life cycle decision making. 19

        The ALP survey offers less guidance to help us pin down leisure preference and

intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) parameters. For this reason, we used a moment-

matching approach 20 to derive optimal parameter sets that match the model output on claiming

ages with the survey data under the Status Quo. We constructed a set of 150 unique

combinations of leisure preference and IES parameters by varying 𝛼𝛼 in 15 steps of 0.1 over the

interval 𝛼𝛼 ∈ (0.9, … , 2.3) and 𝜙𝜙 in 10 steps of 0.1 over the interval 𝜙𝜙 ∈ (0.1, … ,1). For each of

these 150 parameter combinations, we solved the life cycle optimization problem separately for

Early Claimers, Normal Claimers, and Late Claimers. Then we determined expected claiming

ages for each subgroup by simulating the life cycle paths for each individual in the ALP survey,

based on the optimal controls for that person’s claiming age subgroup. The optimal leisure

preference/substitution elasticity pair for each subgroup minimized the squared distance



17
   Appendix Table A. 2 presents the results of a multivariate regression of expected claiming ages under the Status
Quo on various controls. The risk aversion coefficient is positive and highly significant. The same holds for the
coefficient on the long-term planner dummy, representing those who make financial plans for 5+ years. By
contrast, our impatience dummy variable High Spending, which represents those who would immediately consume
the better part of a windfall cash inflow, has a negative and statistically significant coefficient.
18
   While the survey did contain information regarding the general direction of the relation between claiming ages
and risk/time preference, we cannot directly infer numeric values of the risk aversion and time preference
parameters for use in the model.

between the simulated model-based expected claiming age and the expected claiming age in

the survey data.

       Figure 1 displays the (log) values of the squared differences between the model-based

and empirical expected claiming ages for all 150 combinations of the leisure preference and

IES parameters, indicating the location of optimal sets in 𝛼𝛼-𝜙𝜙-space. We summarize the results

in Table 4, with the optimal preference parameter sets for each claiming age group as well as

the corresponding claiming age deviations between the model and the data.

< Figure 1 and Table 4 here >

       In each panel of the Figure, darker regions indicate the parameter pairs generating the

minimum (log) squared differences. The lifecycle model results best fit the survey data when

the leisure preference and IES are set to 𝛼𝛼 = 2.2 and 𝜙𝜙 = 0.1 for Early Claimers; for Normal

Claimers when the leisure preference and IES are set to 𝛼𝛼 = 2.2 and 𝜙𝜙 = 0.1; and for Late

Claimers the best fitting 𝛼𝛼 = 1.6 and 𝜙𝜙 = 0.7. In other words, as baseline claiming ages rise,

leisure preferences generally fall and the IES increases. This is a plausible result, since those

who delay claiming more will generally have to work longer in order to finance consumption

during the delay period. Thus individuals who optimally claim late will tend to exhibit lower

leisure preference. Claiming later is an investment that trades off current income and

consumption in exchange for higher future income and consumption, as discussed in Section 2.

Accordingly, claiming later is optimal for those more willing to shift consumption ahead in

time, which requires a higher intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

       Our IES estimates accord reasonably well with those reported in the literature. Hall

(1988) concluded that the IES is below 0.2 and could potentially be zero. Attanasio and Weber

(1995) derived a value of up to 0.67 based on CEX data, and Attanasio and Weber (1993)

estimated a value of up to 0.78 based on cohort data from the FES. An international meta-

analysis by Havranek, Horvath, Irsova, and Rusnak (2015) reported a mean IES of 0.594 for

the US. As for leisure preference, we are also in line with prior studies using very different
                                                                                                                13


approaches. Chai, Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell (2011) concluded that 𝛼𝛼 = 1.3 described the

aggregate claim age distribution over time. Low (2005) used an effective leisure preference

parameter of 𝛼𝛼 = 1.5, while the effective leisure preference in Cooley and Prescott (1995) and

Laitner and Silverman (2012) was 𝛼𝛼 = 1.78. 21

        Having identified the optimal combination of 𝛼𝛼 and 𝜙𝜙, and, hence, having fully

calibrated our life cycle model, we can now examine how well our utility-maximizing decision

making framework tracks the Status Quo claiming age choices in our ALP module. To this end,

Table 5 presents average empirical and model-derived Status Quo claiming ages, distinguished

across Early, Normal, and Late Claimers. Results reveal an almost perfect match for all three

claiming age groups. Empirical and model-based average claiming ages are identical to the first

decimal, at age 62.7 for Early, 65.9 for Normal, and 69.4 for Late Claimers. Model results

deviate from empirical observations by a mere 0.013 years for the Early, 0.034 years for the

Normal, and by a negligible 0.005 years for the Late Claimers.

< Table 5 here >

        We also provide results for subsets of persons differentiated by household wealth and

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 level (i.e., our model’s state variables). Generally speaking, model predictions deviate a

bit from the data, since as noted above, there was no clear-cut empirical relationship between

wealth or benefit levels and expected claiming ages. The model, by contrast, predicts that

expected claiming ages generally increase with wealth and retirement benefits. This is

theoretically plausible, inasmuch as wealthier households can delay claiming Social Security

benefits more and still maintain a certain level of consumption without necessarily having to

work much more and forego too much leisure. Nevertheless, people with higher 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 also have

a higher opportunity cost of early retirement, so having a higher 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 provides a larger incentive




21
   Specifically, Low (2005) used the specification 𝐶𝐶 0.4 𝐿𝐿0.6 for his composite good of consumption and leisure,
while Cooley and Prescott (1995) and Laitner and Silverman (2012) used 𝐶𝐶 0.36 𝐿𝐿0.64. As strictly monotonic
transformations are order-preserving, these specifications correspond to 𝐶𝐶 1 𝐿𝐿1.5 and 𝐶𝐶 1 𝐿𝐿1.78 , respectively.

to continue working and generally results in later claiming. The two effects appear to balance

for Early Claimers, as model-based claiming ages hardly differ between those with high and

low benefits. Given their relatively high leisure preference, members of this subgroup are less

susceptible to work incentives. As a result, theoretical results are close to empirical claiming

age observations.



6    Responses to the Lump Sum Approach: Predicted vs Empirical Claiming Patterns

        Having calibrated our model so that it matches Status Quo claiming age results in the

survey, we next study how the Lump Sum approach changes expected claiming ages in our

model, and then we compare the theoretical responses to survey responses. Accordingly, we

again solve the life cycle optimization problem for Early, Normal, and Late Claimers using the

optimal preference parameters in Table 4, but now we replace the Status Quo Social Security

regime with the Lump Sum setup. 22 We simulate the life cycle paths for each individual in our

ALP survey using the optimal controls for that person’s claiming age subgroup. Findings appear

in Table 6 which presents the average differences between expected Status Quo and expected

Lump Sum claiming ages for both the empirical and model-based datasets. We also provide

results for subsamples differentiated by household wealth and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 levels.

< Table 6 here >

        The most interesting finding is that the model-generated claiming ages under the lump

sum approach are remarkably similar to those reported by survey respondents asked to predict

their claiming ages under the reform. It should be emphasized that the model calibration was

based solely on the Status Quo evidence and did not use the survey data for the Lump Sum

scenario. In other words this is a true “out of sample prediction.” For Early Claimers, our model

predicts a lump sum-induced claiming age increase of 1.2 years, for Normal Claimers an



22
   Technically, switching the model from the Status Quo to the Lump Sum setup only requires using the 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 and
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 factors from the Lump Sum column instead of the Status Quo column in Table 3.
                                                                                                15


increase of 0.4 years, and for Later Claimers a decrease of 0.5 years. Accordingly, the model

underestimates the average expected claiming age increase for Early Claimers in the survey by

a miniscule 0.008 years (i.e. less than 3 days), and for Normal Claimers by a mere 0.061 years

(i.e. about 3 weeks). Only for Late Claimers is there a slightly larger difference between the

model’s prediction and the survey data, with the model underestimating the survey decline in

claiming by 0.2 years. Aggregating over the three subgroups, the model predicts an overall rise

in the expected claiming age of 0.41 years, quite close to the 0.39 years in our survey data.

       If we disaggregate by household wealth, the survey data reveal no significant impact of

financial endowments on how lump sum incentives affect claiming ages. By contrast, our model

predicts that wealthier Early Claimers would delay claiming more than their poorer

counterparts. Given their low 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼, being able to smooth consumption is especially valuable for

this subgroup. Therefore these households find the substantial lump sum payments appealing

in exchange for longer delays only when they have sufficient own wealth to balance pre- and

post-claiming consumption. For example, those with low wealth will delay claiming by only an

additional 0.1 year when offered the lump sum, while those with wealth exceeding $100,000

are projected to delay claiming by an additional 2.4 years. Among the Late Claimers, those with

the most wealth have the smallest increment in claiming ages.

       The level of retirement benefits has a significant impact only for the Late Claimers in

terms of the empirically observed lump sum-induced claiming age change. Nevertheless, the

model predicts an overall positive relation between the 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 and the claiming age delay across

all groups.



7   Claiming Behavior under Less-Than-Actuarially-Fair Lump Sum Benefits

       Thus far, we have found that both the ALP survey and the model-based analysis imply

about a 0.4 year average delay in claiming Social Security benefits under the Lump Sum regime.

This raises the question as to how sensitive claiming decisions might be to the level of lump
                                                                                                            16


sum benefit offered. Our empirical survey did not explore that question, as it only solicited new

claiming ages assuming actuarially fair lump sums. 23 Yet the fact that our lifecycle framework

can reliably predict aggregate claiming behavior under lump sum incentives suggests the

usefulness of a model-based policy experiment to shed more light on alternative lump sum

values. To do so, we undertake a final set of lifecycle optimizations and simulations using the

preference parameters in Table 4, but now we determine claiming age changes for lump sum

benefits set below the actuarially fair levels.

        Results appear in Figure 2 which depicts model-projected average Lump Sum claiming

ages for lump sums ranging from 100% to 75% of the actuarially fair amount. Interestingly, as

we move gradually toward less generous lump sums, expected claiming ages are barely

affected. Only for levels below 93 percent of the actuarially fair value do we see any important

changes in expected claiming ages: for instance if the lump sum were 90 percent of its

actuarially fair level, average claiming ages would fall by about 1.5 months (relative to the fair

lump sum outcome). Once the level falls below 90 percent, there is a substantial decline in

optimal expected claiming ages. For instance, at 80 percent, the average claiming age is about

65.1, or one year earlier than with the fair lump sum. From there, it gradually decreases further

as the lump sum continues to fall.

< Figure 2 here>

        An interesting tipping point appears to arise at a lump sum worth between 85 and 90

percent of the actuarially fair level. 24 In this range, the expected claiming age drops sharply to

65.7, which was the average expected Status Quo claiming age in our empirical survey (dotted

line in Figure 2). Obviously such a reduction would have welfare effects, as it would reduce


23
   Brown, Kapteyn, Luttmer, and Mitchell (2016) undertook a different experiment asking people directly how
much they would be willing to pay for $100 more in Social Security income, and the vast majority of respondents
indicated values much below the actuarially fair amount.
24
   Though we are not advocating this for Social Security, many pension systems have offered less than fair lump
sums. For instance Warner and Pleeter (2001) found that lump sums worth only half of the offered annuity values
were preferred by more than half of the US military officers who were offered them, and more than 90 percent of
enlisted personnel. The City of Philadelphia is currently considering lump sum buyouts worth about half of the
annuity values, to help solve the city’s huge pension underfunding problem (Ballantine, 2016).
                                                                                                17


lifetime consumption. Yet the finding that people would delay claiming for a lump sum less

than the fully actuarially equivalent indicates the range over which retirement ages might be

induced to rise above those seen currently.



8   Conclusion

       We have developed a lifecycle model in which individuals optimally select their

consumption, saving, work effort, and Social Security benefit claiming ages. Next we calibrated

it to generate expected retirement benefit claiming behaviors under current Social Security rules

that match claiming patterns found in a nationally representative survey fielded through

RAND’s American Life Panel. We then used this model to simulate how people might change

their claiming behavior if part of their Social Security benefits – the portion currently paid as

an additional lifelong annuity– were to be exchanged for an actuarially fair lump sum. Unlike

studies that calibrate models to empirical data and subsequently conduct simulation analyses

for policy purposes, we can compare the “out of sample” model predictions to what people say

they would actually do, since our survey also elicited new claiming ages given such a reform.

       The empirical study on claiming age decisions in our representative sample of 2,428

Americans age 40-70 produced an average expected claiming age of 65.74 under current Social

Security rules. Our lifecycle model calibrated using these data closely replicated average

claiming patterns under the Status Quo: in fact our matching exercise produces simulated

average claiming ages under the current rules averaging 65.75, which deviate from the survey

result by only 3.6 days. We then used the model to predict an increase in the average claiming

age of 0.41 years if respondents were offered the actuarially fair lump sum, close to the average

increase of 0.39 years reported in the survey. Not only did the model predict the average

claiming age response to lump sum incentives reasonably well on an aggregate level, it also did

so for subgroups. In particular, it correctly predicted that those claiming early under the current

rules would be the ones with the largest rise in claiming ages when offered the lump sum, and
                                                                                              18


that those currently claiming late would react to the policy change reducing their claiming ages.

Last, we studied the claiming age sensitivity to less generous lump sum amounts. We found

that, for lump sums worth not less than 85-90% of the actuarially fair value, simulated claiming

ages still remain higher than under the Status Quo. Thus our contribution was to develop and

calibrate a theoretical life cycle model using experimental evidence to predict out-of-sample

responses to such reforms.

       Early retirement is commonly acknowledged as a risk factor that endangers financial

wellbeing at advanced ages, and reforms have been proposed to alleviate the problem including

mandating higher retirement ages or cutting early retirement benefits. As an alternative, we

have explored whether and how lump sum incentives might encourage later claiming. Our

calibrated model confirms that offering people actuarially fair lump sums could incentivize

them to delay claiming by reasonable amounts, without needing to rely on benefit cuts to get

them to do so.

Notes:The figures report, for each claiming age group, the logs of squared differences between model-
predicted and empirically measured Status Quo claiming ages using alternative parameter combinations
of leisure preference (𝛼𝛼) and elasticity of intertemporal substitution (𝜙𝜙). Darker colors indicate smaller
differences. Early Claimers had baseline claiming ages below age 65; Normal Claimers had baseline
claiming ages from 65 to 67; and Late Claimers had baseline claiming ages over age 67. The minimum
log squared difference for Early Claimers is -13.3 for the combination 𝜙𝜙 = 0.1 and 𝛼𝛼 = 2.2; the
minimum log squared difference for Normal Claimers is -6.8 for the combination 𝜙𝜙 = 0.2 and 𝛼𝛼 = 1.6;
and the minimum log squared difference for Late Claimers is -10.6 for the combination 𝜙𝜙 = 0.7 and
𝛼𝛼 = 1.6. Source: Authors’ calculations.

Notes: Under the Status Quo, the annuity paid is the lifetime annual benefit from Social Security for
alternative claiming ages for an illustrative individual having an age 62 annual benefit of $10,000. The
Implied Return represents the expected internal rate of return (subject to survival to claiming age) of
delaying claiming for one additional year. Under the Lump Sum Alternative, the annuity represents the
lifetime annual benefit payable from Social Security for alternative claiming ages for the same
illustrative individual. The Lump Sum column represents the one-time benefit payable at the delayed
claiming age. The Implied Returns columns represent the one-period return of delaying an additional
year under the Status Quo or the Lump Sum alternative. Source: Author’s calculation based on benefit
adjustment factors reported in Social Security Administration (2014b).
