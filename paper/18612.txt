                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper, we examine the political economy of voting rights in the American South. We begin
by measuring the impact of both formal laws and informal modes of voter suppression on African-American
political participation. In contrast to prior research, we find evidence that both formal and informal
modes of voter suppression were important and mutually reinforcing. Part of our analysis includes
explicitly identifying the magnitude and causal effects of lynching on black voter participation. We then
turn to analyzing to the relatively unexplored question of how disenfranchisement–and the accompanying
shifts in political power–affected policy outcomes, congressional voting, and partisan control of state
and federal legislatures.

    There is a clear consensus that historically African Americans have enjoyed fewer economic

and political freedoms and reduced material and social welfare relative to whites.1 There is,

however, much less consensus regarding the sources of this disadvantaged status.                    Many

economists attribute the dearth of black economic and political advancement to informal

institutions such as the crop lien system; 2 paternalism; 3 discrimination in labor markets; 4 and

more recently to social networks that have historically excluded disadvantaged groups (see, for

example, Currarini et al. 2009). Others focus on formal laws and political decisions. For

example, Margo (1990) shows how, by segregating blacks into separate and inferior schools,

Southern governments impaired human capital accumulation both within and across

generations.5 This, in turn, resulted in persistent racial disparities in economic and educational

outcomes. 6 Along the same lines, scholars across many disciplines attribute residential

segregation and the creation of ghettoes to various federal policies and state laws inhibiting

efforts by blacks to acquire mortgages and move into white neighborhoods (Cutler et al. 1997;

Jackson 1985; Massey and Denton 1993).

    Perhaps nowhere is the debate about formal and informal institutions more salient than in the

literature on black disenfranchisement. As is well known, from shortly after the end of

  Compared to whites, African-Americans had lower literacy and schooling rates (Margo 1990, pp. 5-17);
less occupational mobility (Fishback 1984; Craig and Fearn 1993; Whatley 1990; Wright 1996; Meeker
and Kau 1977); more work-related injuries (Maloney 1998); lower wages (Smith 1984; Margo 1990, pp.
87-108); higher unemployment (Sundstrom 1992); lower life expectancies (Haines 2002; Ewbank 1987;
Meeker 1976); reduced nutrition and stature (Carson 2009); higher infant mortality rates (Fishback et al.
2000; Haines 2002); and lower rates of home ownership (Collins and Margo 2001).

  Ransom and Sutch (1977, 2001) argue that the crop lien system locked poor black farmers in the South
into debt peonage. For contrary interpretations, see Goldin (1979), Fishback (1989) and Irwin and
O’Brien (2001).

  Alston and Ferrie (1985, 1993, 1999) present evidence that paternalism worked as a protection racket
that inhibited black mobility and undercut political support for a welfare state.

Reconstruction to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, southern blacks were denied the

right to vote.    In his now classic treatment, The Shaping of Southern Politics:               Suffrage

Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, 1880-1910, J. Morgan Kousser (1974)

argues that formal legal institutions such as poll taxes and literacy requirements were

instrumental; without these laws and state enforcement of the laws, Southern racists never would

have succeeded in denying blacks access to the ballot box. By contrast, in his seminal work,

V.O. Key (1949) claims that formal laws were epiphenomenal, secondary to, and symptomatic

of, a deeper set of social forces.        In Key’s words, the passage of poll taxes and literacy

requirements at the state level were “a fait accompli brought about . . . by more fundamental

political processes,” where the phrase “fundamental political processes” refers to a host of

informal modes of disenfranchisement initiated by private individuals, election officials, and

organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan. Informal methods of voter disenfranchisement involved

all manner of privately-initiated fraud, violence, and intimidation. Put another way, in Key's

view, it was white animus toward blacks that mattered; the actions of the state merely reflected

the preferences of the white populace and the white populace sought to suppress black political

action through every means possible.

    In this paper, we examine the political economy of voting rights in the American South. We

begin by measuring the impact of both formal laws and informal modes of voter suppression on

African-American political participation. While previous scholarship tends to emphasize the

impact of either formal or informal institutions to the exclusion of the other, our analysis

suggests a middle-way path: we find that both formal and informal institutions undercut black

political participation, and that formal and informal modes of disenfranchisement were mutually

re-enforcing. In particular, we present the strongest empirical evidence to date of the primal role
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 3


played by informal activities in the loss of suffrage by southern blacks; not only identifying the

relative magnitude of these activities but also providing the first empirical evidence of the link

between violence (lynchings) and black disenfranchisement in the post-Reconstruction south.

We additionally provide suggestive evidence of the role that party control of the election process

(election judges, poll locations and times, etc.) played in disenfranchising southern blacks. On

the other hand, our work suggests that the adoption of formal laws establishing poll taxes and

literacy requirements, while not the primary drivers of disenfranchisement, did hasten the total

disenfranchisement of blacks by approximately ten to thirteen years.

      After analyzing the processes that disenfranchised blacks, we turn to the relatively

unexplored question of how disenfranchisement–and the accompanying shifts in political power–

affected policy outcomes. We examine this question on both the extensive margin (the

composition of legislatures) and the intensive margin (congressional voting behavior, conditional

on party affiliation). It is generally believed that disenfranchising southern blacks impacted

legislation on issues of economic policy and race. This belief has both logical and historical

appeal. During Reconstruction, when recently emancipated slaves had access to the ballot box,

blacks were able to form coalitions with white Republicans and promote a legislative agenda

that, at least at the federal level, was friendly to African-American interests. Between 1866 and

1875, Congress passed and enacted four civil rights laws designed to guarantee blacks equal

access to the voting booth, housing, hotel accommodations, private property, the administration

of justice, and other rights and privileges. Although the courts eventually struck down parts of

the civil rights laws, these measures illustrate how black interests could affect positive political

change by forming coalitions with white Republicans, so long as blacks had access to the ballot.7

    See Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883)
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 4


Only when blacks were disenfranchised were Southern legislatures able to wholly undo these

federal protections.

      To measure the effects of disenfranchisement on policy, we evaluate the voting records of

southern congressmen. This analysis builds on a simple historical observation about Southern

politics: because blacks were a minority in so many districts, they could only garner political

power by forming coalitions with white Republicans. The opportunity to work in coalition with

Republican interests increased the legislative impact of the franchise for the country's minority

black population. By the same token, black votes were key to Republican efforts to build an

electoral majority. In evaluating the impact of black political disenfranchisement on voting on

Republican priorities, we use the well-known Poole-Rosenthal DW-NOMINATE scores.8 As a

way of capturing the effects of disenfranchisement on voting behavior over policies directly

relevant to black voters, we identify 12 key house floor votes on issues related to civil rights and

suffrage. We then evaluate legislative voting records on these bills. To measure the effects of

disenfranchisement on the extensive margin of policy – that is, which party is elected – we gather

data on the party control of state legislatures. With these data, we measure, in both absolute and

relative terms, the extent to which formal and informal methods of disenfranchisement altered

the party composition and control of state legislatures. We also gather data on congressional

election outcomes to assess the likelihood of a Democrat being elected to office before and after

disenfranchisement.       Presumably, as blacks were denied access to the ballot box and lost

whatever political power they had, Democrats would have cemented their hold on the political

process.

      Consistent with our findings regarding the path to disenfranchisement, we find that both

formal and informal methods of disenfranchisement are important for explaining changes in the

composition of state legislatures and the election of Democrats to Congress. Further, with the

loss of franchise, the relationship between the size of a district’s black population and

representative voting on issues important to black interests switches from a significant and policy

relevant positive relationship to a significant negative relationship. Finally, we document that the

coalition between black and Republican interests yield results for Republican concerns as well.

We find that when southern blacks had the franchise, the presence of a large black population in

a given Congressional district was associated with the adoption of more conservative policies at

both the extensive (election of republicans) and intensive (congressional voting – given party)

margins. To our knowledge, ours is the first work to quantify these relationships.9




A Brief History of Disenfranchisement



Over the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, state legislatures throughout

the American South passed laws designed to restrict and forestall black political participation.10

We call these laws franchise restriction laws. Most franchise restriction laws fall into one of

three categories: the poll tax, literacy requirements, and ballot box laws. Poll tax laws required

individuals to provide evidence that they have paid their “poll tax” for the current year (and in

some cases required evidence that individuals were current over a long-number of years) in order

to vote. Literacy-test laws typically required individuals to read and explain a portion of the

9
  The two papers in economics most closely related this analysis are Naidu (2012) which identifies a
causal link between disenfranchisement and reductions in state level spending on black schools and a
recent paper by Cascio and Washington (2012), which finds that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (which
reversed the processes we analyze and returned the franchise to southern blacks) led to dramatic increases
in black voter participation and induced a shift in the distribution of state aid toward localities with large
black populations.

state constitution, to the arbitrary satisfaction of an election official, prior to voting. Finally,

several states passed collections of onerous election laws that required individuals to cast

separate ballots for different offices into a set of up to 8 different ballot boxes (invalidating all

votes by an individual if even one ballot was miscast), blocked the use of party symbols or color

coding on ballots, and barred any assistance in navigating the complicated voting procedure by

imposing a “secret ballot” requirement. One might, therefore, consider ballot box laws as a type

of literacy test. Accordingly, in our empirical analysis, we collapse the ballot box and literacy

test laws into a single treatment.

        Table 1 lists all of the franchise restriction laws passed by Southern states between 1877

and 1910. 11 Except for Georgia and Virginia, which passed their first poll tax as soon as

Reconstruction ended, Southern states passed their first poll tax laws after 1889 and before 1905.

Arkansas and Virginia passed multiple poll tax laws because earlier measures were struck down

by the courts or were repealed and later revived by the legislature. Seven of the eleven states

passed laws requiring a literacy test to establish voting eligibility. Mostly, these laws were

enacted during the 1890s or very early 1900s. Ballot box measures were passed by every state in

the South except Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia. Outside of Florida, which passed its law in

1889, all of the ballot-box laws were enacted during the 1890s.

        The question that first motivated our research (and a long list of prominent scholars

before us) is directed at understanding the efficacy of these laws: did they drive

disenfranchisement, or were black voter participation rates already trending down even before

their passage so that blacks would have been disenfranchised even without their passage? With

11
  We include the state of Texas in Table 1 for completeness. However, we exclude Texas from our
subsequent analysis for two reasons. First, having been recently admitted to the union, Texas' post-
reconstruction experience was different from that of the other southern states. Second, and more
importantly, the voting data for Texas appears to be systematically corrupted, with voter turnout rates
recorded in the data that are unbelievably high -- often exceeding county populations.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 7


the right data, answering this question would be a simple econometric exercise: compile a panel

of Southern states and, using a difference-in-differences set up, identify how franchise restriction

laws alter the level and trend in black voter participation rates. The difficulty arises because

voter participation rates for nineteenth and early twentieth century are aggregated across racial

groups and are not reported separately for blacks and whites. To address this problem, Kousser

for example, works one state at a time and uses ecological decomposition techniques. He

computes mean suffrage changes for the periods immediately preceding and following passage

of a combination of a literacy test and poll tax. He finds that suffrage rates dropped less in the

period directly preceding the passage of these laws than they did in the period immediately

following their passage. Based on this analysis, Kousser concludes that “the relatively small

declines in Negro voting previous to disfranchisement [laws]” were important only to the extent

that they facilitated the passage of poll taxes and literacy tests.

        As a way of previewing our turnout analysis, Figure 1 summarizes the relationship

between percent black and voter participation in Mississippi counties for the years 1876, 1888,

1892 and 1904. Notice that for 1876, while Reconstruction was still in play and federal troops

still occupied parts of the South to prevent violence at the polls, the estimated relationship is

positive, and voter turnout rises slightly with the proportion of the population that is black. This

suggests that blacks were voting at higher rates than whites in Mississippi at this point in time,

and/or that as the proportion of the population that was black rose (along with black political

influence) it spurred whites to vote at higher rates. In either case, the pattern suggests a high

degree of black political participation, which is consistent with the available anecdotal and

fragmentary quantitative evidence.         Yet by 1888, the relationship has reversed itself and

increases in percent black are associated with sharp reductions in voter turnout. Just four years
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement       Page 8


later, disenfranchisement is almost complete: to see this note that for both 1892 and 1904, as

percent black approaches 100 percent, predicted turnout is almost zero.              This basic pattern is

repeated across all southern states over this time period. In our formal analysis, we explore the

extent to which the relationship between voter turnout and black population level changed as a

result of the implementation of poll taxes, literacy requirements, and ballot-box measures.

Because of a lack of directly measured data on black turnout rates, in our turnout analysis we are

forced to infer turnout rates based on ecological decompositions that are in spirit similar to this

graphical analysis.

        While we are sensitive to general concerns about ecological decompositions, we are

confident of our approach and the interpretations that flow from that approach. The primary

concern is that systematic patterns that we observe at the county-level between voter turnout and

percent black are driven by white responses to the relative size of the black population. There

are several reasons why we do not think that this is a plausible explanation for the results we

present below. First, our analysis is focused on federal elections. Thus, the relevant electorate to

which white voters should respond is at the Congressional District and/or State level. We base

our analysis on inter-county variation and as a result this source of bias should be attenuated.

Second, a large number of our counties contain populations that are more than 65% black.

Explaining the magnitude of the changes we see in voting turnout in these counties based on

white response to black populations would require unrealistically large shifts in the behavior of

these white voters. Third, and perhaps most important, the patterns that we see in the data are

inconsistent with this explanation. Relative turnout in black counties is decreasing as anti-black

activism (both formal and informal) is increasing. If turnout patterns were driven by white

response to black voters, we should expect to see white turnout increasing in highly black
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement       Page 9


districts as Democrats and vigilante groups such as the Klan moved aggressively to restore the

"Solid South". Fourth, our results are robust to the inclusion of a broad set of interacted fixed

effects and trends. Finally, variation in our imputed measures of disenfranchisement have the

expected statistical relationship to both our measures of informal disenfranchisement activities

and the behavior of elected officials. These observations and the strong internal consistency that

appears in our analysis suggest our approach is sound.



Identifying the Causes of Disenfranchisement



        Before turning to the specifics of empirical strategy, a few words about data are in order.

We use county-level data on election turnout in Congressional and Presidential Elections.12 The

data were originally compiled by Jerome Clubb, William Flanigan, and Nancy Zingale.13 The

original dataset reports total votes cast at the county-level for every congressional and

presidential election between 1840 and 1972. We merge a subset of the years from this dataset

with county-level population data to create panels of year-by-county turnout measures – one

panel for congressional elections and one panel for presidential elections. These turnout

measures are constructed simply as total votes cast divided by total population in a given county

and year. Our final data set covers voter turnout data for congressional and presidential elections

and the percent of each county's population that is black for the years 1872 to 1912. In later

analysis the data are also aggregated at the congressional district level. Limitations inherent in



12
   In later analyses, we use state-level data on gubernatorial election turnout. We omit gubernatorial
elections from this particular analysis because of a lack of readily available data on county-level turnout
in these elections.

A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 10


the available census data and occasional changes in county boundaries provide challenges on this

front, and these challenges will be identified and discussed below.

        Percent black is computed simply as total black population divided by total population in

a given county and year.14 The counts of total black population and total population are taken

from the 1860-1920 Decennial Censuses of Population. In most cases, we linearly interpolate

between the two nearest Census years to obtain intercensal estimates of each of these counts and

the corresponding percent black. One challenge in constructing the data is the fact that a number

of new counties are created during the time period of interest. The creation of these new

counties is accompanied by changes in the boundaries of existing counties. When this occurs,

linear interpolation misrepresents changes in the percent of the population that is black within a

county in non-Census years. For instance, suppose that a county’s boundaries change in 1876 in

a way that increases the percentage of the population that is black. It would be inappropriate to

use the change in the black population in that county between the 1870 and 1880 Censuses to

construct a continuous linear growth rate for all years within this decade, when in reality there is

a discrete jump at 1876.

        To address this issue, we identify all distinct “versions” of each county throughout the

panel, where a county is coded as a new “county version” each time that its boundaries change.

Using this approach, we construct percent black using only Census data from the same county

version. Specifically, we begin by identifying new counties that appear in each of the decennial




14
  One might also be interested in the percent of the voting-eligible population that is black. However,
there is not sufficient information in all of the Censuses to consistently construct such a measure. In
particular, the 1870 and 1880 Censuses do not report counts of population that are broken down by race,
gender, and age.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement        Page 11


Censuses. Then, we identify (1) the specific year that each new county was created and (2) the

surrounding counties that were modified in order to create this county.15

        There are two categories of problem counties to address: counties that are newly created

and counties that are modified. Of 841 counties in our sample, 643 (76 percent) counties exist

and are unmodified during the entire period of interest (1875-1912). 78 counties are newly

created. 102 counties are modified once (including several of the created counties) and 11 are

modified twice. For a newly created county, total and black populations for the few years prior

to its first year in the Census are estimated using a linear extrapolation of these counts from the

two following Censuses. For instance, to obtain percent black in 1876 for a county that appears

in 1876 we linearly extrapolate the rates of change in total and black population back based on

the trend between 1880 (the first Census for which the county is observed) and 1890.

        For pre-existing but modified counties, we conduct a similar procedure with the added

complication that we must extrapolate from future Censuses to obtain estimates for the new

“county version” and we must extrapolate from previous Censuses to obtain estimates for the

pre-existing county version. To make this clear, consider the pre-existing counties that were

modified to create a new county. Estimates of total and black population for years strictly

between 1870 and 1876 are constructed using rates of growth from the 1860 and 1870 Censuses.

Estimates for 1876 and the remaining years of the decade are constructed using rates of growth

from the 1880 and 1890 Censuses.16



15
   We use the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries to accomplish this. This resource can be found at
http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/. Using the Atlas, we manually record the date that a new county
is created and the counties that were modified to create it.
16
   We lose six observations as a result of this method. In particular, to use this method to estimate percent
black for non-Census years, there must be two Census observations of the relevant county version on
either side of the change. Thus, if a county changes twice within one decade, we cannot construct percent
black for any years in between the first and second changes.

The Relative Importance of Formal vs. Informal Disenfranchisement



Our analysis begins with a series of cross-sectional regressions run separately for each unique

state x presidential election pair17. The goal is to show how the relationship between county-

level racial composition and voter turnout evolves over the study period. Our approach was

previewed above in the discussion of Mississippi counties in figure 1; here, however, we develop

a formal apparatus which, though simple, undergirds our approach to the relevant ecological

decomposition. We start with the regression model:



        #                  ∗                                ∗

        (1)



where j indexes county version and t indexes election (year). For a given state x presidential

election pair, assuming that black and white turnout rates are independent of county demographic

composition, the estimated coefficients from this regression (α and β) recover white and black

turnout percentages for each state in each election.

        Ideally, we would like to observe black turnout rates and study the impact of

disenfranchising interventions directly. As discussed above, such data do not exist, so we rely on

an ecological decomposition approach that assumes that high turnout in a district with a high

concentration of blacks implies a high black turnout rate, whereas low turnout -- perhaps after

disenfranchisement -- implies low black turnout. One minor issue is that because our analysis


17
   Here we focus on presidential elections because data are missing for some states for some
congressional elections -- making the visual presentation of the data that follows more difficult. In the
statistical analysis that follows, our results are not sensitive to the choice of Presidential vs. Congressional
turnout data.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement       Page 13


takes total white and black populations as controls and not the corresponding voting-eligible

populations, our estimates of turnout and the impact of disenfranchisement will be smaller in

magnitude than had we based our percentages on voting-eligible populations.18 However, as we

are interested primarily in documenting changes in turnout in response to formal and informal

interventions, this is a minor concern.

        With these caveats in mind, once we have estimated equation (1), we can tie the

estimated relationship to the fitted regression lines in the scatter plots from figure 1 above

through the following relationship:



                                      ∗              .                                                (2)



From equation (2) it is apparent that the slope of the fitted line in the Mississippi scatter plots

recovers an estimate of the difference in mean turnout rates for blacks and whites.

        For each state, Figure 2 plots the evolution over time of estimated white turnout

(diamonds), estimated black turnout         (squares), and estimated black turnout as a percentage of

estimated white turnout       (triangles). The vertical lines in the figure denote the years in which

different ballot restrictions first came in to force.         While there is substantial noise in the

relationships, in all ten states the steady erosion of the black franchise is clear.              In some

   As discussed above in the data section, due to limitations in the census data, we constructed our data
based on black and white populations per county rather than voting eligible populations (race specific
counts of males over the age of 18). In earlier versions of our work, we analyzed interpolated data for
eligible voters – yielding results consistent with those presented here. However, our concern about
potential biases that could be introduced by this interpolation led us to focus our analysis on turnout as a
percentage of population. With the obvious limitation that systematic changes in the relative age
compositions of the black and white populations could impart bias into our estimates. Such systematic
changes do not seem to occur; the difference between the voting-eligible fraction of the white population
and the same measure for the black population remains essentially constant over our study period.

instances the importance of legalized ballot restrictions are readily apparent: the combination of

poll tax, secret ballot and literacy test which all came into effect in Mississippi for the 1892

election; the poll tax and literacy test initially in effect in North Carolina in 1904; Tennessee's

poll tax and multi-box ballot law effective for the 1892 election; and, the combination of literacy

test and re-enactment of a poll tax in Virginia in effect for 1904. However, in the remaining

states it is difficult to differentiate the effects of ballot restrictions from the secular trends; and in

all instances (with the possible exception of Tennessee) the data suggest that the passage of legal

ballot restrictions is preceded by an erosion of the black franchise.

        Having summarized the data in figure 2, we turn now to a formal statistical analysis and

adopt a more elaborate regression framework. Equation (3) presents our baseline specification:



                                ∗                     ∗               ∗        ∗                   ∗

           ∗        ∗                                   .   (3)



Note that j indexes county-version, s indexes state and t indexes election (year). County-version

( ) and year (          fixed effects are included in all specifications. Pct Vote and Pct Black are

percentages based of the entire county population. Finally, tax is an indicator for a poll tax being

in force and lit is an indicator that either an explicit literacy test or combination of ballot law and

secret ballot were in force (see Table 1). For the regression analysis, our sample consists of

elections from 1876 to 1912. (Note that we start in 1876 because that is commonly seen as the

last election of the Reconstruction era, and because, based on Figure 2, it is the peak of black

turnout in many states).
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 15


          Tables 2.A and 2.B present results from these regressions for Congressional and

Presidential elections. They decompose the overall reduction in Congressional (Presidential)

election turnout from 14.9% (15.6%) to 7.16% (6.98%) that occurred between 1876 and 1912

into its component parts.19

          Model 1 is our baseline specification from equation (3). Both the literacy test (along with

secret ballot and multi-box laws) and the poll tax are predicted to have a significantly negative

impact on black turnout. For instance, using data from Congressional elections (Table 2A), the

model predicts that the poll tax decreases black turnout by roughly 2.2 percentage points relative

to whites while the literacy test is predicted to decreases black turnout by roughly 9.0 percentage

points relative to whites. Notably, the poll tax – which also impacted white voters – is predicted

to significantly decrease their turnout as well, but at less than half the rate that it is predicted to

decrease black turnout.

          Model 2 adds a trend variable to equation (3). The trend captures the secular decrease in

black franchise relative to white franchise (presumably driven by informal mechanisms such as

fraud, violence and intimidation) that began following Reconstruction: (year – 1876) * percent

black. The inclusion of this trend diminishes the estimated effects of the laws observed in

Column 2, highlighting the importance of controlling for these informal means of

disenfranchisement. One way to characterize these results is to compute how many years of

secular/informal disenfranchisement (as measured by the interaction between trend and percent

black) would be required to achieve the same level of disenfranchisement as occurred in

response to the passage of the Poll Tax and Literacy laws. This "years" equivalency is reported in

the row labeled “Impact of Poll Tax + Literacy Requirement.” The results of model 2 suggest

that these laws accelerated black disenfranchisement by roughly 22 to 31 years. However, model
19
     The figures quoted are cross-county averages.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 16


2 markedly underestimates the coefficient on trend because it fails to account for the change in

trend that occurred following the passage of poll tax and literacy laws.

        In models 3 and 4, we explicitly address the issue of changing trends. In model 3 we

allow the trend to change after the imposition of both a poll tax and a literacy test through the

inclusion of a "Post-law trend" variable and its interaction with percent black. Thus, the

coefficient on “Trend X Pct. Black” can now be interpreted as the trend in turnout prior to formal

disenfranchisement; that is, one might interpret the coefficient as a rough measure of the impact

of informal methods of disenfranchisement that gradually stripped blacks of their voting rights

even in the absence of poll taxes and literacy laws. Model 4 replicates model 3, but further

strengthens identification through the inclusion of a fully interacted set of state and year fixed

effects. This sharper identification comes at the expense of identifying the main effects of the

laws. It is our most robust specification. With the exception of a slightly diminished predicted

impact of the laws in model 4 relative to model 3, results across the two specifications are

roughly similar. Thus, in the remaining discussion we focus on Model 4. Using data from either

congressional or presidential elections, we find that – in the absence of poll taxes or literacy tests

– black turnout decreases by roughly 1.5 percentage points every four years relative to white

turnout. Consistent with the suggestion that the laws themselves achieved near-total

disenfranchisement, this trend in relative black turnout flattens significantly with the passage of

formal disenfranchisement measures. Also, post-law black turnout decreases, relative to that of

whites, by just 0.5 percentage points every four years following passage of the formal laws.

        Finally, model 4 indicates that, if both poll taxes and literacy tests were passed

simultaneously (as was often the case), black turnout would decrease by 4-5 percentage points

(depending on whether we consider presidential or congressional data). Thus, it is clear that both
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 17


informal and formal means of disenfranchising blacks had a meaningful impact. Based on our

estimates, the introduction of disenfranchising polices accelerated total black disenfranchisement

by approximately 11-12 years.



The Path from Informal to Formal Disenfranchisement



While it is clear that informal and formal means of disenfranchisement each had significant

direct impacts on restricting blacks’ access to the ballots, years of violence and intimidation may

have been causal in the sense that they paved the way to allowing the formal voting restrictions

to pass (Kousser, 1974). In this section, we assess this claim. Put differently, we ask: To what

extent was an increase in informal disenfranchisement a necessary condition for the

establishment of formal disenfranchisement?

        To answer this question, we construct a continuous state- and year-specific measure of

disenfranchisement, which we then use to examine the growth in disenfranchisement

immediately prior to the passage of poll tax and literacy laws. In particular, we begin with the

(black turnout) estimates that were used to construct the graphs in Figure 2 (which resulted from

state- and year- specific regressions of turnout on percent black). Within each state, we create a

normalized ′ which runs between 0 and 1.             Our “continuous disenfranchisement” measure is

then constructed as (1- ′). Thus, for a particular state, when this value is equal to zero black

voting rates are at their highest point and when the value reaches one disenfranchisement has

reached its peak.

        Table 3 reports the means of election-to-election (two year) growth in this continuous

disenfranchisement measure prior to the enactment of disenfranchising laws. We report the
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 18


increase in disenfranchisement experienced immediately prior to a law being enacted (that is, the

difference between the measure one election prior to the law and the measure two elections prior

to the law) and also the average growth across all other previous elections. Notably, there is a

sharp increase in disenfranchisement one period prior to a law being introduced, which provides

initial evidence that an acceleration in the degree of informal disenfranchisement is associated

with the passage of formal mechanisms.

        Table 4 provides more direct evidence. Here we estimate a Cox proportional hazard

model, predicting the probability of passage of any policy (column 1), a literacy test or ballot law

(column 2), or poll tax (column 3) as a function of the same one-period lagged increase in

disenfranchisement as is reported in Table 3. In column 1 we find that increasing growth in this

measure is a significant predictor of introducing a law, providing further support for the means

comparisons of table 3. Turning to columns 2 and 3, we find that this result is largely driven by

the introduction of literacy tests/ballot laws. While the coefficient estimate is positive, this model

does not provide a statistically significant prediction that growth in informal disenfranchisement

accelerates the introduction of poll taxes.

        To summarize our results, we find that both informal and formal means of

disenfranchisement were important, with restrictive voting laws accelerating the process of

disenfranchisement started by informal means. Moreover, tables 3 and 4 (in combination with

the preceding results) suggest that informal disenfranchisement played two roles: actively

disenfranchising blacks (at a rate of roughly 3% points per decade) but also paving the way to

the passage of voting restrictions to achieve near-complete disenfranchisement of blacks.



Direct Tests for Mechanisms of Informal Disenfranchisement
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 19




To this point, our analysis has implicitly identified informal disenfranchisement as that

disenfranchisement which cannot be explained by the passage of formal barriers to the vote.

While the vast majority of these disenfranchising activities are unrecorded, we are able to

identify and test two direct proxies for informal modes of disenfranchisement: (1) lynching and

(2) Democratic control of state government which gave the party direct administrative control of

the electoral process.

        Historians and contemporary commentators have described the transition from

Reconstruction-era suffrage to the implementation of “formal” disenfranchisement as taking

place in three phases which can be characterized as: (1) the intimidation stage, (2) the dilution

stage, and (3) disenfranchisement.20 Our lynching and state government control measures are

meant speak to the first and second of these phases respectively. The "intimidation" stage is

characterized by violence and threats of violence towards blacks. Democrats had not yet regained

power and as such were unable to restrict blacks’ ballot access through institutional mechanisms.

Instead, blacks who supported Republicans were threatened with violence (and economic

sanctions), allowing Democrats to gain some footing in returning to office despite facing largely

black, pro-Republican electorates. Anecdotal evidence suggests that violence played a significant

role. For instance, when Democrats regained power of the state legislature in North Carolina for

the first time since Reconstruction, “Klan activity was reported in at least ten of the fifteen

counties gained by the conservatives, and the conservatives victory was due less to an increase in

their vote than to a decline in that of the Republicans” (Olsen, 1980). While such anecdotal

evidence abounds, we are aware of only one attempt to provide quantitative evidence of this

20
  For contemporary references, see for instance Hamm (1899), Dunning (1901) and Poe (1902). For
examples of the treatment of these phases of disenfranchisement by historians, see for instance Perman
(2001) and Kousser (1999). Kousser, in particular, is responsible for the language used here.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement    Page 20


relationship. As we discuss below, this prior work finds no evidence of a link between violence

and disenfranchisement.

        The “dilution” phase is characterized by fraud and government attempts to minimize the

influence of the black electorate without yet formally preventing blacks from voting (as

eventually occurs with the passage of laws such as literacy requirements an poll taxes).21 Once in

control of state government, Democrats leveraged their control of the election apparatus,

employing a variety of methods to maintain their power. Democratic governors were able to

appoint their preferred agents to supervise elections. In some instances, this led to polling

locations purposefully located a great distance from largely black communities or last-minute

changes to polling locations of which only white voters were notified (Dunning, 1901). This also

facilitated fraud and bribery that was both blatant and unpunished; Hamm (1899) for instance

notes that “ballot boxes were stuffed with tissue ballots and forgery on tally sheets was freely

committed.” Gerrymandering was another widely used approach; an extreme example is

Mississippi’s “shoestring district” which packed most of the state’s highly black communities

into an electoral district three hundred miles long and twenty miles wide.

        We cannot observe or measure the vast majority of these dilutive activities. However, a

large number of these mechanisms are only possible if Democrats are in control of state

government. Thus, controlling for the formal disenfranchising actions of government and level of

electoral support for Democrats, the impact of these state-sponsored informal actions should

appear in our data as a discontinuous drop in black voting that occurs after a Democrat takes

control of the governors’ office.

21
  Consistent with the extant literature, we classify the poll tax and literacy laws as formal barriers to
black franchise. However, we note that one alternative interpretation of these laws was that while not
erecting a "formal" barrier they instead empowered the party in control of the election mechanisms to
become more successfull in their efforts at informal disenfranchisement through their unchecked
discretion in the application of these laws.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 21




Lynching



While most all scholars agree that violence was used to suppress black voter turnout in the post-

Reconstruction South, there is very little quantitative evidence establishing a causal link between

violence and turnout, or in measuring the magnitude of that link. In the only quantitative

assessment we are aware of, Kousser (1999) examines Republican vote share in a handful of

counties that had experienced a violent incident in the year preceding an election. In most of the

counties he examines, Republican vote share roughly matches the fraction of the population that

is black, which he takes as suggestive evidence that violence did not lead to the “once and for all

destruction of the Republican vote” that one might have expected.

        Using a comprehensive database of lynchings that occurred in the south between 1882

and 1930 22 , we construct a more comprehensive county-level dataset that indicates which

counties have experienced lynchings in the year preceding all biennial elections occurring

between 1882 and 1912. We use this dataset to evaluate the empirical link between violence and

disenfranchisement. Thus, we begin by extending our previous specifications to include a

county-level indicator for the occurrence of a lynching within each given county in the year

leading up to each election. We then fully interact this variable with percent black and the

presence of a poll tax or literacy test/ballot law. For simplicity, we also collapse our controls for

the presence of voting laws into a single indicator for the presence of either of these laws. For

parsimony, we only report results from our most rigorous model specification, which includes


22
  We use the “Historical American Lynching” (HAL) data collection, which is constructed and made
available by Elizabeth Hines and Eliza Steelwater (http://people.uncw.edu/hinese). The data records
lynchings for all of the states in our sample except for Virginia. The original lynching-level database
indicates the race of the victim. In constructing our dataset, we only use lynchings with black victims.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement     Page 22


controls for county fixed effects, state-year fixed effects, and trends. Simpler specifications yield

similar (but stronger) results.

        We begin with the coefficients on “% black X lynching” and “% black X Lynching X

Law,” which estimate the differential impact of a within-county lynching on black turnout before

and after the introduction of formal disenfranchising policies. These coefficients are reported in

Column 1 of Table 5, with estimates from Congressional elections in Panel A and Presidential

elections in Panel B. The estimates imply that when no formal disenfranchising policies have

been passed lynching decreases black turnout by roughly 1-2 percentage points (relative to white

turnout). This negative impact disappears once formal disenfranchising polices are in place. At

least with regard to the signs of the coefficients, this is what we would expect: the presence of

laws, typically associated with Democratic control of government,                  achieves almost total

disenfranchisement. As such, lynching only affects turnout in the absence of such laws.

        However, these results – particularly when examining presidential elections – are

relatively weak. There are two potential explanations for this finding. First, there are relatively

few lynchings in our data. This fact paired with the smaller number of presidential elections may

drive the lack of precision in Panel B. Second, and perhaps more importantly, although a

lynching occurs within a particular county it is likely to impact turnout in surrounding areas as

well. That is, this first specification might conflate treatment and control:               many “treated

counties” are coded as though they are in the “control group.” This would lead our included State

X Year fixed effects to absorb some of the general treatment effect.

        To address the second issue, we broaden our definition of the lynching “treatment,”

considering an observation to be treated if a lynching occurred either within the given county or

in a neighboring county. A county is considered “neighboring” if it is less than 100 miles from
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 23


the reference county (measured from county centroid to county centroid). Model 2 replaces the

within-county treatment with the within-100 miles treatment. For increased flexibility, model 3

includes both measures to allow for differential impacts as a function of distance from the

lynching. In model 3, the within-county and within 100 miles measures are constructed to be

mutually exclusive. The “within 100 miles” coefficients should therefore be interpreted as the

impact of a lynching that occurs in a closely neighboring county.

        Relative to model 1, models 2 and 3 generate results that are both larger in magnitude and

more precise, suggesting that the impact of a lynching does extend beyond the location of the

lynching itself and serves as a more general form of intimidation. Model 2 predicts that a

lynching within 100 miles decreases turnout by 2 to 4 percentage points prior to

disenfranchisement, with little impact afterwards. Model 3 confirms the existence of both a

within-county and neighboring county effect with the within-county effect being roughly 45%

greater in magnitude than the neighboring county effect. Overall, our results suggest that the

within-county change is between 3 and 6 percentage points. For comparison, this effect is

roughly 2 to 3 times larger than the estimated effect of a poll tax under the same empirical

specification (Table 2, Model 4).23

     Are these effects genuinely driven by the intimidation associated with lynching? An

alternative explanation is that our lynching measure merely serves as a proxy for some

unobserved characteristic of the legal environment that may be depressing turnout. While this

would be instructive in its own right, it would not be the direct indication of “informal”

disenfranchisement that we are attempting to provide in this section. To assess this possibility,

model 4 extends model 3 by interacting the coefficients of interest with an indicator variable set


23
  Of course, the black turnout rate is substantially lower by the time poll taxes and literacy tests are
introduced, so comparisons between percentage point changes are made for illustrative purposes only.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 24


to one when the neighboring-county lynching is in a different state. If our lynching measures are

picking up characteristics of the state legal environment, we would expect to see very little

impact of lynchings that are within 100 miles but out of state. Model 4 suggests that this is not

the case. In presidential elections, the effect is identical regardless of whether the nearby

lynching is in- or out-of-state. In congressional elections, the impact of an out-of-state lynching

is marginally smaller, but still significantly negative.



Control of Government



We now examine the impact of a sitting Democratic governor (at the time of an election) on

black turnout. When a Democrat is elected Governor, the party takes control of the state's

election machinery and gains power to appoint election judges and officials. This in turn

empowers the party to pursue the types of informal activities that characterized the "dilution"

stage of informal disenfranchisement.

    There are two potentially important sources of endogeneity between black turnout and

Democratic control of state government. First, any other unobserved factors that are associated

with depressed black voter turnout will also likely be associated with increased electoral success

for Democrats. However, if changes in party control of the election apparatus results in access to

new modes of informal disenfranchisement then there should be a discrete drop in black turnout

once a Democratic governor is in power. This is in contrast to factors which are not associated

with actual control of the governorship. The impact of these factors should vary continuously

and thus can be controlled for by incorporating in our models flexible functional forms of
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement       Page 25


gubernatorial vote share, as well as controls for the proportion of legislative seats held by

Democrats.

     The second potential confounder is the possibility that control of the Governor's office is

associated with other formal means of disenfranchisement - beyond the literacy tests/ballot laws

and poll taxes for which we control. Given our review of the available information we believe

that the laws that we have identified represent a major proportion of the formal rules adopted to

disenfranchise blacks.      We do however concede that one interpretation of the results of this

particular set of analyses is that it captures the net effect of all formal and informal

disenfranchisement associated with Democratic control of the levers of state - exclusive of those

laws specifically modeled in our analysis.

     We take as our “treatment” an indicator variable that is equal to one if the governor in office

at the time of an election is a Democrat.24 We include as controls a quadratic in the Democratic

vote share in the most recent Governor's race. These controls, as well as the Democratic

governor indicator, are fully interacted with percent black. To more fully capture the state

political environment, we also include controls for the composition of the state legislature in a

subset of the regressions.25

     Table 6 reports the impact of a Democratic governor on black voter turnout. Here, we are

primarily interested the interaction of percent black with our treatment (% black X Dem.

governor) – reported in columns 1 and 3. To provide a parallel to the analysis of lynching, in

columns 2 and 4 we report specifications which include the interaction of percent black,

Democrat governor, and the presence of a law (% black X Dem. gov. X Law). However, in this

24
   We observe two third-party governors in our dataset – a “Readjuster” and an “Anti-lottery Democrat.”
In both cases, they are closely aligned (and thus recoded) as either Republican or Democrats.
25
   In particular, we include controls for a quadratic function of fraction of the state legislature that are
Democrats (separately for both upper and lower houses). When included, these state legislature controls
are also fully interacted with percent black and the presence of a formal policy.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 26


specific analysis, Models 1 and 3 are our preferred specifications - for two reasons. First, unlike

lynching, it is less clear that we should expect a difference in the impact of a sitting Democratic

governor before and after a suffrage-restricting policy is passed. Just as a Democrat can interfere

with the election process informally prior to the passage of a law, a Democrat can also allow

loose and potentially harsher interpretations of suffrage-restriction laws after they have passed.

Second, and perhaps more importantly, because passage of literacy tests and poll taxes are so

closely linked to the election of Democratic Governors, there is very little independent variation

in these two measures. This problem is most acute the models that include both time trends and

legislative controls .26

     Considering results for both Congressional and Presidential elections, Models 1 and 3 predict

that when a state has a Democratic governor black turnout is reduced by between 3.5 and 6

percentage points. Under the tighter identification strategy in Model 3, we get a prediction that

black voter turnout was reduced by between 4.5 (4.25) percentage points in Congressional

(Presidential) elections. Models 2 and 4 provide some weak evidence that this effect may be

higher with the passage of a poll tax or literacy test. However, we do not place much emphasis

on these results because, as already stated, there is a lack of post-law observations where

Democrats are not in control; of a total 115 post-law state-year combinations, there is a non-

Democratic governor in just five instances.

     To summarize, in this section we more explicitly explored the impact of “informal”

disenfranchisement on turnout using two proxies motivated by the historical narrative of

disenfranchisement: (1) lynching and (2) Democratic control of state government, which

provided the Democratic Party control of the election machinery. Qualitatively, our results are


26
  This problem is most acute in the data for Presidential elections because we have roughly half as many
Presidential election observations as we do for Congressional elections.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 27


consistent with what one might expect: lynching and Democratic control of government, even

before the introduction of a law, suppresses turnout. What is somewhat surprising is the

magnitude of the effects: both lynching and Democratic control generate relative turnout

reductions that exceed our estimates of the impact of poll taxes and literacy laws. To some extent

this lends credence to Key’s “fait accompli” argument. At a minimum, however, these results

emphasize the importance of viewing disenfranchisement as a gradual, continuous process

accomplished by the collective impact and interaction of informal and formal measures. Moving

into the next section, these findings motivate us to employ both discrete, policy-based measures

and continuous measures of disenfranchisement in analyzing the impact of disenfranchisement

on electoral outcomes and Congressional voting behavior.




The impact of disenfranchisement on policy outcomes



We now turn to perhaps the most novel part of our analysis:                     an examination of how

disenfranchising blacks affected legislative and policy outcomes during the late nineteenth and

early twentieth century. In particular, and as already noted, disenfranchisement undermined the

coalition of black voters and Republican politicians formed during the Reconstruction era.

Hence, in this section we explore how the gradual weakening of this coalition affected the

election of Republicans (extensive margin) and voting behavior within the congress of

representatives of the two major parties (intensive margin). On the extensive margin, we assess

the likelihood of a Democrat being elected to the United States House of Representatives (as a

function of the racial composition of the electorate) and also explore the evolution of Democrats’
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement      Page 28


control of state legislatures. On the intensive margin, we first study how politicians voted on bills

of specific interest to black voters (civil rights bills). Then, using a measure of politicians’

ideology based on their roll-call voting behavior (Poole & Rosenthal’s DW-NOMINATE

scores), we study the impact that disenfranchisement had on the location of policy positions

(voting behavior) of both Congressional Democrats and Republicans relative to the fiscal

ideologies of these two parties.



Data



In addition to panel data on disenfranchising laws and the constructed “continuous

disenfranchisement” measure discussed above, we utilize several supplementary data sources in

the remaining analysis. First, for all district-level analyses, we construct race and population

measures at the congressional district level by aggregating county-level Census data.27 As before,

we obtain intercensal estimates of population through simple linear interpolation of Census data.

Table 7 summarizes this district-level measure of black population for Census years within the

relevant time span. Notably, the black population is very high in a majority of counties; even in

1910 (when average black population is at its lowest point), blacks make up at least 10% of the

population in more than 95% of congressional districts.

        Data on the composition of state legislatures is taken from the Partisan Division of

American State Governments, 1834-1985.28 The data include the numbers of legislators by party



27
   In most cases, counties fully map into congressional districts. When this is the case, we simply
aggregate county-level population data to create congressional district-level data. In some cases, counties
are split across multiple congressional districts, by town and or City Ward. When possible, we allocate
town and/or City Ward-level data to the appropriate congressional district.
28
   Compiled by Dean Burnham (ICPSR Study No. 16).
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 29


for every state legislature (upper house and lower house) between 1834-1986, from which we

construct “fraction democrat” for each observation between 1872-1910.

        Data on the election and behavior of US Representative is taken from the Database of

United States Congressional Historical Statistics, 1789-1989 (ICPSR Study No. 3371). This

database includes several tables; relevant to this study are:



       Election Table: includes one observation for each candidate in an election; provides party

        affiliation for all candidates and congressional district of election.

       Serves Table: one observation for each term served by each representative; provides party

        affiliation and congressional district served.

       Roll Call Table: includes one observation for every roll call vote that every representative

        participated in.



We keep only southern state observations that are from the relevant time period (1872-1910, plus

a handful of Roll Call Votes between 1870-1872). The bills we examine are summarized in the

Table 8. By focusing on this set of bills, we attempt to capture all prominent civil rights-related

roll call votes in the relevant time period.

        Finally, as a measure of politicians’ voting behavior, we use the first dimension of Poole

& Rosenthal’s DW-NOMINATE score. This dimension of the DW-NOMINATE score locates a

politician along a left-right axis based on their voting patterns in each particular Congress

relative to others in the same Congress. Increasingly positive DW-NOMINATE scores indicate a

politician who is farther right (Republican-held positions) on economic issues, while increasingly

negative scores indicate a politician who is farther left (Democrat-held positions). One final issue
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement     Page 30


to note is that the dispersion of DW-Nominate scores varies across Congresses. To increase the

comparability of the DW-Nominate scores across congresses we normalize these scores, dividing

each individual’s score for a given congress by the standard deviation of scores within that

Congress. Our findings are not sensitive to this normalization.



General empirical strategy



In the following analyses we are interested in the relationship between disenfranchisement

interacted with the percentage of an electorate that is black and a variety of outcomes. These

include the likelihood of democrat being elected, civil rights roll-call voting, and DW-Nominate

scores. Our baseline specification for these analyses is:



                    .                                         .



where       .           is the percentage of the population that is black within district d at time t

and               is one of two measures of disenfranchisement. Of particular interest are the

coefficients on “percent black” and “pct. black X disenfranchised.” The former informs us of the

influence that a largely black electorate can have on shaping policy outcomes when allowed to

vote, while the latter documents the extent to which that influence diminishes as voting rights are

stripped.

        In some specifications (labeled “policy” in the tables that follow), the disenfranchisement

measure is simply an indicator variable with                       1 if there is a disenfranchising policy

(literacy test or poll tax) enacted in the state that district d is located in at time t. For simplicity,
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement      Page 31


throughout this section we assess the impact of the presence of any disenfranchising policy,

rather than separating the impacts of literacy tests and poll taxes as in the previous section. In

other specifications (labeled “cont. disenf.” in tables that follow),                   is our constructed

continuous disenfranchisement measure.

        The dependent variable          and additional controls vary with the question of interest, but

all specifications include state and year fixed effects. We also include controls for party

affiliation. In the analysis of Congressional election outcomes, the unit of observation is a single

election outcome and thus we are able to control for the number of terms that the incumbent had

served at the time of the election. Whatever the unit of observation, however, standard errors are

clustered at the congressional district level (with each change in a district’s boundaries being

coded as a new district.)

        Throughout this section, “percent black” is re-centered around its mean, which varies

across our different datasets but is roughly 42%. This does not change the estimation or

interpretation of the coefficient on “percent black” or any of the terms with which “percent

black” is interacted. It merely allows us to interpret the “disenf.” coefficient as the impact of

disenfranchisement in the average county, rather than in a county with no black citizens. This

facilitates easier interpretation of the estimated coefficients as most counties have relatively high

percentage black (as documented in Table 7.)

        Finally, when we assess the effect of disenfranchisement on party politics, we look at

legislatures rather than individual representatives/candidates.             Accordingly, in regressions

looking at the party composition of legislatures, we regress “fraction of members of the

legislature that are Democrats” on some measure of disenfranchisement, either policy indicators
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 32


or the continuous measure. Again, state and year fixed effects are included. Bootstrapped

standard errors are clustered at the state-level.



Results: Political outcomes on the extensive margin



This section documents the impact that disenfranchisement had on the election of politicians

(and in turn, the election of policies). Democrats pushed disenfranchisement forward (at least

partially) with the goal of reducing Republicans’ influence, so not surprisingly they were the

party to benefit from disenfranchisement. In our analysis of the extensive margin we first

examine the impact of disenfranchisement on the partisan composition of state legislatures and

then estimate the impact of disenfranchisement on the likelihood that a Democrat will succeed in

an election for the US House of Representatives in a Southern district.

        Table 9 documents Democrats’ gains at the state legislature level. Taking as the unit of

observation a state legislative term. The table reports the results of regressing the fraction of

members of each legislature that are Democrats on our measures of disenfranchisement, for both

Upper Houses (columns 1 and 3) and Lower Houses (columns 2 and 4). In columns 1 and 2 our

results suggest that a formal anti-black voting policy (such as a poll tax, literacy test, or ballot

law) is in place, while in columns 3 and 4 we employ our constructed continuous measure which

incorporates both formal and informal disenfranchisement.

        Regardless of which measure we use, we find a significant increase in Democrat control

as disenfranchisement takes hold. Notably, the magnitude of the effect of our continuous

measure is much larger. Recall that the continuous measures captures the effects of both formal

and informal modes of disenfranchising black voters. Thus, the larger magnitude of coefficients
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 33


on the continuous measure (which therefore indirectly contains the “policy” measure)

emphasizes the importance of both of these mechanisms in determining the relative partisan

compositions of the state legislatures.

        In Table 10 we evaluate the impact of disenfranchisement on Congressional elections

Taking each election for US House of Representatives (within the relevant states and time

period) as the unit of observation, we estimate linear probability models assessing the likelihood

that a Democrat is elected as a function of the electoral environment they face (the racial

composition of the electorate and disenfranchisement status). Whether we measure

disenfranchisement strictly with respect to formal policies (column 1) or using our more general

continuous measure (column 2), two important patterns emerge, both of which are more

pronounced under the use of our continuous measure of disenfranchisement (Column 2). First,

when blacks have access to the ballot, the presence of a large number of blacks within a district

markedly reduces the probability that a Democrat wins the district (albeit insignificantly so when

using the “policy” measure). Second, as blacks were stripped of voting rights, this influence not

only disappeared but was reversed. The positive coefficients on “Disenf. X Pct. Black”

demonstrate that Republicans’ advantage in high-black districts shrank as disenfranchisement

increased. More striking is the fact that the marginal impact of “pct. black” conditional on blacks

being disenfranchised (the linear combination Pct. Black + (Disenf. X Pct. Black)) is also

positive and significant. Thus, disenfranchisement accomplished more than eliminating

Republicans’ advantage: it also shifted the advantage to the Democrats, perhaps driven by white

animosity towards blacks in high-black districts.



Results: Political outcomes on the intensive margin
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 34




We conclude our analysis of the political economy of disenfranchisement by exploring its impact

on the voting behavior of Congressional Representatives. We explicitly consider both sides of

the Republicans’ coalition with black voters.           It is not surprising that the black franchise

impacted congressional outcomes at the extensive margin, aiding the election of Republicans.

Less clear is the impact that black voting had on the intensive margin. Did the black franchise

just lead to the election of Republicans who strongly supported civil rights for blacks ex ante?

Or, did the franchise actually empower black constituencies to demand stronger policy positions

from Republicans once they were elected?                  Conversely, did large enfranchised black

constituencies embolden Republican congressmen to take more partisan positions on economic

issues? With these issues in mind, we first assess representatives’ roll call voting behavior in the

context of civil rights bills and then in the context of unrelated bills (as summarized by the first

dimension of the DW-Nominate score.) In both sets of analyses, we first examine the impact of

disenfranchisement on legislator voting behavior in general to provide some sense of how

disenfranchisement shifted policy outcomes. We then examine how the disenfranchisement

differentially impacted the behavior of Republicans and Democrats.

        Pooling votes from all of the bills listed in Table 8, Table 11 presents the results of linear

probability models assessing the likelihood that a representative voted against the interest of

blacks. Column 1 uses the simple “policy” indicator as our measure of disenfranchisement, while

column 2 uses the continuous measure. 29 As before, the results are qualitatively similar

regardless of which measure is used. First – and unsurprisingly – Republicans are less likely to


29
  We have fewer observations in Column 2 because our continuous measure only goes as far back as
1872 and several roll call votes of interest take place before 1872. Dropping the pre-1872 bills from
column 1 to achieve a set of bills directly comparable to column 2 does not substantially change the
existing results.
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 35


vote against the interest of blacks. However, conditional on party affiliation, we find that the

likelihood of voting anti-black varies substantially with the degree of disenfranchisement and the

percent of a representative’s electorate that is black. In particular, when blacks have access to the

ballots, representatives from increasingly black districts are significantly less likely to vote

against the interest of blacks. However, as disenfranchisement takes hold, these representatives

become significantly more likely to vote anti-black (the linear combination of Pct. Black and

(Disenf. X Pct. Black) coefficients is positive and significant.) This, we think, is a striking

finding, highlighting how large black populations in a given place promoted black political

interests before disenfranchisement but undermined them afterward. In columns 3 and 4, we

repeat the analysis from columns 1 and 2 but allow for a differential response by Democrats and

Republicans. While the responses of legislators from the two parties move in the same direction

with respect to percent black and disenfranchisement, columns 3 and 4 demonstrate that

Republicans largely drive the results. Republicans from high-black districts are significantly less

likely to vote anti-black prior to disenfranchisement, while both Democrats and Republicans

from high-black districts are more likely to vote against the interest of blacks after

disenfranchisement.

        These patterns of course mirror our findings from the previous section. When blacks have

the franchise, democrats are at a disadvantage in high-black districts and representatives from

high-black districts (controlling for party) are more willing to support black interests. With

disenfranchisement, Democrats gain a relative advantage in high-black districts and

representatives actually become more antagonistic to black policy concerns than are their

Democratic colleagues in low-black districts. The combination of these results provides evidence

of the strength and importance of the role that the black franchise plaid in facilitating black
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 36


access to the political process through their coalition with Republican interests. Further, they

highlight the fact that loss of the franchise not only led to the loss of access to the political

process, but actually paved the way to the election of legislators who actively worked against the

interests of the black populations living within their districts.

        Finally, we examine how this coalition (and its demise) affected voting on Republican

interests, exclusive of civil rights. Tables 12a and 12b reports the results of regressions that take

as the dependent variable the first dimension of the DW-Nominate score. Recall that the DW-

Nominate score places each representative (with one observation per congress) along a left-right

spectrum based on how they voted on economic-related issues. Increasingly positive (negative)

scores are associated with increasingly conservative (liberal) voting records.

        In Table 12a, we employ the same general empirical specification that has been used

throughout this section, including state and year fixed effects. In Table 12b, we take advantage of

the fact that most congressmen serve in multiple congresses and include congressman fixed

effects. 30 This allows us to better identify how a politician reacts to a changing electorate,

whereas the state and year fixed effects specifications may partially capture a changing

electorate’s propensity to elect a more (or less) extreme candidate. Results are qualitatively

similar regardless of which approach we use.

        Models 1 and 2 (in both Tables 12a and 12b) estimate the average impact of

disenfranchisement and percent black on policy outcomes (as measured by DW-Nominate

scores) using each of our two measures of disenfranchisement. 31 The significant positive


30
   This approach is not feasible in the analysis of voting on civil rights bills, as we do not work with
consecutive congresses there. Thus, there are far fewer repeated observations of individuals.
31
   A shortcoming of this approach is that because the sample consists of every representative from every
Congress (between 1872-1910), any individual who served multiple terms in Congress appears in the
dataset several times. To address this issue, we have run alternative specifications which aggregate the
data to the representative level, averaging DW-Nominate score and relevant covariates across all of an
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 37


coefficient on “pct. black” suggests that, controlling for party, in the presence of a black

franchise large black constituencies lead legislators to adopt more conservative voting behavior.

However, this result is eliminated with disenfranchisement. Despite the strong relationship that

exists in the absence of a policy, once a policy is enacted there is no statistical relationship

between the between percent black within a representative’s district and his voting behavior.

Again, this seems striking. It shows that black disenfranchisement not only affected legislative

voting on civil-rights types of issues, but on a broad range of public policies. To our knowledge,

no previous scholarship has documented empirically such an effect.

        Note that unlike our previous analysis, there is no actual reversal in the impact of black

constituencies on the intensive voting margin. In other words, under disenfranchisement we do

not see large black populations being associated with increasingly Democratic voting positions.

Also of interest is that the result here is not more pronounced when we use the continuous

measure of disenfranchisement (and in some cases is insignificant where the policy dummy picks

up a significant relationship).       Recall that the continuous measure in some sense (albeit

indirectly) captures both the effects of formal and informal disenfranchisement. Thus, this can be

interpreted as suggestive evidence that, in the context of legislative roll-call votes, it is primarily

the formal disenfranchisement policies that influence behavior. As before, in Models 3 and 4,

we explore whether these results vary by party. Here, the results are mostly driven by Democrat

voting behavior. That is, we find that – prior to disenfranchisement – Democrats from high black

districts are forced to adopt positions closer to those of Republicans. This is no longer true after

disenfranchisement.




individual representative’s terms. The results are essentially identical whether aggregated to
representative-level or not, so we report only main specifications here.

Concluding Remarks



        The central conclusions of this paper are twofold.              First, we consider the political

economy of the path to disenfranchisement.             In doing so, we provide a new quantitative

assessment of the Key-Kousser debate over the relative importance of formal vs. informal efforts

to disenfranchise black voters. While Kousser was correct in arguing that legal institutions were

an important instrument of political disenfranchisement, he overstated their importance when he

claimed that they were significantly more important than violence and informal institutions.

Specifically, the evidence that we provide suggests that formal disenfranchisement hastened an

extant process of informal disenfranchisement on the order of 10 to 12 years. We also provide

empirical evidence that passage of disenfranchising legislation was predicated on increases in the

level of informal disenfranchisement. Furthermore, we provide statistical evidence supporting

the role of two different informal mechanisms to explain informal disenfranchisement. Of most

note is our finding that having a lynching occur within a given county in the year prior to a given

election reduces black turnout by approximately three to six percentage points; lynchings in

proximate counties suppress black turnout by two to four percentage points.

        Our second set of results regard the impact of disenfranchisement on legislative

outcomes. This is an area that to date has received minimal quantitative analysis. We find that

through their coalition with Republican interests the franchise gave black voters an effective

political voice. However, once the franchise was removed black citizens in predominately black

congressional districts not only lost their political voice, but faced representatives that were

actively hostile to their interests. While this is an intuitive finding, our regressions are the first to

document its magnitude and significance. In addition, and perhaps more surprising, we also find
A Poll Tax by Any Other Name: The Political Economy of Post-Reconstruction Disenfranchisement   Page 39


that, by undermining the coalition between blacks and Republicans, voting on issues unrelated to

civil rights also changed, moving toward more liberal, pro-Democrat outcomes. One mechanism

driving these shifts was a move from a competitive political system, where there was a real

chance for Republicans to win office, to one where the Democratic Party dominated state

legislatures and faced little risk of defeat from Republicans.

     a.     Invalidated by U.S. Circuit Court January 7, 1905, reenacted prior to the Election of 1910.
     b.     The Election Law of 1891 mandated a secret ballot and standardized ballots. In concert, these requirements were a type of de-facto
            literacy test. Illiterate voters could no-longer rely on party symbols and/or similar devices to vote straight party and the secret ballot
            requirement created barriers to voting assistance.
      c.    Several States adopted complicated “multi-box” election laws that required multiple ballots (typically 8) each to be placed in a
            separate ballot box. A mistake in filing a single ballot would disqualify all ballots – thus, these laws operated much like a de facto
            literacy test.
      d.    Combination of Secret Ballot requirement and an onerous change in registration requirements.
      e.    Secret Ballot.
      f.    Secret Ballot w/out Party Identifiers & New Registration Law.
      g.    Virginia’s Poll Tax was repealed 1882 and then re-instated in 1904.
