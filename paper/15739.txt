                                              ABSTRACT

We review different empirical approaches that researchers have taken to estimate how consumption
responds to income changes. We critically evaluate the empirical evidence on the sensitivity of consumption
to predicted income changes, distinguishing between the traditional excess sensitivity tests, and the
effect of predicted income increases and income declines. We also review studies that attempt to estimate
the marginal propensity to consume out of income shocks, distinguishing between three different approaches:
identifying episodes in which income changes unexpectedly, relying on the covariance restrictions
that the theory imposes on the joint behavior of consumption and income growth, and combining realizations
and expectations of income or consumption in surveys where data on subjective expectations are available.

1. Introduction


         How does household consumption respond to changes in economic resources? Does the

response depend on the nature and duration of the changes? Do anticipated income changes have

a different consumption impact than unanticipated shocks? And do transitory income shocks have

a lower impact than permanent ones? These questions are crucial for understanding consumers’

behavior and to evaluate policy changes that impacts households’ resources. Indeed, in virtually

all countries consumption represents more then two thirds of GDP, and knowledge of how

consumers respond to income shocks is crucial for evaluating the macroeconomic impact of tax

and labor market reforms as well as for the design of stabilization and income maintenance

policies. 1 Indeed, both labor economists, macroeconomists and experts in public finance are

active contributors to this literature.

         In this survey we review different empirical approaches that researchers have taken to

estimate these important policy parameters. Our emphasis will be on methods and on the

discussion of the most relevant approaches and empirical results, especially the most recent ones.

Our objective is to critically evaluate evidence on two questions: excess sensitivity tests to

predicted income changes and estimates of the marginal propensity to consume out of income

shocks.

         To put matters in perspective, Figure 1 provides a roadmap to the main links between

consumption and income changes, underscoring the different questions that will be examined.

The main distinction that we draw is between the effect of anticipated and unanticipated income

changes. The Modigliani and Brumberg (1954) and Friedman (1957) celebrated life-cycle and

    A related literature looks at the effect of wealth shocks on consumption (Maki and Palumbo, 2001).



                                                           2
permanent income models posit that people use saving to smooth income fluctuations, and that

they should respond little if at all to changes in income that are anticipated. When this important

theoretical prediction is violated, researchers conclude that consumption is excessively sensitive

to anticipated income changes. While this is a clear implication of the theory, providing a clean

test of the theory encounters two types of problems, one empirical and one theoretical. On the

empirical side, it is very hard to identify situations in which income changes in a predictable way.

But even if the empirical problems can be surmounted, there are many plausible explanations

why the implications of the theoretical models may be rejected, ranging from binding liquidity

constraints to non-separabilities between consumption and leisure, home production

considerations, habit persistence, aggregation bias, and durability of goods.

         Figure 1: A Roadmap of the Response of Consumption to Income Changes


     More recently, the literature has sought to gain further insights by distinguishing between

situations in which consumers expect an income decline or an income increase. While credit




                                                     3
constraints may be responsible for a correlation between consumption and expected income

increases, they cannot explain why consumption reacts to expected income declines, for instance

after retirement. A further distinction that has proven to be useful is between large and small

expected income changes, as consumers might react mostly to the former and neglect the impact

of the latter.

      The branch on the right-hand-side of Figure 1 focuses instead on the impact of

unanticipated income shocks. Here the main distinction is between transitory shocks, which

according to the theory should have a small impact on consumption, and permanent shocks,

which should lead to major revisions in consumption. As with anticipated changes, the literature

has sought to pin down the empirical estimates identifying positive and negative shocks. Since

here the econometrician can study how consumption responds to income innovations, the interest

is in estimating structural parameters (in particular, the marginal propensity to consume) as well

as on testing.

      The survey proceeds as follow. Section 2 summarizes the theoretical literature, and provides

an organizing framework to study the effect of income changes on consumption. Section 3

focuses on expected income changes, distinguishing between the traditional excess sensitivity

tests, the effect of income increases and of income declines. Section 4 reviews three approaches

to estimate the effect of unexpected income changes on consumption: attempts at identifying

episodes in which income changes unexpectedly, estimates of the marginal propensity to

consume that rely on the covariance restrictions that the theory imposes on the joint behavior of

consumption and income growth, and estimates that combine realizations and expectations of

income or consumption in surveys where data on subjective expectations are available. Section 5

concludes.

2. Theoretical predictions



     To organize the discussion, consider the standard problem of an agent who maximizes the

expected utility of consumption over a certain time horizon subject to an intertemporal budget

constraint and a terminal condition on wealth. If consumers can borrow and lend at the same

interest rate and if the utility function is state- and time-separable, one obtains the well-known

Euler equation for consumption:



                                  u ' (cit 1 )  (1   ) 1 Et 1 (1  rt )u ' (cit )         (1)



where c is consumption, r the real interest rate,  the intertemporal discount rate, and Et1 the

expectation operator based on information available at time t1. Equation (1) states that in

equilibrium there are no intertemporal consumption reallocations that can increase consumers’

utility at the margin. If the interest rate is constant and equal to the intertemporal discount rate,

one obtains the result that the marginal utility is a martingale:



                                               Et 1u ' (cit )  u ' (cit 1 )                    (2)



     Ex ante current marginal utility is the best predictor of next period’s marginal utility; ex

post, marginal utility changes only if expectations are not realized, a property of the solution first




                                                         5
noted by Hall (1978). Hence, changes in marginal utility are unpredictable on the basis of past

information. For instance, an anticipated income decline (due to retirement or unemployment),

should not affect the marginal utility of consumption at the time it occurs, because consumers

would have already incorporated the expectation of the income decline in their optimal

consumption plan when the information firstly became known. However, as we shall see,

unexpected income changes do affect the marginal utility of consumption to an extent that

depends on the nature and duration of shocks and the structure of credit and insurance markets.



2.1. The response of consumption to predictable income changes



     Earlier attempts at testing the implication of the theory that the marginal utility is a

martingale relied on the special case of quadratic preferences. This case is known in the literature

as the permanent income model with certainty equivalence (Flavin, 1981; Campbell, 1987).

Under this assumption, equation (2) rewrites as:



                                              cit  cit 1   it                                 (3)



where it = citEt1cit is a consumption innovation, i.e., the effect on consumption of all new

information about the sources of uncertainty faced by the consumer. The sources of uncertainty

may be idiosyncratic or aggregate, and include shocks to income, interest rates, health or

demographic variables. Hence, it is consumption itself, and not marginal utility as in the general




                                                   6
case of equation (2), to behave as a martingale. Ex ante current consumption is the best predictor

of next period’s consumption; ex post, consumption changes only if expectations are not fulfilled.

     Under the null hypothesis that consumption is a martingale, equation (3) gives an

orthogonality condition which can be tested empirically: no variables known in period t1 (and

earlier) should be correlated with changes in consumption between t1 and t. Hence, in the

following regression:



                                                    J
                                          cit   xit' 1 j  j   it                       (4)
                                                   j 0




the permanent income model predicts that j = 0 for all j. The orthogonality condition test does

not require specific assumptions about the sources of uncertainty faced by consumers, but in this

survey we are particularly interested in the case in which the x variable coincides with expected

income changes. Note that rejection of the null hypothesis (j ≠ 0) does not point to specific

reasons why consumption does not follow a martingale, and hence it is intrinsically a weak test of

the theory.



2.2. The response of consumption to unpredictable income shocks



     Another important testable implication of the model is that consumption should respond to

unpredictable changes in the variables the consumer is uncertain about. For working-age

individuals, the most important source of uncertainty is labor income. If the latter is the only

source of uncertainty, equation (3) can be rewritten as:



                                                   7
                                                                  1

                                                                  1  r  Et  Et 1  yit    (5)

                                           annuitization factor




     Equation (5) offers a structural interpretation for the consumption innovation t of equation

(3). The change in consumption between t-1 and t depends only on revisions in the expectations

of future income between the two periods. If no new information about future income arrives,

consumption is constant. In contrast, new information about future income available in period t

induces the consumer to update the optimal consumption plan. The impact of the income

revisions is proportional to an annuitization factor (which depends on the interest rate and the

consumers’ horizon). When the horizon is infinite this factor collapses to r/(1+r).

     The expression (5) is useful because it suggests that different assumptions about the income

process imply very different consumption responses to income shocks. To exemplify, we assume

that the planning horizon is infinite, and consider different income processes. In the first case we

examine, which is often used to characterize macroeconomic series, income follows an

ARMA(1,1) process:



                                         y it  y it 1  vit  vit 1



(with  possibly equal to 1), so that equation (5) rewrites as:




                                                          8
                                                    r 1 r 
                                          cit                  vit                             (6)
                                                   1 r 1 r  



     In equation (6) consumption changes depend on the degree of persistence of the income

process. The more persistent the process, the more volatile is consumption from one year to the

next. To simplify the discussion, consider the AR(1) case and how the AR coefficient affects the

sensitivity of consumption with respect to income shocks. If  = 0 (the income process is not

serially correlated) the marginal propensity to consume with respect to income shocks is r/(1+r).

This happens because when  all variations in income are transitory and individuals consume

only the annuity value of the income revision. Hence in this case consumption is much less

volatile than income. If instead  = 1 (income follows a martingale process), all changes in

income are permanent, and the marginal propensity to consume with respect to income shocks

equals 1.

     Figure 2 plots consumption against time for income processes with different degrees of

persistence (()=(0.95,0.2), (0.8,0.2), (0,0.2), and (0,0.5)) starting from a normalized initial

consumption value of 1 and assuming v=0.1. The figure shows that consumption is much more

variable when the process that generates income is more persistent. Quite clearly, the volatility of

consumption depends heavily on the size of autoregressive coefficient.

     The limitation of the ARMA characterization of the income process is that it restricts shocks

to be only of one type. But since the work of Friedman (1957), economists have recognized that

some of the income shocks are transitory (mean reverting) and their effect does not last long, and

others are highly persistent (non-mean reverting) and their effect cumulates over time. Examples

of transitory shocks are fluctuations in overtime labor supply, bonuses, lottery prizes, and



                                                   9
bequests. Examples of permanent innovations are generally associated with job mobility,

promotions, lay-off, and severe health shocks.

     Figure 2: Consumption Response to Income Shocks of Different Persistence



     A widely adopted characterization of the income process that allows simultaneously for

both permanent and transitory shocks is:



                                           y it  Pit  vit                             (7)



where Pit is the permanent component following a martingale process:




                                                 10
                                           Pit  Pit 1  u it                                (8)



and vit is an i.i.d. transitory component. The consumption equation (5) in this case depends on

both types of shocks:



                                                     r
                                           cit         vit  u it                           (9)
                                                    1 r



which implies that consumption responds one-to-one to permanent income shocks but is nearly

insensitive to transitory shocks.

       To encompass the effect on consumption of various specifications of the income generating

processes one can write a general expression for consumption changes:



                                                       K
                                             cit    k  itk
                                                       k 1




where the income process has K different components, and each differs in its degree of

persistence. The coefficient k measures the effect of the innovation of the k-th income

component on consumption changes. Its size depends on the persistence of the income

component itself and (except for the infinite horizon case) on the consumer’s horizon. To

exemplify, in the case of the ARMA(1,1) process of equation (6), K=1, 1=v, and

       r 1 r 
1=                 . In the case of the process described by equations (7)-(8), K=2, 1=v, 2=u,
      1 r 1 r  




                                                  11
1=(r/1+r), and 2=1. In the finite horizon case, the consumption sensitivity to income shocks is

adjusted by an annuitization factor that grows as the consumer approaches the end of the planning

horizon. Other cases can be obtained in a similar fashion, allowing for aggregate as well as

idiosyncratic income components, or more complex income processes (such as those including

random trends, unevenly distributed aggregate shocks, etc.).

     As shown by Campbell (1987), under the same set of assumptions considered so far (in

particular, quadratic preferences, intertemporal separability, infinite horizon and perfect credit

markets), one can derive the following saving function:



                                                     Et yit  j
                                         sit                                              (10)
                                               j 1   1  r  j


     This equation states that people save when they expect their income to decline, and borrow

when they expect income to increase, an implication of the model that is known as “saving for a

rainy day” and is the mirror image of equation (5). When income follows the process described

by equations (7)-(8), the Campbell equation becomes:



                                                       1
                                             sit          vit
                                                      1 r



     Since income changes that are not consumed are by definition saved, saving responds

(almost) one-for-one to transitory income shocks and is completely insensitive to permanent

shocks. The effect of income shocks can be studied referring to the consumption equation (5) or




                                               12
to the saving equation (10); the particular specification and test adopted depend mainly on data

quality and availability.



2.3. Precautionary saving



     In the quadratic utility model people save only if they expect income to decline, and don’t

change their saving behavior if their income becomes more uncertain. To allow for precautionary

saving, we now assume that preferences are isoelastic, the interest rate is constant and equal to

the intertemporal discount rate, and consumption is log-normally distributed. The first order

condition for utility maximization becomes:

where is the coefficient of relative risk aversion and t is as before a forecast error (in

consumption growth rather than consumption changes). The first term on the right-hand side of

equation (11), absent in the quadratic utility case, is always positive and depends on the

coefficient of relative prudence, which in the isoelastic case is (1+). Along the equilibrium path

an increase in uncertainty (reflected in an increase in the conditional variance of consumption

growth) raises consumption growth and therefore current saving.

     The model with certainty equivalence and the precautionary saving model share the

common prediction that consumption should not respond to anticipated income changes.

However, the implications of the precautionary saving model about the impact of income shocks



                                                   13
are more complex, because with isoleastic preferences there are no closed form solutions for

consumption or consumption growth (no analog of equation (5) linking consumption changes to

income innovations) regardless of the income process. To study the response of consumption to

income shocks one must therefore rely on approximations of the expectation error, such as the

one recently derived by Blundell, Low and Preston (2008):



                                                                       K
                                 ln cit        vart 1 ( ln cit )    k  itk   it   (12)
                                             2                         k 1




where it is an approximation error, and we have allowed for a log income process with K

different components. The effect of the innovation on the k-th income component on

consumption growth is measured by the coefficient k, which now depends not only on the

persistence of the income component itself and the planning horizon, but also on preference

parameters. For example, individuals with preferences characterized by high prudence will have a

relatively low value of k because they have accumulated a buffer of precautionary saving, and

therefore an income shock has a lower impact on their consumption.

    To evaluate this model, one can rely on the simulation results recently produced by Kaplan

and Violante (2009). They simulate a life-cycle model with preferences characterized by constant

relative risk aversion, an income process that distinguishes between permanent and transitory

income shocks, and a pay-as-you-go pension system. Using realistic assumptions about the

parameters of interest, they show that consumers who can freely borrow and save subject to a

terminal condition on wealth are able to smooth transitory shocks to a large extent (the marginal

propensity to consume out of a transitory income shock is 0.05) and permanent shocks to a much



                                                       14
lower extent (the marginal propensity to consume out of a permanent shock is 0.77). 2 When

consumers are unable to borrow, both marginal propensities to consume increase considerably (to

0.18 and 0.93 respectively).

        In the buffer stock model also the discount rate affects the sensitivity of consumption to

income shocks. Simulation results produced by Carroll (2001) show that if consumers are

impatient (r) and log income is the sum of a permanent and an i.i.d. transitory component

(and if consumers face a small but positive probability of zero income in each period), the

implication that transitory income shocks have a negligible impact on consumption still holds

true. Permanent shocks, however, have a somewhat lower impact. In fact, in models with prudent

households a positive income shock reduces the ratio of wealth to permanent income, thus

inducing households to spend part of the income increase to raise their buffer of precautionary

saving. Under a wide range of parameter values, Carroll shows that in this class of models the

marginal propensity to consume out of a permanent income shock is about 0.9.



2.4. Credit and insurance markets



         The models that we have described so far are based on the assumption that consumers

operate in perfect credit markets: they can borrow and lend at the same interest rate as long as

they don’t violate the intertemporal budget constraint and satisfy the terminal condition on wealth.

At the same time, consumers don’t have access to insurance markets, either formal or informal:

the only way to buffer income shocks is by self-insuring, i.e., saving or borrowing in credit

markets. Both assumptions are subject to extensive debate and research.
2
    The authors do not investigate how much of this result is due to the presence of a social security system.



                                                            15
     The consequences of removing these assumptions on the main predictions of the theory can

be far-reaching. Suppose that consumers don’t have access to credit, or are limited in the amount

of borrowing. In the presence of such liquidity constraints, consumers cannot borrow in

anticipation of an income increase, and therefore consumption will change at the time the income

increase materializes, in contrast to the permanent income model. With liquidity constraints the

orthogonality test fails, in the sense that the coefficient attached to positive expected income

change will be statistically different from zero in equation (4). However, when income is

expected to decline consumers can still save, and the orthogonality condition holds.

     In the model with liquidity constraints consumption responds asymmetrically also to

income shocks, because the ability to smooth unexpected and transitory income declines through

borrowing can be seriously affected. Consider for instance an individual who is temporarily laid

off and has no access to credit and no accumulated wealth: the marginal propensity to consume

out of negative and transitory shocks in equation (4) will be higher than predicted by the theory.

On the other hand, consumers will still save when they receive an unexpected and transitory

income increase.

     Insurance opportunities also affect consumption allocations and the response to income

shocks. In a benchmark case, known in the literature as the complete markets model, households

can insure ex-ante all income shocks through a system of contingent transfers, which can either

be provided by formal insurance markets, the government (through taxes, transfers and subsidies)

or family networks (through private transfers). It can be shown that in this case consumption

growth is constant for all households:




                                                16
                                                 ln cit  t                                 (13)



so that individual consumption growth depends only on aggregate components, common to all

individuals, and not on idiosyncratic shocks.

     One way of implementing the complete market equilibrium is through a system of transfers

flowing from individuals receiving positive income shocks to those receiving negative shocks.

This benchmark case is clearly unrealistic, for at least two reasons. First, it assumes that all

shocks are publicly observable. However, when individuals are privately informed about the

shocks they receive, those with positive realizations have an incentive to misreport their type

even in the presence of full commitment. Similarly, if information is public but there is only

limited commitment, individuals receiving positive shocks (especially permanent ones) have an

incentive to walk away from their obligations. Either way, the equilibrium becomes unsustainable.

     On the other hand, it is well known that self-insurance is inefficient even conditioning on

private information or limited commitment, and that is it is possible to obtain constrained-optimal

equilibriums in which consumers are provided with more insurance than in the self-insurance

case. The literature has focused on plausible cases of incomplete markets providing partial

insurance against income shocks over and above what is warranted by the standard permanent or

self-insurance model; for recent surveys, see Heathcote, Storesletten and Violante (2009) and

Attanasio and Weber (2009). These models imply that the parameters k in equation (12) reflect

also the degree of market completeness: in general, the more complete markets are, the lower the

response of consumption to income shocks.




                                                  17
2.5. An organizing framework



      The previous discussion highlights that consumption should not respond to anticipated

income changes, but should react to unexpected income shocks, to an extent that depends on the

characteristics and persistence of the shocks themselves and on the degree of completeness of

credit and insurance markets. As organizing framework we can summarize the discussion by

means of the following expression for consumption growth:



                                                                                  K
                                           ln cit  z it'   Et 1  ln y it    k  it   it
                                                                                           k
                                                                                                      (14)
                                                                                 k 1




where the zit variables capture the effect of preference shifts (such as age and family size) and

precautionary savings on consumption growth, and it is an approximation error (which may also

include measurement error in consumption).

      Depending on the purpose of the analysis, equation (14) can be used in two ways. One

could test the hypothesis that expected income growth does not affect consumption growth (the

orthogonality test described above, or =0), possibly distinguishing between positive and

negative expected income growth, without making any specific assumption about the income

                          K
process (i.e., treating   
                          k 1
                                 k
                                      it k   it as a composite error term).


      Alternatively, one can neglect the expected income term and focus on the estimation of the

marginal propensity to consume with respect to income shocks, i.e., the parameters k. These

parameters may be informative not only about the impact of income shocks, but also about the



                                                              18
structure of credit and insurance markets. For example, in the complete market case k for all k,

regardless of the income process. In the precautionary saving model, consumption responds

strongly to permanent income shocks, while transitory shocks have negligible effects.3 The buffer

stock model delivers similar implications. Models that allow for insurance opportunities provided

by governments, firms, family networks or other channels, predict that consumers are able to

insure shocks to a larger extent than in models with only self-insurance, implying lower values

for k.4 In the remaining two sections of the paper we discuss, in turn, how empirical studies have

estimated the  and k parameters. Table 1 summarizes the results from the various approaches,

data used and main findings of the selected papers that we survey in rest of the paper.




3. The response of consumption to predicted income changes



      In this section we review empirical strategies for testing the prediction that consumption

does not respond to anticipated income changes. The earlier literature focused on testing if

consumption changes (or consumption growth) is orthogonal to lagged information, an approach

that is directly derived from the consumption Euler equations (3) and (11). Since predicted

income growth was usually estimated on the basis of variables known in previous periods, the

approach placed strong restrictions on the data. A second, more recent generation of studies

attempts to identify episodes in which future income changes in a predictable fashion and to test



3
  In the precautionary saving model one can be pin down the values of k only by simulation analysis with specific
assumptions about preferences and the income generating process, see Kaplan and Violante (2009) for an example.
4
  Assuming the provision of public insurance does not crowd out private insurance.



                                                       19
if consumption reacts to such changes. This literature places much fewer restrictions on the data,

but requires assumptions about what consumers know of their future income.

     Even if the test discussed in this section are not designed to explain the channels through

which past income information might affect current consumption, by focusing on the behavior of

particular groups (low-wealth or low-income individuals, renters, borrowers, etc.) and

distinguishing between income declines and income increases, one can gain insights about the

validity of alternative consumption models (for instance about the incidence of borrowing

constraint) or preference characterizations (such as myopia and non-separabilities between

consumption and leisure). See also the discussion in Browning and Crossley (2001).



3.1. The excess sensitivity test



     Over the past three decades, many authors have performed excess sensitivity tests with

macro and micro data, and some have documented the failure of the predictions of the theory.

The first such study was Hall (1978) who starts from the Euler equation (1) and tests the

hypothesis that consumption growth between period t1 and period t cannot be explained by

variables dated t1 and earlier, in particular lagged income growth. As remarked by Deaton

(1992), Hall’s test initially attracted some perplexity because most economists had become used

to the idea that consumption growth does depend on lagged income growth, while the

orthogonality test challenged the presence of such link. Ultimately, Hall (1978) found that the

coefficient of lagged income growth was not statistically different from zero, but the

orthogonality restriction was rejected for other lagged variables (such as stock market prices).




                                                20
      In a closely related and widely cited paper, Flavin (1981) specified an income process

which she used to decompose statistically income growth into expected and unexpected

components.5 She then estimated jointly the consumption and income equations, finding evidence

of excess sensitivity of consumption to predicted income growth. While popular in the eighties,

excess sensitivity tests that rely on macroeconomic data were soon abandoned, because evidence

for excess sensitivity in macro data is likely to be due to aggregation bias, as shown among others

by Attanasio and Weber (1993) in an influential paper.

      Unfortunately, econometricians quickly discovered that problems with microeconomic data

are not less daunting, even disregarding measurement error issues (Altonji and Siow, 1987). In

particular, the empirical literature faces four kinds of problems in testing the restriction =0 in

equation (14). The first problem is that finding viable instruments for income growth that are

truly exogenous and yet have good predictive power is difficult in the extreme, leading empirical

economists to approach the problem using out-of-sample information about consumers’ expected

income changes, rather than a pure statistical procedure. The selected instruments for income

growth might be poor because the econometrician has less information than the individual, who

may be better informed about events such as promotions or unemployment spells. Hence, it may

be more promising to identify episodes of salient, large, expected income changes that are

observable to both the individual and the econometrician. We will discuss this approach in the

next section.

      The second problem with excess sensitivity tests based on equation (14) is that the

conditional variance of consumption growth is difficult to observe and is therefore either omitted

5
  Predicted income growth is obtained as the predicted value of a regression of income growth on variable assumed
to be uncorrelated with consumption growth (typically, lagged income growth). In other words, the distinction
between anticipated and unanticipated income growth is achieved through an Instrumental Variables procedure.



                                                       21
from the estimation or subsumed in observable characteristics (the variables zit). The problem

here is that the conditional variance of consumption growth could be correlated with Et1lnYit,

generating spurious evidence of excess sensitivity.6

      Third, excess sensitivity may result from a failure to control properly for non-separable

preferences. If leisure is an argument of the utility function, and if consumption and leisure are

non-separable, today's consumption decisions will be affected by predictable changes in

households' labor supply. This implies that consumption growth is positively correlated with

predictable growth in hours of work. Since predicted growth in hours will almost surely correlate

with predicted income growth, failure to control for labor supply indicators may lead to spurious

evidence of excess sensitivity (that is, it could bias the estimated α coefficient upwards), as

shown by Attanasio and Weber (1995) with panel data drawn from the Consumer Expenditure

Survey (CEX).

      Finally, excess sensitivity may also arise spuriously from the misspecification of the

stochastic structure of the forecast errors. According to the permanent income hypothesis with

rational expectations, the conditional expectation of the forecast errors must be zero, i.e.

Et1(it)=0 in equation (4). The empirical analog of this expectation is an average taken over long

periods of time, not across a large number of households. In fact, as pointed out by Chamberlain

(1984), there is no guarantee that the cross-sectional average of forecast errors will converge to

zero as the dimension of the cross-section gets large. For instance, if the forecast error is the sum

6
  Carroll (1992) goes one step further, and points out that even Zeldes' (1989) sample splitting approach described
below may produce spurious evidence in favor of liquidity constraints if one does not control properly for expected
consumption risk. Omitting the conditional variance term creates a spurious correlation between consumption growth
and income that is stronger for low-wealth households. Rich households have greater capacity than poor ones to
buffer income fluctuations by drawing down their assets, so that a finding of excess sensitivity in the group of poor
households only - as in Zeldes - could be rationalized once the assumption of certainty equivalence is dropped by the
theory of intertemporal choices.



                                                        22
of an aggregate and an idiosyncratic shock, then in a short panel the orthogonality condition fails

even if the permanent income model is true: aggregate shocks induce a cross-sectional

correlation between expected consumption growth and predicted income growth. The problem is

sometimes handled by including time dummies in the Euler equation. But time dummies don’t

solve the problem either, because aggregate shocks might be unevenly distributed in the

population.

      A more general criticism of excess sensitivity tests is that when the test fails, the rejection

does not help to discriminate among alternative consumption models. In the early literature

following Hall, excess sensitivity was generally held to be due to the presence of credit market

imperfections, in the form of interest rate differential or credit rationing. 7 However, later

literature has shown that such dependence would not have to stem from the budget constraint.

Similar dependence could be generated by non-separable preferences between consumption and

leisure, habit formation, home production or durability of goods, see Attanasio (2000) for a

survey. Laibson (1997) shows that excess sensitivity can arise in equilibrium for consumers with

hyperbolic preferences even in the absence of credit constraints. While the empirical implications

for the Euler equation of all these extensions are rather similar to liquidity constraints,

intertemporal dependence originating from the preference side has vastly different policy

implications than credit constraints.

      Considerable progress in the study of the impact of credit constraints on consumption was

made incorporating additional information. The most influential and innovative paper in this

7
 Excess sensitivity may arise also in models where myopic behavior induces tracking of consumption to income, in
precautionary saving models, or in models with precautionary saving and borrowing constraints, and empirically it is
very hard to distinguish between them. Furthermore, detecting failures of the theory in models with prudence and
borrowing constraints is not easy, because the orthogonality condition may not be violated most of the time, as
households save in the anticipation of future constraints.



                                                        23
respect was Zeldes (1989), who relied on an asset-based sample separation rule. Zeldes assumed

that the level of assets separates households that are likely to be liquidity constrained (the low-

wealth group) from those that have access to credit markets or no need to borrow (the high-

wealth group). If the only violation of the model is due to the existence of liquidity constraints,

excess sensitivity should arise only in the low-asset group. If instead excess sensitivity is due to

non-separable preferences or myopia there is no reason to expect that the results for the two

groups should differ. Using panel data on food consumption available in the Panel Study of

Income Dynamics (PSID) Zeldes indeed found a violation of the theory in the low-asset group.

Since the coefficient of lagged income in the Euler equation was found to be statistically different

from zero and twice as large (in absolute value) as for the high-asset group, he concluded that the

rejection of the theory is due to the effect of credit constraints.

      While adding outside information improves the power of the excess sensitivity test and ties

potential rejections more clearly to a specific alternative, splitting the sample on the basis of

wealth has a number of drawbacks. First of all, wealth is a good indicator of liquidity constraints

only if there is a roughly monotonic relation between the two. But poor households are not

necessarily identical to constrained households. For instance, households that are able to borrow

without full collateral have negative wealth but are obviously not credit constrained. Second,

sample splits based on wealth are bound to be highly imperfect because assets and asset income

are often poorly measured.8


8
  Jappelli, Pischke and Souleles (1998) attempt to identify the impact of liquidity constraints using direct information
on borrowing constraints obtained from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). In a first stage they estimate
probabilities of being constrained which are then utilized in a second sample (the PSID) to estimate switching
regression models for the Euler equation. Contrary to Zeldes (1989), their estimates do not indicate much excess
sensitivity associated with the possibility of constraints. However, quantile regressions indicate that the pattern of the
conditional distribution of consumption in the constrained and unconstrained regimes is consistent with the
hypothesis that liquidity constraints affect food consumption allocations. Attanasio, Goldberg, and Kyriazidou (2008)



                                                           24
3.2. Distinguishing between income increases and income declines



      Variants of the excess sensitivity tests distinguish between positive and negative expected

income changes, an approach first proposed by Shea (1995). He noted that different consumption

models imply different response of consumption to predicted income increases and declines.

Under myopia, consumption tracks income, and consumption should respond equally to

predictable income increases and decreases. In the presence of credit constraints, however,

households can save when income is expected to fall, but cannot borrow when income is

expected to rise. Therefore with credit constraints consumption should be more strongly

correlated with predictable income increases than declines. In his empirical application Shea

(1995) isolates households in the PSID whose heads can be matched to particular long-term union

contracts, and constructs a household-specific measure of expected wage growth. He finds that

consumption responds more strongly to predictable income declines than to predictable income

increases, an asymmetry which is inconsistent with both liquidity constraints and myopia.

      Garcia, Lusardi and Ng (1997) use a statistical approach to distinguish between positive and

negative expected income growth. They predict the probability of being liquidity constrained

using a switching regression framework, and find that liquidity constrained consumers are

excessively sensitive to past information (but unconstrained consumers also exhibit behavior that

is inconsistent with the theory). Jappelli and Pistaferri (2000) use subjective quantitative income



use CEX data on car loans (instead of consumption data) to show that particularly for poor households the demand
for loans is more sensitive to the quantity of debt (which they measure with loan maturity) than to the price of debt
(the interest rate). They argue that these results are consistent with the presence of binding credit constraints in the
car loan market.

expectations available for a sample of Italian households as an instrument for income growth and

find no evidence for excess sensitivity to both income increases and declines.




3.3. Episodes of income increases



         One reason why excess sensitivity tests based on pure statistical procedures provide very

weak tests of the theory might be that the instruments used to predict income growth (such as

lagged income growth and the like) are not be powerful enough. Therefore applied researchers

have tried to identify specific episodes in which predicted income changes are observable by both

the consumer and the econometrician. Such episodes can also be classified into expected income

increases and expected income declines.

         Wilcox (1989) examined the response of aggregate consumption to pre-announced social

security benefits increases. He found that consumption increases not when the income increase is

announced, but when it is actually implemented. In particular, he estimated that a 10 percent

increase in social security benefits induces a 1 percent increase in retail sales in the same month,

and a 3 percent increase in durable goods purchase. The limitation of this particular test is that it

is difficult to analyze major changes in tax policy using aggregate data on components of retail

sales.

         In a series of papers Shapiro and Slemrod (1995, 2003, 2009) use instant-survey data to

measure individual responses to actual or hypothetical tax policies. For example, in their 1995

paper they examined the effectiveness of President Bush’s temporary reduction in income tax




                                                 26
withholding which took place in 1992.9 One month after the implementation of the tax change,

they surveyed about 500 taxpayers and asked them (a) whether they had realized that income tax

withholding had decreased, and (b) what they were planning to do with the extra money in their

paycheck, i.e., mostly save it or mostly spend it. Shapiro and Slemrod found that 40 percent of

people interviewed planned to spend the extra take-home pay, suggesting that even a temporary

tax change could be moderately effective in increasing household spending. Their analysis of the

2001 income tax rebate reports a lower estimate of the marginal propensity to consume (only 22

percent of the interviewed households reported planning to spend the tax rebate), and little

evidence of myopia or liquidity constraints. Their analysis of the 2008 tax stimulus reaches

similar conclusions. A problem of these studies, common to all research using subjective

responses or expectations, is that respondents may have little incentives to answer the questions

correctly, may have trouble understanding the wording of the questions, or may in practice

behave differently from their reported behavior.

      Other studies have used actual consumption data to study temporary tax changes that

increase disposable income. Parker (1999) considers the effect on consumption of the anticipated

income increase induced by reaching the social security payroll cap ($106,800 in 2009) at some

point during the calendar year.10 Souleles (1999) studies the anticipated income increase induced

by the receipt of tax refunds, and in a subsequent paper analyzes how consumption responded to

the widely pre-announced tax cuts of the Reagan administration era (Souleles, 2002). All of these

studies use data from the CEX, all find evidence of excess sensitivity, and most of them don’t

attribute the failure of the theory to liquidity constraints.

9
 The change was transitory as it was planned to be offset by a smaller tax refund in 1993.
10
  Parker (1999) also exploits the expected decline in income that high-income taxpayers face in January of each year
when the social security payroll tax kicks back in.



                                                        27
      In Parker’s study, a 1 dollar anticipated rise in income increases nondurable consumption by

about 20 cents. This result is unlikely to be due to liquidity constraints, because the sample

includes only high-income taxpayers. Souleles (1999) finds that 10 percent of federal tax refunds

are spent on non-durables, but that the response of total consumption is much larger, or 65

percent of refunds, suggesting that most of the refund is spent on durable goods. Since high-

wealth individuals are those mostly using the tax refund to spend on durables, he concludes that

borrowing constraints can explain only part of the results.11 Souleles (2002) also points out that

liquidity constraints are unlikely to explain his excess sensitivity finding.

      Further insights from tax refunds is provided by Johnson, Parker and Souleles (2006), who

study the large income tax rebate program provided by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief

Reconciliation Act of 2001. The program sent tax rebates, typically $300 or $600 in value, to

about two-thirds of U.S. households. According to the permanent income hypothesis a single

rebate would have little effect on spending. Further, the theory predicts that, in the absence of

liquidity constraints, spending should increase as soon as consumers begin to expect some tax cut,

and not increase only after they actually have received the rebate check. Johnson, Parker, and

Souleles’ analysis uses a unique feature of the rebate program. Because it was administratively

difficult to print and mail the rebate checks all at once, they were mailed out over a ten-week

period from late July to the end of September 2001. Most importantly, the particular week in

which a check was mailed depended on the second-to-last digit of the taxpayer's Social Security

number, a number that is effectively randomly assigned (the timing of receipt of the tax rebate


11
  Hsieh (2003) studies two episodes affecting the same households: tax refunds (as in Souleles, 1999) and payments
from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which go only to Alaskan residents. His results are puzzling, because he finds
excess sensitivity with respect to tax refunds but not with respect to payments from the Alaska Permanent Fund.




                                                       28
was observed in their CEX data thanks to the addition of a special survey module). This

randomization allows the authors to identify the causal effect of the rebate by comparing the

spending of households that received the rebate earlier to the spending of households that

received it later. The authors find that the average household spent 20-40 percent of its 2001 tax

rebate on non-durable goods during the three-month period in which the rebate was received. The

authors also find that the expenditure responses are largest for households with relatively low

liquid wealth and low income, which is consistent with liquidity constraints.

     In a related paper, Agarwal, Liu and Souleles (2007) use a panel data set of credit card

accounts to analyze how consumers responded to the same tax rebate analyzed by Johnson,

Parker and Souleles (2006). They estimate the month-by-month response of credit card payments,

spending, and debt to the rebates, exploiting the randomized timing of the rebates’ disbursement

to identify their causal effects. They found that, on average, consumers initially saved some of the

rebate, by increasing their credit card payments and thereby paying down debt and increasing

their liquidity. But soon afterward their spending increased, counter to the implications of the

permanent income model.

    A paper that stands in contrast to these is Browning and Collado (2001), who use Spanish

micro data to examine the consumer response to the payment of institutionalized June and

December extra wage payments to full-time workers. Browning and Collado detect no evidence

of excess sensitivity, and argue that the reason why earlier researchers found large response of

consumption to predicted income changes is because of bounded rationality: consumers tend to

smooth consumption and follow the theory when expected income changes are large, but are less




                                                29
likely to do so when the changes are small and the cost of adjusting consumption are not trivial.12

Suppose for example that consumers who want to adjust their consumption upwards in response

to an expected income increase need to face the cost of negotiating a loan with a bank. It is likely

that the utility loss from not adjusting fully to the new equilibrium is relatively small when the

expected income increase is small, which suggests that no adjustment would take place if the

transaction cost associated with negotiating a loan is high enough.13

      This “magnitude hypothesis” has been formally tested by Scholnick et al (2009), who use a

large data set provided by a Canadian bank that includes information on both credit cards

spending as well as mortgage payment records. As in Stephens (2008) he argues that the final

mortgage payment represent an expected disposable income shock (that is, income net of pre-

committed debt service payments). His test of the magnitude hypothesis looks at whether the

response of consumption to expected income increases depends on the relative amount of

mortgage payments.

      Overall, the main limitation of the approach discussed in this section is that it offers little

guidance for how consumers would react to different shocks and environments. However, it does

offer ways to evaluate why consumption theories fail. For instance, some of the studies examined

found that low-wealth consumers react more to predictable income changes than high-wealth

consumers, a finding that points to the existence of liquidity constraints.



3.4. Episodes of income declines

12
   The magnitude argument could also explain Hsieh’s (1999) puzzling findings. Tax refunds are typically smaller
than payments from the Alaska Permanent fund (although the actual amount of the latter is somewhat more
uncertain).
13
   Another element that may matter, but it has been neglected in the literature, is the time distance that separates the
announcement from the actual income change. The smaller the time distance, the lower the utility loss from inaction.



                                                          30
      The most useful aspect of analyses that consider the effect of expected income declines on

consumption is that any excess sensitivity that is found in the data cannot be attributed to

liquidity constraints, because models with credit constraints predict that consumers don’t borrow

(and rather save) if they expect their income to decline. While borrowing can and does face limits,

saving does not.

      The most important predictable decline in one’s income occurs at retirement. A powerful

test of whether consumption is insensitive to predictable changes in income is thus to compare

consumption before and after retirement. The first paper to look at this issue is Banks, Blundell

and Tanner (1998), who used repeated cross-sectional data drawn from the UK Family

Expenditure Survey (FES), and found a remarkable drop in consumption after retirement.

Bernheim, Skinner, and Weinberg (2001) repeated the test for the U.S. using the PSID, and also

found evidence of a substantial consumption drop at retirement (24 percent for the first income

quartile, 15 percent for the second quartile and 9 percent of the third and fourth quartiles). The

main limitation of their study is that the only consumption information available in the PSID is

food consumption.14

     How do we explain the finding that consumption drops at retirement? One possibility, of

course, is that the life-cycle theory is not valid, and that consumers are myopic or lack self-

control. That is, they fail to anticipate that retirement brings about a steep decline in income.

When they realize it, they are forced to adjust their consumption downward. But other

14
  Studies that use more comprehensive consumption measures find little or no consumption drop in the US. Hurd
and Rohwedder (2006), using a special module in the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) find that for the average
household there is no consumption drop. However, their sample size is rather small. Attanasio, Meghir and Aguila
(2008) using panel data from the CEX find that food consumption declines by 6 percent, but detect no decline for
non-food consumption. These papers also provide a detailed survey of the relevant literature.



                                                      31
explanations don’t imply a rejection of the theory. Most of the fall in consumption at retirement

may be due to the decline of work-related expenses (such as transportation, canteen meals, etc.),

rather than a decline of all consumption categories. A related argument is that, from equation (2),

the theory predicts that individuals smooth the marginal utility of consumption, and not

necessarily consumption itself. If utility is non-separable between consumption and leisure,

equation (2) rewrites



                                       Et1u(cit,Lit) = u(cit1,lit1)



     If consumption and leisure are substitutes in utility, the sudden increase in leisure time from

the period before retirement (l) to the period after retirement (L) requires a corresponding sharp

adjustment in consumption. Another possibility is that retirement may not be that expected after

all, so consumption may legitimately fall because retirement comes as a shock. Haider and

Stephens (2007) emphasize that for most workers the timing of retirement is uncertain, and that it

is sometimes forced upon the individuals by events such as prolonged unemployment or

disabilities.

     A further explanation for a decline in consumption at retirement is home production, an issue

stressed in Hurd and Rohwedder (2006) and Aguiar and Hurst (2007). The idea is that

consumption (and in particular food consumption, the only consumption indicator available in the

PSID) is just an input to a home production function, which also uses as other factors leisure time,

shopping, and housework. Retirement brings about a sharp increase in the amount of time

available for shopping and housework, so individuals may choose to substitute, say, tomatoes




                                                   32
purchased in a grocery store with tomatoes grown in their own garden. Similarly, they may spend

more of their time looking for cheaper items. Indeed, Aguiar and Hurst (2005) use the Continuing

Survey of Food Intake of Individuals (CSFII), collecting information on food expenditure and

calories intake, and the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a time use survey, to

show that while food expenditure does decline at retirement, food intake does not, consistent with

the home production story. In a follow-up paper, Aguiar and Hurst (2006) use individual scanner

data on grocery expenses from the ACNielsen's Homescan Survey to find that the elderly shop

more frequently and buy cheaper goods (or manage to find the same goods at a lower price) than

younger individuals who have less leisure time available.

    Retirement is not the only situation in which households expect future resources to decline.

Souleles (2000) studies the consumption effect of expected disposable income declines induced

by paying for college tuition. Using CEX data, Souleles tests whether households’ non

educational consumption decreases in proportion to their college expenditures. The main finding

is that households appear to do a relatively good job smoothing their consumption into the

academic year, despite large expenses, consistent with the life-cycle hypothesis.

    The retirement and college tuition experiments are cases in which income declines in a

predictable way, and therefore the excess sensitivity test is free of complications due to liquidity

constraints. All in all, the evidence appears to be in favor of consumption smoothing and the

basic tenets of the permanent income hypothesis.

4. The response of consumption to unanticipated income shocks



     In this section we turn to examining tests of the prediction that consumption should respond

to unanticipated income changes and that the response should depend on the persistence of the

shock and on the degree of imperfections of credit and insurance markets. The literature has

considered three approaches. A first method attempts at identifying episodes in which income

changes unexpectedly, and to evaluate in a quasi-experimental setting how consumption reacts to

such changes. A second approach is to estimate the marginal propensity to consume with respect

to income shocks using the covariance restrictions that the theory imposes on the joint behavior

of consumption and income growth. A third approach estimates the impact of shocks combining

realizations and expectations of income or consumption in surveys where data on subjective

expectations are available. Each of these approaches has pros and cons, as we shall discuss below.



4.1. The quasi-experimental approach



     The approach we discuss in this section does not require estimation of an income process, or

even observing the individual shocks. Rather, it compares households that are exposed to shocks

with households that are not (or the same households before and after the shock), and assumes

that the difference in consumption arise from the realization of the shocks.

     The first of such attempts dates back to a study by Bodkin (1959), who laid down fifty years

ago all the ingredients of the quasi-experimental approach. In this pioneering study the

experiment consists of looking at the consumption behavior of WWII veterans after the receipt of

unexpected dividend payments from the National Service Life Insurance. Bodkin assumes that



                                                34
the dividend payments are unanticipated and represent a windfall source of income, and finds a

point estimate of the marginal propensity to consume non-durables out of this windfall income is

as high as 0.72, a strong violation of the permanent income model.

     The subsequent literature has looked at the economic consequences of illness, disability,

unemployment, and, in the context of developing countries, weather shocks and crop losses.

Some of these shocks are transitory (i.e. temporary job loss), and others are permanent (i.e.

disability); some are positive (i.e. dividends pay-outs), others negative (illness). The framework

in Section 2 suggests that it is important to distinguish between the effects of these various types

of shocks because, according to the theory, consumption should change almost one-for-one in

response to permanent shocks (positive or negative), but may react asymmetrically if shocks are

transitory. Indeed, if households are credit constrained (can save but not borrow) they will cut

consumption strongly when hit by a negative transitory shock, but will not react much to a

positive one.

     Recent papers in the quasi-experimental framework look at the effect of unemployment

shocks on consumption, and the smoothing benefits provided by unemployment insurance (UI)

schemes. As pointed out by Browning and Crossley (2001) unemployment insurance provides

two benefits to consumers. First, it provides “consumption smoothing benefits” for consumers

that are liquidity constrained. In the absence of credit constraints, individuals who faced a

negative transitory shock such as unemployment would borrow to smooth their consumption. If

they are unable to borrow they would need to adjust their consumption downward considerably.

Unemployment insurance provides some liquidity and hence it has positive welfare effects.

Second, unemployment insurance reduces the conditional variance of consumption growth in

equation (12) and hence the need to accumulate precautionary savings.



                                                35
      One of the earlier attempts to estimate the welfare effects of unemployment insurance is

Gruber (1997). Using the PSID, he constructs a sample of workers who lose their job between

period t1 and period t, and regresses the change in food spending over the same time span

against the UI replacement rate an individual is eligible for (i.e., potential benefits).15 Gruber

finds a large smoothing effect of UI, in particular that a 10 percentage point rise in the

replacement rate reduces the fall in consumption upon unemployment by about 3 percent.16 He

also finds that the fall in consumption at zero replacement rates is about 20 percent, suggesting

that consumers face liquidity constraints.17

      Browning and Crossley (2001) extend Gruber’s idea to a different country (Canada instead

of the US), using a more comprehensive measure of consumption (instead of just food) and

legislated changes in UI (instead of state-time variation). Moreover, their data are rich enough to

allow them to identify presumably liquidity constrained households (in particular, their data set

provide information on assets at the time of job loss). Browning and Crossley estimate a small

elasticity of expenditures with respect to UI benefit (5 percent). But this small effect masks

substantial heterogeneity, with low-assets households at time of job loss exhibiting elasticities as

high as 20 percent. This is consistent with the presence of liquidity constraints.

      A critique of this approach is that the response of consumption to unemployment shocks is

confounded by three set of issues (similar arguments apply to papers that look at unpredictable


15
   The use of potential benefits instead of actual benefits is for three reasons: (a) the endogeneity of UI receipts, (b)
the large amount of error in reported UI benefits, and (c) the policy interest in the effect of potential UI benefits
(which can be manipulated by the government) rather than on the effect of received benefits (which cannot).
16
   The use of a measure of total consumption (rather than just food) would presumably make the estimated effect
even larger, given that food is only a share of total consumption.
17
   Gruber also tests whether anticipated layoffs (measured using “seasonal” and “serial” layoffs) have no impact on
consumption, and finds no rejection of this hypothesis. Given that he is considering anticipated income declines, this
result is not inconsistent with his finding regarding the large impact of an unemployment shock. Moreover, for some
individuals an unemployment shock could be a persistent one (i.e., individuals close to retirement).



                                                          36
income changes due to illness or disability, as in Stephens, 2001). First, some of these shocks

may not come as a surprise, and individuals may have saved in their anticipation. For example,

being laid off by Chrysler in 2009 is hardly an unanticipated event. Second, the theory predicts

that consumers smooth marginal utility, not consumption per se. If an unemployment shock

brings more leisure and if consumption is a substitute for leisure, an excess response of

consumption to the transitory shock induced by losing one’s job does not necessarily represent a

violation of the theory. Finally, even if unemployment shocks are truly fully unanticipated, they

may be partially insured through government programs such as unemployment insurance (and

disability insurance in case of disability shocks). An attenuated consumption response to a

permanent income shock due to disability may be explained by the availability of government-

provided insurance, rather than representing a failure of the theory. Therefore a complete analysis

of the impact of unemployment or disability shocks requires explicit modeling of the type of

insurance available to individuals as well as of the possible interactions between public and

private insurance.18

      The above discussion suggests that it might be easier to test the theory in contexts in which

insurance over and above self-insurance is not available, such as in developing countries. 19

Gertler and Gruber (2003) look at the effect of income shocks arising from major illness on

consumption in Indonesia. They find that while people smooth well the effect of minor illnesses

(which could be interpreted as transitory shocks, or anticipated events), they experience



18
   Some of these interactions stem from the fact that most welfare programs are means- and asset-tested. For
example, in the US individuals with more than $2,000 in liquid assets are not eligible to receive Food Stamps,
Medicaid and other popular welfare programs even if they have no income. The disincentives to save (self-insure)
induced by the presence of public insurance (which in most cases are not subject to time limits) have been studied by
Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes (1995).
19
   On the other hand, there may stronger family networks in these countries.



                                                        37
considerable more difficulty in smoothing the impact of major illnesses (which could be

interpreted as permanent shocks).

     Wolpin (1982) and Paxson (1993) study the effect of weather shocks in India and Thailand,

respectively. In agricultural economies, weather shocks affect income directly through the

production function and deviations from normal weather conditions are truly unanticipated events.

Wolpin (1982) uses Indian regional time series data on rainfall to construct long run moments as

instruments for current income (which is assumed to measure permanent income with error). The

estimated permanent income elasticity ranges from 0.91 to 1.02 depending on the measure of

consumption, thus supporting strongly the permanent income model. Paxson (1992) uses regional

Thai data on weather to measure transitory shocks and finds that Thai consumers have a high

propensity to save out of transitory weather shocks, in support of the theory. However, she also

finds that they have a propensity to save out of permanent shocks above zero, which rejects a

strong version of the permanent income hypothesis.

     Studies using quasi-experimental variation to identify shocks to household income have the

obvious advantage that the identification strategy is clear and easy to explain and understand.

However, these studies’ obvious limitation is that they capture only one type of shocks at a time,

for instance illness, job loss, rainfall, extreme temperatures, or crop loss. One may wonder, for

example, whether the Gruber (1997) and Browning and Crossley (2001) estimates obtained in a

sample of job losers have external validity for examining the effect of other types of shocks

(especially those that are much harder to insure, such as shocks to one’s productivity).

     A second limitation of the approach is that some of the income shocks (in particular,

unemployment and disability shocks), cannot be considered as truly exogenous events. For

instance, for some people unemployment is a voluntary choice, and for others disability could be



                                                38
reported just to obtain benefits (a moral hazard issue). For this reason, not all income variability

is necessarily unanticipated, or not acted upon by the agent (Low, Meghir and Pistaferri, 2009).

The lesson of the literature is that identifying episodes of genuine exogenous and unanticipated

income changes is very difficult. One such case is weather conditions, to the extent at least to

which people don’t move to different regions to offset bad weather conditions.



4.2. Statistical decomposition of income shocks



     A different approach to identify the consumption response to unanticipated income shocks

makes specific statistical assumptions about the income process, and uses covariance restrictions

to identify the parameters that characterize the joint behavior of consumption and income, and in

particular the response of consumption to shocks.

     But how to identify income shocks? Two methods have emerged in the literature. A first

approach, which we discuss in this section, relies on panel data (or pseudo-panel data) and

measures shocks as deviations from observable income determinants. To be valid, this method

requires assuming that each individual conditions on the same set of variables to form

expectations, that the individuals and the econometrician have the same information set and that

the econometrician knows the stochastic process that generates individual income expectations. A

different strategy relies on quantitative subjective expectations, which we discuss in the next

section.

     There are several advantages of the statistical decomposition of income shocks. First of all,

it allows estimating simultaneously the marginal propensity to consume with respect to shocks of

various nature and persistence. The main variable of interest in the statistical decomposition is



                                                39
income, and therefore one can estimate the response of consumption to all type of income shocks

rather than to specific episodes (like weather fluctuations or job loss). Finally, there is a sharper

(albeit econometrically derived) distinction between transitory and permanent shocks. There are

also drawbacks, however. Since the approach assumes that income and consumption follow a

particular process, it is structural in nature and may suffer from specification bias for the

consumption rule. The approach is more demanding in terms of data, because it requires repeated

observations on income and consumption, although not necessarily in the same data set, and not

necessarily for the same households. Finally, with this is approach it is more difficult to

distinguish between the effect of positive and negative income shocks.

     To explain how the method works, consider again a slightly modified version of the

consumption rule (14), to which we append an equation for income growth:



                                  ln cit  z it'  c   1 it   2 it   3 it   it
                                                              1        2            3

                                                                                                (15)
                                  ln y it  z it'  y   it   it   it
                                                          1        2            3




     In this specification 1 represents a permanent shock (the innovation of a martingale

process), and 2 and 3 are i.i.d. components, measuring respectively transitory shocks and

measurement error in income. The parameters 1 and 2 measure the marginal propensities to

consume with respect to permanent and transitory income shocks, respectively. Recall from the

discussion in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 that these parameters can be interpreted as the degree to which

households insure income shocks, and therefore capture the degree of market completeness.

Finally,  is a measurement error in consumption. The literature typically imposes 3=0 because




                                                    40
consumption does not respond to noise in income. But note that this assumption has behavioral

content if 3 captures anticipated transitory changes in income that are unobserved to the

econometrician. In the rest of the section we follow the literature and impose 3=0.

      The consumption rule (15) states that consumption growth depends on preference shifts z

(such as age and family size), as well as income shocks, and nests many of the models that we

have discussed. For instance, according to the permanent income model, consumption responds

fully to permanent income shocks (1), while transitory shocks have negligible effects (0)

because consumers use accumulated assets to smooth temporary income fluctuations. The buffer

stock model has similar implications, possibly allowing for slightly lower values of . In the

complete markets benchmark model consumption is completely insulated from transitory as well

as permanent shocks (0). Finally, models with precautionary savings or partial insurance

predict that consumers are able to insure also permanent shocks to a larger extent than in the PIH

(0<.

      Identification of the model with panel data on income and consumption growth can be

approached considering a set of covariance restrictions. Defining the residual term

from income validation studies, as suggested by Meghir and Pistaferri (2004).

      The first paper to decompose income shocks to estimate the marginal propensity to

consume is Hall and Mishkin (1982), who work with PSID data on income and food consumption.

Their setup assumes quadratic preferences (and hence looks at consumption and income changes),

imposes 1=1, and leaves only 2 free for estimation. They find that the response of consumption

to innovations in transitory income is 29 percent, which is too high to be consistent with the

theory.

      Blundell, Pistaferri and Preston (2008) extend the framework to the CRRA case and

consider also a shock to higher moments of the earnings distribution. In their study they create

panel data on a comprehensive consumption measure for the PSID using an imputation procedure

based on food demand estimates from the CEX. They find that consumption is nearly insensitive

to transitory shocks (the estimated 2 parameter is around 5 percent, but higher among poor

households), while their estimate of 1 is significantly lower than 1 (around 0.65, but lower for

the college educated and those near retirement and higher for poor or less educated households),

suggesting that households are able to insure at least part of the permanent shocks.20


20
  Jappelli and Pistaferri (2007) consider the implications that the theory imposes on the mobility matrix of household
consumption and income. Using Italian data from the SHIW, they find considerably less insurance against income
shocks than in US applications (the marginal propensity to consume out of permanent shocks is around 1 and that
with respect to transitory shocks is around 0.3). These results are confirmed in a subsequent paper (Jappelli and
Pistaferri, 2008) using more recent data, which also points out that the marginal propensity to consume out of



                                                         42
      The results of Blundell, Pistaferri and Preston (2008) can be used to understand why

consumption inequality in the US has grown less than income inequality during the past two

decades. Their findings suggest that the widening gap between consumption and income

inequality is due to the change in the durability of income shocks. In particular, a growth in the

variance of permanent shocks in the early eighties was replaced by a continued growth in the

variance of transitory income shocks in the late eighties. Since they find little evidence that the

degree of insurance with respect to shocks of different durability changes over this period, it is

the relative increase in the variability of more insurable shocks rather than greater insurance

opportunities that explains the disjuncture between income and consumption inequality.

     A low response of consumption to permanent shocks may reflect not only insurance

opportunities, but also advance information. To exemplify, suppose that one finds that

consumption responds little to what the econometrician labels a permanent shock. Does this

happen because the income change is not really a surprise from the point of view of the consumer

(i.e., it was anticipated), or is it because it is mostly insured? The variation that is measured in the

data may reflect both information known to the econometrician and superior information held by

the individual. Two recent papers take the information issue seriously. Primiceri and van Rens

(2009) assume that consumers are unable to smooth permanent shocks, and that any attenuated

response measures the amount of advance information that they have about developments in their

(permanent) income. Using CEX data, they find that all of the increase in income inequality over

the 1980-2000 period can be attributed to an increase in the variance of permanent shocks but that

most of the permanent income shocks are anticipated by individuals; hence consumption

transitory income shocks is higher among households with lower education (0.315) than among those who completed
high school (0.121), suggesting that people with higher education have easier access to credit markets to smooth
income fluctuations.



                                                      43
inequality remains flat even though income inequality increases. While their results challenge the

common view that permanent shocks were important only in the early 1980s (see Card and Di

Nardo, 2002), they could be explained by the poor quality of income data in the CEX.

    In related research, Guvenen and Smith (2009) assume that the income process is the sum of

a random trend consumers must learn about in Bayesian fashion, an AR(1) process with AR

coefficient below 1, and a serially uncorrelated component. They extend the consumption

imputation procedure of Blundell, Pistaferri and Preston (2008) to create a panel data of income

and consumption data in the PSID, and find that consumers know quite a lot about the evolution

of their income process (about 80 percent of the uncertainty about the random trend component is

resolved in the first period).

    This discussion suggest that although the approach based on the covariance restrictions

between the income and the consumption processes allows estimation of the sensitivity of

consumption to permanent income shocks, it still does not isolate the reasons why permanent

shocks appear to be smoothed. In particular, the approach cannot distinguish between insurance

mechanisms and differential information between the individual and the econometrician.




4.3. Subjective expectations



      As pointed out in Sections 4.1. and 4.2, identifying income shocks is difficult because

people may have information that is not observed by the econometrician. For instance, they may

know in advance that they will face a temporary change in their income (such as a seasonal lay-

off). When the news is realized, the econometrician will measure as a shock what is in fact an



                                               44
expected event. The literature based on subjective expectations attempts to circumvent the

problem by asking people to report quantitative information on their expectations, an approach

forcefully endorsed by Manski (2004). This literature relies therefore on survey questions, rather

than retrospective data as in Section 4.2, to elicit information on the conditional distribution of

future income, and measures shocks as deviations of actual realizations from elicited expectations.

     Hayashi (1985) is the first study to adopt this approach. He uses a four-quarter panel of

Japanese households containing respondents’ expectations about expenditure and income in the

following quarter. Hayashi works with disaggregate consumers’ expenditure, allowing each

component to have a different degree of durability. He specifies a consumption rule, and allowing

for measurement error in expenditures, estimates the covariances between expected and

unexpected changes in consumption and expected and unexpected changes in income. His results

are in line with Hall and Mishkin (1982), suggesting a relatively high sensitivity of consumption

to income shocks.

    Pistaferri (2001) combines income realizations and quantitative subjective income

expectations contained in the Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) to identify

separately the transitory and the permanent income shocks. To see how subjective income

expectations allow estimating transitory and income shocks for each household, consider the

income process of equations (7) and (8). The assumption of rational expectations implies that the

transitory shock at time t can be point identified by:




                                                    
                                          it   E yit 1  it                             (16)




                                                   45
where it is the individual’s information set at time t. Using equations (7)-(8) and (16), the

permanent shock at time t is identified by the expression:




                                                         
                              uit  yit  E yit  it 1  E yit 1  it   

e.g., the income innovation at time t adjusted by a factor that takes into account the arrival of new

information concerning the change in income between t and t+1. Thus, the transitory and

permanent shocks can be identified if one observes, for at least two consecutive time periods, the

conditional expectation and the realization of income, a requirement satisfied by the 1989-93

SHIW. Pistaferri estimates equation (10) and finds that consumers save most of the transitory

shocks and very little of the permanent shocks, supporting the saving for a rainy day model of

Section 2.2.

    Kaufmann and Pistaferri (2009) use the same Italian survey, but different years (1995-2001)

to distinguish the superior information issue from the insurance issue mentioned in Section 4.2.

Considering the covariance restrictions implied by the theory on the joint behavior of

consumption, income realizations, and subjective quantitative income expectations, they show

that the degree of insurance of income shocks is upward biased. They also find that a large part of

the transitory variation in income is either anticipated or the result of measurement error, while

about two-third of the permanent variation in income can be labeled as a true innovation.

    Studies that use subjective expectations are subject to the usual criticisms about the validity

of subjective data, such as their reliability and information content, and in practice it is still the

case that subjective expectations are seldom available alongside consumption and income data or




                                                   46
confined to special survey modules. However, there is considerable promise in the use of

subjective expectations to evaluate the validity of various consumption models.




5. Conclusions



    Understanding how household consumption responds to changes in income is an important

topic of research, in particular for understanding how consumers would respond to tax or welfare

reforms, which is key for the formulation of effective stabilization policies. In this paper we have

reviewed empirical approaches to two distinct questions. First, does household consumption

respond to changes in income that are anticipated? Second, does consumption respond to

unexpected income changes? While it is difficult to summarize such a vast body of work, some

consensus emerges from the literature, on both methods and substance.

    On method, it is clear that distinguishing between negative and positive income changes, and

between transitory and permanent income shocks can help to shed light not only on the response

of consumption to income, but also on the validity of various theories of intertemporal choice.

There are a variety of approaches that can be fruitfully explored to analyze these issues, from

identification of specific episodes of anticipated income declines or increase, to the estimation of

sophisticated income process to distinguish between transitory and permanent shocks, to use of

data with subjective consumption or income expectations. Indeed, in this survey we have

attempted to classify the various studies along each of these dimensions.

    On substance, there is by now considerable evidence that consumption appears to respond to

anticipated income increases, over and above by what is implied by standard models of



                                                47
consumption smoothing. Although the reasons for this failure of the theory are not yet well

understood, there is evidence from diverse sources, studies and countries that, at least locally,

liquidity constraints are an important culprit for this failure. Indeed, consumption appears much

less responsive to anticipated income declines (for instance, after retirement), a case in which

liquidity constraints have no bearing. Future work should be directed toward understanding which

type of credit rationing (quantity vs. price rationing) and which model of behavior (adverse

selection vs. moral hazard) best explains the data.21

     A second finding that emerges from the literature is that the consumption reaction to

permanent shocks is much higher than that to transitory shocks. There is also evidence, at least in

the US, that consumers do not revise their consumption fully in response to permanent shocks.

Taken together, these finding are consistent with the hypothesis that precautionary savings and

even perhaps insurance over and above self-insurance (achieved through government welfare

programs, family labor supply, or family networks) play an important role in consumption. Here

as well, households’ heterogeneity is important, because liquidity constraints appear to be able to

account for the estimated larger marginal propensities to consume , especially in sub-groups of

the population that are less likely to be able to access credit markets, such as low-income or low-

education households. The main challenge for empirical work is to distinguish between

information (which might be solved with better data or the specification of an income process that

acknowledges the possibility of advance information) and insurance (which may require a better

modeling of the sources of consumption smoothing available to consumers over and above own

savings, see Attanasio and Pavoni, 2007). The large fiscal packages implemented in virtually all


21
  Primarily for lack of space, we have not discussed so-called behavioral (or other preference-driven) explanations
for these findings. See recent surveys by Angeletos et al. (2001) and Camerer et al. (2005) for a discussion.

countries in response to the recession of 2008 will certainly provide the grounds to gain further

insights into the response of consumption to income changes.
