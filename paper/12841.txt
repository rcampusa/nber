                                             ABSTRACT

Uncertainty varies strongly over time, rising by 50% to 100% in recessions and by up to 200% after
major economic and political shocks. This paper shows that higher uncertainty reduces the responsiveness
of R&D to changes in business conditions - a "caution-effect" - making it more persistent over time.
Thus, uncertainty will play a critical role in shaping the dynamics of R&D through the business cycle,
and its response to technology policy. I also show that if firms are increasing their level of R&D then
the effect of uncertainty will be negative, while if firms are reducing R&D then the effect of uncertainty
will be positive.

I. Introduction

Uncertainty about future productivity and demand conditions varies strongly over time, rising

by 50% to 100% during recessions, and by 100% to 200% after major political and economic

shocks.1 These ‡uctuations in uncertainty appear to generate ‡uctuations in investment, hir-

ing and productivity as higher uncertainty generates a temporary slowdown and bounceback

as …rms postpone activity and wait for uncertainty to resolve (Bloom, 2006).

       An omitted factor from this analysis, however, is R&D which has become a focus of recent

business cycle models (Diego Comin and Mark Gertler, 2006, and Gadi Barlevy, 2007). R&D

may respond di¤erently to uncertainty because of di¤erent adjustment costs. Investment in

the capital stock typically incurs stock adjustment costs from changing the capital stock,

while R&D investment in the knowledge stock typically incurs ‡ow adjustment costs from

changing the ‡ow rate of the knowledge stock (see section II). I show that these di¤erent

adjustment costs lead to di¤erent predicted dynamics under uncertainty, including making

R&D rates much less responsive to business-conditions and more persistent over time at

higher uncertainty.

       These adjustment-cost and uncertainty e¤ects can help to explain the high persistence

of R&D across time, which at the …rm-level is about three times more autocorrelated than

investment. They may also help to explain why across-business cycles R&D is highly persis-

tent and responds to recessions with a lag. The higher uncertainty in downturns will reduce

the responsiveness of R&D, delaying its response to worsening business conditions. Finally
   1
    William Schwert (1989) shows that uncertainty over future industrial production, stock and bond prices
‡uctuate over the business cycle, increasing by 50% to 100% in recessions. Nick Bloom (2006) shows stock-
market volatility jumps 100% to 200% after economic and political shocks like the Cuban Missile crisis, the
assassination of JFK and the 9/11 attack.
the results imply …rms will be much less responsive to technology policies during periods of

high uncertainty, for example if the policy change itself increases uncertainty.



II. Time varying uncertainty with stock and ‡ow adjustment costs

The traditional real options models assumed time constant uncertainty in order to derive

analytical solutions.2 They assumed some driving process, for example price (P ), evolved as

a Geometric Brownian motion with a constant drift            and constant volatility




(II.1)                   dPt = Pt ( + dWt )             where dWt       N (0; 1)


Since volatility is …xed, investigating the impact of time-varying ‡uctuations in uncertainty

is not possible in these models.

       A small literature has tried to extend these models to incorporate time varying uncertainty

( t ). It …nds temporary increases in uncertainty cause a drop and rebound in investment,

employment and productivity growth due to a “delay-e¤ect”, which can be summarized as

dIt =d    t   < 0. At high levels of uncertainty …rms postpone making decisions so aggregate

investment and employment activity slows down. Productivity growth also slows down as

reallocation of factors of production from low to high productivity …rms slows.3 Higher un-

certainty also induces a “caution e¤ect”whereby …rms are less responsive to any given shock

because higher uncertainty increases the chances of making a costly mistake, so responsive-

ness is lower (Bloom et al., 2007), which can be summarized as @ 2 It =@ t @Pt < 0.

    See, for example, Robert MacDonald and Daniel Siegel (1986), Guiseppe Bertola and Ricardo Caballero
(1994), Avinash Dixit and Robert Pindyck (1994) or Andrew Abel and Janice Eberly (1996).
   3
     See Ben Bernanke (1983) and John Hassler (1996) for a single agent and factor model, and Bloom 2006
for a micro to macro multi-factor model and empirical evidence.
       These extensions, however, have yet to examine the impact of time varying uncertainty on

R&D and the knowledge stock. In the productivity and innovation literature the knowledge

stock (Gt ) is usually modelled as the accumulation of R&D expenditures (Rt ) over time,

in a similar way that capital stocks (Kt ) are modelled as the accumulation of investment

expenditures (It ) over time:


(II.2)                                 Kt+1 = (1          K )Kt   + It

(II.3)                                 Gt+1 = (1          G )Gt   + Rt


Although uncertainty and real-options are not modelled, one could speculate that R&D will

be a¤ected in the same way by uncertainty as investment.4 But, this turns out not to be

true due to the di¤erent adjustment costs for capital and knowledge stocks.

       Capital stock adjustment costs are typically assumed to arise from direct changes to their

stocks, for example from resale losses for capital goods. This can be written as


(II.4)                                     CK (It )    CK ( Kt )


Knowledge stocks, however, are intangible and can not typically be bought or sold.5 Instead,

knowledge stocks are adjusted (more slowly) by changing the level of R&D, which changes the

growth rate of the knowledge stock. The adjustment costs for R&D - for example resale losses

on R&D equipment or scientists hiring/…ring costs - are similar, however, to the adjustment

costs for capital in that they depend on the change in R&D levels. Given the law of motion
   4
    There is a literature looking at “R&D real-options”, which uses stochastic calculus to value complex
multi-stage R&D projects, but these assume no R&D adjustment costs and no change in uncertainty over
time, so are focused on R&D project valuation rather than dynamics (see for example, Eduardo Schwartz,
2003).
   5
    Patents are one exception to this, although these cover a small fraction of R&D as they are only available
on innovative codi…ed knowledge, typically with a few years lag due to delays in the patenting process.
for the knowledge stock (II.3) this implies


(II.5)                       CG ( Rt ) = CG (              Gt     G   Gt )

                                                CG (       Gt )


Comparing (II.4) to (II.5) the adjustment costs for the knowledge stock are one order of

di¤erence apart from the adjustment cost for the capital stock. This distinction arises because

the costs of adjustment for capital arises directly from changing its stock. The costs of

changing knowledge stocks arise not from changing its stock, but from changing the rate of

change of its stock (R&D). Thus, adjustment costs arise in changing the level of the capital

stock and changing the ‡ow rate of the knowledge stock. This distinction plays a critical

role in shaping the response of investment and R&D to uncertainty.

   Interestingly, in the macro literature a number of recent papers (for example Lawrence

Christiano, Martin Eichenbaum and Charles Evans (2005)) assume a ‡ow cost for changing

investment rates between periods, CK ( It ): Under these assumption my results for R&D

would extend to capital. This would also be true more generally of the impact of uncertainty

if it a¤ected industries producing productive assets, such as the capital goods producing

industry (see, for example, Sherwin Rosen and Robert Topel, 1988).



III. Simulation results for R&D and uncertainty

Firms are uncertain about future business conditions (X), which evolve as a geometric ran-

dom walk with mean      and stochastic volatility      t



(III.1)              dXt = Xt ( +     t dZt )              where dZt         N (0; 1)
The uncertainty process ( t ) is modelled for simplicity as an AR(1) process, consistent with

smooth business-cycle ‡uctuations, noting this could easily be generalized


(III.2)              t   =    t 1   +   (      t 1)   +   S St            where dSt     N (0; 1)


      There are adjustment costs for changing R&D. In the baseline model these are assumed

to be linear, re‡ecting the hiring/…ring costs for scientists and buying/selling costs for R&D

equipment, C( Rt ) = j Rt j, where                   > 0. I also present results for quadratic adjustment

costs for comparison, C( Rt ) =             Q Gt (    (Rt =Gt ))2 , where   Q   > 0. In the model I assume the

adjustment costs for capital and labor are zero for analytical tractability, and focus on the

implications of R&D adjustment costs. This should not change the stylized results for R&D,

because in a Cobb-Douglas production function with iso-elastic demand each factor responds

most to its own adjustment costs, with limited cross-factor response.6 Analytical results can

show a unique solution to the …rm’s optimization problem exists (see the Appendix for the

full model), with numerical methods used to solve for exact values.7

      Figure 1 plots the optimal rates of R&D as a function of current business conditions for

low uncertainty (        t   = 5%), medium uncertainty (         t   = 20%) and high uncertainty (   t   = 50%).

There are two key results from the simulation.

      First, the adjustment costs for changing R&D generate a zone of inaction in the response

of R&D to changes in business (demand and productivity) conditions. Given the costs of

changing R&D rates …rms only incur this when the gap between the actual and desired R&D

rate is above a certain threshold, generating a central region of inaction. This creates a

dynamic link between current and past R&D rates, consistent with the empirical evidence
  6
      See the tables of results in Bloom (2006).
  7
      The code available on http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom.
that R&D rates change only slowly over time, and are more persistent then sales growth,

employment growth or investment rates.8

       Second, the zone of inaction is larger for higher values of uncertainty, and the response is

more muted when it does occur. This is the “caution e¤ect”of uncertainty on R&D behavior.

When uncertainty is high the probability of business conditions changing are greater, and

since it is costly to change R&D rates the option value of waiting is greater.

       Figures 2a and 2b plot the optimal rates of R&D expenditures at low, medium and high

uncertainty for low prior values of R&D and high prior values of R&D.9 The key result is that

the direct impact of uncertainty depends on the di¤erence between optimal R&D and lagged

R&D. If optimal R&D is higher than lagged R&D (the right side of both …gures) - so that

…rms want to raise R&D - then higher uncertainty reduces R&D, a negative “delay-e¤ect”.

If optimal R&D is below lagged R&D (the left side of both …gures) - so the …rms want to cut

R&D - then higher uncertainty increases R&D, a positive “delay-e¤ect”. Thus, the impact

of the “delay e¤ect”depends on the relationship between desired R&D and lagged R&D.

       Of course, if R&D depreciates over time (due to scientists quitting and equipment wearing

out), then temporary increases in uncertainty will reduce R&D at the steady state. This is

because the inherited level of R&D will have depreciated below the optimal level. This is

very similar to the reasoning behind the negative steady state “delay e¤ect”of uncertainty on

investment and hiring which arises because depreciation, attrition and growth mean inherited

capital and labor are always below their optimal levels.
   8
    For example, in Compustat data (1990 to 1999, manufacturing) the correlation between current and
two-year lagged sales growth rates are 0.082, labor growth rates are 0.095, investment rates are 0.274, and
R&D rates are 0.690. The aggregate …gures show a similar pattern (Comin and Gertler (2006)).
   9
    These values are 1.875% and 7.5%, chosen as half and twice the steady-state rate of R&D expenditure,
     Rt
rt = G t
         , given the 15% depreciation in Gt and quarterly periodicity.
       Figure 3 plots the optimal rates of R&D expenditure for low, medium and high uncer-

tainty assuming only quadratic adjustment costs for R&D. The e¤ects of uncertainty almost

completely disappear. With quadratic adjustment costs no real options e¤ects arise, and

the assumed homogeneity on revenue function in demand conditions and knowledge stocks

minimizes any Jensen’s e¤ects from a concave/convex marginal revenue product of R&D in

demand conditions. Hence, the impact of uncertainty on R&D depends critically on the

adjustment costs for R&D, for which empirical evidence is very limited.



IV. Implications of uncertainty for micro and macro R&D

At the micro level the “caution-e¤ect” of uncertainty on R&D implies much lower respon-

siveness of …rms in periods of high uncertainty. This could explain why, for example, US

…rms have been so slow to respond to the R&D tax credit, a policy beset by continued uncer-

tainty over its survival (Bloom et al., 2002). This could be investigated by estimating (with

appropriate instrumentation) the following type of regression10


(IV.1)           ri;t =   0   +   1 ri;t 1   +   2   yi;t +   3 i;t   +   4 ri;t 1 i;t   +   5   yi;t   i;t   + Xi;t + "i;t


where ri;t is …rm i year t (R&D/sales), yi;t is …rm i year t log(sales) and Xi;t are a full set

of controls including …xed e¤ects and year dummies. The empirical implication from section

(III) for R&D is that higher uncertainty should reduce the responsiveness of …rms to sales

growth (     5   < 0) and increase the responsiveness to lagged R&D expenditure (                                  4   > 0).

       At the macro level the “delay-e¤ect” of uncertainty on R&D is highlighted in table 1,
  10
    Micro data is particularly suitable for testing the “caution e¤ect” of because of the large samples of
impulses and responses in …rm panel data. Macro data is particularly suitable for testing the “delay-e¤ect”
because of the role of re-allocation across …rms in driving the productivity component of the “delay-e¤ect”
which only arises under aggregation.
with uncertainty e¤ects on investment in table 2 for comparison. The two columns in Table

1 re‡ect the result that higher uncertainty increases R&D if the current period R&D is a

downward adjustment (Rt < Rt 1 ), and reduces R&D if the current period R&D is an upward

adjustment (Rt > Rt 1 ).




    Table 1: The marginal impact of an increase in uncertainty on R&D

                                        R&D decreasing* R&D increasing

    Knowledge stock decreasing                     +

    Knowledge stock increasing                     +

    * If R&D rates depreciate at rate   R,   then the condition is Rt < (1   R )Rt 1




   In contrast table 2 shows that lagged investment plays no role in determining current

investment. Instead comparing across the two rows shows that uncertainty increases current

investment if the capital stock is decreasing after controlling for depreciation (Kt < (1

 K )Kt 1 ),   and reduces it if capital stock is increasing (Kt > Kt 1 ).




    Table 2: The marginal impact of an increase in uncertainty on investment

                                    Investment decreasing Investment increasing

    Capital stock decreasing*                      +                         +

    Capital stock increasing

    * After controlling for depreciation, Kt < (1      K )K t 1




   Thus, this implies uncertainty would reduce R&D when it is increasing - typically during
the recovery from a recession and initial part of a boom. In comparison it would reduce

investment when capital is above trend - typically during a boom. In addition higher uncer-

tainty will tend to increase the persistence of R&D changing its dynamics, but reduce the

responsiveness of investment changing its amplitude. Thus, uncertainty will have a di¤er-

ential impact on the levels and dynamics of R&D versus investment, due to di¤erent ‡ow

versus stock adjustment costs.



V. Conclusions

Uncertainty varies strongly over time, persistently rising by 50% to 100% during recessions,

and temporarily rising by 100% to 200% after major political and economic shocks. The

impact of these changes in uncertainty on investment and hiring appears to be two-fold: …rst

higher uncertainty typically reduces aggregate investment, hiring and productivity growth

due to a “delay e¤ect”, and second higher uncertainty makes …rms less responsive to any

changes in their environment, a “caution e¤ect”. These e¤ects have been shown to be ana-

lytically and empirically important in micro and macro investment and employment behavior.

   This paper extends these results on time varying uncertainty to R&D by modelling the

‡ow adjustment costs of knowledge stocks and contrasting this to the stock adjustment costs

of capital and labor. I show that higher uncertainty reduces the responsiveness of R&D to

changes in demand conditions and increases the persistence of R&D over-time, the R&D

equivalent to the “caution-e¤ect”. I also show that if …rms are increasing R&D then the

marginal e¤ect of uncertainty on R&D will be negative, while if …rms are reducing R&D

then the marginal e¤ect of uncertainty on R&D will be positive. Thus, the R&D equivalent
to the “delay-e¤ect”depends on the desired change in R&D. I then present micro and macro

predictions, with the hope that future empirical research will make progress in testing these.
VI. Appendix

The model underlying the simulations assumes …rms have a revenue function F (X; K; L; G) =

         (1   )       (1       )
X K               L                G(1         )(1   )
                                                         which nests a Cobb-Douglas production function in capital

(K), labor (L) and the knowledge stock (G), and an iso-elastic demand curve with elasticity

( ). Demand and productivity conditions are combined into an index (X), henceforth called

“business conditions”.

   Business conditions (X) evolve as an augmented geometric random walk with mean

and variance               t



(VI.1)                                   dXt = Xt ( +         t dZt )             where dZt   N (0; 1)


The uncertainty process ( t ) is modelled for simplicity as an AR(1) process, noting this could

easily be generalized


(VI.2)                         t   =     t 1   +     (        t 1)   +   S St          where dSt    N (0; 1)


   In the model for analytical tractability I assume the adjustment costs for capital and labor

are zero and focus on the implications of R&D adjustment costs. This should not change

the stylized results for R&D, but facilitates a numerical solution to the model since the state

and control spaces are both reduced by two dimensions.

   There are no structural estimates of R&D adjustment costs in the literature. But there

is a long literature on capital and labor adjustment costs which I use as a starting point

for modelling R&D adjustment costs(Bloom (2006), and Russell Cooper and John Halti-

wanger (2006)). This literature focuses on three cost terms - linear costs re‡ecting per

unit adjustment costs: C( Rt ) =                                Rt       (   +[   Rt > 0]     [ Rt < 0]), quadratic ad-
                                                                                                  Rt 2
justment costs re‡ecting higher costs of rapid changes: C( Rt ) =                     Q Gt (      Gt
                                                                                                     ),   and …xed

costs re‡ecting the revenue loss from disruption involved in changing factors of production:

C( Rt ) =       F        F (X; K; L; G)t ( Rt 6= 0). I report results for linear and quadratic R&D

adjustment costs, but also investigated a range of other adjustment costs and found real

options e¤ects whenever linear or …xed costs were present.

    With fully ‡exible capital and labor I can optimize these out, and then normalize the

business conditions process, to derive the concentrated revenue function Fe(Y; G) = AY 1 G .

The Bellman equation can then be stated as follows

                                                                            1
 V (Yt ; Gt ; Rt 1 ;     t)   = max Fe(Yt ; Gt )   C(Rt ; Rt 1 )   wRt +       E[V (Yt+1 ; Gt+1 ; Rt ;          t+1 )]
                                    Rt                                     1+r

where w is the cost of R&D and r is the discount rate. The problem is jointly homogeneous

of degree one in (Yt ; Gt ; Rt ; Rt 1 ) so can be normalized by Gt

                                                                      (1   K )(1   rt )
V (yt ; 1; rt 1 ;   t)   = max Fe(yt ; 1)     C(rt ; rt 1 )   wrt +                       E[V (yt+1 ; 1; rt ;   t+1 )]
                               rt                                          1+r

where yt = (Yt =Gt ) and rt = (Rt =Gt ). Analytical results can show a unique solution to the

…rm’s optimization problem exists, with numerical methods used to solve for exact values.
