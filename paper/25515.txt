                                        ABSTRACT

We study a model where firms accumulate data as a valuable intangible asset. Data accumulation
affects firms‚Äô dynamics. It increases the skewness of the firm size distribution as large firms
generate more data and invest more in active experimentation. On the other hand, small data-
savvy firms can overtake more traditional incumbents, provided they can finance their initial
money- losing growth. Our model can be used to estimate the market and social value of data.

                                    1.    Model Solution Details

   There are two sources of uncertainty in firm i‚Äôs problem at date t: the (random) optimal
technique Œ∏i,t , and the aggregate price Pt . Let (¬µÃÇi,t , Œ£i,t ) denote the conditional mean and
variance of firm i belief about Œ∏i,t given its information set at date t, Ii,t .
   In this section, we will first describe the firm belief updating process about its optimal
technique. Next, we argue that in this environment, the firm‚Äôs optimal production choice
is deterministic, and thus the price is deterministic as well. Finally, we lay out the full set
of equations that characterize the equilibrium of this economy with two groups of firms.

   Belief updating. The information problem of firm i about its optimal technique Œ∏i,t can
be expressed as a Kalman filtering system, with a 2-by-1 observation equation, (¬µÃÇi,t , Œ£i,t ).
   We start by describing the Kalman system, and show that the sequence of conditional
variances is deterministic. Note that all the variables are firm specific, but since the
information problem is solved firm-by-firm, for brevity we suppress the dependence on
firm index i.
   At time t, each firm observes two types of signals. First, date t ‚àí 1 output provides a
noisy signal about Œ∏t‚àí1 :

(1)                                      yt‚àí1 = Œ∏t‚àí1 + a,t‚àí1 ,

where a,t ‚àº N (0, œÉa2 ). We provide model detail on this step below. Second, the firm
observes nt = zktŒ± data points as a bi-product of its economic activity. The set of signals
{st,m }m‚àà[1:ni,t ] are equivalent to an aggregate (average) signal sÃÑt such that:

(2)                                         sÃÑt = Œ∏t + s,t ,

where s,t ‚àº N (0, œÉ2 /nt ). The state equation is

                                    Œ∏t ‚àí Œ∏ÃÑ = œÅ(Œ∏t‚àí1 ‚àí Œ∏ÃÑ) + Œ∑t ,

where Œ∑t ‚àº N (0, œÉŒ∏2 ).
 At time, t, the firm takes as given:

                                   bt‚àí1 = E Œ∏t | st‚àí1 , y t‚àí2
                                                             
                                   ¬µ
                                   Œ£t‚àí1 = V ar Œ∏t | st‚àí1 , y t‚àí2
                                                                

where st‚àí1 = {st‚àí1 , st‚àí2 , . . . } and y t‚àí2 = {yt‚àí2 , yi,t‚àí3 , . . . } denote the histories of the
observed variables, and st = {st,m }m‚àà[1:ni,t ] .
  We update the state variable sequentially, using the two signals. First, combine the
priors with yt‚àí1 :

                                           Œ£‚àí1 ¬µ  bt‚àí1 + œÉa‚àí2 yt‚àí1

                     V ar Œ∏t | It‚àí1 , yt‚àí1 = œÅ2 Œ£‚àí1              + œÉŒ∏2

Then, use these as priors and update them with sÃÑt :

 Equations (4) and (5) constitute the Kalman filter describing the firm dynamic infor-
mation problem. Importantly, note that Œ£t is deterministic.

  Modeling quadratic-normal signals from output. When yt‚àí1 is observed, agents know
their capital kt‚àí1 . Therefore, they can back out At‚àí1 exactly. To keep the model simple
for a short paper, we assumed that when agents see At‚àí1 , they also learn whether the
quadratic term (at‚àí1 ‚àí Œ∏t‚àí1 ‚àí a,t‚àí1 )2 had a positive or negative root. An interpretation is
that they can figure out if their action at was too high or too low.
  Relaxing this assumption complicates the model because, when agents do not know
which root of the square was realized, the signal is no longer normal. One might solve a
model with binomial distribution over two normal variables, perhaps with other simplifying
assumptions. For numerical work, a good approximate solution would be to simulate the
binomial-normal and then allows firms to observe a normal signal with the same mean and
same variance as the true binomial-normal signal. This would capture the right amount of
information flow, and keep the tractability of updating with normal variables.

                         Deterministic Dynamic Production Choice


  Consider the firm sequential problem:
                                            ‚àû
                                            X
                                   max E0         Œ≤ t (Pt At ktŒ± ‚àí rkt )
                                            t=0

We can take a first order condition with respect to at and get that at any date t and for
any level of kt , the optimal choice of technique is

                                            a‚àót = E[Œ∏t |It ].

Given the choice of at ‚Äôs, using the law of iterated expectations, we have:

                            E[(at ‚àí Œ∏t ‚àí a,t )2 |Is ] = E[V ar[Œ∏t |It ]|Is ],

for any date s ‚â§ t. We will show that this object is not stochastic and therefore is the
same for any information set that does not contain the realization of Œ∏t .
  Lemma. The sequence problem of the firm can be solved as a non-stochastic recursive
problem with one state variable.
Proof of Lemma 1. We can restate the sequence problem recursively. Let us define the
8


value function as:

Vt ({st,m }m‚àà[1:nt ] , yt‚àí1 , ¬µÃÇt‚àí1 , Œ£t‚àí1 ) = max E At ktŒ± ‚àí rkt + Œ≤Vt+1 ({st+1,m }m‚àà[1:nt+1 ] , yt , ¬µÃÇt , Œ£t )|It‚àí1
                                                                                                                      

              Œ±
with nt = kt‚àí1    . Taking a first order condition with respect to the technique choice con-
ditional on It reveals that the optimal technique is a‚àót = E[Œ∏t |It ]. We can substitute the
optimal choice of at into At and rewrite the value function as
                                                     h
 Vt ({st,m }m‚àà[1:nt ] , yt‚àí1 , ¬µÃÇt‚àí1 , Œ£t‚àí1 ) = max E AÃÑ ‚àí (E[Œ∏t |It ] ‚àí Œ∏t ‚àí a,t )2 ktŒ± ‚àí rkt
                                                                                     
                                                 kt
                                                                                                             i
                                                         + Œ≤Vt+1 ({st+1,m }m‚àà[1:nt+1 ] , yt , ¬µÃÇt , Œ£t )|It‚àí1 .

Note that a,t is orthogonal to all other signals and shocks and has a zero mean. Thus,
                                                    h
Vt ({st,m }m‚àà[1:nt ] , yt‚àí1 , ¬µÃÇt‚àí1 , Œ£t‚àí1 ) = max E AÃÑ ‚àí ((E[Œ∏t |It ] ‚àí Œ∏t )2 + œÉa2 ) ktŒ± ‚àí rkt
                                                                                      
                                               kt
                                                                                                              i
                                                          + Œ≤Vt+1 ({st+1,m }m‚àà[1:nt+1 ] , yt , ¬µÃÇt , Œ£t )|It‚àí1 .

Notice that E[(E[Œ∏t |It ] ‚àí Œ∏t )2 |It‚àí1 ] is the time-t conditional (posterior) variance of Œ∏t , and
the posterior variance of beliefs is E[(E[Œ∏t |It ] ‚àí Œ∏t )2 ] := Œ£t . Thus, expected productivity is
E[At ] = AÃÑ ‚àí Œ£t ‚àí œÉa2 , which determines the within period expected payoff. Additionally,
using the Kalman system equation (4), this posterior variance is
                                    h                       ‚àí1           i‚àí1
                             Œ£t =     œÅ2 (Œ£‚àí1     2 ‚àí1
                                           t‚àí1 + œÉa )  + œÉŒ∏2     + nt œÉ‚àí2

which depends only on Œ£t‚àí1 , nt , and other known parameters. It does not depend on
the realization of the data. Thus, {st,m }m‚àà[1:nt ] , yt‚àí1 , ¬µÃÇt do not appear on the right side of
the value function equation; they are only relevant for determining the optimal action at .
Therefore, we can rewrite the value function as:
                                      h                                          i

                              Equilibrium with Two Types of Firms

   Here we re-introduce the dependence on firm index i. Assume there are two types of
firms, i = L, H, were L (H) stands for low (high)-tech firm. High tech firms have high
data efficiency: znew > zold . There is a mass M of firms with high data efficiency.
   The first order condition of each firm in this environment is:

Euler equation is a 2nd order equation in posterior variance: it involves Œ£i,t‚àí1 (through
substituting for ki,t from equation (4)) , Œ£i,t , and Œ£i,t+1 . Alternatively, it can be expressed
a 2nd order equation in firm capital: it involves ki,t‚àí1 , ki,t , and ki,t+1 .

The second pair determine firm posterior variance given the prior variance and production
