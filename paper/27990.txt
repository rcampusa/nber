                                           ABSTRACT

No firm or sector of the global economy is untouched by innovation. In equilibrium, innovators
will flock to (and innovation will occur where) the returns to innovative capital are the highest. In
this paper, we document a strong empirical pattern in green patent production. Specifically, we
find that oil, gas, and energy producing firms ­ firms with lower Environmental, Social, and
Governance (ESG) scores, and who are often explicitly excluded from ESG funds' investment
universe ­ are key innovators in the United States' green patent landscape. These energy
producers produce more, and significantly higher quality, green innovation. Our findings raise
important questions as to whether the current exclusions of many ESG-focused policies ­ along
with the increasing incidence of explicit divestiture campaigns ­ are optimal, or whether reward-
based incentives would lead to more efficient innovative outcomes.

    As of 2019, sustainable investing represents more than 20 percent of the $46 trillion

in the U.S. assets under management. Compared to 2015, sustainable and impact investing

has increased by more than 40% (USSIF 2018). A large contributor to this growth has

been the 2015 guidance issued by the Department of Labor which allowed fiduciaries to

incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into their investment

decision.1 Given this push, flows to ESG increased substantially.2

    The most straightforward motivation for ESG investing comes from a preference

function that loads positively on the goals of a given ESG fund. An investor with these

preferences might be willing to sacrifice an amount of risk-adjusted return in order to

allow the fund to achieve those returns with aligned ESG focus; or alternatively, pay more

for a fund that promises the same ex-ante risk-return dynamics while delivering aligned

ESG investment.

    However, a number of other views could motivate ESG investing. For instance, a

micro-founded, belief-based view of ESG investing could exist irrespective of the investor's

actual preferences for ESG. If consumers value products that are ESG compliant, they

factor      stance: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/employers-and-advisers/guidance/field-assistance-
bulletins/2018-01

  According to a 2019 survey by Callen Institute, of the 89 U.S. institutional investors that were asked
about their approach to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors when evaluating investments,
42% of them incorporated ESG factors into the investment decision-making. The corresponding figure in
2012 was 22%. The implementation of ESG is often done by either avoiding certain categories categorically
(such as Tobacco (27%), Weapons (16%), Fossil Fuel (11%), Gambling (11%)), or embracing certain
industries (such as Local Economic Benefit (22%), Clean Tech (14%), Environment (11%), etc.). Norges
Bank, as an illustration, decides on the exclusion of companies from the fund's investment universe, or to
place companies on an observation list. In 2020, out of 167 excluded companies, 76 % of them were either
involved in production of coal or coal-based energy, caused severe environmental damage, or emitted
unacceptable    amounts      of   green-house    gasses   (https://www.nbim.no/en/the-fund/responsible-
investment/exclusion-of-companies/).


                                                    3
might be willing to pay a premium for these, or firms might collect a monopolistic rent

on production if it were a salient product differentiation attribute. Moreover, if talented

workers preferred companies following ESG principles, it could also be a mechanism to

attract higher quality factors of production (such as human capital), or pay less for these

factors. In these ways, good ESG behavior might be a source of comparative advantage

that ­ if the market didn't fully impound ­ could result in favorable future return

dynamics.

   The clearest counterargument to these positive arguments is that the constrained

portfolio maximization run by ESG-constrained fund managers is dominated by the

unconstrained maximization run by other managers, resulting in likely underperformance

in the risk-return space.

   The academic evidence on the realized performance of ESG-focused funds is decidedly

mixed (Eccles, Ioannous, and Serefaim (2014), Krüger (2015), Dimson and Karakas, and

Li (2015), Khan, Serafaim, and Yoon (2016), Ferrell, Liang and Renneboog (2016), among

others). Moreover, there is limited systematic evidence that firms receiving disproportional

amounts of capital from ESG funds have outperformed in any measurable way. Given

this, our understanding of whether ESG investment flows impact innovation which can

help us solve environmental problems is incomplete.

   In this paper, we aim to address this gap in the literature by being the first paper to

systematically investigate who produces green patents, the most influential of these green

patent producers, and whether the capital of investors who desire to allocate capital

toward ESG objectives actually do end up investing in these producers. As a starting

point, as ESG capital investment flows have been rising in the past decades, there has

been a concurrent sharp increase in green innovation and patent production, as shown in


                                             4
Figure 1.

        We show that the majority of this recent green patenting is not driven by highly

rated ESG firms, firms that are commonly favored by ESG funds, but instead by firms

that are explicitly excluded from ESG funds investment universe. We use two large

datasets that capture the complete universe of patents from 2008 through 2017 in order

to identify the universe of green patenting activity.3 Moreover, for much of our analysis

on firm characteristics of patenting entities, we concentrate on publicly traded firms, due

to there being rich, publicly available measures of firm characteristics, external activities,

income, profitability, and patent holdings.

        Specifically, we show that the energy sector has a large and growing percentage of

their entirety of patenting activity dedicated to green research. Moreover, the incremental

green patent is significantly more likely to come from energy firms than any other type

of firm, in particular highly rated ESG firms that are producers of green patents. In

addition, the green patents of energy producing firms are significantly higher quality, in

terms of being more highly cited. Energy producing firms are also significantly more likely

to produce "blockbuster" green patents than other firms. Yet, these energy firms are

explicitly excluded from many ESG funds, and the targets of many divestiture campaigns

whose stated aims often include push forward green energy innovation.4 On the intensive

margin, energy firms even get less "credit" in terms of incremental ESG score increase for

each (higher quality) green patent they produce.

  While our patent data exists back to 1980, our ESG ranking data only begin in 2008, which is why we
begin our main testing sample then. However, for every test that does not rely on the ESG data, the sample
is from 1980 to 2017. Our overall institutional ownership data goes back to 2005, and hence for every test
that rely on institutional ownership, the sample is from 2005-2017.

         The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides background

for our study, while Section III describes the data we collect on patents and ESG metrics

in order to run our analyses. Section IV presents our main results on green patenting,

including the most frequent patenting entities, the quality of this patenting, and the

reward the market seemingly places upon it, Section V concludes.



II.      Background

      In addition to the above-mentioned studies, recent empirical work investigating the

implications of socially responsible investing on firms include Teoh et al. (1999), Hong

and Kacperczyk (2009), Geczy et al. (2005), among others. Teoh et al. (1999) studies the

effects of the South African boycott to end apartheid and shows the boycott had no

discernible effect on the valuation of firms with ties to South Africa. Similarly, a New

York Times (2014) article notes that Stanford's divestment from coal stocks had little

effect on stock prices. Geczy et al. (2005) and Hong and Kacperczyk (2009) study the

characteristics of stocks that are not usually favored by socially responsible investing and

show that these stocks tend to have lower price-to-book ratios, less institutional

ownership, and less analyst coverage.

      Earlier studies on the theory of impact investing argue that firms that are excluded

by socially responsible investors end up facing with higher costs of capital, suggesting

clean projects need to clear a higher hurdle rate to be financed (Heinkel et al. 2001).

Unlike Heinkel et al. (2001) which puts emphasis on the negative effects of screening by

the socially responsible funds, Oehmke and Opp (2020) focus on the conditions under

which socially responsible investors provide additional financing for clean technology

relative to what profit-maximizing investors would be willing to provide. In that sense,


                                             6
Oehmke and Opp (2020) highlight the positive aspects of impact investing by focusing on

the ability of socially responsible investors to impact firms by relaxing financial constraints

for clean production. Chowdry, Davies, and Waters (2019) provide a model in which

profit- and social- impact motivated investors provide financing for projects that produce

both corporate profits and social good. They show that when a firm that cannot commit

to pursuing social goals, impact investors should hold financial claims in the firm to

incentivize profit-motivated owners to pursue social goals. Moreover, Hart and Zingales

(2017) argue companies should consider maximize shareholder welfare, including

environmental concerns, not just financial value, and explicitly calls for active fund

engagement rather than divestment.5

    The equilibrium asset pricing implications of divestment have been subject of Davies

and Van Wesep (2018), and Pastor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2019). Davies and Van

Wesep (2018) study divestment campaigns which aim to depress share prices to induce

managers to change firm behavior. They make the case that divestment campaigns are

likely to be ineffective and may be counterproductive simply because managerial

compensation contracts reward long-run profitability and stock returns, rather than short

term prices. Pastor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2019) propose a general equilibrium pricing

model incorporating ESG investment preferences.                  In their model, ESG firms have

negative CAPM alphas, the extent to which depend on preference heterogeneity and

strength of ESG sensitivity in preferences.

III.      Data

       Our analysis relies on two main streams of data: (1) Patent Citation and Patent

Assignment databases, and (2) Environmental Score data from Sustainalytics ESG

Ratings database. We collect data on all patents granted in the United States from the

Patent Citation and Patent Assignment database for the years from 1980 through 2017.6

We focus on publicly traded firms, for which there are rich, publicly available measures

of firm characteristics, external activities, income, profitability, and patent holdings. We

assign patents to Compustat firms by matching patents' assignee names with Compustat

company names. In order to do this, we use a combination of natural language processing

(NLP) techniques to implement exact and fuzzy matching, and then augment with hand

matching (and checking).

       We then further classify each patent into a technology class (essentially, the industry

to which the patent applies) and also whether the patent has the potential to contribute

to environmental problems, which we call "green patents" following the guidelines the

Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) created for the same

purpose. 7 According to this classification, patents that are related to environmental

technologies are classified into various broad environmental technology categories

including environmental management, water related adaptation technologies, biodiversity

protection and ecosystem health, climate change mitigation technologies related to energy

generation, and waste-water treatment or waste management. 8 Hascic, and Migotto

(2015) provide a detailed explanation of OECD's algorithm that identify patents that

contain environment-related technologies related to environmental pollution, water

scarcity, climate change mitigation.9

    Additionally, we use Sustainalytics' Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)

Ratings Database to measure a given firm's engagement in environmental issues.

Sustainalytics' database aims to contain information on how well companies proactively

manage the environmental, social, and governance issues that are the most material to

their respective business. More specifically, Sustainalytics evaluates firms based on three

categories: (a) Preparedness, (b) Disclosure, and (c) Performance. Preparedness refers to

company management systems and policies designed to manage material environmental

risks. Disclosure refers to whether the company meets international best practice-

standards and is transparent with respect to the most material ESG issues. Finally,

Performance refers to company environmental performance based on quantitative metrics

such as carbon intensity and based on the analysis of controversial incidents in which the

company may have been involved.

IV.    Main Results on Green Patenting

a. Top Green Patenting Firms and the Time Series of Green Patenting

       We begin our analysis by examining the top green patent holding firms as of 2017.

This is shown in Table 1. Table 1 shows a number of initial interesting patterns. From

Panel A, out of top 50 green patent producers, for instance, 14% of them are energy firms,

which are explicitly excluded by many ESG favored funds, and a main segment of the

firms focused-upon by divestiture campaigns. These firms are Exxon Mobil, Honeywell

International, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Conoco Phillips, Chevron, and US Oil. These seven

firms collectively produced 6,969 green innovation patents. This can also be seen in Panel

B, in which the Energy Sector has the second most green patents amongst the sector-

classifiable green patents.



                              --     Insert Table 1 here --



       In Table 2, we tabulate the number of granted patents that we use in our tests ­

both green and non-green - for public firms. Our final sample, containing all firms from

1980 to 2017 that produce at least one patent is 11,397 public firms. These firms produce

2,077,832 patents, of which we flag 5.61% as green patents. In looking at the time series,

the percentage of green patents peaks in number and percentage in the last year of the

sample, with 5,251 patents produced (6.32% of all patents produced by publicly traded

firms in 2017).



                              --     Insert Table 2 here --




                                           10
b. Green Patenting at the Industry Level

         We next move on to our main regression analyses in order to explore the above

patterns in a more formal setting where we can control for numerous determinants of

R&D and patenting. In particular, we explore the role that the energy sector is playing

in the landscape of green innovation vis-à-vis other firms undertaking R&D programs and

patenting in the same space. We begin by examining green patenting at the industry

level.

         Turning to this industry-level analysis, we first explore whether green patent

production in the energy sector differs from that of green patent production in other

industries. To perform the analysis, we estimate the following OLS fixed-effects model:



Green Patent Ratio it = b0 + b1 x Energy Sectorit + Year Fixed Effects             (1)



         The unit of observation in this analysis is industry-year, where we define an

industry with its 2-digit SIC code. In this analysis, reported in Table 3, we only include

industries if at least one firm produced one green patent in a particular year, ensuring

that we compare only industries that engage actively in green patent production. Our

sample spans from 1980 to 2017 and we have roughly 56 industries per year on average.

Energy Sector is a dummy variable if the first two digits of its Standard Industrial

Classification (SIC) is 10 (Metal, Mining), 12 (Coal Mining), 13 (Oil & Gas Extraction),

14 (Nonmetallic Minerals, Except Fuels), 29 (Petroleum & Coal Products), or 49 (Electric,

Gas, & Sanitary Services). Out of 2,143 industry-year observations, 197 observations

belong to the energy sector.




                                           11
                               --     Insert Table 3 here --



       Our main dependent variable of interest is the Green Patent Ratio. We compute

this ratio simply by dividing the number of granted green patents in a given industry by

the total number of granted patents in that industry in that particular year. This measure

is meant to capture the relative importance of green innovation in that industry (vs. all

other innovation), through this green share. In this sample, 8.30 % of the patents are

green patents. We find that the coefficient of the Energy Sector Dummy is 13.95% (t =

15.28). This implies that the energy sector has nearly three times the relative focus on

green innovation in their innovation portfolio as the average industry, at 22.25%.

Moreover, at the sector-wide level, the energy sector appears to have a sizable percentage

of its innovation efforts going toward green research ­ with nearly a quarter of its patent

innovation in this space. From Table 3, our conclusions remain similar when we control

for several important factors that could potentially contribute to the industry level green

patent production. These factors include average industry level investment, R&D

spending level, average firm age in the industry, average firm size in the industry, average

firm cash level, and average industry book leverage. Moreover, nearly all of these on their

own are not significantly related to the Green Patent Ratio on their own. This is to say

that it is not industries that on average have higher overall investment, specifically higher

R&D investment industries, industries with older firms, larger firms, or firms with more

cash reserves that focus disproportionately on green innovation. The only industry-level

variable that appears related is average book leverage, with industries focusing on green

patenting being slightly more highly levered on average.




                                             12
       One might worry that the patenting we are measuring in Table 3 has to do broader

green patenting outside of specific climate-mitigation technology with respect to energy

sources. This might be especially true if energy firms were attempting to strategically

appear engaged in green patenting, but not wanting to materially impact the fossil-fuel

components of their businesses. In order to explore this, we subset our green patent

universe to examine solely those green patents in the universe that directly address

"Climate change mitigation technologies related to energy generation, transmission, or

distribution."

       The results of the analysis are reported in Appendix Table A1. Specifically, in

Appendix Table A1 we run an identical regression to Table 3, but focusing solely on these

alternative energy patents. From Appendix Table A1, the Energy Sector appears to have

a significantly larger percentage of its innovation efforts going specifically toward

alternative energy innovation relative to all other industries. Specifically, the coefficient

in Column 3 of 0.0221 (t=5.022) implies that the energy sector has, similar to Table 3,

an almost three times larger focus specifically on climate change mitigation technology

innovation relative to all other industries.



c. Which Environmental Score firms are Green Patenting?

       We now turn our focus to the link between incremental green patent production

and environmental metrics many investors focus on to allocate their capital in this space.

We begin by asking the simple question of whether firms with better Environmental Scores

contribute more to green patent production in general; i.e., we ask if the incremental green

patent is more likely to come from better or worse scored ESG firms. Relatedly, we also

examine whether the incremental green patent is more likely to come from companies in


                                               13
the energy sector to check whether the Table 3's industry-level analysis - which suggested

energy industries dedicate a significantly larger percentage of their patenting activity to

green research - is also echoed at a more granular, firm-level. We conduct this analysis

using the patent level data and use the following linear probability models:



Green Patent Dummy i = b0 + b1 x Environmental Scoreit + Year Fixed Effects (2)



and



Green Patent Dummy i = b0 + b1 x Energy Sectorit + Year Fixed Effects              (3)



   Our initial findings, summarized in Table 4, demonstrate two strong patterns. First,

the coefficient of Environmental Score in Column 1 is negative, indicating that the

incremental green patent is more likely to come from more poorly scored ESG firms. More

specifically, the negative coefficient of Environmental Score (-0.011, t =3.704).        In

particular, the -0.0011 coefficient implies that a firm which has a one standard deviation

higher Environmental Score (13.807) is 24% less likely to green patent (1.52% less likely

from a mean of 6.38%). In Column 2, we then explore to what extent this might be driven

by the relation from Table 3 ­ that energy firms have both significantly lower

Environmental Scores, but also are large and important producers of green patents.



                              --     Insert Table 4 here --




                                            14
   Column 2 of Table 4 suggests that the incremental green patent is more likely to come

from firms in the energy sector. More specifically, the positive coefficient on Energy Sector

of 0.1364 (t = 5.50) implies that green patents are over three times more likely to be

produced by energy firms than by firms in other industries (20.02% vs. 6.38%).

   Lastly, one might argue that given that we know energy firms are active in green

patenting, perhaps this is simply a mechanical relationship ­ and would hold with any

industry we know is active in the green patenting space. In order to test this thesis, we

run the identical specification in Table 4, but instead include a categorical variable for

whether the firm is from one of the Top 3 Industries in green patenting activity (excluding

the Energy Sector):



Green Patent Dummy i = b0 + b1 x Top 3 Sectors (outside of Energy)it + Year Fixed

Effects   (4)



   The results are shown in Column 3 of Table 4. In sharp contrast to the Energy Sector,

the coefficient on other active sectors is negative and highly significant. This suggests that

these industries, while active in green patenting, are even more active in patenting in

other types of technologies. Thus, these industries are simply higher frequency patentors

across all technologies, and in fact appear to actually proportionately concentrate on

activities outside of green innovation. Again, this is the opposite of the relative

concentration in this activity for energy firms.

   These results collectively reinforce those from Table 3, suggesting that the incremental

green patent is significantly more likely to come from energy firms than other green

patentors.


                                             15
d. Who gets Rewarded for Green Patenting?

       In this section, we turn out focus to the determinants of ESG scores. Specifically,

we ask whether the widely used environmental metrics reflect the green patent production

of firms. Put differently, the evidence thus far suggests that: i.) the energy sector firms

(which have lower ESG scores, along with being explicitly restricted by many ESG-focused

vehicles and campaigns) appear to be large players in the universe of the entirety of green

patenting; and ii.) that firms with higher environmental scoring seem to produce fewer

green patents, on average. Given these two facts, we next ask whether energy firms are

driving the negative relationship in general between ESG scores and green patents we

document in Table 4; and relatedly, whether energy firms get less "credit" in terms of

incremental ESG scores for each green patent they produce.

       To examine these questions, we estimate the following OLS model,

       In this analysis, we work with firm level data as public firm disclosures allow us to

measure several research inputs, such as research and development expenses, at the firm

level. The data also allow us to control for important firm characteristics potentially

related to green patent production. For instance, if the energy sector were dominated by

large firms and green patents require a certain minimum-scale, we could be attributing

the higher green patent production result documented in Tables 3 and 4 to being involved


                                            16
in energy, when in fact firm size is driving the results. We include firm size in this last

specification to explicitly control for such factors contaminating our results.



                               --     Insert Table 5 here --



       Our main variable of interest in Table 5 is Green Effort, which measures a firm's

effort to produce green patents. We use three metrics for this purpose: (1) number of

green patents granted in a given year, (2) number of green patent applications in a given

year, and (3) number of citations per green patent, in that particular year. With the first

two metrics, number of patent applications and patents granted, we seek to capture the

green patent production activity at different points of the patenting process. The last

metric, number of citations per green patent, proxies for some measure of green patent

quality produced. For all the measures, to look at their relative percentage differences

across firms and years, we take the log of one plus the metrics (1)-(3).

       From Table 5, a number of empirical patterns emerge. First, once Energy Sector

firms are stripped out, for all other firms there is a positive relationship between

Environmental Score and green effort metrics. For instance, the coefficient of number of

green patents granted from Column 1 suggests that a firm with one-standard deviation

higher green patenting receives a 2.10 point higher Environmental Score (t = 2.026). This

same positive and significant relationship with Environmental Score holds across the other

measures of green effort for firms outside of the Energy Sector: number of green patents

applied for and number of citations per green patent.

       Second, that the energy sector seems to be an exception to this general positive

reward that is given for green patenting efforts by firms. In particular, both the main


                                             17
effect coefficient on a firm being in the Energy Sector is negative, along with the

interaction term, Energy Sector x Green Effort, being negative across specifications. While

marginally statistically significant, the coefficients imply large economic magnitudes

across each of the respective Green Effort metrics. For instance, the results in Column 1

suggest that an energy firm with a one-standard deviation larger amount of green patents

granted in a given year compared to average firm in the sample, is associated with -5.26

(t = 1.926) lower Environmental Score. Compared to the mean Environmental Score of

56, this magnitude corresponds to a roughly 10% lower score. Put differently, energy firms

get less credit in terms of incremental ESG scores for each green patent they are granted,

apply for, or even citation per green patent awarded.

       Panel B of Table 5 performs the identical analysis as Panel A, but again with the

placebo grouping of other frequent green patenting sectors. In sharp contrast to energy

sector firms, other top green patenting firms both have significantly higher ESG scores on

average, and are rewarded more for green patenting activity, than the average firm. Thus,

it appears again to be a special characteristic of energy firms with regard to the association

of their green patenting vs. all other firms (even other frequent green patentors).



e. Quality of Green Innovation

   One explanation that could potentially explain the results in Tables 3-5 is that energy

producing firms simply produce lower quality (or less meaningful) innovation within the

green innovation space. If this were true, we might expect to see exactly what is observed

­ that while the energy sector produces a large quantity of green patents (in number), the

value of these patents are low, and thus Environmental Scores appropriately take this

into account by not rewarding for this relatively low-quality innovation.


                                             18
   In Table 6 we test this by investigating the quality of green innovation by the energy

sector vs. other green innovation. For this purpose, we define two variables. Our first

metric is the number of citations the green patents of a firm receives. The second one is

a dummy variable that takes a value of one if the percentage of green patent citations is

above the 95th percentile of all green patents for that year (which we term Blockbuster

Patent). Results presented in Table 6 show that energy firms do not appear to produce

green patents of lower quality. In fact, the opposite appears to be true. Green patents

produced by the energy sector are significantly more highly cited than the average green

patent, and are significantly more likely to be Blockbuster Patents. The coefficient in

Column 3 of Panel A on Energy sector suggests that the green patents of energy firms

have 9.14% (t = 4.281) more citations on average than other green patents. Relatedly,

Column 3 of Panel B suggests that energy firms are 12.36% (t = 4.898) more likely to

produce a blockbuster green patent.

   In Panels C and D we test this same alternative for other industries that produce large

amounts of green patents. Again, these industries appear to be producing different kinds

of green patents. For these other industries, even though they are large producers of green

patents, the green patents seem to be of significantly lower quality on average (Panel C).

Moreover, they are also significantly less likely to be blockbuster green patents (Panel D).

   Stepping back, the results of Tables 3-6 then suggest that energy producers in our

sample appear to produce more, and significantly higher quality, green innovation.

Further, this is not a function of them being simply producers of a large share of green

patents, as other aggregate large share producers of green patents exhibit quite different

empirical dynamics.

f. Fund Flow Analysis

   In our final analysis, we investigate whether energy firms ­ who empirically appear to

be large producers of high quality green innovation in relative terms - are getting

disproportionally more (or less) capital from ESG funds. For this purpose, we conduct

two tests. First, we investigate whether green funds are investing less in energy firms in

comparison to other funds. In other words, after conditioning on a firm being in the energy

sector, do we observe ESG funds invest less in energy than other types of (otherwise

equivalent) funds. Secondly, we ask whether energy firms constitute a lower weight of the

portfolio of ESG funds compared to their other investments; i.e. if we solely focus on ESG

or green funds, do we observe a less weight is given to firms that operate in energy sector.

   To conduct these two tests, we need to identify the funds that are likely to be

considered as "green funds," or "ESG funds," by investors. We identify these green funds

using two methods. First, we look at the fund names. We label a fund as a green fund if

its name contains "ESG" or "green". We manually go through this list and eliminate

names that are likely to give us a type 2 errors, i.e. we do not call "Evergreen Money

Market Fund" as a green fund. Second, we look at the lists that are publicized by two

well-known market participants in this space - The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible

Investment (USSIF) and Charles Schwab.

   Table 7 contains our analysis. From Table 7, the answers to the questions posed above

appear to be "yes" in both instances. Specifically, across Panel A of Table 7, the

coefficients on Green Fund indicate that controlling for other determinants of holding,

energy firms are: i.) significantly less likely to be held at all; ii.) are held in significantly


                                               20
smaller amounts; and iii.) are held in significantly smaller weights relative to their index-

weight; by Green Funds vs. all other funds. Each of these effects are large in magnitude

(25% to 100% differences), and highly statistically significant.

     Panel B then shows that the exact opposite is true of other highly active green

patenting firms outside of the energy sector.      Finally, Panel C shows that from the

perspective of conditioning on a Green Fund, and reinforces these findings: controlling for

other firm-level determinants of holdings, Green Funds significantly underweight energy

sector firms, and overweight other green patenting firms.

     Stepping back, Table 7 shows a real, capital markets flow implication of being an

energy firm in terms of investment underweighting (and avoidance) by Green Funds. This

is despite the evidence in Tables 3-6 regarding their extensive role in green patenting, and

the relative quality of this green patenting activity.



                               --     Insert Table 7 here --




V.      Conclusion

        We find consistent and robust markers that the quantity and quality of green

patenting is higher for energy firms. Paradoxically, these firms are precisely those to

which capital is often restricted by mandates and campaigns whose directive is to solve

the important problems linked to green innovation. Our analysis thus suggests there is a,

perhaps surprisingly, negative relationship between the generators of innovation that can

help us confront environmental challenges and where capital is being directed. That said,

there is still work to be done as to whether capital allocation indeed follows the ESG


                                             21
scores, and to what extent this ESG score-motivated investment can be calibrated to

achieve better capital allocation by the investors.

       Stepping back, we believe investigation of these issues will provide critical insight

into the shifting landscape of innovation, allowing us to capture and assess the full welfare

impact of ESG capital on the economy. Moreover, our findings raise important questions

as to whether the current exclusions of many ESG-focused policies ­ along with the

increasing incidence of explicit divestiture campaigns - are optimal, or whether reward-

based incentives would lead to more efficient innovative outcomes.

using OECD's IPC classification, i.e. green patents are the ones that contain one of the following
environmental technologies: environmental management, water-related adaptation technologies,
biodiversity protection and ecosystem health, climate change mitigation technologies related to energy
generation, transmission or distribution, transportation, buildings, waste-water treatment or waste
management, and production or processing of goods. Green patent classification is constructed and

                          Table 3: Green Patent Production and Energy Sector.
This table reports the results of OLS regressions where the dependent variable is the Industry Green Patent
Ratio, which is the percentage of green patents granted in a given industry, defined by 2-digit SIC code, in
that particular year. Energy Sector is a dummy variable if the first two digit of Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) is 10 (Metal, Mining), 12 (Coal Mining), 13 (Oil & Gas Extraction), 14 (Nonmetallic
Minerals, Except Fuels), 29 (Petroleum & Coal Products), or 49 (Electric, Gas, & Sanitary Services). We
identify green patents using OECD's IPC classification, i.e. green patents are the ones that contain one of
the   following   environmental   technologies:   environmental       management,     water-related     adaptation
technologies, biodiversity protection and ecosystem health, climate change mitigation technologies related
to energy generation, transmission or distribution, transportation, buildings, waste-water treatment or waste
management, and production or processing of goods. Unit of observation is industry (2-digit SIC code) and
year. The sample covers 1980 to 2017. Reported t-statistics in parentheses are heteroscedasticity-robust and
clustered by year.

   Table 4. Green Patent Production, Environmental Score and Energy Sector ­ Patent level analysis.
This table reports the results of OLS regressions where the dependent variable is a dummy variable that
takes a value of one if the granted patent is a green patent, as defined in the description of Table 1. The
independent variable is Environmental Score (out of 100) which shows how well companies proactively
manage the environmental issues that are the most material to their business. Energy Sector is a dummy
variable that equals to one if the first two digit of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 10 (Metal,
Mining), 12 (Coal Mining), 13 (Oil & Gas Extraction), 14 (Nonmetallic Minerals, Except Fuels), 29
(Petroleum & Coal Products), or 49 (Electric, Gas, & Sanitary Services). Top 3 Sector (outside of Energy)
is a dummy variable that equals to one if the sector is among the top 3 sectors in terms of green patent
production, excluding the Energy Sector: Manufacturing, Services, and Transportation & Public Utilities.
The sample period is from 2008 to 2018. Reported t-statistics in parentheses are heteroscedasticity-robust
and clustered by year. Reported t-statistics in parentheses are heteroscedasticity-robust and clustered by

                            Table 6. Green Patent Citations and Energy Sector.
This table reports the results of OLS regressions where the dependent variable in Panel A is the log of green
patent citations normalized by all patent citations by a firm, and the dependent variable in Panel B is an
indicator variable that equals to one if the percentage of green patent citation is the the top 95 percentile.
We identify green patents using OECD's IPC classification, i.e. green patents are the ones that contain one
of the following environmental technologies: environmental management, water-related adaptation
technologies, biodiversity protection and ecosystem health, climate change mitigation technologies related
to energy generation, transmission or distribution, transportation, buildings, waste-water treatment or waste
management, and production or processing of goods. Energy Sector is a dummy variable that equals to one
if the first two digit of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 10 (Metal, Mining), 12 (Coal Mining), 13
(Oil & Gas Extraction), 14 (Nonmetallic Minerals, Except Fuels), 29 (Petroleum & Coal Products), or 49
(Electric, Gas, & Sanitary Services). Top 3 Sectors (outside of Energy) is a dummy variable that equals to
one if the sector is among the top 3 sectors in terms of green patent production, excluding the Energy
Sector: Manufacturing, Services, and Transportation & Public Utilities. The sample covers 1980 to 2017.
Reported t-statistics in parentheses are heteroscedasticity-robust and clustered by year.

                            Table 7. Green Funds Investment in Energy Sector
Panel A reports OLS regression of fund ownership in a firm on whether the fund is a green fund,
conditioning on a firm being in the Energy Sector. Panel B reports OlS regression of fund ownership in a
firm on whether the firm is in the Energy Sector, conditioning on the fund being a green fund. A fund is
considered green if is has "ESG" or "green" in its name, or is in in the list of USSIF (The Forum of
Sustainable and Responsible Investment), or it is in the list of Charles Schwab's Green Funds. Energy
Sector is a dummy variable that equals to one if the first two digit of Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) is 10 (Metal, Mining), 12 (Coal Mining), 13 (Oil & Gas Extraction), 14 (Nonmetallic Minerals, Except
Fuels), 29 (Petroleum & Coal Products), or 49 (Electric, Gas, & Sanitary Services). Top 3 Sectors is a
dummy variable that equals to one if the industry is among the top 3 sectors in terms of green patent
production, excluding the Energy Sector: Manufacturing, Services, and Transportation & Public Utilities.
The sample covers 2005 to 2018.11 All regressions include year-quarter fixed effects. Reported t-statistics in
parentheses are heteroscedasticity-robust and clustered by fund x firm.

  Appendix Table A.1: Green Patent Production and Energy Sector ­ Looking only at patents that are
   "Climate change mitigation technologies related to energy generation, transmission or distribution".

This table reports the results of OLS regressions where the dependent variable is the Industry Green Patent
Ratio, which is the percentage of green patents granted in a given industry, defined by 2-digit SIC code, in
that particular year. Energy Sector is a dummy variable if the first two digit of Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) is 10 (Metal, Mining), 12 (Coal Mining), 13 (Oil & Gas Extraction), 14 (Nonmetallic
Minerals, Except Fuels), 29 (Petroleum & Coal Products), or 49 (Electric, Gas, & Sanitary Services). We
identify green patents using OECD's IPC classification, i.e. green patents climate change mitigation
technologies related to energy generation, transmission or distribution. Unit of observation is industry (2-
digit SIC code) and year. The sample covers 1980 to 2017. Reported t-statistics in parentheses are
heteroscedasticity-robust and clustered by year.
