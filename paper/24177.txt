Global Inequality when Unequal Countries Create Unequal People

                                           ABSTRACT

Current global inequality measures assume that national-mean income does not matter to
economic welfare at given household income, as measured in surveys. The paper questions that
assumption on theoretical and empirical grounds and finds that prominent stylized facts about
global inequality are not robust. At one extreme, theories of relative deprivation yield a
nationalistic measure whereby global inequality is average within-country inequality, which is
rising. Other theories and evidence point instead to an intrinsic value to living in a richer country.
Then parameter values consistent with subjective wellbeing imply far higher global inequality
than prevailing measures, though falling since 1990.

1.      Introduction
        The prevailing approach to measuring global inequality pools all household incomes in
the world and measures inequality in this global distribution the same way one measures
inequality within one country. This has been dubbed the “cosmopolitan” approach in that
everyone in the world is treated the same way. 2 Three stylized facts have emerged from the
literature following this approach: 3 (i) the bulk of global inequality (two-thirds to three-quarters)
is between countries rather than within them; (ii) inequality between countries has been falling
since around 1990, while average inequality within countries has been rising; and (iii) on
balance, global inequality has been falling.
        We have seen diverse reactions to this pattern. Some observers have argued that falling
global inequality diminishes the need for further redistributive effort, including in addressing
high and rising inequality within countries. 4 Another view is that rising inequality in rich
countries is an unwelcome consequence of the falling inequality between-countries, as jobs
appear to move to the developing countries that are far poorer but are enjoying higher growth
rates during the current period of globalization and convergence. 5
        However, there appears to be a salience to nationality that is missing from the
cosmopolitan approach to measuring global inequality, at least as it is commonly implemented
empirically. 6 That salience stems in large part from the fact that many of the arguments made
against high inequality relate to residents of a given country rather than the world as a whole. 7
An example is the commonly-heard concern about economically-powerful elites dominating
political and judicial decision making at national and local levels. Similarly, the relevant domain
for personal evaluations of status and self-respect in unequal societies often appears to be
national rather than global. The standard cosmopolitan approach to global inequality can be in
tension with the idea that ideals of “equity” or “justice” are confined to a set of “moral


2
  This is the term used by Brandolini and Carta (2016), in keeping with the usage in Caney (2005) and Nagel (2005).
3
  Further discussion of these stylized facts can be found in Bourguignon (2015), Lakner and Milanovic (2016),
Milanovic (2015, 2016) and Ravallion (2017a). Note that stylized fact (ii) represents a marked reversal in the long-
run pattern back to the early 19th century, as documented by Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002).
4
  For example, Cowen (2014) uses declining inequality between countries as an argument against intra-national
redistribution. See the comments by Bhattacharya (2014) and the Economist (2014).
5
  These views are discussed further in Bourguignon (2015), Milanovic (2016) and Rodrik (2017).
6
  Kanbur (2006) makes a similar point about “between-group” inequalities such as based on gender or ethnicity.
7
  This applies to most of the arguments for “non-intrinsic egalitarianism” made by O’Neill (2008).
                                                         2
comparators,” being people who are bound in some personal relationship, as in the approach
found in Walster et al. (1978). It has often been argued that for most people such relationships
are quite localized—rarely extending beyond the borders of the country of residence.
         One possible response to these concerns is to reject cosmopolitanism by down-weighting
foreigners. In the limit, “global inequality” is then nothing more than the average inequality
within countries. That can be thought of as an implication of political nationalism—that
distributional concerns and redistributive efforts are confined to fellow nationals. 8 For example,
in keeping with his contractarian approach to questions of social justice, Rawls (1999) argues
that people living in rich countries only have a moral obligation to help those in poor countries
when (and only when) the latter are not well governed, such that the people live in “burdened
societies.” 9 Such arguments motivate abandoning cosmopolitanism in favor of a more
nationalistic approach for measuring global inequality. For example, this is the approach taken
by Brandolini and Carta (2016) who postulate a social welfare function that treats people equally
within the country of residence but puts lower weight on foreigners.
         Yet, to many observers, including this author, a cosmopolitan approach to measuring
global inequality is compelling. Yes, nations exist and their governments address (in various
ways) inequality within their borders (and beyond them, such as through development
assistance). While the institutional fact of nation states and the limitations of global institutions
may entail severe constraints on what global redistribution can be achieved in practice, these
facts cannot dull the moral case for a cosmopolitan perspective in thinking about “global
inequality”—a perspective that values all people of the world equally, no matter where they may
happen to have been born. This echoes the arguments of Nagel (2005), Singer (2010) and others
that national borders are not morally relevant to the case for helping disadvantaged fellow human
beings. That implies an unconditional commitment to the cosmopolitan view in measuring global
inequality. Can such a commitment be reconciled with a concern about national identity?
         This paper offers an approach to measuring global inequality that maintains the essence
of cosmopolitanism but recognizes that one’s view of global inequality, and the implications one
draws for assessing global economic developments and policies, depends on how one values

8
  The term “nationalistic” can be used in different ways. Here it refers solely to how one thinks about global
inequality. In that context, the present usage is broadly consistent with others, such as Beck (2006).
9
  For a critical assessment of this and other aspects of Rawls (1999) see Buchanan (2000).

national income in assessing individual economic welfare. The literature on global inequality has
long recognized the existence of a “citizenship premium” (Milanovic, 2016, p.131) from living
in a rich country, but has implicitly assumed that this premium is fully reflected in household
income or consumption expenditure per person as measured in a household survey (normalized
to constant prices). That seems unlikely. Indeed, there are many reasons why national income
can matter to individual welfare at given own-income. One possibility that has been considered
in the literature is relative deprivation (Duesenberry, 1949; Runciman, 1966). Following this
approach, Ravallion and Chen (2011) and Milanovic and Roemer (2016) assume that individual
economic welfare depends on both own-income and relative income, defined as own-income
relative to the mean for the country of residence. 10 Then higher mean income has a negative
direct welfare effect. Intuitively, this suggests less inequality than implied by standard measures.
If the effect of relative deprivation is large enough then we end up with a strongly nationalistic
perspective on global inequality, which depends solely on the within-country component in
current measures.
        However, there can also be positive external effects of living in a wealthier country. The
contextual factors are transmitted via better institutions, better public services, greater security
and greater opportunities for economic gain, leisure and social protection, all of which can be
expected to depend positively on mean income in the country of residence. And these positive
effects could well dominate the negative effects associated with relative deprivation. To the
extent that those living in richer countries are intrinsically better off there is even greater
inequality in the world than suggested by current measures using survey-based own-incomes.
The inequality between countries becomes an extra source of inequality between people. In
short, unequal countries create (horizontally) unequal people at the same observed income.
Surprisingly, this possibility has been ignored in the literature on measuring global inequality.
        The paper studies how sensitive the findings in the literature on global inequality are to
allowing national income to matter intrinsically to individual economic welfare. The proposed
alternative measure is not simply a re-weighting of the “between” and “within” components of


10
  In the context of measuring relative poverty, Ravallion and Chen (2011) consider a welfare function of the form
𝑤𝑤(𝑦𝑦, 𝑦𝑦/𝑚𝑚) where y is own-income, m is the country mean and the function w is strictly increasing in both
arguments. Milanovic and Roemer (2016) consider a welfare function of the form 𝑦𝑦1−𝜆𝜆 (𝑦𝑦⁄𝑚𝑚)𝜆𝜆 where 0 ≤ 𝜆𝜆 ≤ 1.
Neither formulation allows a positive external welfare effect of living in a country with a higher mean income.
                                                         4
inequality, but requires a new measure, consistent with the underlying valuations of differences
in national income. Both positive and negative effects are allowed empirically. At one extreme, a
purely nationalist measure emerges. Another special case is the prevailing implementation of the
cosmopolitan approach. However, the paper also studies the implications of the neglected case in
the literature, whereby higher national income has a positive value at given own income.
       The paper finds that stylized fact (i) and (iii) are not robust to allowing national income to
matter intrinsically over the range of parameter values considered. One can obtain rising or
falling global inequality, and the “between-within” decomposition changes substantially. Even a
seemingly modest weight can generate anything from a large reduction in measured inequality to
a large increase. And the changes are larger than one sees over time, or that one obtains with
adjustments for underreporting of incomes by the rich. While further research is called for, the
paper argues that there is a stronger case for the view that higher national income has a positive
intrinsic value, implying higher global inequality than is thought, though falling since 1990.
Indeed, the trend decline in global inequality since 1990 is robust to all except a strongly
nationalistic view.
       The following section points to reasons why national income matters intrinsically,
implying that a new approach to measuring global inequality is called for. Section 3 outlines the
paper’s approach. Section 4 presents the results on global inequality measures. Section 5
concludes.

2.     Arguments and evidence as to why national income matters

       Standard measures of global inequality are based on household disposable income or
consumption expenditure derived from a household survey. The household aggregate for income
or consumption is then normalized for differences in the prices faced and household size (and
possibly composition). The resulting measure is taken to be a sufficient statistic for individual
real income. Yet there are some well recognized limitations of such data. The constraint of
relying on respondent recall in surveys entails that income or consumption is typically only
measured over a relatively short recall period. Nor is access to non-market goods, including
some public services, typically accounted for.



                                                 5
         Why national income matters intrinsically: In the standard approach to measuring global
inequality, mean national income only matters in so far as it influences individual own income,
as measured in surveys. 11 It is plausible that the country of residence matters to personal
income. 12 This is the instrumental case for why national income matters. However, there are also
reasons to postulate an independent intrinsic effect of national income. Four main reasons can be
identified, two of which imply a negative effect while it is positive for the other two.
         First, the “relative income hypothesis” of Duesenberry (1949) postulates that individual
welfare depends on how the individual is doing relative to a set of comparators. 13 In this context,
a higher mean in the country of residence is taken to give disutility at given own-income through
perceptions of relative deprivation. 14 Easterlin (1974) argues that the only way income matters to
subjective welfare is through its relative value, i.e., relative to national income. 15 This is how he
explains the seemingly weak response of average national happiness to aggregate economic
growth. (The discussion will return to the evidence on this issue.) Proponents of this approach
advocate that evaluations of individual real income are purely relative, and in the context of
measuring global inequality it is natural to think of the mean national income as the deflator for
own income.
         The discussion will return to the evidence on relative deprivation using data on subjective
wellbeing, but there is an observation that can be made from another data source. The fact that
the real values of national poverty lines rise with mean income can be interpreted as support for
the idea of relative deprivation (Ravallion and Chen, 2011). That interpretation assumes that the
national lines represent a (roughly) common level of welfare across countries, so that the
observed lines can be interpreted as money metrics of that common level of welfare. This cannot
be considered conclusive, however, since the reference level of welfare implicit in a national
poverty line may well be an increasing function of the mean. Thus there is an identification

11
   This dependence of own-income on national income is typically implicit in past approaches, but is made explicit
in Milanovic (2015).
12
   There is supportive evidence in the results of Clemens et al. (2008) on the determinants of labor market earnings
and the results of McKenzie et al. (2010) on the income gains from migration.
13
   Important early contributions in sociology were made by Davis (1959) and Runciman (1966). In economics,
social effects on welfare have been used to explain self-assessed welfare and aspects of behavior, including
Duesenberry (1949), Easterlin (1974), Frank (1985), and Clark et al. (2008).
14
   Rayo and Becker (2007) show that such utility functions can emerge endogenously (interpreted as the end-point of
an evolutionary process) given the difficulty in distinguishing close options and the boundedness of happiness.
15
   Subjective welfare (also called “subjective wellbeing”) here refers to self-assessed happiness or “satisfaction with
life” based on survey questions.

problem in what can be inferred from the fact that national lines rise with the mean (Ravallion
and Chen, 2017).
          The second reason starts with the observation that we would ideally measure real income
over a longer time period than that for which current income is measured in surveys. This is well
recognized in principle, but largely ignored in the practice of inequality measurement. For
example, Milanovic (2016, p.131) discusses the role that country of residence plays in
determining “lifetime income” through the aforementioned citizenship premium. But lifetime
income is not what is measured in surveys. Current national mean income may then be a relevant
indicator of expected future own-income, given that this need not be reflected well in the
available income metric. What then might national mean income reveal about expected future
income? In a neoclassical growth model, higher mean national income implies a higher capital
stock per capita. With diminishing returns to capital and a given technology, future growth rates
will then be lower in countries with a higher current mean—giving a process of economic
convergence among countries with a similar long-run (steady-state) mean income. 16 This
argument points to a negative effect of higher national income at given (survey-based) own-
income even without perceptions of relative deprivation.
          Third, it can be argued that higher mean income in the country of residence is associated
with advantages that are not reflected in the prevailing implementations of the cosmopolitan
approach based on household consumption or income from surveys. There are a number of
sources of such direct advantage. One way this can happen is through external benefits of living
in a society with a better educated population, as postulated in the Lucas (1988) model of
endogenous economic growth. As is well recognized, this can readily modify the convergence
property in the second argument above, which assumes similar fundamentals (including
technology) and (hence) a similar long-run mean income across countries. Against this view,
there is evidence of a strong negative effect of current poverty incidence on growth rates, along-
side the neoclassical conditional convergence property (Ravallion, 2012). The citizenship
premium of living in a country that is richer today will then entail a higher expected long-run
(steady-state) level of real income. This can be interpreted as a positive real-income effect of
current national mean income at given current own-income.

     See, for example, Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995).

         But even without such dynamic effects, or deficiencies in current income measures from
surveys, the prevailing implementation of the cosmopolitan approach excludes direct gains from
better provision of non-market goods and services (except those that generate direct income
transfers, which are already reflected in standard income or consumption aggregates). Almost all
public services are provided at the national (or more local) level, not globally. Nation states are
clearly important institutions for providing local public goods, generating positive externalities
for those living in well-endowed countries. Across countries and over time, public spending
tends to rise with mean income—a pattern known as Wagner’s Law (Musgrave, 1969; Peacock
and Scott, 2000; Akitoby et al., 2006; Afonso and Alves, 2017). 17 While Wagner’s Law need not
apply to all types of public spending, it is a plausible assumption that richer countries have better
public goods and that these deliver welfare gains. (This can be thought of as another source of
differences in long-run mean income in a dynamic model.) Administrative capabilities also
improve, allowing better regulatory controls to allow, for example, cleaner environments in
richer countries. There is no guarantee that higher average income yields such benefits; that
depends crucially on domestic policy choices. However, mean income is clearly relevant, and in
a positive way.
         The opportunities for leisure also appear to be greater in richer countries, again
generating direct welfare gains not reflected in observed incomes. Higher productivity creates
such opportunities. Richer countries are clearly also better endowed with public goods that are
complementary to leisure. Consistent with this further source of intrinsic value to living in richer
countries, Bick et al. (2017) find that average hours of work per adult tend to be lower in
countries with higher average incomes.
         The fourth reason is that having better off co-residents can facilitate better insurance
through both formal and informal risk-sharing arrangements. There is evidence consistent with
the view that publically-provided social protection tends to be better in countries with a higher
mean income (Ravallion, 2016, Chapter 10). This is also a common finding of theoretical models
of informal (non-governmental) risk-sharing (Coate and Ravallion, 1993; Ligon et al., 2002;
Ravallion, 2008) and the prediction has found empirical support in lab experiments (Charness
17
  Wagner’s Law is sometimes defined as a rising share of national income devoted to government spending as
income rises. Afonso and Alves (2017) provide a review of the empirical literature. Wagner’s Law is generally
thought to be a feature of industrialized countries, but the same pattern is found in data for developing countries, as
shown by Akitoby et al. (2006).
                                                           8
and Genicot, 2009). Positive externalities can arise via one’s current income or be an
independent effect, such as through greater personal security in the presence of uninsured risks.
Since it is repeated interaction that facilitates both social comparison and mutual support or
collective action, it is not surprising that these conceptually distinct theoretical perspectives point
to similar social groups—neighbors, friends, co-workers—as the generators of the external
effects. While the most relevant co-insurance group for any individual is unlikely to be the whole
population of the country of residence, it is reasonable to assume that living in a country with a
higher mean income will generally entail greater opportunities for private support when current
income is low.
         Note that all four reasons can be present at once. For example, a negative effect
stemming from relative deprivation can coexist with a positive effect stemming from better
public goods in a richer country. For the present purpose, the salient issue for measuring global
inequality is whether the net effect is positive or negative.
         Evidence from data on self-assessed welfare: Much of the evidence that has been
presented in the literature in support of the relative deprivation hypothesis has come from
country-level studies using self-reported welfare (typically measured from a survey question on
“happiness” or “satisfaction-with-life”) as the dependent variable in a regression with both own
income and income for a comparator group as regressors (often along with other controls).
         The conclusions drawn from such regressions can be challenged on a number of grounds.
The results can depend on the assumed distribution of the error term. 18 For skewed distributions
the results can be sensitive to changing those assumptions, as shown by Bond and Lang (2017). 19
Another concern in interpreting the evidence from these studies is latent heterogeneity in how
respondents interpret the scales used in survey questions; Ravallion et al. (2016) examine this
issue for three developing countries using vignettes and find considerable heterogeneity in
scales, though regression parameters appear to be reasonably robust.
         Putting these concerns to one side, some of the regressions reported in this literature
indicate that self-reported happiness or satisfaction with life rises with own-income relative to a

18
   Given that the data are ordinal, a nonlinear regression estimator is typically used, such as ordered probit assuming
that the error term for the latent continuous variable is normal.
19
   This is probably only a serious concern for happiness data that have a highly skewed distribution such as the
three-point happiness scale from the General Social Survey. More commonly used scales such as the standard
satisfaction with life question used by psychologists appear to be near normally distributed.
                                                           9
comparison group, often defined by co-residents, as in (for example) Luttmer (2005) and Knight
et al. (2009). 20 Using data for the US, Luttmer (2005) cannot reject the null hypothesis that
subjective wellbeing is homogenous (of degree zero) in own income and neighborhood income,
implying that subjective wellbeing depends on relative income not own-income. Layard et al.
(2010) come to a similar conclusion using data for the US, Germany and other countries in
Western Europe and Clark et al. (2017) report strong negative effects of comparator income
levels (at given own income) on subjective wellbeing in Britain, Germany and Australia. We can
call this the strongly relative view, as distinct from the weakly relative view, which assumes that
own income still has a positive weight at given relative income (Ravallion and Chen, 2011).
         Not all the evidence has found support for the hypothesis of relative deprivation. In
testing for such effects in self-reported happiness data from Russia and South Africa
(respectively) Senik (2004) and Kingdon and Knight (2007) found evidence of positive external
effects of neighbors’ income, controlling for own income; the latter paper finds evidence of a
negative effect for more distant co-residents of the same country. In a study for Malawi,
Ravallion and Lokshin (2010) also found evidence of both positive and negative effects
depending on income level, with the positive effect dominant among the poor. They suggest that
the informal coinsurance institutions found in rural Malawi can explain this empirical finding.
         When considering global inequality, the differences between countries come into play—
differences that obviously cannot be identified in the studies reviewed above using data for a
single country. There are some studies using cross-national data, such as Di Tella and
MacCulloch (2010), Diener et al. ( 2010) and Diener and Tay (2015). These typically find a
positive correlation between mean subjective welfare assessments and national income per
capita. 21 However, these studies cannot tell us whether the effect of higher national income is
internal (via own income) or external (at given own income).
         There are three papers in the literature that allow one to separate these two effects, and all
three point to the existence of (positive) net gains from higher national income at given own
income. The first two are by Helliwell (2008) and Helliwell et al. (2010), which are similar
enough to be grouped together. These papers estimate regressions for individual (self-reported)

20
  Also see the survey by Clark et al. (2008) and the discussion in Ravallion (2014a).
21
  The relationship is also found to be nonlinear, specifically concave, with a marked flattening out at high mean
income levels; see, for example, Di Tella and MacCulloch (2010).
                                                         10
subjective wellbeing responses in both the World Values Surveys and the Gallup World Poll,
pooling data across countries. The regressors include both own-household income and GDP per
capita of the country of residence. In both cases, there is a positive and statistically significant
“own-income” effect. The data from the World Values Surveys also indicate a positive and
significant effect of national income, at given own income. This is not indicated by the results
using the Gallup data set for the sample as a whole, but is found for the OECD sub-sample. Note,
however, that the regressions include other national characteristics that are clearly correlated
with GDP per capita, such as an index of corruption (with a significant negative effect on
subjective welfare) and, in Helliwell et al. (2010), country life expectancy (with a significant
positive effect). Thus the total effect of higher national income on subjective wellbeing is
undoubtedly higher. Helliwell et al. (2010, p.308) conclude that their global regressions
“…suggest that any relative income effects at the national level are being substantially offset by
the effects of other excluded variables that support life satisfaction in the richer countries.”
       The third paper is Diener et al. (2013), also using the micro data from the Gallup World
Poll. For the bulk of their analysis the authors averaged the household income variable (and other
variables) to national level. However, at one point they briefly compare the effects on reported
subjective wellbeing of income differences within nations to those between them. The authors
report that there is at best a small effect of relative income within countries but a strong positive
effect of the between-nation differences in average income. Diener et al. (2013, p.273) conclude
that “…a richer person in a rich nation would be better off than a rich person in a poor country.”
The authors conjecture that this may be because of better infrastructure in rich countries though
there are other possible explanations as discussed above.
       In summary: The literature does not leave one very confident about the size or even sign
of the personal real-income effect of higher national income at given own income. One finds
arguments and empirical support for both negative and positive effects. However, it is notable
that the only papers in the literature that tested for an effect of national income on subjective
wellbeing using global micro data suggest that the effect is positive. Yet, the only paper on
global inequality measurement that allowed for an independent effect of national income
assumed that a negative effect, through relative deprivation (Milanovic and Roemer, 2016). So



                                                  11
the evidence from global subjective welfare studies sits uncomfortably with how global
inequality has been measured in the past.
        In the light of these observations it is important to know how much prevailing measures
of global inequality are affected by allowing national income to matter intrinsically, either
positively or negatively. The rest of the paper takes up that issue.

3.      Measuring global inequality when national income matters

        The approach taken here provides a simple way of encompassing the various views on
the intrinsic value of national income discussed in the previous section. Household income per
capita is scaled up or down by a country-specific multiplicative factor based on the mean. The
approach allows for both a non-negative relative-income effect on household welfare and a non-
negative intrinsic effect at given relative income.
        Three further points should be noted at the outset. First, the motivation is explicitly
welfarist. In response, one might argue that we can be concerned about global inequality based
on observed own-incomes whether or not the underlying income or consumption measures from
surveys are expected to adequately reflect real income. Against this, the interpretations typically
given to inequality measures presuppose the relevance of income to some concept of economic
welfare, though possibly the relevant income concept differs from what is available from
standard surveys, such as with regard to the time period (as discussed in the previous section). In
the following analysis, the received approach is allowed, but only as a special case.
        Second, the focus here is on relative inequality, as is almost invariably measured in the
literature on global inequality. Relative measures satisfy the usual scale independence axiom,
whereby multiplying all incomes by a constant does not change the measure of inequality. Not
everyone agrees with this axiom; indeed, surveys of university students suggest that a sizeable
minority do not, preferring instead a translation invariance property (whereby adding a constant
does not change the measure), which yields absolute inequality measures. 22
        Third, the summary statistic of the distribution of income deemed relevant to individual
welfare is taken to be the mean. This accords well with the various motivations from the


22
  The first surveys of students to show this were reported in Amiel and Cowell (1999) and it has been confirmed by
other surveys since; for further discussion see Ravallion (2014b, 2017a).

literature (Section 2); for example, the mean is likely to be the relevant parameter in determining
the resources available for public services not accounted for in own-income. However, relative
deprivation arguments have often used the median. In principle, the present approach can be
readily modified, replacing the mean with the median, though some properties of the measure do
not then go through, as will be noted.
        The proposed measure: Let 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 > 0 denote the income of household i in country j at

time t. We can treat 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as a continuous random variable, and also presume that its values have

been normalized for differences in prevailing prices. Let 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 be the corresponding mean in
country j where 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 is the global mean with a global population size of 𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 . Global inequality is
                                                          ∗
then measured here for the distribution of real income 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 defined by:
                      ∗
                 ln𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≡ ln𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼ln(𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 )                                                 (1)
The parameter 𝛼𝛼 reflects the intrinsic value attached to national income, i.e., its weight relative to
own-income. (Any instrumental value of a higher mean is taken to already be reflected in 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .)
        The standard approach to measuring global inequality has 𝛼𝛼 = 0. A range of values for 𝛼𝛼
will be considered, embracing different views on how national income might matter horizontally,
between people with the same observed income. A value of 𝛼𝛼 < −1 is ruled out by the
                   ∗
assumption that 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is non-decreasing in the mean at given relative income. When 𝛼𝛼 = −1 we
have the strongly relative view of Easterlin (1974) and others whereby only relative income
            ∗
matters (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 /𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ). In considering the upper bound, it will be recalled that the results of
past global studies of subjective wellbeing suggest that positive values are more plausible than
negative ones. The study by Helliwell et al. (2010) reports regression coefficients of subjective
wellbeing on both own-income and national income (GDP per capita), both in logs; the ratio of
the coefficient on log national income to that on log own-income gives 𝛼𝛼. The regressions
suggest a positive value with upper bound estimate around 𝛼𝛼 = 0.5, though a narrower interval
of 0.3-0.5 is suggested for most regression specifications. However, recall that there are also
indirect effects of national income through the other control variables used in this study, so the
true value is likely to be somewhat higher. For example, the indirect effect via life expectancy
alone would probably add about 0.05 to the effect of log national income on satisfaction with


                                                           13
life, which would raise the upper bound estimate for 𝛼𝛼 to 0.6. 23 A higher value might be
defended if one allows for other covariates that are correlated with national income (such as
exposure to corruption, as an aspect of institutions, which was also found to be a significant
predictor of subjective wellbeing by Helliwell et al.). The following analysis will consider values
of 𝛼𝛼 over the interval [-1, 1].
         While the formulation in (1) generalizes the standard approach to measuring global
inequality, it could be generalized further. To give an example, one might prefer to interpret 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
as an unequally-weighted mean, with weights given by how “close” other people are to person i
(so that one would need to rewrite the variable as 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 to allow for idiosyncratic weights). This
would allow the idea of (sub-national) “moral comparators.” However, in measuring global
inequality, it does not seem an unreasonable simplification to focus on the national (equally-
weighted) mean. To give another example, for international migrants one might distinguish the
mean income of the country of birth from that of current residence, although the two are the
same for 97% of the world’s population (United Nations, 2015), so this is a moot point.
         A further extension would relax the restriction that 𝛼𝛼 is a constant. This restriction can be
questioned. For example, it might be hypothesized that the negative relative-deprivation effect
becomes more important at higher income levels, suggesting a switch in the sign of 𝛼𝛼 (as found
for Malawi in Ravallion and Lokshin, 2010). However, given that the present purpose is solely to
explore the robustness of prevailing measures of global inequality, it does not seem unreasonable
to focus here on the simple one-parameter specification in (1).
         In choosing a measure of global inequality, the mean-log deviation (MLD)—given by the
log of mean income less the mean of log income—is known to have a number of desirable
features. The fact that (unlike the Gini index) MLD is decomposable by population sub-groups is
clearly an attractive feature for the present purpose. There are other such decomposable measures
including other measures in the class proposed by Theil (1967). However, MLD is the only
measure that satisfies both the Pigou-Dalton transfer axiom and the Monotonicity in Distance
axiom of Cowell and Flachaire (2017); the former axiom requires that mean-preserving income
transfers in which the recipient is poorer (richer) than the donor will decrease (increase)

23
   I have used an elasticity of life expectancy to mean income of 0.015 (Pritchett and Summers, 1996), mean life
expectancy of 70 years and a regression coefficient of satisfaction with life on log GDP per capita of 0.05 (Helliwell
et al., 2010). This calculation is only intended to be broadly indicative.

measured inequality while the Monotonicity in Distance axiom says that, when comparing two
distributions that differ in one person’s income, the greater the distance from equality, the higher
the inequality. Note that MLD is non-negative but not bounded above by unity.
                                                 ∗
         The MLD based on the distribution of 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 over all i, j is given by: 24
                                                  ∗
                  𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑖𝑖 ∑𝑗𝑗 ln(𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡∗ /𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )/𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡                                                   (2)
where the global mean of the adjusted incomes in (1) is denoted 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡∗ . The decomposability of
MLD entails that 𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 = 𝐿𝐿𝐵𝐵 (𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 + 𝐿𝐿𝑊𝑊 (𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 where
                                                       ∗
                  𝐿𝐿𝐵𝐵 (𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ln(𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡∗ /𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 )                                                    (3.1)

                  𝐿𝐿𝑊𝑊 (𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼)𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗                                                            (3.2)
                                                                         ∗
are the between and within-country components respectively, and where 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is the country-
                                                              ∗       ∗
specific mean of the adjusted incomes, 𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼)𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = ∑𝑖𝑖 ln(𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 /𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )/𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗 and 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 /𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 is the
population share of country j. The standard approach in the literature is the special case:
                  𝐿𝐿(0)𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑖𝑖 ∑𝑗𝑗 ln(𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 /𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )/𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡                                                     (4)
By contrast, when 𝛼𝛼 = −1 global inequality is average inequality across countries (noting that
𝐿𝐿𝐵𝐵 (−1)𝑡𝑡 = 0). This is “nationalistic” in that inequality between countries receives no weight.
         Properties of the measure: Equation (1) entails that all incomes within a given country
                                 𝛼𝛼
are multiplied by a constant (𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ). So under the scale-independence axiom, the within-country
component of global inequality is independent of 𝛼𝛼; all that changes is the between-country
component. This does not just involve re-weighting the between- and within-country components
of the standard measure. Rather, the between-country component changes. To see this, one can
re-write (2) in terms of the ordinary (un-adjusted) incomes, giving:
                  𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 = ln[ ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 (𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 /𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 )𝛼𝛼+1 ] + (𝛼𝛼 + 1)𝐿𝐿𝐵𝐵 (0)𝑡𝑡 + 𝐿𝐿𝑊𝑊 (0)𝑡𝑡              (5)
To better understand the relationship between 𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 and the usual measure with 𝛼𝛼 = 0 we need
to look more closely at the first term on the right hand side of (5). Consider the limiting case in
                                                                                   𝛼𝛼+1
which 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 for all j whereby 𝐿𝐿𝐵𝐵 (𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 = 𝐿𝐿𝐵𝐵 (0)𝑡𝑡 . On noting that 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗  is convex (concave)
                                                          𝛼𝛼+1
for 𝛼𝛼 > (<)0, we have (by Jensen’s inequality) that 𝐸𝐸(𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ) > (<)(𝐸𝐸𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 )𝛼𝛼+1 as 𝛼𝛼 > (<)0.



 Recall that it is assumed that 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≥ 0. This clearly holds for consumption but need not hold for incomes. For a
24

modification of MLD to allow non-positive values see Ravallion (2017b).
                                                                 15
Thus ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 (𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 /𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 )𝛼𝛼+1 > (<)1 as as 𝛼𝛼 > (<)0. As long as 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 has positive variance, the

term ln[ ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 (𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 /𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 )𝛼𝛼+1 ] is positive (negative) for positive (negative) 𝛼𝛼. We see then that
negative (positive) weights on national income imply lower (higher) global inequality (𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 <
(>) 𝐿𝐿(0)𝑡𝑡 for 𝛼𝛼 < (>) 0).
         A stronger monotonicity property also holds, namely that 𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 is a strictly increasing
function of 𝛼𝛼 and as long as 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 varies across countries. To verify this, note that, since the
within-country component is independent of 𝛼𝛼, we only need look at how the between- country
component varies with 𝛼𝛼. Differentiating w.r.t. 𝛼𝛼 we have: 25
                                                                           𝛼𝛼+1                           𝛼𝛼+1
                                 𝑚𝑚∗                          ∑𝑗𝑗(𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ln 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 )−(∑𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 )(∑𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ln 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 )
       𝐿𝐿𝐵𝐵 ′(𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 � 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗∗ − 1� ln 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 =                                           𝛼𝛼+1
                                                                                         ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
                                                                                                                                          (6)
                                    𝑡𝑡


On noting that 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is a random variable with positive variance, the expression on the right-hand
side of (6) is the difference between the expected value of the product of the two random
              𝛼𝛼+1
variables, 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗  and ln 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , and the product of the expected values of those variables. That
difference is positive since the variables have positive covariance (given 𝛼𝛼 + 1 > 0). Thus we
have verified that 𝐿𝐿𝐵𝐵′ (𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 > 0 and (hence) that 𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 is also an increasing function of 𝛼𝛼. 26
         We will now see what all this looks like empirically.

4.       New measures of global inequality

         The sources of the household survey data are the World Bank’s PovcalNet, the
Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living
Conditions (EU-SILC). 27 I have used data for 144 countries, being all those with two surveys. 28
Both surveys for a given country use the same indicator, either current household consumption
or income per person. Given a degree of predictable income variability over time, consumption is
used in preference to income when there is a choice; consumption is used for about two-thirds of
countries, while disposable income is used for the rest; the latter is more common in Latin
America and the OECD. Current-year population weights are used, as provided in PovcalNet.

                ∗        𝛼𝛼+1
25
   Note that 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗  .
26
   If one prefers to use the median rather than the mean then monotonicity is no longer assured. (This was pointed
out to me by Emmanuel Flachaire in correspondence.)
27
   The specific data set used here is described more fully in Ravallion and Chen (2017).
28
   This is not essential, but avoids concerns about non-random attrition when the set of countries changes over time.
                                                                    16
        Following standard practice, the country-specific consumer price indices are used to
convert to a common base year, in this case 2011, and survey means in local currency units are
converted to $s at 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) using the consumption PPPs from the
International Comparison Program. PPPs deal with the fact that many goods and services are not
globally traded so their prices vary, depending (in particular) on local wage rates.
        The median year for the first survey is 1993 and it is 2012 for the second. Figure 1 gives
the kernel densities of ln(𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 /𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ) around these two dates. The decline in inequality between
countries is evident; the between-country component of MLD as conventionally measured is the
(population-weighted) mean of the densities in Figure 1 which falls from 1.03 to 0.76. Figure 2
provides the corresponding densities of the national MLDs. We see the expected shift to the right
(higher inequality within countries) across most of the range of MLD. There is an exception,
however, for high-inequality countries (MLD over 0.6) for which there are fewer cases around
2012. This could be corrections to initial measurement errors, although prior research has also
suggested there is a process of inequality convergence across countries when one allows for
classical measurement errors in the estimation method (Ravallion, 2003). There is only a small
positive correlation (r=0.191; n=144) between the annualized changes in MLD between the
earliest and latest surveys and the annualized growth rates in the mean, and it is not statistically
significant. 29 Thus these estimates conform to one of the stylized facts identified by Ferreira and
Ravallion (2009) that growth in the mean tends to be distribution-neutral on average.
        Table 1 gives 𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 for various values of 𝛼𝛼 while Figure 3 plots 𝐿𝐿𝐵𝐵 (𝛼𝛼)𝑡𝑡 against 𝛼𝛼.
(Recall that the within-country component does not vary with 𝛼𝛼.) For the standard case of 𝛼𝛼 = 0
we see a decrease in the MLD based on observed consumptions or incomes, driven by the fall in
the between-country component. As expected given monotonicity (section 3), negative values of
𝛼𝛼 yield a lower between-country component, bringing down the overall inequality index (Table
1). The opposite holds for positive values (implying that people in richer countries are better off
at given own-consumption). This is all in line with the theoretical expectation.
        We see that the quantitative magnitudes are sizeable. By construction, going from 𝛼𝛼 = 0
to 𝛼𝛼 = −1 brings the global measure down to average inequality within countries—a large (63-


29
  The t-test on the regression coefficient of the annualized change in log MLD on the annualized change in log
mean gives t=1.27 (prob.=0.20) using a heteroscedasticity-consistent standard error.

76%) reduction (Table 1). If proportionate increases in national consumption matter about as
much as those for own consumption (an 𝛼𝛼 = 1 type person) then the global inequality measure is
more than doubled, with the between-country component rising to about 90% of the total.
         Three observations help put the numbers in perspective. First, note that the differences in
MLD over the range of 𝛼𝛼 greatly exceed the range in levels of inequality found across countries
using the standard approach. This is evident on comparing Table 1 with Figure 2; the MLDs
across countries for the earliest (latest) years range from 0.07 (0.10) to 1.13 (0.96). Going from
𝛼𝛼 = −1 to 𝛼𝛼 = 1 increases the inequality measure 14 of the standard deviations of the cross-
national distribution of MLD for the earliest surveys, and 12 standard deviations for the latest.
Across the range of 𝛼𝛼, the implied differences in MLD swamp the cross-country differences in
MLD for 𝛼𝛼 = 0. If we focus on 𝛼𝛼 = 0.6 then the global MLD for the more recent surveys is up
to twice the global value at 𝛼𝛼 = 0, and over 50% higher than the highest value for any country.
         Second, even with 𝛼𝛼 in [-0.2, 0.2] (say), the global inequality index (for 1990) changes
by an amount that is greater than the absolute change observed over this 20 year period.
Differences over the value of 𝛼𝛼 also swamp the differences over time at given 𝛼𝛼.
         The third observation relates to the concern in the recent literature on the implications for
measured inequality of a systematic under-estimation of the incomes of the rich in household
surveys. 30 The differences in measures of inequality according to 𝛼𝛼 are comparable to, or even
larger than, those implied by even a seemingly large underestimation of the incomes of the rich.
Suppose, for example that incomes of all the richest 1% in the world are actually double the
numbers in Lakner and Milanovic (2016) for 2008. 31 This would add about 0.1 to MLD. 32
         As expected, a higher weight on national income implies higher global inequality. As is
evident from Figure 3, I also find that the claim that the between-country component of global
inequality has fallen over this period is robust to the choice of 𝛼𝛼. Given that the within-country
component of 𝐿𝐿(0)𝑡𝑡 has risen over time, it turns out that the qualitative conclusion that overall
global inequality fell over the period is only robust for 𝛼𝛼 > −0.7 (Table 1).

30
   For example, Korinek et al. (2006) estimate that correcting for selective compliance in household surveys would
add around 0.05 to the Gini index for the U.S. Similarly, on using income tax records to supplement survey data one
finds higher inequality measures; see, for example, Piketty and Saez (2003).
31
   Lakner and Milanovic estimate that in 2008 the world’s richest 1% had an average income of $64,213 (converted
at PPP for 2005) while the overall mean was $4,097.
32
   Let all incomes of the richest 𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟 proportion of the population, with income share 𝑠𝑠 𝑟𝑟 , be underestimated by a factor
k. Then the change in MLD is (𝑠𝑠 𝑟𝑟 − 𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟 ) ln 𝑘𝑘.

5.     Conclusions

       It is surely remarkable that measures of global inequality attribute no economic
advantage to living in a richer country beyond what is already reflected in the household incomes
measured from surveys. The assumption that the advantages, or possibly disadvantages, of living
in a richer country are fully reflected in the survey-based incomes is hard to defend on either
theoretical or empirical grounds. The paper finds that some prominent stylized facts about global
inequality are not robust to attaching an intrinsic value to higher national income.
       Competing theories have been considered here. The idea of relative deprivation
postulates negative externalities from economic gains to co-residents. So too does a neoclassical
growth model when it is recognized that “own-income” is almost certainly measured in surveys
over a shorter period of time than people evaluate their expected future welfare. The nationalistic
view that “global inequality” is just the average national inequality across countries emerges as
the limiting case in which it is relative income within the country of residence that matters.
       By contrast, one can point to plausible theoretical arguments for positive external effects
of living in a richer country at given own income. Examples of the transmission mechanisms
include the likely positive correlation between national income and factors conducive to a higher
long-run personal income, greater opportunities for leisure, better public services, better
regulations and better social protection. None of these gains are likely to be properly reflected in
current incomes as measured in surveys. And there is evidence to support all these mechanisms.
The implication is clear: the (large) differences in average incomes found between rich and poor
countries create an extra (horizontal) inequality between their residents, not reflected in their
observed current incomes. This is a downward bias in prevailing measures of global inequality.
       The paper’s results suggest that this bias is highly salient to the quantitative measures
obtained of global inequality from standard data sources. A person who defines her economic
welfare in terms of relative income alone will see far less inequality in the world than a person
who puts a sizeable value on the external benefits of living in a richer country. Using what can
be considered the ideal inequality measure for this purpose, the paper finds that relative
deprivation theory implies that global interpersonal inequality is far lower than prevailing
measures suggest since it is then entirely within countries. However, this changes dramatically
when one allows a positive intrinsic value of national income, such as when living in a richer
                                                 19
country brings benefits in terms of access to non-market goods and services, and better
opportunities for private support in times of need.
       It is hard to be confident as yet on the magnitude of the intrinsic value of higher national
income, and the topic merits further research. From what we know now based on past global
studies of subjective well-being, it is possible that the national income effect is 50% or more of
the own-income effect. Then global inequality is far higher than prevailing measures suggest,
and far higher than found in even the most unequal country. Indeed, the differences in levels of
inequality due to even rather modest differences in how one values national mean income tend to
swamp the differences seen over time in standard measures, or the differences we see between
countries, and are also large relative to the impact on global inequality of even a substantial
underestimation of the incomes of the rich.
       The stylized fact that global inequality has been falling since around 1990 is not robust,
though one only finds rising inequality with a seemingly high negative weight on national
income, such as due to relative deprivation. The finding of falling between-country inequality is
robust whatever intrinsic value (positive or negative) one attaches to national income in
assessing individual economic welfare.
