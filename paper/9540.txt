                                           ABSTRACT

This paper examines how compensation packages change when health insurance premiums rise. We
use data on employee choices within a single large firm with a flexible benefits plan; an increasingly
common arrangement among medium and large firms. In these companies, employees explicitly

choose how to allocate compensation between cash and various benefits such as retirement, medical
insurance, life insurance, and dental benefits. We find that a $1 increase in the price of health

insurance leads to 52-cent increase in expenditures on health insurance. Approximately 2/3 of this
increase is financed through reduced wages and 1/3 through other benefits.

INTRODUCTION

       Many companies have redesigned their benefits plans to require employees to pay the full

marginal cost (pre-tax) of more expensive plans. Such ‘fixed subsidy’ schemes have been

discussed for over two decades (Enthoven, 1978), but have gotten more attention recently as

health insurance premiums escalate. These schemes are more efficient if workers have different

tastes for health insurance (Levy, 1997), and research has shown that employee insurance

choices are quite responsive to these arrangements (Buchmueller and Feldstein, 1996; Cutler and

Reber, 1998).

       What is less clear is how the total compensation package—e.g. retirement benefits—

changes when health insurance premiums rise. If the price elasticity of demand for health

insurance is less than one — and the evidence suggests it is—then workers will increase

expenditures on health insurance as their share of premiums rise. But if labor supply and

demand remains fixed, then total compensation should not change, just its composition into

health insurance, wages, and other benefits (Smith and Ehrenberg, 1983; Summers, 1989). This

is easiest to see in cafeteria-style plans, where employers make a defined contribution to all

employer-related benefits, and higher health insurance premiums must induce changes in

composition of total compensation–either in lower after-tax wages or in decreased contributions
to other benefits.

       This paper examines how workers change their compensation package in response to

changing health insurance premiums. To the extent that workers do not completely substitute

away from rising premiums, we are particularly interested in whether employees finance health

insurance by reducing current income (essentially wages) or other benefits (life insurance,

disability insurance, and other benefits).

       We know of no other work in this area, although there is a substantial literature on the

tradeoff between wages and fringe benefits. Much of this work tries to estimate the substitution

between benefits and wages using data aggregated at the firm or industry level (Woodbury,
1983). These estimates are somewhat limited because the fringes are often allocated as part of a

collective bargaining agreement or a less explicit process based on worker preferences that calls

into question the underlying assumptions of flexible wages and costless mobility (Freeman,

1981; Goldstein and Pauly, 1976). Others have tried to estimate the relationship with employee-

level data from multiple firms. The implausible result that wages and benefits do not tradeoff—

holding productivity fixed—are best explained as bias due to unobserved heterogeneity (Smith &

Ehrenberg, 1983).

        We try to avoid these problems by focusing on employee choices within a single large

firm with a flexible benefits plan. Under such an arrangement, employees explicitly choose how

to allocate compensation between cash and various benefits, such as retirement, medical

insurance, life insurance, and dental benefits. Such plans cover 52% of workers in medium and

large firms, and the proportion is growing, so they are interesting to study in their own right

(BLS, 1999). The effect of health insurance premiums on compensation is identified by the

substantial variation in premiums across years.

        The results suggest that about two-thirds of the premium increase is financed out of cash

wages and the remaining one-thirds is financed by a reduction in benefits. However, these

findings come from only a single firm—and hence limit our ability to draw inferences to the

general population—but they do suggest that the relationship between health insurance benefits,
and wages warrants further investigation.



DATA

        The original data set consists of three years (1989-1991) of earnings and benefit

information for employees under age 65 at a single U.S. company.1 While these data are 10

years old, this period is relevant to the current debate about health care costs because health

insurance premiums are rising rapidly today, as they were in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. It

        1These  data were obtained from a benefits consulting firm. The terms of the data release
precluded us from providing detail about the company, including its industry.
also is comparable to periods studied in other research looking at health plan switching that

found large elasticities. Furthermore, there is little reason to expect that human behavior with

regard to insurance choice has changed much over the last decade. Our study focuses on a

sample of single employees who signed up for a health insurance plan2. Families are excluded

because we have no information on the health insurance opportunity sets of spouses, and how

those might change over time. These employees are geographically dispersed across 47 states.

The data also include a limited set of demographic controls such as age and sex. Since we

analyze changes in employees’ expenditures relative to the previous years, we restrict our

attention to employees with atleast two years of data – resulting in an analysis sample of 7,896

employee-year observations.

        Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the sample. Total compensation averaged

$27,412. Approximately 2.3% of compensation ($622) went towards the purchase of health

insurance, 1.1% ($286) went towards purchase of other benefits within the cafeteria plan and the

remaining compensation was taken as wages. Benefits appear low as a fraction of total

compensation because our benefits and compensation measures do not include legally mandated

benefits such as Social Security and workers’ compensation, nor do they include the employer

contributions towards health insurance and retirement.

                                     [INSERT TABLE 1 HERE]
        Employees in this firm were given a menu of benefit options. To finance these benefits

each employee was also given a completely fungible credit allocation that depends on salary and

job tenure. However, the credit allocation does not determine expenses on benefits as employees

can make additional pre-tax deductions from their salaries or wages to finance benefits. In

addition, employees can also choose to cash –out most of their credit allocation.

                                     [INSERT TABLE 2 HERE]


        2 We excluded a small number of single employees (222) who did enroll in the employers health
plan despite a free catastrophic health plan option. Clearly these employees had other outside insurance
options .
        Table 2 shows the mean, standard deviation and probability of contributing, for each

benefit component of total compensation in 1990. Employees spend their total compensation on

wages, health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health care savings

account,3 retirement plan, accident insurance, survivor insurance, and life insurance to cover

dependents. Some of these components are rarely used, and the contributions are small. Rather

than estimate models for all of them, we aggregate these into three broad categories – wage,

health insurance and other benefits. Although the benefits in the “other benefits” category are

diverse they are conceptually related in that most of them are insurance products that involve

forgoing current consumption (in terms of premiums) for future and uncertain payouts.

        Table 3 shows the enrollment in each year for the different health insurance plans offered

by the firm. The company offers two types of health insurance plans: fee-for-service (FFS) plans

and HMOs. Table 3 shows that within the FFS class, there are three types of plans: a catastrophic

plan with a deductible of 5% of salary, a low option plan with deductibles of $300 for

individuals, and a high option with deductibles of $150. The other plans consist of 43 HMOs

nationwide, with each employee’s available options depending on state of residence and year.

                                      [INSERT TABLE 3 HERE]

        As with most employers, this company contributes towards the purchase of these plans.

Unlike many employers, however, the amount does not vary by plan choice, but depends only on
the number of beneficiaries. By not contributing more generously to more expensive plans, the

employer makes employees face the full marginal cost of more generous coverage (on a pre-tax

basis). The employer’s ‘fixed subsidy’ is equal to the premium for the catastrophic plan.

                                      [INSERT TABLE 4 HERE]

        Table 4 shows the variation in the copremiums—the amount of total premium paid by the

employee—across plans. HMO copremiums rose faster in absolute and percentage terms from

reimburse qualifying health care expenses. Any unused funds left in the account at the end of the year are

1989 to 1990. From 1990 to 1991, the premiums in the low-deductible FFS plan rose faster than

the HMO premiums, but the HMO premiums still increased substantially. The drop in

enrollment in both types of plans (shown in Table 3) during that period may reflect these

premium increases. Table 4 also shows that HMO premiums vary considerably over this period,

sometimes falling as much as 26% or increasing by 34% year-to-year. We exploit this

considerable variation to identify our models.
METHODS

       We model how the allocation of total compensation varies with an increase in costs of

health insurance for employees. That is, we want to know the responsiveness of each component

of total compensation (wages, health insurance expenditures, other benefits) to changes in health

insurance prices for employees. The key challenge is to measure changes in the price of health

insurance for employees.

       Ideally, a measure of increase in the price of health insurance would show the difference

in the costs of obtaining a reference level of utility due to a new vector of health insurance

copremiums. However, the problem with constructing this “true price index” is that utility is not

measurable. To circumvent this problem alternative estimates of price changes calculate the

difference in costs of obtaining a fixed basket of goods at a new vector of prices. Two well-

known indices are the Laspeyres price index that measures the difference in costs of purchasing

the base year basket of goods and the Paasche price index that measures the difference in costs of

purchasing the current year basket of goods. Although these fixed weight indices are easy to

calculate they induce some bias in the measurement of cost changes. Most importantly, these

indices ignore the possibility of substitution among goods due to changes in relative prices. For

example, employees might switch to cheaper health plans in response to changes in the relative

price of health plans (This is true in our data as shown in Tables 3 and 4). Thus using base year

enrollment in different health plans as weights for the price index will overstate the true increase

in the cost of health insurance. Fisher (1922) proposed an index that is the geometric mean of the

Laspeyres and Paasche price index. The Fisher price index has much lower substitution bias and

other desirable properties compared to other fixed weight price indices (Diewert, 1976). In

particular it closely approximates the true cost index if preferences are homothetic. Due to its

desirable properties most statistical agencies around the world including the Bureau of Economic

Analysis at the US Commerce Department have started using the Fisher index to measure
changes in prices and quantities (Boskin et al., 1998). We also use the Fisher price index to

measure changes in prices.

        Since HMO plan options and copremiums vary with the state we create separate indices
                                                             (                                    )
for each state in our data. If the vector Ps ,t = P1,s ,t , P2, s ,t ,.., Pj , s ,t ,.., PJ , s ,t represent the insurance

copremiums for each of the J health plans offered in each state s in year t and the vector
        (                                     )
Qs ,t = Q1, s ,t , Q2,s ,t ,.., Q j , s ,t ,.., QJ , s ,t represents the percentage of employees enrolled in each of

the J health plans in state s in year t, then the Fisher index for state s in year t is defined as4:
                                      P .Q          P .Q        
                (1)     Fishers ,t =  s ,t s ,89   s ,t s ,91 
                                      P .Q   P .Q 
                                      s ,89 s ,89   s ,89 s ,91 
            Finally we create a price of insurance variable for each state s in year t ( prices ,t ) by

multiplying the Fisher index for each state-year with the average copremiums in that state in

1989. This essentially rescales the unit-less Fisher index to 1989 copremium dollars in each state

and thus makes our regressions results easy to interpret.
                (2)     Prices ,t = Fishers ,t * ( Ps ,89 .Qs ,89 )

            We estimate separate employee fixed-effects models for each component of total
compensation. Essentially, an employee fixed-effects model controls for employee-specific time
invariant unobservables (such as preferences for insurance) and primarily uses variation in
employee choices and prices overtime to identify parameter estimates. Models that ignore these
fixed effects will produce biased estimates if the employee-specific unobservables are correlated
with our explanatory variables. If i and t subscript the employee and year then our empirical
model can be summarized by the following equations:
                (3)     Wagei ,t = α iwage + δ wage Pricei ,t + β wage X i ,t + ε iwage
                                                                                   ,t

                (4)     Benefiti ,t = α ibenefit + δ benefit Pricei ,t + β benefit X i ,t + ε ibenefit
                                                                                               ,t

                (5)     Health Insurancei ,t = α ihealth + δ health Pricei ,t + β health X i ,t + ε ihealth
                                                                                                     ,t

       Where, α k represents the employee fixed effects for benefit k, δ k measures the increase

in expenditures on wage or benefit k due to a one dollar increase in the price of health insurance,
and similarly the vector β k measures the changes in benefit k due to changes in other covariates X

in our model. Equations (6) is an accounting identity and states that expenditures on wages,
health insurance and other benefits add up to the total compensation of the employee. Equation
(6) along with the three behavioral equation (3), (4) and (5) also implies that ∑ δ k = 0 . That is,
                                                                                 k

given that total compensation is fixed, any change in health insurance expenditures due to rising
health insurance prices must be financed entirely by changes in benefits or wages.
       To better illustrate our results we also compute the expenditure elasticity of each benefit
category k with respect to the health insurance price at the mean benefit allocations in 1989.

RESULTS

       The parameter estimates from models (3) to (5) are presented in the Table 5. The results
show that a $1 increase in the price of health insurance leads to a 52 cents increase in health
insurance expenditures. This 52 cent increase in health insurance expenditures is financed by a
37 cents reduction in take home wages and a 15 cents reduction in other benefits. Thus
approximately 70% of the increase in health insurance expenditures due increase in prices is
financed by wage reductions. Put in elasticity terms, each 100% increase in the price of health
insurance leads to a 50% increase in health insurance expenditures, a 1% decrease in take home
wages, and a 28% decrease in other benefits.
DISCUSSION

       Our results suggest that employees facing an increase in the price of health insurance
respond by lowering their level of insurance coverage. However, employees do not completely
substitute away from health insurance, in fact increases in prices lead to increases in health
insurance expenditures. These results accord well with the previous literature, which also found
that the price elasticity of demand for health insurance was less than 1 (Buchmueller and
Feldstein, 1996; Cutler and Reber, 1998).
       Increases in expenditures on health insurance are accommodated by reducing both the
take-home income and other benefits such as life insurance, disability insurance, dental insurance
and retirement benefits. Thus, our results suggest that rising health insurance prices not only
reduce resources for current consumption but also lower insurance purchases against a variety of
risks. If health insurance prices continue to rise and individuals continue to reduce their purchase
of health insurance and other insurance products that might leave them vulnerable to health,
mortality, disability and other significant risks in the long run.
        Our results also show that when employees are given the choice of absorbing premium
increases through salary reductions or limiting expenditures on health and other benefits, they
primarily choose to reduce take-home pay. This choice might reflect the advantage to employees
of retaining non-taxed compensation in the form of benefits, and instead reducing taxable
income. This suggests, that employers who trade off wage increases for increases in health
insurance premiums are reallocating compensation in a way that workers have shown they prefer
when they are provided options within flexible spending plans.
