            This paper empirically analyzes a broad range of real exchange rate appreciation episodes.

The cases are identified after compiling a large sample of monthly multilateral real exchange rates

from 1960 to 1994. The objective is twofold. First, the paper studies the dynamics of appreciations,

avoiding the sample selection of analyzing exclusively the crisis (or devaluation) cases. Second, the

paper analyzes the mechanism by which overvaluations are corrected. In particular, we are interested

in the proportion of the reversions that occur through nominal devaluations, rather than cumulative

inflation     differentials.   We calculate the probability of undoing appreciations    without nominal

depreciations for various degrees of misalignment.      The overall conclusion is that it is very unlikely

to undo large and medium appreciations without nominal devaluations.

1      Introduction

One of the leading explanations              behind almost all exchange rate crises is that the real
exchange rate was previously           overvalued.        This would explain the market speculation
against the currencies         and the subsequent             real devaluation.     Although      economists    do
not agree on the concept            of overvaluation           (sometimes     called misalignment         or just
appreciation)      or on its empirical          counterpart,        the magnitude       of two recent crises
reintroduced      the discussion.       In 1992, the exchange             rate crises in Italy, Spain, and
the United Kingdom            affected the perceived sustainability               of the European      Monetary
System and cast doubts about the success of the future European                             Union. In 1994, the
magnitude       of the Mexican exchange rate crisis and its implications                     for global financial
instability    obliged the US treasury          and the IMF to mobilize a rescue package.
    There is a vast literature          on whether        exchange rate overvaluation             was the main
cause behind each of these crises. There has a]so been some effort in identifying                           com-
mon factors to exchange rate crises and major devaluations.                        1 However, the sample of
countries chosen in these studies is not adequate                   to answer some important          questions.
For example,      the question      what is the probability           that a currency which has appreci-
ated by 25% in real terns           will face a crisis or need a large devaluation?                   cannot    be
answered      with a sample of devaluations               or crises only. 2 This sample selection              bias
does not exist in studies that test Purchasing                    Power Parity      (PPP)     but their focus is
on whether the real exchange rate will eventually                     revert to its mean and not on how
this reversion     occurs.     Surprisingly,     little attention       has been given to the likelihood
of crises or devaluations         in appreciation         episodes.     More generally        there are, to our
knowledge,      no studies that focus on characterizing                appreciations.
    The importance           of describing     appreciations        and the likelihood        of devaluation       is
easier to understand         as a practical     matter.       Several countries      have used the exchange
rate as an instrument           to stabilize    inflation       and coordinate      expectations      around    an
easy focus point.     In several cases, the credibility              of the policy maker seems to depend
largely on her ability to maintain             the exchange rate peg. There are several current

    1See Dornbusch, Goldfajn and Vald6s (1995); Eichengreen, Rose, and W yplosz (1994) and (1995);
and Edwards (1989) for some recent attempts to characterize exchange rate crises and devaluations.
All these studies find that the RER is overvalued during the period previous to devaluations.
    2Klein and Marion (1994) study the duration of peg regimes in Latin America avoiding this sample
selection problem. However, they do not address the questions we try to answer here. Interestingly,
they conclude that the level of the RER is the main determinant of the duration of pegs.

examples.      In the context of developing countries Argentina                     and Brazil are interesting
cases.      Argentina’s     economic       policy and credibility          depend    largely on its ability to
sustain     the peg. After four years of higher inflation                  at home than abroad in a fixed
exchange regime, the Argentinean                   Peso appreciated       considerably       in real terms.   Even
if one takes for granted            that in the medium             or long run the Argentinean           Peso will
revert to its PPP value, the question                 of how this reversion will occur is still relevant.
A nominal devaluation           would probably          undermine        the credibility     of the government’s
economic       policy and induce capital              outflows      d la Mexico.      Thus,      for Argentinean
policymakers       (and public) and international                 investors the question        of how likely it is
to have a smooth landing (avoiding a large devaluation),                        given how appreciated         their
currency is, becomes extremely                  important.       The same is true in the case of Brazil.
    From a theoretical          perspective         there are several reasons why it is important                  to
understand       the dynamics           of appreciations,         and especially    how they are corrected.
In fact, several models assume                   (and some derive) real costs of a nominal               exchange
rate devaluation.           For example,          in building      a model to discuss          whether    currency
crises are self-fulfilling,         Krugman        (1996) assumes that there are real costs in terms
of reputation      when the authority             decides to devalue. The literature            on exchange-rate
based stabilizations,          on the other hand,            has stressed      the importance        of imperfect
credibility     as an explanation          for the consumption            boom and real appreciation           that
usually accompany           such stabilizations.        Credibility,     in that literature,     is defined as the
likelihood of the abandonment                   of the peg. 3 Knowing whether             it is possible to correct
an overvaluation          without    a (large) nominal devaluation            is a key step in evaluating       the
plausibility     of the imperfect credibility          explanation.       Finally, the analysis of how likely
is an appreciation         episode to end through            inflation    differentials     rather than nominal
exchange rate movements              sheds light to the question            of how rigid nominal prices are
and how persistent          inflation     is.
    This paper empirically              analyzes a broad range of real exchange rate appreciation
cases. For that purpose,            we define appreciations            as PPP departures         in the short and
medium run. The cases are identified after compiling a large sample of monthly                                mul-
tilateral     real exchange rates from 1960 to 1994. The objective                         is twofold.   First, the
paper studies the dynamics               of appreciations,        avoiding the sample selection of analyz-

exchange rate-based stabilizations.

ing exclusively the crisis (or devaluation)            cases. In particular,         we analyze the number
of appreciation      cases that exist under different definitions,                 their duration,        temporal
distribution     and exchange          rate arrangement         characteristics.      The main conclusions
are as follows:      First,     the most striking      result is the large asymmetry                between     the
duration      of the appreciation        build-up    and the return-to-normality               phases.     Second,
we present evidence that fixed arrangements                     are more likely to suffer appreciations.
Third, we show that appreciation              episodes happen more often during the last part of
our sample period (1980–94).             Finally, we also show that episodes are notably shorter
when fundamentals         are considered.
    The second objective of the paper is to analyze the mechanism                           by which the over-
valuations     are corrected.       In particular,     we study what proportion               of the reversions
occurs through      nominal devaluations            rather than through         nominal price adjustments
(or cumulative      inflation     differentials).    We calculate       the probability        of successful ap-
preciations     for various degrees of appreciation.            4 Figure 1 shows a typical result.             Note
that there are no successful cases when an appreciation                      reaches 35% or more.
    The paper is organized             as follows. Section 2 sets the theoretical               framework      that
defines real exchange          rates and overvaluation           episodes.      Section 3 characterizes          ap-
preciation     episodes across time and exchange rate regimes.                     Section 4 decomposes          the
return-to-equilibrium          real depreciation     into the fraction of the adjustment                 that takes
place through      nominal       exchange     rates and inflation        differentials,      respectively.     This
section    also calculates      the probability y of successful          adjustment.         Section     5 concen-
trates    on the dynamics         of appreciation      episodes and calculates             transition     matrices.
Finally, section 6 concludes.



2        Methodology                     and Data
In order to analyze and interpret             movements         of the real exchange rate (RER) as an
appreciation      episode one needs to define an equilibrium                    concept      and the dynamics
out of steady state.          This is not an easy task.          In fact, we speculate          that one of the
main reasons that prevented              previous    attempts      to characterize        overvaluations      is the
lack of a consensus           around    a sound empirical         counterpart       to any definition        of the

   4We formally define the term successful appreciation in section 4. For now, we mean appreciations
that end without large nominal devaluations.

equilibrium   RER. The RER between two countries                    is defined as the relative cost of
a common bmket of goods measured               in terms of a common numeraire:          PI /P2, where
Pi is the price of the basket in country         Z.
    The equilibrium      concept we use is Purchasing           Power Parity - PPP, probably        the
simplest and most powerful theory of real exchange determination.5                  It is based on the
Law of One Price which states that, abstracting            from tariffs and transportation       costs,
free trade in goods should ensure identical prices of these goods across countries.               This
implies that the same basket of goods in two different countries                 must have the same
price, or P1/Pz = 1.
    This paper denotes by overvaluation               or appreciation       the episodes of PPP de-
partures   in the short or medium          run .6 The correction        of PPP   deviations   (or over-
valued RER) can be thought         to occur through        the following channel.      An overvalued
currency   generates    unsustainable      current    account    deficits through    the loss of com-

    5See Dornbusch (1987) for an historical perspective.
   6We ignore undervalued episodes. The emphasis on overvaluations in the literature and policy
discussions is probably because prices and wages are flexible upwards. Presumably, undervaluations
are less costly to reverse.

petitiveness.      The latter      also leads to possible          recession and losses of reserves.              All
of these effects will work to adjust              domestic      prices expressed           in foreign currency     to
international      levels. 7
    In the definition of RER we can theoretically                      disaggregate       the price levels in three
categories:      Price of exports        (Pz), price of imports         (Pm) and price of nontraded            goods
(P.).8    The RER is then defined as follows:


                                                                                                                  (1)


    Taking logs and rearranging              we have:


e = {~(Pm       –P:)   +8(P.     –P;)}     + {7(P.   –Pi)}     + {(~–       ~’)P2+       (P– P’)Pj+ (7–7’)P:},

or equivalently,


         e=     Departures     from Law of One Price + Relative price of nontradables+

              Terms of Trade effect.

    The idea is that when the law of one price holds, ceteris paribus,                               there will be no
pressure on relative prices (current account deficits will be optimal,                             wages and prices
in equilibrium).       This amounts         to:


                                          Pz =P~      and       Pm =P~,


    We can abstract          from the direct Terms of Trade effect if we assume that the weights
are not so different between the baskets.                    If a – a’ = O, ~ – ~’ = 0 and ~ – y’ = (),
then we have:


                         e=     {Q(P* – p;) + B(Pz–             P:)}    +   {’Y(P.   –   Pl)}j                    (2)

where we remain with only two components,                       namely departures                from the law of one

   7A fundamental issue for the interpretation of our paper is whether the                 RER is a trend-stationary
stochastic process —that is if it tends to revert towards its mean. Recent studies have shown that
this is indeed the case. See Froot and Rogoff (1995), Isard (1995) and Breuer (1994).
    ‘Here the subscript m (or x) represents the import (export) good in the home country which is,
also, the export (import ) good of the rest of the world.

price and nontradables        price differences.
    If we assume that differences in nontradable              prices do not exert reverting         pres-
sures (as in the case of haircuts),        then only differences in tradable             prices should be
considered     in the overvaluation     measure.   Therefore,   one needs to disentangle          the two
components      of the RER above.         One approach      is to assume that equilibrium          move-
ments in the term Y(P. – p:) of equation               (2) occur slowly and that time trends will
capture   these movements. 9 A second approach              is to control for the effects of funda-
mentals   by regressing       the RER on several variables          that   are related    to nontradable
prices but not to departures        from the law of one price.l”
    We follow both approaches          in the paper.    We first follow the approach of regressing
the RER on time trends,         without    taking into account fundamentals.             Besides being a
simple procedure,      this would be the optimal         approach     if the price index had a small
proportion     of nontraded     goods, and their prices change smoothly. 11 For each country
we calculate


                                           Epr = a + T’~,                                              (3)

where EP~ is the predicted         value from the regression         of the log of the RER on two
time trends     (linear and square) denoted        by T.
    Using the predicted        value as our equilibrium       real exchange       rate, the departures
from equilibrium      are calculated      as follows (normalizing          the series to 100 when the
RER is in equilibrium):


                                                                                                       (4)

where E is the original series.

    ‘An example of these movements is the Balassa-Samuelson effect. When there is a productivity
growth differential between the traded and nontraded goods sectors and this differential is not
homogeneous across countries, then the (cross country) relative prices of nontraded goods, and
therefore, the RER, will change over time.
   100ne could argue that some of the fundamentals chosen may also be related to the departures
from the law of one price. In this case, this second approach will tend to underestimate the extent
of overvaluation. Since the first approach does not control for fundamentals and may overestimate
the extent of overvaluation, one can interpret the resulting two series as defining the boundaries of
the true overvaluation episode.
   11Since the RER is trend-stationary this is a perfectly valid procedure.




                                                   7
2.1      Controlling for Fundamentals

We also follow the second approach.        Here we assume that nontraded               prices do change
with movements       in fundamentals.      Thus,       we want to clean RER movements                from
changes in the term Y(pn – p;) of equation             (2).
    Operationally,   we calculate    for each country:




where X is the set of fundamentals.
    The fundamentals      we use to isolate the RER movements               from movements        of non-
traded   good prices are the following: 12


Terms of Trade        (TOT)       TOT shocks affect the relative price of nontradables                    in
small open economies. 13 If there is a positive                permanent     shock,    the demand      for
nontradables    will increase with the increase in permanent                income.     In equilibrium,
the relative price of nontradables      will rise and we should observe a real appreciation.
    If the shock is temporary,      and therefore the effect on permanent              national   income
is small,   the demand     for nontradables       will not increase        and the relative       price of
nontradables   will not react, provided       the supply is unchanged.           This will be the case
whenever there is a fixed cost to move resources out of the tradable              sector and decrease
the supply in the short run.        Otherwise,     even temporary          TOT shocks can have an
effect on the RER. Here we assume that TOT affect the equilibrium                          RER through
supply effects only in the long and medium              run.   Then, the optimal        procedure    is to
net out the effect of TOT        and smooth      the resultant       predicted   values,    In this way
long run trends will be captured        and very short effects smoothed.
    In the case of large countries      there is an endogeneity         problem       because the TOT
are defined simultaneously     to the relative price of nontraded            goods.


Government       Spending        An expansion      in government       spending will appreciate       the
RER if it increases the overall demand           for nontradables.      This will be the case if the

  12One may consider capital inflows as an additional fundamental. However, these flows are just
the counterpart of the current account plus reserves, and therefore, are simultaneously determined
with the RER. For that reason, we chose not to include them in the regressions.
  13See Edwards (1989).



                                                   8
government      propensity     to consume      nontradables      is larger than the private sector’s.
When thepropensities           arethe     same and anincrease         inexpenditures       is financed by
debt the effect depends          on how permanent          is the shock and how forward             looking
are consumers.          As a general      rule, the effect on nontradable           prices increases     the
more temporary           the government       shocks are (when the shocks are temporary                  the
private    sector will not decrease         consumption       proportionally)      and the less forward
looking consumers         are(Ricardian     equivalence will not hold). We measure government
spending      as the ratio of government        expendituresto       GDP.


Openness         Openness      reflects how connected       the economy is to the rest ofthe          world
and stands here for trade liberalization.           It is proxied here by the ratio ofexports           plus
imports      toGDP.
    A trade liberalization        generates     an equilibrium      RER depreciation        from a labor
market general equilibrium         perspective.    The decrease in tariffs generates the necessity
of a crowding-in        to restore full emplyment,        This, in turn, requires a reduction         in the
price of nontradables.14


  Some transitory         shocks to the fundamentals          we consider have no effect on equilib-
rium RER’s.’5         In this case, because the regression          in equation      (3) will capture    the
long run relationship        between the RER and fundamentals,                  short run movements       in
the latter    may generate      false short term movements           in our “equilibrium”         estimate.
These movements,          however, will be unrelated       to movements         in the actual RER. In or-
der to minimize this effect, we smooth the predicted               RER’s with a 12-month centered
moving average.


2.2       Episode Definition and Phases

Figure     2 presents     an example      of an appreciation       episode.      We define the start      of
an appreciation         case as the time when the difference between                the actual   RER and
our estimate      of “equilibrium”        RER (the predicted       value from equations          (3) or (5))
is equal or higher than         a certain     threshold    (e. g., 1570 or 25Yo). The appreciation
ends when this difference hits a second threshold                associated     with the existence of no

  14See Dornbusch (1974).

                                                     9
appreciation.       We define this second threshold              as 5%. In order to control for data
blips, an episode has to be sustained          for more than 2 consecutive            months    to classify
as such.

    We define four notable points:          (i) Stafl, when theappreciation           hits the threshold,
(ii) End, when the appreciation         disappears      –i.e.,     the RER hits the 5% benchmark,
(iii) Peak, when theappreciation            is the highest,       and (iv) History,    when theappre-
ciation first reached 5%. An appreciation              episode is then defined as the Start-End
period.
    There are also two phases:         History-Peak,      representing       the build-up   problem      and
Peak-End,   representing       the return   to a “normal”         level.lG

  16The phases add-up to more than an episode because the latter does not include the build-
up to the appreciation threshold. In characterizing episodes, we are interested in what happens
conditionally on being appreciated, not just in general.

2.3      Data Description

The initial sample is given by monthly               data of 93 countries         during the period 1960-
1994 (39,060 observations).           Because of missing values the actual sample size of RER
is equivalent     to 86.170 of the potential         sample          (when we include fundamentals              the
actual sample size falls to 73.6% of the potential                    sample size). The initial sample is
composed of countries in the Summers and Heston database                         with more than 1 million
people in 1985, with monthly             price data from the International                Financial    Statistics
(IFS), and with origin-destination              trade data from the United               Nations’     Yearbook of
~ade    Statistics.     The list of countries     is presented         in appendix       D.
    We construct        the multilateral     RER for each country             as a trade-weighted        average
of bilateral    RER’s with those trading          partners      encompassing         4% or more of trade (in
either exports        or imports).    The weights are fixed and represent                      the trade flows of
1985, or the closest year for which data is available.                   They are presented          in appendix
E,17
    In order to minimize the effect of movements                     in nontradables      prices, we construct
our empirical      measure      of RER using WPI when possible.                    Consumer         price indices
may contain       a large proportion         of nontraded           final goods in their index that            have
little effect on competitiveness.           It is not surprising,         then, that it is easier to reject
the random       walk hypothesis       when WPI are used in PPP                 tests.        When countries     do
not have a reliable WPI series we use CPI. This is the case with some developing
countries      (see appendix       D for a complete        list).     Since these countries         tend to have
also a higher inflation        than the average, we are confident              that even these cases have
a mean-reversion        process.
    One caveat regarding           our RER construction             is that some WPI’S may have a large
component       of an imported        intermediate     good that is not produced                 at home.      This
implies that for some countries            the WPI may not be a good proxy for their price level
and competitiveness.          Although      we do not control for these cases and, therefore,                   we
may not detect         some appreciation        cases, this should not bias our results regarding
how the RER returns           to equilibrium.

   17We checked for data errors in the original data using graphic methods. The price series of El
Salvador for 1977 was geometrically interpolated from December 1976 and January 1978 because
it shows a break in 1978 (the IFS flags the series as having a break and it shows deflation of 21%
in 1 month). Missing values of price data of Ghana (Apr. ‘81–Jan. ’82), Iran (Jul. ‘86–Mar. ’89), and
Kuwait (Jan. ‘84–Dee. ’84) were also interpolated.


                                                      11
    In order to analyze the role of the nominal exchange rate and inflation differentials
in the return-to-normal           phase of the RER one needs a nominal                      exchange rate index
for each month           and country.       We construct        this index using the exchange               arrange-
ment description          of the IMF annual            report   Exchange         Arrangements         and Exchange
Restrictions.      The report         presents   for each country         a summary         of the exchange        ar-
rangement       status     as of December        of each year and a chronology                of changes during
that same year. We use this information                     to construct        a monthly     exchange      arrange-
ments database           describing     the principal      features    of the arrangements.            Appendix        C
presents     a description      of the coding and summary                statistics    describing      the arrange-
ments.      With this data on hand we construct                   a nominal         index for each month          and
country.     When the arrangement             is a peg we use the respective nominal exchange rate;
when the arrangement             is an unknown           basket we usually          use the nominal        exchange
rate with respect to SDR (in some cases we use the last peg); when the arrangement
is floating we use the currency used in the last peg that was in place. la
    The data        for the construction             of fundamentals          has annual     frequency      and the
sources are the following:              Terms of Trade are from the World Bank Tables com-
pleted with unit import               and export       prices from the IFS for 1960-64 and 1993-94,
Openness        (the ratio of exports        plus imports       to GDP) and government                 spending   (as
percentage      of GDP) are from the Summers and Heston database,                           completed       with the
World Bank’s Development                Report data for 1993-94 when possible.lg



3        Characterizing                      Appreciations
This section presents          several features         of the episodes in our sample.                In particular,
we analyze the number             of appreciation         cases that     exist under different definitions,
their duration,      temporal         distribution      and exchange          rate characteristics.       The main
conclusions      can be summarized           as follows: First, the most striking             result is the large
asymmetry        between      the duration           of the appreciation         build-up    and the return-to-
normality       phases.     Second,      we present       evidence     that     fixed arrangements         are more

   18We classify target zones with a width less than 7% as pegs, We classify crawling pegs, managed
floating, and periodic adjustable pegs aa flexible arrangements and use the underlying nominal
exchange rate for our index.
   lgIn order to use these data in monthly regressions we interpolate the yearly data using June as
the base month.

likely to suffer appreciations.          Third,   we show that        appreciation      episodes    happen
more often during the last part of our sample period (1980-94).                     Finally, we also show
that episodes are notably        shorter when fundamentals            are considered.


3.1     Number of Appreciations

The number      of appreciations       episodes that exist in our sample depends             on both the
cutoff that defines appreciations         (the threshold       that defines the start date in figure 2)
and the method       we use in defining the “equilibrium”             RER (the RER~T in equations
(3) or (5)). Table 1 presents         these results.



                            Table 1: Number of Appreciation            Episodes

                                25                     71                  56

                                35                     36                  20



   As expected,      the number        of episodes      declines with the appreciation           cutoff (for
example,     there are only 36 and 20 cases that had an appreciation                   larger than 35%).
Also, there are less cases when we take into consideration                  the effect of fundamentals
in the equilibrium    RER estimation.         The methodology          disregards    some appreciations
episodes that were previously         detected    because their actual RER movements               are now
considered    equilibrium     changes (given the movement            of fundamentals)      .20

  20We also get some new episodes because of movements in fundamentals. We smoothed the
predicted RER in order to minimize the number of “false” appreciation ewes —the ones driven by
excess movement of our equilibrium values. See section 2.1.

3.2     Duration

The average duration           of appreciations         depends     on both the threshold                that    defines
appreciations      and whether        fundamentals       are considered.            Moreover, duration           is very
different between      the History-Peak          and Peak-End             phases.     In what follows we will
focus on4 benchmark            cases: appreciation        thresholds       of15%and       25%, with and with-
out controlling     for fundamentals.         Table 2 presents the statistics              of average duration
in months,      including    incomplete      cases.

   The average duration               of appreciations        using only time trends              to estimate        the
equilibrium      is about     2 years.     Using fundamentals,             the average duration             drops by
approximately       1 year. This pattern         of shorter duration             when one takes into account
fundamentals       also holds inthe       History-Peak        and Peak-End           phases.     Interestingly,      the
average duration       of the Peak-End          phase is approximately                one half of the duration
of the History-End          period.    Of course, behind this difference is the sudden return                         to
equilibrium     produced      by nominal devaluations.
   We also present           the frequency      histograms        of duration        of our benchmark             cases.
Figures 3 and 4 present the cases of entire episodes given an appreciation                                  threshold
of 1570, with and without             considering      fundamentals.         Figures 5 and 6, on the other
hand, present the histogram             of the History-Peak         and Peak-End         phases duration           with
the same threshold.         Figures 19 to 22 in appendix             A present the cases for an appreci-
ation threshold      of 2570. The same conclusions                hold.     Duration     is highly asymmetric
between the build-up          and the come-back phases.             The higher duration               of the History-
Peak phase spreads over all categories                of duration      lwting       more than 4 months.            This
last conclusion     is independent         of the threshold         and whether         fundamentals            are con-


                                                         14
sidered.    Also, including       fundamentals       reduces the duration      of the episodes (not only
the average duration).
    A final question regarding duration              is what happens with incomplete             cases, that is,
cases that remained being an episode when the data of the respective country ended. If
these cmes had significantly           longer durations        than the complete episodes, there would
be evidence that they are of a different nature, namely equilibrium                   appreciations           (not
picked-up      by trends     and fundamentals)         that only in the long run would disappear.
Table 3 shows the average duration                (and number of episodes) of such cases. The main
conclusion      is that these durations           are almost    always smaller than the durations               of
complete       ewes.

3.3        Temporal Distribution

Several structural         changes    in the world economy            may have affected          the temporal
distribution     of appreciation      episodes.     Among other factors, changes in inflation levels,
capital    mobility,     and exchange      arrangements         may have produced     bunching         of cases
during some periods. ‘1 The presumption                is that the first two have raised the likelihood
of appreciations        during the second part of our sample, while the movement                       towards
more flexible exchange regimes may have decreased it.
    Because our panel data is unbalanced                  —some countries       have more observations
than others—           the simple time path of number             of cases is a misleading        indicator     of
the temporal       distribution      of cases. Instead,      we present the ratio of episodes to total

countries       in the sample with data grouped              every 5 years. Cases are dated using the
date of Start ,22 The results for the benchmark                cases with an appreciation     threshold       of
15% is presented          in figures 7 and 8. The cases with a threshold            of 25% are presented
in figures 23 and 24 in appendix              A.
    The graphs show that towards the second part of our sample the number of cases
clearly increases.        In fact, during the period 1980–94 there are at least twice as much
cases as during          1960–75 (controlling         for the number     of potential    episodes).       The
cases with RER’s after controlling             for fundamentals       show an even more clear upward
trend.       Interestingly,    when only trends are considered,          there is a notorious     bunching
of episodes around            1980–85.


3.4          Exchange Arrangements

The overall trend             of exchange    arrangements       is towards     more flexible systems,      al-
though       some countries       have changed their systems back to fixed regimes.               Appendix
C describes         our characterization       of exchange      arrangements      and presents    summary
statistics     for our sample period.23
    In order to evaluate whether             appreciation     episodes happen more often under spe-
cific exchange rate arrangements              we compare the proportion          of each type of arrange-
ment during         the episodes     (more specifically       during the History-Peak       and Peak-end
phases) with the proportion              of each type observed in the total population.24           Because
of the trends issues discussed above, a total average would be misleading                    for the num-
ber of appreciations           has increased       over time and fixed exchange rate arrangements
have declined.        In order to control for this problem we compare the proportion                  of each
type of arrangement            of episodes grouped every 5 years with the population             proportion
during those same 5 years.               We then calculate       a weighted     average of this indicator
using the actual number             of episodes that occurred        during those same 5 years,           The
date of the episodes is assigned according                to the Start date.      Table 4 presents     these

   22Notice that this ratio is not immune to composition effects. An example is given by developed
countries having more data, and being less likely to suffer appreciations.
   23Using a panel of annual data, Ghosh et al, (1995) study the impact of exchange arrangements on
inflation and growth. They conclude that fixed regimes have less inflation and that the arrangement
is unrelated to growth.
   241ncases in which episodes have more than one arrangement we calculate the episode’s proportion
of each arrangement according to the number of months each arrangement ww in place.

    The results       show that,      as expected,       fixed regimes are more likely to suffer ap-
preciations.     This effect is higher when larger appreciations                  are considered.      Flexible
regimes are less likely to suffer appreciations.               These regimes include crawling pegs,
adjustable      bands, adjustable         pegs to baskets, and managed floating,           In terms of dual
and multiple         exchange    rates,    the results     show that     during    appreciations      episodes,
countries      have these arrangements          at least twice as many as in normal                times.    This
could be interpreted         as implying      that dual-multiple        regimes have a higher probabil-
ity of appreciating.         However, in this case the reverse causality                also exists.        When
an episode starts         countries   are more likely to put in place dual markets                  in order to



                                                         20
improve the competitiveness          of certain sectors.25
    There are clear asymmetries          in the exchange arrangements             prevailing   during the
History-Peak      and Peak-End       phases.    In particular,    the proportion      of fixed exchange
rate arrangements       is notably    larger during the History-Peak             period,     The contrary
happens      with flexible and floating         arrangements.       This fact gives support         to the
notion that the return-to-equilibrium           is more easily accomplished        by flexible exchange
regimes,      These results    hold independently         of appreciation      thresholds    and whether
fundamentals      are included.      Dual systems         do not appear      more likely during     either
phase.



4         Nominal          Exchange Rate-Inflation                                 Decomposi-
         tion

One of the basic questions         in this paper is whether         there are appreciation        episodes
that do not end in exchange rate collapses or large devaluations,                     More specifically,
one can ask how do appreciation         episodes end: Is the inflation differential —prompted
by the loss of competitiveness—         enough to return to the equilibrium            RER? How much
of the total work is done by the nominal              exchange      rate?    In order to answer these
questions     we constructed      a monthly     nominal     exchange rate index for each country.
This index follows the movements               of the pegs that     a country     may have, including
changes in the currency        to which the peg is established.             In cases in which unknown
baskets of currencies     are the nominal        target    we use the nominal       exchange rate with
respect     the SDR. In cases of flexible and floating             regimes we use the price of the
currency     last used as a peg.
    In order to decompose         the real depreciation       that occurs during the return to the
equilibrium     we calculate the total depreciation         of the actual RER during the Peak-End
phase, and the total nominal actual depreciation                during that same period.        Successful
appreciations     can then be defined as episodes that require less than a certain threshold
in order to return to the equilibrium. 26 Letting A denote percentage                      change we have

  25This effect also means that, in these cases, the nominal exchange rate used to calculate the real
exchange rate loses its relevance.
  26There is an important issue regarding appreciation cases that happen after a “structural” break
in the equilibrium RER. Our methodology does not allow for such changes, so we count this break

the identity:
                                      AE = ANom + A (P – P“)

where Nom is the nominal             exchange rate index and P and P* the price indices.                       We
can then calculate
                                            s=l-A:;m

as our successful index.


4.1      Detrended               RER

4.1.1       Successful      Index    Distribution

A first issue to analyze is the distribution                 of our successful     indicator      S.    Knowing
this distribution        will allow us to measure how sensitive the definition                 of successful is
to the threshold         for S. In particular,       if very few cases are partially            successful,    the
threshold       one chooses is not crucial.
    Figures 9 and 10 present the histograms                  of the S indicator    for our two benchmark
cases using the first methodology             (trends     as the equilibrium        concept).      We observe
a large mass of cases that           are not successful at all —the nominal               devaluation         does
more than all the work.27 There is also some mass in totally                        successful cases —the
inflation differential      does all the work. There are few cases in which the appreciation
was partially      successful.
    Finally,     comparing       figures 9 and 10, we observe that              when larger appreciations
are considered,       there is less probability      of success (for any S), There is less mass on
or close to S = 1 in figure 10, where the threshold                  is 25Y0.


4.1.2       Searching For a Critical             Cutoff

Knowing the distribution            of S we can now search for the critical level of apprecia-
tion:   the level at which a successful episode is very unlikely to happen.                            We define
(arbitrarily)     a successful appreciation         when the nominal exchange rate does less than

as an episode (that has an end). The key is that if this is the case, then the RER during the whole
episode is not under any pressure and nominal devaluations should not occur. This biases our results
towards observing successful cases.
  ZTInflation differentials may have a negative contribution to the return. In this cases, nominal
devaluations do more than all the work.

half of the work (S > 0.5). Since the mass of partially                       successful cases is small our
conclusions         do not critically depend on the successful definition.              Figure 11 shows the
probability     of success for different appreciation               levels. Here each episode is considered
as one case, regardless of its duration.                (In section 5 we explore in more detail the link
between degree of appreciation,                 time, and the probability       of success).
    When appreciations            of 25% or more are considered                only 10% of the cases are
successful      —that     is they devalue less than             5070 of the observed       real depreciation
between       Peak and End.            This probability         clearly decreases    with the appreciation
level. The conclusion          is that for large appreciations,            say 25% or more, it is unlikely
to undo an appreciation               without    a   devaluation;     sooner or later a nominal      exchange
rate correction        is required.


4.1.3        Successful      Episodes:          Description

This subsection         describes the appreciation            episodes in which the nominal devaluation
caused less than          half of the total          real depreciation,     so they can be considered        as
relatively     successful cmes. The initial sample includes appreciations                      of 25% or more,

    The list shows that these countries               are not typical appreciation                  cases; if one con-
siders medium          and large size countries           the probability              of success is even smaller.
Notably,      almost     all have fixed exchange           arrangements.                This does not mean that
fixed arrangements          should be kept in place, for the probability                        of success of these
arrangements       is small.    The key policy recommendation                          is to avoid the appreciation
in the first place (or at least weight its benefits with the high probability                                  of future
devaluation).
    Finally,     notice that        a couple of successful            episodes     do not suffer an actual            real
appreciation      during     the build-up        period    or an actual           real depreciation          during    the
return-to-normality         phase.      mends     in the RER make these cases to be identified                          as
appreciations      under our definition.


4.2        RER         and Fundamentals

If one repeats the exercise of the last section using the predicted                           RER calculated          with
fundamentals       none of the conclusions change. Moreover, the conclusion regarding how
difficult it is to undo appreciations           without nominal devaluations                  is stronger:     there are
no experiences         of successful episodes if appreciations               of 3570 or more are considered.

4.3      Conditional Probabilities

This subsection       reports     probabilities          of successful           appreciations             conditional         on dif-
ferent characteristics.         Table 6 presents             the results.           First, during the second period
of the sample,      1980–1994, the probability                  of successful appreciations                       is substantially
lower than in the first period.            Second, there is no apparent                          pattern        relating success-
ful appreciations     with the duration              of the episodes.              Third,       as expected,              flexible and
floating regimes are less prone to return to equilibrium                                 through         price changes.

like to test the assertion       that the probability        of returning     to equilibrium      is positively
correlated     to the degree of appreciation.
    Reconstructed          transition     matrices forour      appreciation     cases. The matrices show
the probability     of reaching a specific exchange rate value conditional               on a given degree
of appreciation.      The overall sample is the exchange rate values of the appreciation
episodes,     defined using the benchmark              cutoff of 15%. Therefore,       the matrices       show
the conditional      probability        of reaching a specific exchange rate value once a country
has surpassed 15% appreciation              in the past.
    Table 5 presents        the results for the case of trend RER. There are two points to
highlight     from the table.       First, there is a high degree of inertia           in RER’s.       All the
diagonal      terms (shadowed       for contrast)      show substantially       higher probabilities.zg       In
part,     this is a consequence         of the relatively    short transition      time shown:       6 and 12
months,       In fact, the transition        table for 24 months         (shown in appendix          A) shows
lower inertia,     although     we still observe higher probabilities           along the diagonal.
    Second, once high degrees of appreciation                  are achieved (for instance,         30% in ta-
ble 5), there is a low probability             of moving to a slightly lower appreciation               degree
(in this case 0.05 to reach 20-25%),                but a high probability         of reversing     the whole
appreciation      (O,24 to reach a value lower than 570). This result shows that smooth
returns      are highly improbable         in large appreciation       cases and get more unlikely            as
the appreciation      deepens.
    Figure     15 plots the probability         of returning      to an appreciation      of less than      5%
for several levels of appreciation.           It plots the last column of the transition              matrices
described     above (for 6 and 12 months),             but also other transition     times as 1, 3, 24 and
48 months,       As expected,      the longer the period considered,           the higher the probability
of return.     With 48 months,          for example,     the probability      of return ranges from 80 to
96Y0. This confirms the latest PPP mean-reversion                     results in the literature.
    The more interesting           and relevant result is the U-shaped             curve obtained       for the
probability     figures.   It shows that       there is a threshold         where increasing      the level of
appreciation      implies a higher probability           of return.    The reason for the nonlinearity
is the existence of a trade-off between distance and pressure factors.                    Since each curve
in figure 15 is plotted       fixing the time period available to return,              it is reasonable       to

  28There is a substantial larger mass in the diagonal term of appreciations of equal or higher than
3070. However, there is also more support in this area.

expect that small appreciations             and, therefore,    with shorter distances             to cover, have
a higher probability         of return.     This is the distance factor and is reflected                    by the
downward       slope part of the curves. On the other hand, as the degree of appreciation
deepens there are pressures that make the RER return to the equilibrium                              (as defined
above) which will tend to increase the probability                    of return.      Figure     15 shows that
the pressures     to return start to dominate           when the appreciation           reaches 20–25%.
    The concern with appreciation              episodes is not so much whether they will revert but
rather how this reversion will occur. In particular,                the question       is whether the rever-
sion will occur through       a collapse in the nominal exchange rate as opposed to a smooth
reversion.    Figure 16 plots the probability           of a collapse, defined as a return with more
than 95% of the total real depreciation                caused by nominal           devaluation,      as opposed
to inflation differentials       (S <0.05      in terms of the success index).           It is clear that the
probability    of a collapse is an increasing function of the degree of appreciation.29                        The
magnitudes       are important     also. Taking 24 months             as a benchmark,           the probability
of collapse increases from 0.36 to 0.57 when the degree of appreciation                          increases from
10% to 30%. Since we are focusing on the probability                    of collapse and not the broader
probability     of return,    figure 16 in fact isolates the pressure from the distance effect
(the shorter     distance    implies that the probability           of return      from a 5% appreciation
is high but not that the corresponding                probability     of collapse is higher).         Therefore,
figure 16 in general does not show U-shaped                 curves.
    We repeat      the exercise using the episodes             obtained     from the second definition
of equilibrium     RER (controlling          for fundamentals).         The transition         matrices      shown
in table 8 and the probabilities            plotted   in figures 17 and 18 are very similar to the
ones described      above, There are minor differences between figures 17 and 18 and the
corresponding      15 and 16. First, the U-shaped             curves are more pronounced                   when we
control for fundamentals.          Also, since the overall duration             of the episodes when we
control for fundamentals          is shorter     (see description      in the previous         section),    the 24
month schedule does not have a U-shaped                   form (the probability          of reversal is close
to 1 for any degree of appreciation).              Figure 18 shows an even steeper slope for the
probability    of collapse as a function         of the degree of appreciation           (see the 24 and 48
month schedules).

  ‘gHere each month of an episode corresponds to an observation. Before, in subsection 4.1.2, each
episode was an observation.

Subsampling             We calculated      the previous        transition     matrices    and probability      of
collapse using specific subsamples           of our data.       First, we divided our sample between
1960–79 and 1980–94.              There   are no significant          differences    between   the two sub-
periods.      Second,     we divided      our sample        between     fixed and flexible regimes          (the
latter including     a few cases of floating regimes).            As expected,       most of the results are
driven by fixed exchange regime episodes.                   Flexible regime overvaluation         episodes do
not reproduce      the steep upward sloping feature for the probability                    of collapse (as in
figure 16).



6         Conclusions
After the European         and Mexican exchange rate crises during the fist half of the 90’s,
several studies have advanced the hypothesis                  that the level of the real exchange rate
is important      in explaining     future devaluations         and collapses. 30 This paper calculates
the probability      of devaluation       for various levels of real exchange              rate looking at a
sample of 93 countries        and tries to identify all the appreciation                 episodes during the
last 35 years (1960-1994).
    The results      show that      it is relatively     unlikely      to smoothly       undo appreciations
greater    than   25%.     In our sample,         only 107o of the cases had a devaluation                  and
collapse-free return,      This probability       falls as we concentrate         in even more appreciated
cases. There are no successful cases for appreciations                      larger than 3570.31
    The paper also presents          transition     matrices     for the appreciation        episodes.   They
show inertia in the real exchange rate for short periods of time: the RER tends to stay
overvalued and at relatively the same level for 3 to 6 months.                      More importantly,       they
also show that, in a given period of time, it is much more probable to undo completely
the appreciation        than to return the long-run equilibrium                 value only partially.       This
suggests that appreciations          end abruptly       and do not have a smooth return, at least
in very appreciated        cases.   The transition          matrices also focus on the probability            of
collapse   (excluding      small and medium          nominal      devaluations).         Taking a 24 month
horizon as a benchmark,           the probability      of collapse increases from 0,36 to 0.57 when

  31The benchmark here is cases chosen with an appreciation                   threshold of 25% controlling for
fundamentals.

the degree of appreciation          increases from 10% to 30%.
       As a by-product       the paper also characterizes          the appreciation        cases.     We show
that    appreciations     have a longer duration          in the build-up    than in the return           phase
and are more likely to occur in fixed exchange regimes and during the last part of our
sample period, in particular           in the early 80’s,

B       Exchange Arrangements                                   Description

We classify exchange arangements             along two dimension       using the following coding:


                   Exchange      Arrangements

                   1. Peg to American Dollar
                   2.     Peg to British Pound

                   3.     Peg to Prench Pranc

                   4.     Peg to other currency      (flagged)

                   5.     Peg to SDR

                   6.     Cooperative     arrangements      (e.g. EMS)

                   7.     Peg to basket (incl. frequent adjustments)

                   8.     Managed      floating and other flexible arrangements

                   9. Pree floating


                   Dual-Multilateral       Arrangements

                   O.     Unique exchange rate for trade transactions

                   1.     One or more rates for trade transactions

    We consider         arrangements     1 to 6 as fixed regimes,        7 and 8 as flexible,   and 9
as floating.    Table 10 presents        the distribution       of the proportion   of each of these
aggregates,    while table 11 presents       the distribution      of the 9 types of regime and the
proportion     of dual and multiple       exchange rate arrangements.
