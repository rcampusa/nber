                                           ABSTRACT

In this paper I use a panel data set to investigate the mechanics of sudden stops of capital inflows
and current account reversals. I am particularly interested in four questions: (a) What is the
relationship between sudden stops and current account reversals? (b) To what extent does financial
openness affect the probability of a country being subject to a current account reversal? In other
words, do restrictions on capital mobility reduce the probability of such occurrences? (C) Does
openness n both trade openness and financial openness n play a role in determining the effect of
current account reversals on economic performance (i.e. GDP growth)? And, (d) does the exchange
rate regime affect the intensity with which reversals affect real activity? The empirical analysis
shows that sudden stops and current account reversals have been closely related. The econometric
analysis suggests that restricting capital mobility does not reduce the probability of experiencing a
reversal. Current account reversals, in turn, have had a negative effect on real growth that goes
beyond their direct effect on investment. The regression analysis indicates that the negative effects
of current account reversals on growth will depend on the country’s degree of trade openness: More
open countries will suffer less n in terms of lower growth relative to trend n than countries with
a lower degree of trade openness. On the other hand, the degree of financial openness does not
appear to be related to the intensity with which reversals affect real economic performance. The
empirical analysis also suggests that countries with more flexible exchange rate regimes are able to
accommodate better shocks stemming from a reversal than countries with more rigid exchange rate
regimes.

                     FINANCIAL OPENNESS, SUDDEN STOPS
                      AND CURRENT ACCOUNT REVERSALS
                                             by
                                   Sebastian Edwards*
       Since the currency crises of the 1990s economists have had a renewed interest in

understanding the behavior of international capital flows. A number of authors have

argued that in a world of high capital mobility “sudden stops” of capital inflows can be

highly disruptive. According to these authors, sudden stops tend to result in major

current account reversals, and in costly adjustment processes (Rudi Dornbusch, Ilan

Goldfajn and Rodrigo Valdés 1995). There are two important policy issues regarding

sudden stops and current account reversals: First, what determines the occurrence of

these phenomena? And second, what are the effects of sudden stops, and current account

reversals, on countries’ economic performance. In this paper I use a panel data set to

investigate the mechanics of sudden stops and reversals. I am particularly interested in

four questions: (a) What is the relationship between sudden stops and current account

reversals? (b) To what extent does financial openness affect the probability of a country

being subject to a current account reversal? In other words, do restrictions on capital

mobility reduce the probability of such occurrences? (C) Does openness – both trade

openness and financial openness – play a role in determining the effect of current account

reversals on economic performance (i.e. GDP growth)? And, (d) does the exchange rate

regime affect the intensity with which reversals affect real activity?

                     I.      Sudden Stops and Current Account Reversals

       I define a current account reversal as a reduction in the current account deficit of

at least 4% of GDP in one year. A sudden stop, on the other hand, is defined as an abrupt
                                             2


and major reduction in capital inflows to a country that has been receiving large volumes

of foreign capital. In particular, a sudden stop occurs when net capital inflows have

declined by at least 5% of GDP in one year (see Edwards 2004 for details).

       Using a panel data set for 157 countries I found that during 1970-2001 there was a

5.6% incidence of sudden stops; the incidence of reversals was 11.8%. Not surprisingly,

these two phenomena have been closely related. However, the relationship is less than

perfect. Historically there have been many sudden stops that have not been related to

reversal episodes. This indicates that when facing a sudden stop, many countries have

effectively used their international reserves to avoid an abrupt current account

adjustment. At the same time, a number of countries have gone through major current

account reversals without facing a sudden stop in inflows. Most countries in this group

were not receiving large inflows to begin with, and had financed their large deficits by

drawing down international reserves (see Edwards, 2004).

       For the complete sample (2,228 observations), 46.1% of countries subject to a

sudden stop faced a current account reversal. At the same time, 22.9% of those with

reversals also experienced (in the same year) a sudden stop. The joint incidence of

reversals and sudden stops has been highest in Africa, where approximately 62% of

sudden stops happened at the same time as current account reversals, and almost 30% of

reversals coincided with sudden stops. For every one of the regions, as well as for the

complete sample, Pearson χ2 tests for the independence of distributions have very small

p-values, indicating that although there are observed differences between these two

phenomena, the two are statistically related. For the complete sample the χ2 statistic for

the null hypothesis of independence of distributions has a value of 159.8. These results
                                              3


do not change in any significant way if different definitions of reversals and sudden stops

are used, or if different configurations of lags and leads are considered.

                II.     Openness and the Costs of Current Account Reversals

       I use the data set described above to investigate two issues: (a) Does the

probability of experiencing a current account reversal depend on the country’s degree of

financial openness? And (b), do the effects of current account reversals on real economic

activity (GDP growth) depend on the country’s degree of trade and financial openness?1

       Some authors have argued that “excessive” capital mobility is highly disruptive.

According to them, restricting the degree of capital mobility will reduce the probability

that a country faces an external crisis, including a sudden stop and a current account

reversal (Joseph Stiglitz 2002). Whether this is indeed the case is, of course, an empirical

issue. The results reported in this paper, then, shed some light on this policy question, as

they provide a historical assessment of the effectiveness of capital controls.

       In a number of models the costs of foreign shocks – including sudden stops and

current account reversals -- are inversely proportional to the country’s degree of

openness. In Mundell-Fleming type of models the expenditure reducing effort, for any

given level of expenditure switching, is inversely proportional to the marginal propensity

to import. In these models adjustment costs are also inversely proportional to the degree

of financial integration. Countries with a higher degree of financial openness will require

a smaller reduction in aggregate income to accommodate external shocks than countries

with a lower degree of financial integration (Jacob Frenkel and Assaf Razin 1987).

       Recently, Guillermo Calvo, Alejandro Izquierdo and Luis Mejia (2003) developed

a model where sudden stops result in abrupt current account reversals, and in major real
                                                   4


exchange rate depreciations. Depreciations, in turn, are contractionary, with the extent of

the contraction depending inversely on the degree of trade openness of the economy.

They argue that sudden stops and current account reversals will have a greater impact in

closed economies – such as Argentina – than in more open ones, such as Chile.

       Previous empirical works on the effects of current account reversals on real

economic performance have reached different conclusions. Gian Maria Milesi-Ferreti

and Razin (2000), for example, concluded that “reversal… are not systematically

associated with a growth slowdown (p. 303).” Edwards (2002), on the other hand, used

dynamic panel regressions and concluded that major current account reversals had a

negative effect on investment, and on GDP per capita growth, even after controlling for

investment. Neither of these papers, however, analyzed the interaction between openness

or the exchange rate regime, and the costs of current account reversals.

                                   A. The Empirical Model

       I use a “treatment effects” model to estimate jointly an equation on real GDP

growth and a probit equation on the probability of a current account reversal.

(1)            g* j    = φ + x j β + ω j.



(2)            ∆ g t j = λ [ g* j – g t-1 j ] + ϕ v t j + γ δ t j + θ (δ t j Openness t j) + ξ t j .



                                     1,   if δ *t j > 0

(3)            δ tj     =

                                    0,    otherwise



(4)            δ *tj     =    w t j α + ε t j.
                                                5


Equation (1) is a long run growth equation. g* j is long run real per capita GDP growth in

country j; x j is a vector of covariates that capture the role of traditional determinants of

growth, and ω j is an error term. Equation (2) is a growth dynamics equation, where [ g* j

– g t-1 j ] is a partial adjustment term (the “growth gap”), v t j is a terms of trade shock,

and δ t j is a dummy variable (i.e. the treatment variable) that takes a value of one if

country j in period t experienced a current account reversal, and zero if the country did

not experience a reversal. Thus, γ is the parameter of interest: the effect of the treatment

on the outcome. Finally, (δ t j Openness t j) is a variable that interacts δ t j with a measure

of openness. Whether the country experiences a current account reversal is assumed to be

the result of an unobserved latent variable δ* j t, in equation (3). δ*j t, in turn, is assumed

to depend on vector w j t. Some of the variables in w j t may be included in x j t .

Exclusionary restrictions are imposed for identification purposes. β and α are parameter

vectors. ξ j t and ε j t are error terms assumed to be bivariate normal, with a zero mean and

a covariance matrix:



                                σ       ς
(5)                              ς      1



        A two-step estimation procedure is used. Equation (1) is estimated using data for

long-term averages and Feasible Least Squares. Fitted values of long term growth are

used as g* j in equation (2). Equations (2) and (4) are then estimated jointly. In the

estimation of equation (2), I included terms that interact the dummy variable δ t k with

two openness variables – one for trade and one for financial openness. Trade openness is

defined as the ratio of imports plus exports to GDP. Financial openness is measured
                                               6


using a new index based on Dennis Quinn’s (2003) index of capital mobility. This index

goes from 1 to 100, with higher values denoting a higher degree of financial integration.

Thus, countries with stricter capital controls have a lower value of this index. Since I am

interested in understanding the role of financial openness in the probability of reversals,

one of the w j t in equation (4) is the index of financial integration described above.

       In the long run growth equation (1) the dependent variable is real GDP growth per

capita. The following covariates were included: the log of initial GDP per capita; the

investment ratio; the coverage of secondary education; an index of the degree of

openness of the economy; the ratio of government consumption to GDP; and regional

dummies. In some specifications I also included an indexes for the exchange rate regime.

Results from the estimation of (1) are not reported due to space constraints.

       In the growth equation (2) v t j is the change in the terms of trade, and δ t j is the

current account reversals dummy. As stated, I also included the current account reversal

dummy interacted with the trade openness variable, and interacted with the financial

openness index. If reversals have a negative impact on (short-term) growth, the

coefficient of the reversals’ dummy will be significantly negative. If this effect is

inversely proportional to the country’s degree of openness, the coefficients of the

interaction between reversals and openness should be significantly positive.

       In specifying equation (4) I followed the empirical literature on crises, and I

included the following covariates (all lagged one period): (a) The ratio of the current

account deficit to GDP. (b) The external debt to GDP. (c) Net international reserves to

GDP. (d) The share of short term external debt. (e) The relative occurrence of sudden

stops in the country’s region. (f) Growth of domestic credit. (h) The log of initial per
                                               7


capita GDP. (g) An index of financial integration. And (i) country-specific dummies.

                                         B. Results

       In Table 1 I summarize the basic results obtained from the estimation of a number

of treatment models for GDP growth dynamics (the coefficients of the country specific

dummies are not reported). The table contains two panels. The upper panel (A) includes

the results from the growth equation; the lower panel (B) contains the estimates for the

“treatment equation,” or probit equation on the probability of experiencing a current

account reversal. As pointed out above, the treatment observations correspond to current

account reversal episodes. Table 1 also includes the estimated coefficient of the hazard

lambda, as well as the estimated elements of the variance-covariance matrix (5). The first

three equations are for emerging markets. The last equation (1.4) is for the complete

sample of emerging and industrial countries. I discuss first the results from the probit

equations on the probability of reversals. I then focus on the results from the dynamics of

growth equations.

       The probit estimates are presented in the lower panel of Table 1. The results are

similar across models, most coefficients have the expected signs, and are statistically

significant at conventional levels. These results indicate that the probability of

experiencing a reversal is higher for countries with a large (lagged) current account

deficit, a high external debt ratio, a rapid rate of growth of domestic credit, lower initial

GDP, and a high occurrence of sudden stops in their region. Countries that have a higher

level of net international reserves have a lower probability of experiencing a reversal.

The coefficients of the short-term debt have the expected sign, but tend not to be

significant. Particularly important for the subject of this paper, the coefficient of the
                                              8


financial openness index is negative in all regressions, and it is and significantly negative

in equation (1.4) for the complete sample. This provides some (weak) evidence

suggesting that countries with a higher degree of financial openness have a lower

probability of facing a current account reversal. That is, contrary to what has been

argued by critics of globalization, these results suggest that the presence of capital

account restrictions does not reduce the probability of an external crisis. These results are

robust to the sample used, as well as to the specification of the probit equation. A

possible explanation is that the public finds way to circumvent the restrictions. In

addition, it is possible that in countries with capital controls the authorities become

overconfident, and tend to implement more “risky” macroeconomic policies.

       The results from the estimation of the growth dynamics equation are reported in

Panel A. The growth gap and the terms of trade coefficients have the expected signs and

are significant. More importantly, the coefficients of the current account reversal dummy

is always significantly negative, and the coefficients of the term that interacts trade

openness and reversals is always significantly positive. Thus, the effects of a current

account reversal on growth depend significantly on the degree of trade openness of the

economy. This result can be illustrated for the case of equation (1.1):



               Growth Effects of Reversals = -6.025 + 0.032 trade openness.



The variable “trade openness” varies significantly across countries. Its mean is 65%, its

standard deviation is 35%, and its median is 67.4%. The first decile is 28.7%, and the

ninth decile is 130.7%. For a country with a degree of openness equal to the mean, the
                                              9


point estimate of the effect of a reversal on GDP growth (relative to trend) is: -3.945% (-

6.025 + 0.032 x 65 = -3.945). If the country’s degree of openness is low and equal to the

first decile, the effect of a reversal on growth is more negative and equal to -5.11%. But if

the country is very open to trade, and its degree of openness corresponds to the ninth

decile, the effect of a reversal on growth is much smaller, at –1.84%.

       In equations (1.2) and (1.3) the estimated coefficient of the variable that interacts

reversals and financial openness is negative but not significant. All in all, these results

suggest that of financial openness has no effect on the way in which reversals affect

growth. This contrasts with the results in equations (1.1) and (1.4) that indicate that trade

openness mitigates the effects of reversals on economic growth.

              C. Current Account Reversals and Exchange Rate Regimes

       An important question is whether the effects of reversals on growth (relative to

trend) depend on the exchange rate regime. To address this issue I divided the sample

according to four alternative de-facto regimes: hard peg; pegged, intermediate and

flexible (see Edwards and Eduardo Levy-Yeayati, 2003 for the classification). I then

compared the estimates of both the reversals treatment dummy, as well as the term that

interacts reversals and trade openness. The results may be summarized as follows: the

estimated coefficient of reversals (z-statistic) for pegged regimes was -6.573 (-4.43). For

flexible rates it was positive and not signiticant: 0.373 (1.09). The interactive term was

0.041 (3.43) for pegged and –0.044 (-1.01) for flexible regimes. A χ2 test indicates that

these differences in coefficients across regimes are significant. All in all, these results

support the idea that flexible exchange rates act as shock absorbers, allowing countries to

accommodate better external shocks, including current account reversals.

                                    III. Concluding Remarks

       In this paper I have shown that sudden stops and current account reversals have

been closely related. The econometric analysis suggests that restricting capital mobility

does not reduce the probability of experiencing a reversal. Current account reversals, in

turn, have had a negative effect on real growth that goes beyond their direct effect on

investment. The regression analysis indicates that the negative effects of current account

reversals on growth will depend on the country’s degree of trade openness: More open

countries will suffer less – in terms of lower growth relative to trend– than countries with

a lower degree of trade openness. On the other hand, the degree of financial openness

does not appear to be related to the intensity with which reversals affect real economic

performance. The empirical analysis also suggests that countries with more flexible

exchange rate regimes are able to accommodate better shocks stemming from a reversal

than countries with more rigid exchange rate regimes. In interpreting the findings

reported in this paper, it is important to keep in mind that measuring financial integration

is far from easy (Quinn 2003). Further work on the subject should aim at producing even

better indexes of financial integration and capital account restrictions.
