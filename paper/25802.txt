                                          ABSTRACT

We conduct a field experiment to test the demand for flexibility and for soft and hard
commitment among clients of a microfinance institution. We offer a commitment contract
inspired by the rotating structure of a ROSCA. Additional treatments test ex ante demand for soft
commitment (in the form of reminders), hard commitment (in the form of a penalty for missing
an installment), and flexibility (an option to postpone an installment). Our design is unique in the
literature for allowing us to test— using the same respondent population — how demand for
explicit commitment features differs between loan and savings contracts. We find substantial
demand for both credit and savings contracts but no demand for additional commitment features
— either in isolation or in combination — in spite of their effectiveness in improving repayment.
In particular, demand for savings is insensitive to explicit commitment features. Individuals
offered loans actively dislike commitment and flexibility, unless the latter is combined with
reminders. These findings complement a literature showing that commitment devices induce
financial discipline. They show that demand for commitment depends on whether commitment
features are implicit or explicit.

1   Commitment devices, explicit and implicit

Commitment problems — whether due to intra-personal factors such as time-inconsistent
preferences, or to inter-personal ones like the inability to resist demands from others —
are often cited as important barriers to saving and impediments to the repayment of loans
(Casaburi and Macchiavello, 2018; Dupas and Robinson, 2013b; Duflo et al., 2011). Features
of formal and informal financial products testify to the importance of commitment issues in
financial decisions. The high frequency of instalments, the rigidity of the repayment sched-
ules and an emphasis on group lending — all typical of many microfinance contracts — are
believed to provide financial discipline and commitment devices to borrowers (Field and
Pande, 2008; Field et al., 2013). Similar elements characterize rotating credit and savings
associations, one of the oldest and most prevalent informal financial product in the devel-
oping world (Gugerty, 2007). Consistent with this, commitment devices — relying either
on psychological or economic motivations — have proven effective in encouraging savings
and reducing loan defaults (Ashraf et al., 2006; Brune et al., 2016; Dupas and Robinson,
2013b; Karlan et al., 2016; Stango and Zinman, 2014).


The evidence on commitment problems in financial decisions comes from two largely dis-
tinct streams of research, which often treat saving and borrowing as two separate behav-
ioral realms, both conceptually and practically. However, when individuals struggle to
hold savings over time and wish to incur lumpy expenditures, saving and borrowing may
be substitutes (Afzal et al., 2018). While the idea that individuals may ‘borrow to save’ is
not new (Rutherford, 2000; Morduch, 2010; Collins et al., 2009; Armendáriz and Morduch,
2010; Kast and Pomeranz, 2018), its implications for behavioral innovations in the design
of financial instruments have not been explored.

                                   Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts




In this paper, we aim to fill this gap — by presenting evidence on a large field experiment
in Pakistan, conducted with clients of a prominent microfinance institution. Participants
are offered financial commitment products that differ along several dimensions. Some take
the form of a standard credit contract, with a lumpsum disbursed at the outset followed
by a sequence of regular instalments to be repaid. Others take the form of a commitment
saving contract, with a sequence of regular instalments followed by a lumpsum disbursed
at the end. Both contracts offer the same commitment device — that is, a regular instalment
schedule — but differ in the timing of the lumpsum disbursement. We then augment this
standard product with a set of behavioral contractual variations, designed to be represen-
tative of the major tools tested in the literature on savings and borrowing: we offer soft
commitment in the form of reminders to the clients or her peer; and hard commitment in
the form of a penalty for missing an instalment. We introduce higher flexibility by allowing
clients to defer one instalment.


This design allows us to test directly how demand for commitment varies depending on
whether it is implicitly embodied in a saving or credit contract, and on whether it is in-
creased by explicit behavioral variations — through hard commitment, through assistance
in keeping track, and through exogenous variation in exposure to intrahousehold pressure.
Crucially, we can test whether demand for the same commitment features, which have
been added by previous studies either to saving or to credit contracts only (Bryan et al.,
2010), varies when these features are part of a credit or to a saving product. Since we offer
multiple cycles of the product to the same subjects, and randomly vary contract terms in
each cycle, we can test how demand changes not only between subjects in the same sample,
but also within subjects. These tests can help further our understanding of the behavioral

                                                3

foundations of microfinance (Bauer et al., 2012), and for guiding future development of
next-generation microfinance products incorporating behavioral features.


We find substantial demand for credit contracts and, to a lower extent, saving contracts.
When offered both a credit and a saving contract, 46 percent of the participants who take
up at least one offer actually accept both types of contracts. We also find that some subjects
take up savings contracts with a negative return, while others do not take credit contracts
with an interest subsidy. We interpret these results as demand for commitment: saving and
credit are substitutes for some individuals, as both represent means to finance expenditure
by committing to periodic instalments. However, we find no demand for the additional
features of the product — like flexibility and reminders. In particular, take-up of the sav-
ing product is insensitive to the presence of any additional feature. Indeed, clients offered
credit contracts appear actively to dislike the explicit commitment features, and find no
value in reminders.


To characterize heterogeneity in demand for our product, we adapt the machine learning
method recently proposed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018). We find significant demand het-
erogeneity across different kinds of respondents, and show that those most likely to adopt
the product are, on a variety of measures, more likely to have reported difficulties in saving,
more likely to face pressure to share their wealth, and more likely to believe in women’s
empowerment in the household. Finally, we find no effect of our microfinance products on
either business growth or household welfare — a result consistent with a growing body of
literature in both the microcredit and the microsaving domains.


Together, we see our results as making three distinct contributions. First, by presenting the

                                              4
                                        Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


same set of clients with both debt and credit products, we show that, in developing coun-
tries, many microfinance clients ‘borrow to save’. In previous pilot work, we showed this
pattern of behaviour for small financial products with daily repayments (Afzal et al., 2018).
This paper substantially extends that result, by showing that the same general behaviour
holds for a product with larger payments, over a longer period — in particular, a product
with payment sizes and repayment periods similar to those of standard financial products
on the market. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that randomly offers
the same client pool both credit and savings products of a size comparable to standard
microfinance products — and, therefore, the first paper to confirm that, for such products,
many of the same clients will accept both credit and savings products. This complements
recent work by Kast and Pomeranz (2018) showing that, for many microfinance clients,
provision of savings accounts reduces levels of debt. It also supports the already cited liter-
ature on borrowing to save among microfinance clients (Morduch, 2010; Collins et al., 2009;
Armendáriz and Morduch, 2010).1


Second, this is the first time that demand for multiple types of commitment devices has
been tested within the same field experiment. This is important, because it allows us to
quantify the relative effect of different kinds of nudge, in the context of a common under-
lying contract and a common sample.2 Further, since we cross-cut behavioral features with
both savings and credit products, we are uniquely positioned to test their relevance for both
1   The paper also relates to a recent literature on formalisation of informal savings products (Dupas and
    Robinson, 2013a,b). Similarly, Brune and Kerwin (2019) find a positive effect of deferred income streams
    designed as lumpsum payments.
2   Given the constant enrichment of the behavioral policy toolbox, evaluating the relative effectiveness of
    multiple behavioral and economic treatments within one setting is a valuable exercise. In doing this, we
    join a small set of papers that test multiple treatments in the realm of employment contracts (DellaVigna
    and Pope, 2017), investments in energy efficiency (Allcott and Greenstone, 2017) and credit marketing
    (Bertrand et al., 2010).

savings and credit products. Our results on demand for commitment are consistent with
the existing microfinance and microsaving literature. In particular, the decrease in take up
of our product, when augmented with the explicit commitment devices, and the high sen-
sitivity of take-up rates to contractual terms mirror the wide range of take-up figures found
in the literature, especially for credit contracts (Karlan et al., 2010). It also conforms with
the mixed evidence on demand for commitment (Ashraf et al., 2006; Allcott and Kessler,
2015; Damgaard and Gravert, 2018) and on its sensitivity to cost (Laibson, 2015).


The contrast between the high demand for implicit commitment (built into the repayment
structure of the financial product we offer) and the low demand for explicit commitment
(embodied by the additional contract features), complements existing evidence on individ-
uals’ demand for commitment devices. Such evidence is mixed, with some authors finding
high demand for commitment and welfare-improving impacts of commitment contracts
(Kaur et al., 2015; Schilbach, 2019; Augsburg et al., 2018), while others showing the oppo-
site (Bai et al., 2017).3 Our results suggest that demand for commitment is not just driven
by the level of commitment offered, but also by whether commitment is implicit or explicit.
This distinction is consistent with the observed tendency of private institutions to shroud
commitment mechanisms (Laibson, 2018) and to exploit individuals’ partial naivete in the
contracts they offer (DellaVigna and Malmendier, 2004). Shrouded paternalism is moti-
vated by the tendency of naive consumers to demand sub-optimal levels of commitment
(John, 2019; Bai et al., 2017), which drives firms to make commitment features implicit.


3   The evidence on the impact of flexibility on repayment quality in microfinance contracts is similarly mixed,
    with recent contributions showing that flexibility is valued, leads to improved business outcomes, and
    does not increase default (Battaglia et al., 2018; Barboni and Agarwal, 2018), and other papers providing
    evidence to contrary (Field and Pande, 2008; Czura, 2015).

                                         Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


The result — that the appeal of credit and commitment saving contracts is high, but there
is no demand for flexibility or for explicit commitment devices, either soft or hard — also
complements a recent literature documenting the hidden welfare cost of nudges. Recent
empirical research shows that, while nudges can encourage intended behaviour, they also
increase avoidance behaviour (Allcott and Kessler, 2015; Damgaard and Gravert, 2018).4
We speculate that many kinds of commitment devices, including the rather ostentatious
features that we add in this experiment, are viewed by respondents as patronising and in-
fantilising, rather than supportive or helpful.


Finally, we join a growing set of papers in microfinance by measuring the impact of our
financial product on a wide range of household and business outcomes. Consistent with
previous studies in the literature, we do not find transformative effects of microcredit on
either business outcomes or household material welfare (Meager, 2018b; Angelucci et al.,
2015; Attanasio et al., 2015; Augsburg et al., 2015; Banerjee et al., 2015; Crépon et al., 2015;
Tarozzi et al., 2015; Karlan and Zinman, 2011; Liu and Roth, 2019). We also contribute to a
smaller and more recent literature showing similarly limited effects of microsaving (Dupas
et al., 2018; De Mel et al., 2018; Castellanos et al., 2019).


Our paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we present the experimental design and the
different treatments, together with implementation details. We analyse demand for the
product in Section 3, and characterize heterogeneity in that demand in Section 4. We test
the effect of access to the product in Section 5, and conclude in Section 6.
4   In a related literature, experimental studies on ‘avoiding the ask’ and ‘moral wiggle room’ demonstrate
    how individuals avoid information or requests that make them feel morally obliged to act in a certain way,
    when such actions are costly (Andreoni et al., 2017; d’Adda et al., 2018; Dana et al., 2007). Another relevant
    phenomenon, ‘control aversion’, causes incentives and regulations to backfire when they are perceived as
    overbearing (Falk and Kosfeld, 2006; Fehr and List, 2004).

2      Experimental design

Our experiment is designed to answer two questions. First, why do people commit to mi-
crofinance contracts with regular payment schedules? One view — represented by standard
intertemporal optimization models, without behavioral features — suggests that demand
is driven by the net present value of the cash flow provided by the contract. Under such
models, individuals always accept credit if the net cash return is positive, always refuse
a savings contract if the net cash return is negative, and — depending on heterogeneity
in individual circumstances — the same individual either demands a credit contract or a
savings contract. An alternative view — representing the behavioral approach — posits
both that (i) individuals struggle to hold cash balances over time (whether due, for exam-
ple, to problems of self-control or problems of resisting social pressure (Karlan et al., 2019))
and (ii) that those individuals also hold a preference for lumpy expenditures.5 Under this
alternative model, individuals may accept a savings contract having a negative net cash re-
turn, may refuse a credit contract having a positive net cash return, and a given individual
may simultaneously exhibit both demand for savings and for credit (Afzal et al., 2018). To
answer the first question, we offer an individual-liability microfinance product requiring
regular repayments. By varying both the time of payment and size of the lumpsum, we are
able to test, in several ways, for a behavioral motivation for product demand. As we report
shortly, our results under that ‘basic contract’ are consistent with a behavioral motivation,
rather than with a standard model.


5   This could arise, for example, through a preference for lumpy consumption goods (Besley et al., 1993) or
    for indivisible investment opportunities (Field et al., 2013). It could also arise through a ‘concentration
    bias’ (Kőszegi and Szeidl, 2012; Dertwinkel-Kalt et al., 2017) — though our results on use of the lumpsum,
    presented shortly, suggest that this mechanism, even if relevant in this context, would be operating in
    addition to the mechanisms of lumpy consumption and lumpy investment.



                                                       8
                                  Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


This result then begs the second question that our experiment addresses: if microfinance
demand is driven by behavioral foundations, can we increase demand by incorporating explicit be-
havioral features? One might be tempted to assume that the answer to the first question
implies the answer to this second question; however, as we explain in detail shortly, there
are several reasons that this may not be the case. To answer this question, we augment
our basic contract with combinations of four different behavioral features — two relating
to repayment flexibility, and two relating to reminders.



2.1   The basic contract

The financial product offered in the experiment is inspired by the repayment structure of
rotating savings and credit associations: ‘ROSCAs’. Such associations have many different
names in different parts of the world; in Pakistan, they are generally known as ‘commit-
tees’. In a committee, a group of individuals come together with the goal of facilitating
saving. They agree to meet at regular intervals — for example, each week — for a set
number of meetings at which they each make a fixed monetary contribution, the amount
of which is agreed at the beginning of the contract. At each meeting, the contributions
of all members are put into a common pool, which is then allocated to a group member.
Participants take turns receiving the content of the pot, until everyone has received the pot
once, at which time the contract ends. The order in which members receive the pot is either
determined randomly or assigned by bidding, depending on committee rules.


The contract we offer in our experiment has the same general profile of payments: fixed
instalments at regular intervals over a set number of periods, plus one lumpsum payment
mimicking receiving the pot. But the contract does not require the formation of a group —



                                               9
                                  Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


and thus sidesteps the selection and enforcement issues inherent to the formation of saving
committees. Instead, the contract is designed as an individual financial product offered
by our partner institution, the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP), a microfinance
institution with extensive experience offering credit to women across Pakistan. The timing
of the lumpsum disbursement is known to participants at the time of take-up.


Subjects are offered the opportunity to take up a contract in each of three product cycles,
typically with different contract terms. At the beginning of a cycle, each participant is of-
fered an individual contract with known terms. If they accept the contract, payment starts
the following Monday (Week 1). Participants pay a weekly instalment of size M in N − 1
of the N weeks, and receive a lump-sum payment of size L in the remaining week. A
missed payment is considered a default and results in cancellation of the contract. In case
of default, the participant has to return any payment owed to NRSP as soon as possible
and, at the latest, by the end of Week N. If not, the participant is not offered any contract in
the following cycle. In case the participant has a positive balance with NRSP at the time of
default, this balance is returned to the subject at the end of the cycle — that is, after Week
N. Within this basic design we experimentally vary the contracts offered along several di-
mensions: the number of weeks N; the size of each instalment M; the week in which the
lumpsum payment is made (either Week 1 or Week N); and the amount of the lumpsum
payment L.


Recent literature has emphasized the value of replicating similar experiments in different
variations and across different contexts; this is valuable for providing a breadth of contexts,
for understanding the generalizability of results, and for understanding whether results are
sensitive to specific aspects of design (see, for example, Dupas et al. (2018) and Banerjee

                                              10
                                 Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


et al. (2015)). With this principle in mind, we implemented our experiment in two distinct
phases. These phases used different sampling frames (one focusing on microenterprises;
the other focusing on households), with contractual terms adapted to the respective re-
spondent population.


In the first phase, we restricted participation to female NRSP clients — past and current —
whose household owns a business. For this group, we set N = 6 and M = PKR 1000 and
we let the lumpsum payment take three possible values: PKR 5000, PKR 4500 or PKR 5500.
Since participants pay N − 1 = 5 instalments of PKR 1000 each, a lumpsum of PKR 5000
simply returns the five instalments to the subject. A lumpsum of PKR 4500 is equivalent
to deducting 10% from the lumpsum, while a lumpsum of 5500 means adding 10% to the
sum of instalments received. Table 1 illustrates the payment schedule for a basic contract
with a lumpsum payment on Week 1 and an interest of -10%.




                                     < Table 1 here. >




Since there are three possible lumpsum values and two possible disbursement weeks, there
are six possible contracts. Three of these contracts have a lumpsum paid in Week 1: they
are a form of commitment credit contract. Three have a lumpsum paid in Week N: they are
a form of commitment savings contract. Note that some credit contracts charge a negative
interest: credit is subsidized. Similarly, some saving contracts yield a negative interest:
subjects pay to save. This latter feature seeks to mimic the fact that savings instruments
made available to the poor often yield a negative return, either because of fees and charges
(e.g., Dupas and Robinson (2013a)), or because of inflation. More generally, the variation in

                                             11
                                  Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


total remuneration allows us to understand subjects’ willingness to pay for such products.


In the second phase, we drew our sample from past and current female NRSP clients,
whether or not their household owned a business. Following guidance from local partners,
we decided for this broader sample to use more payments, with smaller amounts: specifi-
cally, we set N = 8 and M = PKR 500. In these sessions, the lumpsum takes three values:
PKR 3500, 3200, or 3800. As in the first phase, the middle value is equivalent to setting a
zero interest rate, as in a standard ROSCA contract. The other two values are equivalent to
adding or subtracting 8.6% to the total instalments paid by the participant.



2.2   Behavioral features: Flexibility and reminders

The experimental literature on microfinance has examined how contractual flexibility af-
fects repayment. With some exceptions (e.g. John (2019)), there has been almost no research
on the demand for either flexibility or hard commitment among clients of MFIs in devel-
oping countries. With the aim of filling this gap, we introduced four additional treatments
to the second experimental phase — one treatment to reduce flexibility, one to increase it
and two treatments to remind respondents to repay. These treatments are added to the
basic contract of some subjects; other subjects receive just the basic contract described in
the previous sub-section. Our main research focus is on the demand for reminders and for
contractual rigidity/flexibility. Consequently, these treatments are always introduced to
subjects before take-up. In other words, when a subject decides to accept a contract offer,
she knows all the details of the contract that is being offered.

2.2.1    Reminders

Reminders are the most common form of soft commitment studied in the behavioral lit-
erature on savings. Their purpose is to help participants follow their regular schedule of
payments. In our experiment, we send reminders one day before an instalment is due. Re-
minders are transmitted through phone messages. In the ‘respondent reminder’ treatment,
the message is sent directly to the participant; in the ‘peer reminder’ treatment, the message
is sent to a family member of the participant. Subjects are told that the financial product
offered to them includes reminders. For instance, if a subject is assigned to a respondent
reminder treatment in the first product cycle, she is told that she will receive a reminder
before each instalment is due.6 This is different from other experiments that have externally
introduced reminders and observed how these reminders affect payment patterns (see, for
example, Karlan et al. (2016) who introduce reminders via letters and text messages). Here
we investigate whether subjects are more willing to accept a financial contract that includes
reminders.


The reason behind the inclusion in the experimental design of both ’respondent reminders’
and ’peer reminders’ is the desire to evaluate the relative role of two different sources
of commitment problems discussed in the literature. Inability to meet financial obliga-
tions may derive from their lack of salience, or from individual time-inconsistency and
self-control problems: in such instances, personal reminders increase commitment attain-
6   The experimental protocol stipulates that subjects are told: ‘To help you commit to a regular schedule
    of payments, we will call you on the day before an instalment is due. . . This call will be directed to you
    personally, on a phone number that you will provide to us if you take up the product.’ For peer reminders,
    the text is: ‘To help you commit to a regular schedule of payments, we will call a member of your family
    on the day before an instalment is due.’ Staff we instructed that, for reminder calls to respondents in the
    ‘peer reminder’ treatment, it was not permissible to leave reminder messages with any other person who
    might answer the call.

ment (Karlan et al., 2016). On the other hand, peer pressure and demands from household
members or peers to share available resources may also limit individual ability to save or
repay a loan (Ashraf, 2009; Jakiela and Ozier, 2015), and may also encourage household
members to act as ‘saving monitors’, to help the respondent to stick to the savings commit-
ment (Breza and Chandrasekhar, 2019) given their access to local community information
(Hussam et al., 2017). By comparing the impact of reminders on take-up and repayment
when sent to the respondent or to a peer we are able to assess the relative weight of these
constraints.


2.2.2   Commitment features

Our commitment arm involves either adding a cancellation fee (we term this the ‘sunk’
treatment), or adding additional contractual flexibility (we term this the ‘flex’ treatment).


The ‘sunk’ treatment adds a cancellation fee of PKR 500 for defaulting on a contract. This
penalty is added to the total amount owed by the participant to the bank. If subjects de-
mand harder commitment contracts, we expect more take-up in this treatment. How this
penalty operates depends on whether the contract is a credit contract (i.e., lumpsum paid
in Week 1) or a savings contract (lumpsum paid in Week N). To recall, in case of default
in a savings contract, our implementing partner NRSP returns to the subject in Week N all
the instalments paid before defaulting. For instance, if a subject has paid three instalments
totalling PKR 1500 then defaults, this subject receives PKR 1500 in Week N in the standard
savings contract, but only PKR 1500 minus the cancellation fee, that is, PKR 1000 in the
‘sunk’ treatment. This is equivalent to making the first instalment ‘sunk’ (e.g., John (2019)).
In case of default in a credit contract, the remainder of the debt becomes immediately due.
For instance, if a subject had repaid PKR 1500 on a PKR 3500 loan granted in Week 1 but

                                              14
                                          Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


stops paying in week 5, the unpaid portion of the loan becomes due in that week, i.e., PKR
2000. In the ‘sunk’ treatment, the cancellation fee of PKR 500 is added to this amount.


In the ‘flex’ treatment, in contrast, more repayment flexibility is added to the contract. In
this treatment, we give the participant the flexibility of delaying one instalment by one week
only.7 To illustrate, the subject may decide not to pay the instalment PKR 500 in Week 3. In
this case, the subject will have to pay the regular instalment of PKR 500 in Week 4 plus the
delayed instalment of PKR 500 from Week 3 — i.e., a total of PKR 1000 in Week 4. Other
instalments remain unchanged. Note that the subject in the ‘flex’ treatment decides when
to use the option to delay an instalment. It can be applied to any instalment between the
first instalment and the last — or to none at all. All other rules regulating default continue
to apply.


The design of the ‘sunk’ and ‘flex’ treatments draws from existing studies introducing hard
commitment features to saving products (John, 2019) or adding flexibility to the rigid re-
payment schedule typical of microfinance products (Field et al., 2013; Czura, 2015; Barboni
and Agarwal, 2018; Battaglia et al., 2018).8 We combine these features in an unique exper-
imental design and test their impact on take-up and default both in the saving and credit
domains.
7   Subjects are told that “We understand that it is not always possible to pay instalments every week. There-
    fore, over the course of eight weeks, we will allow you on one occasion only to delay a payment by one
    week.”
8   Our ‘flex’ treatment is closest to the flexibility option in Barboni and Agarwal (2018), with the key difference
    that customers have to pay in full the instalment that they decide to skip with the following instalment,
    rather than spreading out the outstanding balance over the remaining loan instalments.

2.3   Implementation

The first phase was conducted from 25 August 2014 to 1 March 2015 in two districts of
Pakistan Punjab: Bhakkar and Chakwal. The endline survey was completed by 30 March
2015. The second phase was implemented from October 2015 to May 2016 in four districts
of Punjab: Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Khushab and Mandi Bahuddin. The endline survey was
carried out after Ramadan, in July-August 2016. Funding for the first phase was provided
by the International Growth Centre (IGC); funding for the second phase was provided by
the Economic Social Research Council (ESRC).


Participants are drawn from clients of microfinance products offered by NRSP. All subjects
are women. In the first phase, participation is restricted to past and current clients whose
household own at least one business. In the second phase, this restriction does not apply.
The implementation of the experiment was carried out by NRSP field staff. Table 2 shows
the districts, offices and sample size that was included in the two phases of the experiment.



                                     < Table 2 here. >



In Table 3, we summarize the experimental design, and report the share of participants
assigned to each treatment. In Phase 1, we used a simple treatment/control division (with
50% of our sample in each). In Phase 2, we assigned 25% of participants to the control
group; the remaining 75% were then assigned in a 3 × 3 factorial design, covering all com-
binations of (i) sunk, flex or no commitment feature, and (ii) respondent reminders, peer
reminders and no reminders. Subjects were told whether they are in a ‘sunk’, ‘flex’ or ‘re-
minder’ treatment before drawing the cards determining interest rate and lumpsum date.

                                             16
                                       Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


Hence individuals who reject the contract before drawing cards already know whether the
contract would include a ‘sunk’ or ‘flex’ component or a ‘reminder’ component.


The combination of treatment dimensions results in a total of six different generalized
ROSCA contracts in the first phase (that is, the six combinations of interest rate and time
of lumpsum payment), and 54 different generalized ROSCA contracts in the second phase
(the six combinations from the first phase interacted with the nine treatment cells). We
do not have sufficient statistical power to study the effect of each possible combination of
treatments separately, but this was never the intention of the experimental design: rather,
in the empirical analysis, we use the orthogonality of treatment assignment to examine
different treatment dimensions separately.



                                            < Table 3 here. >



We assigned participants to these various treatments by stratified randomization.9 We
fielded baseline and endline surveys on both treated and control subjects. In the second
phase of sessions we also conducted phone surveys to gather higher frequency information
about short list of indicators, with the view of more precisely estimating any potential im-
pact of treatment on business outcomes.


In practice, assignment to treatment was implemented by inviting participants to draw a
card at random at the beginning of a cycle in order to determine the interest charge (i.e.,
9   We stratify as follows. First we divide participants into blocks based on their answers to questions on
    ‘running a business’, ‘whether the respondent makes the final decision on spending’ and ‘whether the
    respondent would use a loan for investment’. We then sort within blocks by household income. Individuals
    with a similar income in the same block are then assigned to different treatments.

                                                     17

zero, negative, or positive) and the week of the lumpsum payment (Week 1 or Week N).
The card is drawn in Week 0, at which time subjects are asked whether they take the con-
tract or not. If they do, NRSP field officers return a week later to start the contract proper.
Inserting a week between the acceptance of the contract and any initial payment is done
both for logistical reasons, and to minimize the effect of pure present bias on take-up.


Tables A1 and A2 describe main characteristics of the sample in the two phases. Monthly
household consumption averages PKR 25,000 ($250) in Phase 1 and PKR 20,000 ($200) in
Phase 2. A large proportion (60%) of the sample in Phase 1 is self-employed but this
proportion is much smaller in Phase 2. On average, respondents in the two samples report
finding it difficult to save. Tables A1 and A2 also report p-values for randomisation balance
across treatments. This is done by regressing each variable on the assigned treatment status
in a saturated specification. We also test for randomisation balance across contract terms,
using a similar saturated specification that regresses each variable on randomly assigned
interest rate and week of payment. We find strong balance across treatment status and
contract terms in Phase 1. We find four variables to be unbalanced at the 90% confidence
level in Phase 2. All our main estimation results are unaffected if we include these four
variables as additional controls.

3       Demand for the product

Our empirical analysis — both of product demand and consequences of adopting — follows
two Pre-Analysis Plans.10



3.1      Average take-up rates

We start by documenting average take-up frequencies for the six combinations of interest
charge and lumpsum week offered in the two phases of experimental sessions. To do this,
we estimate only among treated respondents (that is, we omit respondents in the control
groups, because they were not offered the contracts). Take-up frequencies are obtained by
estimating a linear probability model of the form:

                                            2    3
                                   ait =   ∑ ∑ βwr · Titw · Titr + ε it ,                        (1)
                                           w =1 r =1


where ait = 1 if individual i accepts the contract in cycle t and 0 otherwise. Variables Titw
and Titr are dummies equal to 1 if individual i in cycle t is offered a contract with payment
in week 1 or N and with a negative, zero or positive interest added to the lumpsum. In
phase 2 some subjects said they were not interested in any contract and consequently re-
fused to select a card to determine Titw and Titr . These subjects thus refused all six possible
contracts, each of which they would have been offered with probabilty 1/6. We treat these
cases as six different refusal observations each given a weight of 1/6. Standard errors are
clustered at the individual level.

                                               < Table 4 here. >




Results for all subjects from both experimental phases appear in the top panel of Table 4;
in the bottom panel, we exclude ‘automatic refusers’ — that is, respondents who refused
the contract before learning the contractual terms.11


Focusing on the top panel, we first note that, in both phases, take-up is positive for all six
contracts. Similar qualitative results are obtained if we only consider subjects who were
offered the basic contract. Take-up responds to contract terms: demand for the product is
higher when payment is in week 1 instead of in week N; and demand is higher when the
lumpsum is larger. These differences are all statistically significant at the 1% level. Com-
paring the impact of interest rate on take-up between credit and saving contracts, we see a
larger sensitivity of demand to the size of the lumpsum for the former, consistent with the
existing evidence (Karlan et al., 2010).


We observe behaviors consistent with a pure demand for saving commitment. For instance,
2.7% of participants in phase 1 and 4.1% in phase 2 take up saving commitment contracts
with a fee — i.e., for which the lumpsum is less than total instalments M · ( N − 1). In both
cases, participants could in principle accumulate the instalments themselves and end up
11   The proportion of automatic refusers in each cycle of each phase is reported in Table A3. Across all
     three cycles, automatic refusers account from one third of phase 1 observations, and two fifths of phase 2
     observations. In phase 1, the proportion of automatic refusers increases slowly across cycles; in phase 2,
     the proportion of automatic refusers is twice as high in the first cycle than in the other two. 58% and 29%
     of subjecs are never automatic refusers in phase 1 and 2, respectively. Automatic refusers tend not to refuse
     in all product cycles: the proportion of those who always refuse automatically is 25% and 20% in phase 1
     and 2, respectively.


                                                         20
                                Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


with more money. Other behaviors are consistent with a difficulty to save independently:
a large proportion of subjects, 53% and 62.8% in phase 1 and 2 respectively, refrain from
taking a subsidized credit contract. In both cases, subjects could have taken the loan, paid
back the instalments, and be left with the subsidy. The only reason for not doing so is
having to hold onto the funds to pay the instalments. All these results are consistent with
earlier findings obtained by Afzal et al. (2018) using a similar contract design but a much
shorter contract duration.


It is possible to construct standard models of saving and borrowing — that is, models in
which respondents do not have a preference for commitment savings — in which partici-
pants accept a saving contract with a fee, or refuse subsidized credit. However, the implied
discount rates for such a model are so extreme as to be implausible. To illustrate, consider
the week 1 frequencies, i.e., the take-up of loans. The change in take-up rates over experi-
mental interest rates implies that 8.2% of phase 1 subjects have annual compound discount
rates higher than 128%, and 53% of them have negative discount rates higher than 50%, with
remaining subjects lying in between these two extremes. Similar patterns are observed in
phase 2.


This is not all. If we turn to take-up of savings contracts, we get completely different im-
plied discount rates if we believe our subjects follow a standard model of borrowing and
saving. For instance, the fact that 89% of phase 1 subjects turn down an opportunity to save
at an annual compound interest of 128% (10% over 6 weeks) would imply that these sub-
jects have a discount rate higher than 128% – a number that is much larger than the 8.2% of
subjects who take a loan at that same interest rate. A discrepancy of the same magnitude
is found in phase 2. The same contradiction arises for those subjects exhibiting negative

                                            21
                                 Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


discount rates: 2.7% (4.1%) of phase 1 (2) subjects appear to have a negative discount rate
higher than 60%, compared to 53% (62.8%) based on loans.


The results excluding automatic refusers are similar in terms of sensitivity to contract terms
and in terms of discrepancies in the implied distribution of discount rates across saving and
credit contracts. It is reasonable to assume that automatic refusers include all the subjects
who are uninterested in our contracts because of the implied transaction costs. It follows
that the discrepancies in discount rate distribution observed across the saving and credit
frames are not an artefact of transaction costs.


Even more damaging for a standard model with stable time preferences is the fact that the
same subjects often accept — or reject — both a saving and a credit contract with com-
parable terms. This is summarized in Table 5. In the first panel of the table, we consider
individuals who take a loan charging a positive interest — implying impatience — as well
as a savings contract with a zero or negative return — implying a strong desire to post-
pone consumption. After dropping automatic refusers (for whom contract terms were not
drawn), we have 107 individuals in phase 1 and 350 in phase 2 who were offered each type
of contract at least once during one of the three product cycles. In both cases, the majority
of subjects rejected both contracts — in line with the generally low take-up of low payout
contracts documented in Table 4. Of those who take at least one loan contracts with zero
or positive interest, 20 to 24% also take the savings contract. Similarly, of those who take at
least one saving contract with a negative return, 67 to 68% also take a loan contract with a
zero or positive interest. This shows that most individuals who take up a negative return
savings contract also take a credit contract — suggesting that credit, for them, serves the
same lumpsum accumulation role as credit.

                                              22
                                  Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts




                                      < Table 5 here. >



In the second panel of Table 5 , we consider individuals who accept either of the two costly
contracts discussed in Panel 1, while at the same time refusing a credit contract with a
negative interest — i.e., a contract paying PKR 5500 (Phase 1) or 3800 (Phase 2) in week
1. We have already argued that refusing such a contract violates the standard model —
except for the existence of transaction costs. We have 101 individuals in phase 1 and 399
individuals in phase 2 who are offered both types of contracts, i.e., a negative interest credit
contract and a contract (credit or saving) with a low payout. As noted earlier, the majority
of individuals who are offered the negative interest credit take it. There is, however, a
non-negligible fraction of the subjects who refuse this contract. Of those, all take the lower
payout contract. Similarly, among those who take the low payout credit or savings contract,
two thirds refuse the attractive credit contract. In spite of the different sample sizes, the
proportions are almost identical in the two subject populations.


Taken as a whole, the evidence is impossible to reconcile with a standard model of bor-
rowing and saving in which the distribution of discount rates is stable, reasonable, and
identical for borrowing and lending. The fact that take-up is higher for credit contracts
with a low or negative interest suggests that subjects prefer more money at an earlier date.
But many are also willing to take less advantageous contracts, while others are unwilling to
accept even the most generous contract. As we show in Afzal et al. (2018), this behavior is
consistent with a model in which individuals have a preference for lumpsum accumulation
but are unable to save without contractual commitment. When their demand for lumpsum


                                              23
                                 Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


accumulation is high enough, they are more likely to accept a commitment contract, pro-
vided the effort to save is not too high, i.e., provided that the interest charge is low enough
and the timing of lumpsum disbursement early enough. When the need for lumpsum ac-
cumulation is low, subjects refuse any contract, even those with a credit subsidy.


Further support for this conclusion lies in respondents’ description of how they used the
lumpsum payments in Phase 2. We show the top categories for this use in Figure A4
(appendix). Of the top eight categories (which together cover about 80% of respondents),
seven categories quite obviously describe lumpy purchases, whether in the form of con-
sumption durables (home appliances and clothing), investment (home repairs and assets
for a business), wedding and festival expenses, and medical expenses. The only category
of the top eight that does not necessarily fit this categorization is ‘food purchases’ (repre-
senting 20% of respondents); we do not know more about the specific form of the food
purchases, but we note that even lumpsum food purchases often attract quantity discounts
(see, for example, Brune and Kerwin (2019) and Attanasio and Pastorino (2015)).



3.2   Demand for explicit commitment features

We now turn to the reminder and commitment variations. We have seen that the behav-
ior of many participants is consistent with a demand for lumpsum accumulation and an
inability to save at home, which leads them to accept contracts that commit them to the
payment of a sequence of regular instalments. Since this behavior indicates a demand for
commitment contracts, we are interested in finding out whether these same participants are
also interested in contracts with additional explicit commitment features, such as receiving
reminders or facing a cancellation fee. The literature has shown that such features reduce



                                              24
                                          Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


the probability of default. What is less clear is whether subjects have an ex ante demand
for these additional commitment features. At the same time, we wonder whether subjects
might benefit from the option to postpone an instalment to deal with an emergency. If
this is the case, we expect a higher take-up when this option is included in the contract.
Further, we are able to test whether these contractual features are valued differently when
participants have to pay to save up for to a lumpsum amount in a savings product or when
they have to pay down to repay a lumpsum provided under a standard credit framework.


Figure 1 presents the results from this investigation. The figure shows (on the far left) take-
up rates for the basic contract (that is, the product with neither the ‘flex’/‘sunk’ variation
nor the ‘self reminder’ / ‘peer reminder’ variation); it then shows take-up rates for each of
the eight possible behavioral variations. Error bars show 90% and 95% confidence intervals
on the difference in take-up relative to the basic contract. These take-up rates — and con-
fidence intervals — are obtained using an OLS regression of take-up on dummies for the
nine combinations of reminder and commitment treatments, as well as dummies for the
six combinations of payment week and interest rate. Standard errors are clustered at the
individual level and observations from all three product cycles are combined. We show the
original regression coefficients, and pairwise significance tests, in Tables A4 and A5 in the
appendix.12 Panel A of Figure 1 (at the top) shows these results for credit contracts (that
is, contracts where the lumpsum is offered to be paid in the first period); Panel B (at the
12   Panels 2B and 2C of these tables show respectively the marginal effects of flexibility and of reminders.
     Relative to a basic contract, the addition of flexibility increases demand only when coupled with the option
     of reminders to the respondent (Panel 2B). On their own, reminders reduce take-up, especially when they
     are sent to peers. Adding reminders to the respondent has a significant effect on demand only when
     coupled with the added contractual flexibility (Panel 2C). This seems to suggest that reminders are more
     valued ex ante when the contract is more flexible — perhaps because subjects feel that the lower level of
     commitment needs to be compensated by reminders. This interpretation finds some additional support in
     the fact that reminders have no effect on take-up in the ‘sunk’ treatment. When reminders are sent to peers,
     the positive effect on take-up in the ‘flex’ treatment is smaller in magnitude and no longer significant.


                                                        25

bottom) shows the results for savings contracts (where the lumpsum is to be paid in the
final period).



                                              < Figure 1 here. >



The implications of the figure are stark: contrary to what one might expect, clients do not
value additional commitment features. This is particularly evident for credit contacts. Here,
of the eight variations on the ’basic, no reminders’ product, demand is lower in seven cases;
in three of these cases (‘flex, no reminders’, ’sunk, no reminders’, and ’sunk, reminder to
peers’), the demand reduction exceeds 25% (i.e. 5 percentage points), and is significant. A
joint test that take-up is equal across all nine contracts is rejected with p = 0.011 (see Table
A4). We do not see the same pattern for saving contracts, for which take-up is generally
lower — however, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the relative take-up pattern that
we observe for credit is the same pattern as for saving.13


In our view, this is a novel result for understanding the demand for microfinance in de-
veloping countries. It shows that microfinance products with a fixed repayment schedule
— an extremely common form of contract across developing countries — may represent
an important form of what Laibson (2018) refers to as ‘shrouded paternalism’. As Laibson
explains:

         . . . lots of thriving institutions have bundled commitment features that appear
         to be specifically designed to help agents overcome their self-control problems.
13   When we conduct a joint test here of the null hypothesis that the take-up rate is equal across all nine
     contracts, we find p = 0.321 and we do not reject; see Table A5. When we conduct a joint test across Panel
     A and Panel B, of the null hypothesis that the estimates in Panel B simply scale down those in Panel A by
     a common ratio, we also do not reject: we obtain p = 0.206.

                                                       26
                                  Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


     On the other hand, these institutions generally don’t market these commitment
     features — i.e., the forcing mechanisms are shrouded.

Our results in this paper — namely, our finding that respondents value the commitment
implicit in microfinance, but do not value additional explicit behavioral features — are con-
sistent with precisely this narrative. Similarly, although studies from other domains show
significant demand for contracts featuring explicit commitment (Kaur et al., 2015; Bai et al.,
2017), existing evidence on soft and hard commitment devices in the saving domain con-
firms the greater success of the former (in the form of ‘labeled savings accounts’) over the
latter (both in terms of demand and impact on outcomes) (Karlan and Linden, 2014; Ben-
hassine et al., 2015). The lower demand for explicit commitment features is also consistent
with a related behavioral literature on ‘avoiding the ask’ and control aversion (Andreoni
et al., 2017; Falk and Kosfeld, 2006; Fehr and List, 2004). Our results on demand for flexibil-
ity also emphasize the importance of the specific details of flexibility, in the context of the
specific contract being offered. In particular, both Barboni and Agarwal (2018) and Battaglia
et al. (2018) find significantly higher demand for contracts with a more flexible repayment
schedule — provided in the form of the possibility to take a three-month repayment hol-
iday and spread the outstanding balance over the remaining monthly instalments (in the
former); and of the option to delay up to two monthly instalments with a corresponding
increase in the duration of the loan cycle (in the latter).

4    Heterogeneity in take-up: A machine learning analysis

The previous sections have analysed the average take-up rates across our sample. In this
section, we use a rich set of covariates to characterize heterogeneity in these patterns. To
do so, we use a modified version of the machine learning approach recently proposed by
Chernozhukov et al. (2018). In this context, we see this method as serving two related
purposes. First, the exercise allows us to track take-up for different product types across
groups with different take-up rates. This serves as a robustness check to our earlier con-
clusions: one might be concerned that the average patterns that we have just documented
might change substantially when we focus on heterogeneous sub-groups, but we show in
this section that this is not the case. Second, and more fundamentally, the method allows
us to test directly for heterogeneity across covariates. In doing so, it then allows us to
describe the characteristics of those women who have high demand for the product, and
those who have low demand. We argued earlier that take-up for our product is driven by a
‘borrowing to save’ motivation; if this is the case, this should be reflected in the descriptive
characteristics of those groups having higher product demand.


We implement the Chernozhukov et al. (2018) method as follows. First, we randomly split
treated respondents into auxiliary and main samples. In the auxiliary sample, we use a
machine learning method to estimate the probability of product adoption, conditional on
a vector of 58 baseline covariates. Specifically, we use an elastic net with a logistic link
function; for each random split of the data, we rescale the covariate vector, then tune and
train the model using two-fold cross validation — choosing α (the mixing percentage) and
λ (the regularization parameter) to minimize deviance. We then use the estimated parame-




                                              28
                                          Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


ters from this model to predict take-up in the main sample, for post-processing.14 We focus
primarily on results for Phase 2 (both because Phase 2 incorporated commitment features,
and because Phase 2 collected a more extensive set of baseline covariates); we show similar
results from Phase 1 in the appendix.


Figure 2 shows Group Average Treatment Effects (‘GATES’), sorted by take-up propensity.
That is, we group our data into quintiles of the overall take-up propensity; for each quintile,
we then characterize average take-up rates and 90% confidence intervals. Consider first the
black bars; these show the estimated take-up rates for all contracts pooled. These bars,
which are rescaled versions of the top and bottom panels of Figure 2, are a direct analog to
Figure 4 in Chernozhukov et al. (2018). They show that we have substantial heterogeneity
in take-up rates across individuals with different covariates: for the lowest quintile, the
average take-up rate is approximately 10%, and for the highest quintile, the rate is above
25%.15



                                               < Figure 2 here. >



We augment this analysis in two ways. First, in the top panel of Figure 2, we add take-up
rates and confidence intervals for (i) products offering the ‘flex’ variation, (ii) products of-
14   This follows closely the approach in Chernozhukov et al. (2018). Note that, in our context, the outcome of
     interest is the take-up rate — which, for members of the control group, is zero by construction. Therefore,
     using the terminology of Chernozhukov et al. (2018), we are estimating s0 (z), and imposing b0 (z) ≡ 0 by
     construction. We construct both point estimates and confidence intervals using the ‘variational estimation
     and inference’ method described in Chernozhukov et al. (2018) (for which we use 1000 random sample
     splits).
15   Chernozhukov et al. (2018) provide a method for testing whether this heterogeneity is significant, by testing
     whether the ‘best linear predictor’ of take-up varies with respect to predicted take-up. We find that it does:
     using the terminology of Chernozhukov et al. (2018), we estimate β̂ 2 = 0.983, with a 90% confidence interval
     of (0.691, 1.275) (where β 2 = 0 represents the null hypothesis of no heterogeneity across covariates).

                                                         29
                                           Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


fering the ‘sunk’ variation, (iii) products offering the ‘respondent reminder’ variation and
(iv) products offering the ‘peer reminders’ variation.16 The patterns are remarkable for
their stability across quintiles. In short, ‘a rising tide lifts all boats’: the covariate factors
that correlated to an overall increase in take-up rates also correlate with increased demand
for each of the various behavioral variations. Second, in the bottom panel of Figure 2, we
repeat the analysis for the contract terms: that is, for variations in the lumpsum amount
and in the time of payment. Again, the basic pattern — and all of the stylised facts noted
in Table 4 — holds across all quintiles.


Who, then, are the respondents who fall into these quintiles? Following Chernozhukov
et al. (2018), we answer this question by describing the characteristics of those respondents
in the ‘most affected’ and ‘least affected’ groups — that is, the 20% with the highest adop-
tion rate (which we term the ‘highest adopters’) and the 20% with the lowest adoption rate
(the ‘lowest adopters’). In Table A7 (appendix), we perform this comparison for all 58 of
the baseline covariates used for our analysis. In Table 6, we focus on those covariates with
a specific behavioral interpretation — namely, variables relating to respondents’ baseline
saving difficulties, respondents’ attitudes about women’s empowerment, and respondents’
ability to keep track of tasks and finances.




                                                < Table 6 here. >




Table 6 shows large and highly significant differences in respondent characteristics for al-
16   To be clear: for each of these variations, we graph against the same quintiles calculated earlier — that
     is, quintiles in overall take-up rates, rather than quintiles calculated separately for each variation. This is
     important for comparability across graphs, and comparability to the cluster analysis that follows shortly.


                                                         30
                                  Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


most all of the ‘behavioral’ characteristics in Phase 2. It is particularly noteworthy that,
of the highest adopters, 89% said at baseline that they find it hard to save, and 94% said
they face pressure to share; the equivalent figures for the lowest adopters are just 54% and
55% respectively. Further — and consistent with our interpretation that the basic contract
provides a useful commitment device — the highest adopters are significantly less likely to
have described themselves at baseline as ‘good at keeping track of time’, ‘good at keeping
track of finances’, to follow a strict schedule on finances, to follow a tight routine, and less
likely to act early to avoid forgetting (either generally or with respect to finances). Finally,
as one might expect, the highest adopters report significantly higher intra-household em-
powerment at baseline: they report a significantly higher share of household decisions in
which the woman’s view is always considered, and are more than twice as likely to agree
that it is appropriate for a woman to invest in her business without consulting her husband
and to go shopping for a personal item (specifically, a scarf).


The Phase 1 counterpart to Table A7 appears in the appendix as Table A8. Here we see both
important similarities and important differences to the patterns in Phase 2. Both similarities
and differences can be explained by the different sampling strategies used — in particu-
lar, by the fact that Phase 1 deliberately includes many more self-employed respondents.
For example, we find in both phases that the ‘highest adopters’ are more likely to be self-
employed that the ‘lowest adopters’ (though the highest takers in phase 2 have essentially
the same self-employment frequency (22%) as the lowest takers in phase 1 (19%)). Simi-
larly, we find in both cases that the highest takers are have larger households (with higher
household consumption), and are more likely to be a member of a savings committee. In
contrast, we find no significant difference in Phase 1 between the highest adopters and the
lowest adopters in terms of pressure to share — and, in Phase 1, the highest adopters are

                                              31
                                  Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


significantly less likely to have declared, at baseline, that they find it hard to save. One pos-
sible interpretation is that the Phase 2 and 1 samples form a continuum, with the highest
take-up respondents from phase 2 sharing many similarities with low take-up respondents
from phase 1 — notably in self-employment, consumption expenditures, household size,
membership in a savings committee, and pressure to share. Large households with more
self-employment and a higher income are presumably more able to save — and thus to join
a savings committee — while their daily income from self-employment exposes them more
to the pressure to share. This interpretation would explain why, across the two samples,
take-up increases with self-employment, income, family size, ability to save, and pressure
to share.


Finally, we show the Phase 1 counterpart to Figure 2 in the appendix, as Figure A6. The
general patterns are the same, though Phase 1 respondents appear to have a greater sensi-
tivity to the size of lumpsum payment.



5     Consequences of adopting

5.1   Contract features and repayment

How do contract features affect repayment? This question is important for shedding light
on our earlier take-up analysis. If, for example, late repayment problems are widespread,
this would have implications for the practical viability of the products studied; similarly, if
late repayment rates do not differ between the basic contract and the ‘sunk’ variation, this
might suggest that respondents are naive about the value of the commitment device for
their future behavior (DellaVigna and Malmendier, 2006; John, 2019).


                                               32
                                         Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts




In Figure 3, we show the rate of late repayment by behavioral variations. The structure of
the figure mirrors that of the earlier figure showing take-up rates (Figure 1): we show the
rate of late repayment both for the basic contract and for the behavioral variations, and we
divide the analysis between credit contracts (Panel A, top) and saving contracts (Panel B,
below). The figure shows late repayment that is not authorised by the contract — so, for
example, a respondent under the ‘flex’ contract who is exercising her right to delay one
payment by one week is not considered here to be late. Figure A7 (appendix) repeats the
analysis, but recording those women as making a late payment.




                                             < Figure 3 here. >




Several stylized facts deserve noting here. First, on average, the probability that at least
one of a client’s payments is made late is about 12%. Second, this rate generally decreases
with the various behavioral features — and is significantly lower in several of those cases.17
That is, on their own, reminders (whether reminders to the respondent or to a peer) reduce
the rate of repayment problems, but not significantly; the larger decreases — which drive
significant differences — operate through the contractual flexibility variations. That is, we
do not find evidence, in this context, that clients are naively opting in to the additional
penalty scheme (‘sunk’) without further consequence on their behavior.


17   Under credit, it is lower under the combination of ‘flex’ and the respondent reminders, under the combi-
     nation of ‘sunk’ and the respondent reminders, under the combination of ‘flex’ and the peer reminders,
     and under the combination of ‘sunk’ and the peer reminders. Under savings, it is lower under ‘sunk’ (with
     no reminders), the combination of ‘sunk’ and respondent reminders, the combination of ‘flex’ and peer
     reminders, and the combination of ‘sunk’ and peer reminders.


                                                       33
                                   Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


Third, we note that — with the important exception of the ‘sunk’ contracts — the rate of
late repayment is higher under saving contracts than under credit contracts. This makes
intuitive sense, for two related reasons. On the one hand, subjects who renege on a com-
mitment saving contract only face mild penalties: their paid-in instalments are kept until
the end of the product cycle, at which point they are returned. Therefore — for clients not
facing the ‘sunk’ contract — subjects essentially have the option to walk away from the con-
tract. On the other hand, default in credit contracts is much lower because NRSP collection
effort are much stronger. The logic is simple: the subject has already received the lumpsum,
so reneging is individually optimal for the borrower and thus has to be disincentivized by
a concerted debt recovery effort. While these findings are not particularly surprising, they
nonetheless bring to light the inherent difficulty of getting a third party to enforce a com-
mitment savings contract, as opposed to a credit contract. This simple dichotomy may go
a long way in explaining the predominance of credit contracts in microfinance, in spite of
the fact that an important purpose of microfinance is to enable households to save.



5.2   Business and household outcomes

We now turn to the estimation of the impact of treatment on business and household
outcomes. The main focus of this analysis is the comparison of control participants (who
were not invited to take-up any of our commitment contracts) with treated participants
(who were). We use the following ANCOVA specification:


                          yi1 = β 0 + β 1 · Ti + β 2 · yi0 + φs + ηd + ε i ,                   (2)


where yi1 denotes an outcome variable of interest measured at endline 1, yi0 is the baseline
value of yi1 , φs are strata dummies, and ηd are district fixed effects. We cluster errors at the

                                                 34
                                          Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


household level.


The variable Ti takes two interpretations, depending on the specification. First, we denote
Ti as assignment to treatment; in that case, we estimate equation 2 using OLS, and inter-
pret β̂ 1 as the ITT. Second, we denote Ti as take-up. This takes four possible values, which
depend on whether the subjects takes up the contract in 0, 1, 2 or 3 cycles. In this case, we
calculate average take-up at the individual level, and instrument this using assignment to
treatment and to contractual terms; we then interpret β̂ 1 as providing the LATE, normal-
ized for a case where a respondent takes up in all three product cycles.18


Outcomes are divided into two broad categories: business outcomes and household finance
and consumption. In Table 7, we report business outcomes; we collect ITT and LATE es-
timates for both phase 1 and phase 2 samples. In principle, our MFI partner lends for
business purposes: it is therefore of primary interest whether our commitment saving con-
tract is able to improve business investment and performance.




                                               < Table 7 here. >


18   To instrument average take-up, we proceed as follows. First, for each cycle s, we estimate the predicted
     take-up of individual i based on the different types of treatments i was exposed to in that cycle – i.e.,
     payment week, negative or positive interest, reminders, and ‘flex’ or ‘sunk’ treatment. This is achieved
     using the same regression that was used in generating Table 4 for the six combinations of payment week
     and interest rate — except that it is estimated separately for each cycle. This generates a predicted take-up
     for each product cycle. The sum over all three cycles is then used as instrument for Ti when estimating. For
     automatic refusers, we do not have a specific payment week or interest rate on which to base our prediction
     – since these subjects refused the contract before cards were drawn. To circumvent this issue, we ascribe to
     each of these observations the average predicted take-up associated with their commitment and reminder
     treatment, assuming an average interest rate and payment week. In practice this is achieved, as before, by
     generating six observations for each refuser, one for each combination of payment week and interest rate,
     and ascribing a weight of 1/6 to each of these observation when estimating the predicting equation.


                                                         35
                                 Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


We find almost no significant effect on business and household outcomes of having been
offered our treatment; this is consistent with a growing body of evidence on the effects
of microfinance (see, for example, Meager (2018b) and Meager (2018a)). In the phase 1
sample, 60% of respondents have a business. Among these subjects, we find generally
positive point estimates on business performance, as measured by investment, sales, or
profit. But these point estimates are in general not statistically significant. Two of the ITT
coefficients are above the 10% significance level, but only one of the LATE coefficients is
significant, and it is for another dependent variable. In contrast, among the phase 2 sam-
ple, estimated treatment effects are small in magnitude and never significant. This may be
because a much smaller proportion (12.5%) of these households have a business at baseline.


Results for household material outcomes are presented in Table 8. We find no significant
effect on household consumption or household income (the latter being measured only in
the phase 2 sample). In the phase 1 sample, we find a large and significant LATE coefficient
on total household assets and total individual assets. This encouraging result is, however,
negated in the phase 2 sample where we find a large but negative LATE effect on total
household assets.




                                      < Table 8 here. >




The bottom part of Table 8 relates to household finances. We see that 75% of control subjects
in the phase 1 sample save in a ‘committee’. The proportion is smaller in phase 2: 16.6%.
We find a positive and significant LATE effect on participation in a committee, but given
that the corresponding ITT coefficient is essentially 0, it is unclear how much faith to put

                                             36
                                   Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


in this result. We also find a positive LATE for participation in a committee among phase
2 respondents, but the effect is not statistically significant. The last row of Table 8 reports
results for the total debt of the respondent. Our commitment saving product should have
helped participants reduce their stock of debt. We find little evidence of this. Among phase
1 subjects, ITT and LATE coefficients are positive but not significant, while among phase 2
subjects the ITT is negative and significant but the LATE coefficient is not.


Further, we measure the impact on a short list of indicators using higher frequency in-
formation from phone surveys conducted at the end of each experiment wave. Table A9
(appendix) summarizes the results for business and household outcomes. We find gen-
erally insignificant effects. There are no significant effect on the likelihood of running a
business, the number of businesses or on the value of capital invested in the business in
the last one month. Treated participants have higher consumption and lower debt but this
difference is never significant.


Finally, we check for heterogeneity in these effects, by the quintiles of take-up rates esti-
mated earlier. Specifically, we estimate equation 2 separately for each of those quintiles, for
all of the outcomes in Table 8 and Table 8. We use the bootstrap method of Chernozhukov
et al. (2018), both for obtaining point estimates and for inference. We do not find heteroge-
neous effects (it is not the case, for example, that some quintiles are benefiting from being
offered the treatment while others are not). In Figures A8 and A9 (appendix), we show this
for two outcomes of particular interest: business investment and household consumption
(for Phase 1 and for Phase 2 respectively).

6    Conclusions

Recent years have produced a wealth of exciting research on commitment problems, in-
cluding empirical work on the demand for commitment devices in developing countries.
In such work, it is often assumed that, if people are aware of their commitment problems,
they will welcome the opportunity to take commitment devices. But this need not be the
case: depending upon how they are designed, commitment devices can either serve to be
supportive and helpful, or can serve instead to patronise and infantilise. Many of us, for
example, welcome the implicit commitment in a Pay-As-You-Earn taxation system, or ap-
preciate that consumption taxes are deducted at the point of sale rather than at the end of
the year. Yet most of us would likely be appalled if the government were to send monthly
reminders to pay our taxes, or to offer to institute harsher penalties as a way to assist us to
pay our taxes on time. This basic fact has been long understood in the design of many com-
mitment devices. For instance, groups like ‘Alcoholics Anonymous’ or ‘Self-Management
and Recovery Training’ seek to provide commitment while at the same time maintaining
strong philosophies of respect and mutual support.


For this reason, the optimal design of commitment features remains an open question for
empirical research. This paper makes progress on that issue by testing the role of commit-
ment devices in microfinance in two distinct ways. We have done this in two distinct ways.
First, we test directly whether the rotating structure of a committee can be implemented
as an individual commitment-saving product. In previous pilot work, we established this
fact for small product sizes with daily repayments (Afzal et al., 2018); in this paper, we
show that the same structure can be used for a product with larger payments, over a longer
period. We find substantial demand for such a product. Many microfinance clients ‘borrow


                                              38
                                   Implicit and explicit commitment in credit and saving contracts


to save’ (Collins et al., 2009; Armendáriz and Morduch, 2010; Bauer et al., 2012; Kast and
Pomeranz, 2018; Afzal et al., 2018). But take-up is much higher for credit contracts than
for commitment savings contract. In addition, we find a significantly higher incidence of
repayment difficulties with commitment savings contract and a lower willingness of MFI
staff to enforce such contracts.


Second, we then add additional ‘behavioral’ features in the form of reminders (both for
respondents and for respondents’ peers) and in variation of repayment flexibility. Our de-
sign allows to compare how demand for these features varies between the saving and credit
domain. Our findings show that all these contract features are not valued by clients, on the
contrary, they appear to be actively disliked. These results have important policy implica-
tions for thinking about the future design of microfinance products. Specifically, our results
imply that microfinance institutions should not be seeking to build explicit commitment
features into their products — not because their clients have no demand for commitment
devices, but because that demand is already met through the regular repayment schedule
implicit in standard microfinance products.

This table reports the proportion of individuals whose take-up behaviour would contradict a standard model,
using two descriptive tests. Automatic refusers are omitted from these calculations.

                                            panel b: saving contracts




This figure shows the average take-up for the basic product (that is, the product with neither the ‘flex’/‘sunk’
variation nor the ‘self’/‘peer’ variation), and take-up for each of the eight possible variations. Error bars
show 90% and 95% confidence intervals on the difference in take-up to the basic contract. Stars indicate a
significant difference from take-up of the basic contract; that is, we reject a null hypothesis of equal take-up
rates for the ‘sunk’ variation and for the ‘sunk and peer’ variation, each at the 5% significance level.

                       panel b: take-up by contractual terms (payment and timing)




This figure shows the Group Average Treatment Effects, sorted by the take-up propensity estimated in the main text. In each figure,
the leftmost (black) lines for each group show the average probability of take-up across all contract types; note that these leftmost
lines are identical across figures (allowing for a different scaling of the vertical axis). In the top panel, the four subsequent lines in
each group (in color) show the average take-up across ‘flex’, ‘sunk’, ‘respondent reminders’ and ‘peer reminders’ respectively. In
the bottom panel, the six subsequent lines in each group (in color) show the average take-up across the six different variations on
contract payment and timing. For each category, the graphs show point estimates and 90% confidence intervals (both formed using
the bootstrap methodology proposed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018)).

This figure shows the rate of late repayment for the basic product (that is, the product with neither the
‘flex’/‘sunk’ variation nor the ‘self’/‘peer’ variation), and for each of the eight possible variations. Note that
we are here studying the rate of late repayment; that is, we use a linear probability model for having delayed
payment, for the subsample of observations where the respondent agreed to the contract. Error bars show 90%
and 95% confidence intervals on the difference in take-up to the basic contract. Stars indicate a significant
difference from the basic contract.

All the calculations in this Table are based on an OLS regression of take-up on all interactions between
reminder and commitment treatments. Interaction terms for payment week and interest rate are included
as controls. Standard errors clustered at the household level. We use ‘*’ to denote confidence at the 90%
level. For Panel 2A, p-values for pairwise tests come from OLS coefficient estimates. For Panels 2B and 2C,
p-values come from the relevant pairwise coefficient tests.

      Figure A5: Average take-up by behavioral variations: Pooled across credit and saving




This figure shows the average take-up for the basic product (that is, the product with neither the ‘flex’/‘sunk’
variation nor the ‘self’/‘peer’ variation), and take-up for each of the eight possible variations. Error bars
show 90% and 95% confidence intervals on the difference in take-up to the basic contract. Stars indicate a
significant difference from take-up of the basic contract; that is, we reject a null hypothesis of equal take-up
rates for the ‘sunk’ variation and for the ‘sunk and peer’ variation, each at the 5% significance level.

This table provides a cluster analysis of all the baseline covariates used for the machine learning analysis for Phase 2. Specifically,
we describe the characteristics of those respondents in the ‘most affected’ and ‘least affected’ groups, defined in terms of estimated
probability of adopting. We provide average characteristics, confidence intervals and a p-value on a test of equality of means (‘diff.
(p)’) using the methodology proposed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018).

                             take-up by contractual terms (payment and timing)




This figure shows the Group Average Treatment Effects, sorted by the take-up propensity estimated in the main text. In each figure,
the leftmost (black) lines for each group show the average probability of take-up across all contract types; note that these leftmost
lines are identical across figures (allowing for a different scaling of the vertical axis). The six lines in each group (in color) show
the average take-up across the six different variations on contract payment and timing. For each category, the graphs show point
estimates and 90% confidence intervals (both formed using the bootstrap methodology proposed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018)).
