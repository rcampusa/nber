                     the Term Structure
                     of Interest Rates




                         ABSTRACT




      There does not appear to be a general tendency for
long—term interest rates either to overreact or to underreact to
short—term interest rates relative to a rational expectations
model of the term structure. Rather, there appears to be some
tendency -f or markets to set long—term interest rates in terms of

a convention or rule of thumb that makes long rates behave as a

distributed lag, with gradually declining coefficients, o-f
short—term interest rates. People seem to remember the recent
past but blur the mare distant. In some monetary policy regimes
this convention implies overreaction, in others underreaction.

Introduction



       It   is   plausible that prices of long—term bonds and other
long—term assets would be heavily influenced by social
conventions or "rules of thumb". Investors may assume that

markets price long—term bonds roughly according to the convention
that their yield to maturity      will   be equal to their recent
memories of the level of short—term interest rates plus a

constant "risk premium." Such an assumption might be largely
self—fulfilling,, since people who believe the convention

characterizes market prices may act to make it do approximately
so -


       It   is also plausible that prices of long—term bonds are
influenced by changing perceptions unrelated to any such
mechanistic rule of thumb. Changing attitudes fashions,, public
confidence or beliefs would plausibly account also -f or some

unpredictable drift in long—term interest rates.
       Togetherc the conventional valuation rule and the
unpredictable drift notions might be regarded as Keynesian.

K:eynes said at one point that the long—term interest rate is "a

highly psychological phenomenon" and at another that it is
"highly conventional... .its actual value is largely governed by




                                   —-:—
the prevailing view as to what its value is expected to be.''
    The literature on efficient markets is widely interpreted as
providing evidence contrary to this conventional—psychological

view. If people are guided exclusively by convention or by
changing fashions or attitudes, then it seems likely that they
should create "profit opportunities" for others not blinded by

convention. The general impression in the profession from the
large literature testing + or market efficiency is that such

profit opportunities do not exist. Ironically, this general
impression persists even though there is no agreement about whic!2

efficient markets model is supported by the data.
     The Rational Expectations theory of the term structure of

interest rates with constant risk premium is the form of the

efficient markets models most widely cited with regard to
interest rates. The theory is a useful starting point from which
to describe the behavior of interest rates.2 Departures from the
theory are usually referred to in terms o-f time—variation a-F risk

premia. and showing how the expectations theory fails might also
be described as describing the behavior through time of the risk

premium. The expectations theory with constant risk premium has
had its ups and downs when tested with data. Sutch [1968].

mind the literature on multiple rational expectations

it will not be assumed that rules of thumb are strictly rational.
2. There are actually a number o-f variants a-f this theory with
similar implications for data. They will be unified in a
linearized model below.


                               —4-
Modigliani and Shiller [1973] and Sargent [1979] have claimed
evidence supportive of the theory. Later. however, it was
claimed that the theory could be rejected: Shiller [1979], Hansen
and Sargent [1981]..     I then claimed that long—term interest rates

appear to be too volatile to be in accordance with such simple
expectations theories. Vet the evidence for the claimed excess
volatility of long—term interest rates was itself criticized by
Flavin [1983]   [1984)   and others.. Moreover, it was claimed by
Campbell and Shiller [1984] and Mankiw and Summers [1984) that
recent U. S. long—term interest rates do not seem to overreact to
short—term interest rates.

     This paper will attempt to straighten out some of these
apparently conflicting claims, as well as to point to directions
for alternatives to rational expectations models. The simple
linearized expectations model will be described and compared with
the data. New in this paper are estimates of Modigliani—Sutch
equations, characterizing in simple terms how long and short
rates are related, -for   a   number of sample periods and two
countries. This gives us a better picture o-f     the   robustness of
the relation, and enables us to view it under different monetary
policy regimes. Some notions of uoverreactionu of long—term
interest rates to short rates will be studied, and estimates and
standard deviations of the extent of overreaction or
underreaction will be presented for the various sample periods..

This puts on a surer footing some comparisons made by Sutch
[1967) and Modigliani and Shiller [1973].      Finally,   an attempt



                                  —
will be made here to determine whether the reliance on a
conventional valuation formula or the component of long rate
unrelated to lagged shDrt rates might be considered the reason

that the slope of the term structure gives wrong signals as to
the course of future interest rates,




        It is important first to clarify in what sense the long rate
is actually described by the sort of convention mentioned above.
Modigliani and Butch (1966] were the first to show that the
long—term interest rate might well be described as a simple
distributed lag on short—term interest rates, or, in terms of the
annual data used in this paper:':

                      4             (1)

where         is the n—period rate (yield to maturity in percent on




3. In this paper with its annual data I shall estimate
distributed lags that include the current and four lagged values,
approximately the same total lag length as Modigliani and Butch
(1966] used with their quarterly data. Throughout this paper the
term "short rate" and "one—period rate" will be used
interchangeably, though in the data sets the short rates are not
exactly one—year rates.

at time t, C is a constant term and u. is an error term
uncorrelated    with current and lagged short   rates.   In   their
estimates of the quarterly analogue of (1) they imposed an
Almon fourth—order—polynomial distributed lag on all
coefficients except the -first, which was unconstrained. In their
estimates for 1952 first quarter to 191 fourth quarter, the
estimate   of    was CL32,.   and the sum of all the coefficients (
  O,.,16 was 099. or virtually one. The pattern of distributed
lag coefficients after (was hump shaped, with comparatively
small values for interest rates corresponding to lags of less
than a year or more than three years, and the largest values for
lags of about two years.

     Modigliani and Sutch interpreted this distributed lag as
representing the combined effect of two different expectations
mechanisms for future short—term interest rates. A regressive
expectations mechanism would make expected future short rates a

moving average (with positive weights that decline exponentially
with increasing lag) of current and lagged short rates. An

extrapolative   expectations mechanism would make the expected
change in short—term interest rates a moving average with

positive weights (that decline with lag) o-f current and lagged

changes in short—term interest rates. The combination of both

mechnisrns might produce, they argued, the pattern of distributed

lag   coefficients   that they found in their estimates. They     did
not refer to "rational expectations" (actually they referred to
Keynes 11936]) in motivating these mechanisms, so it seems that
they were at that time referring to habits of thought or

conventions people use to formulate expectations.
       The original Modigliani—Sutch relation was expanded further
by Modigliani and Shiller [1973] to allow for a separate effect
of real interest rates and o-f   inflation   on long—term interest

rates.     This two—distributed—lag equation was incorporated as the
basic term structure equation in    the MIT—Penn—SSRC Econometric

Model of the United States. The     out of sample performance of

this   equation has been good (see Shiller—Campbell—Schoenholtz
[1983].)
       Estimates of equation (1) for data sets other than those
used by Modigliani and Sutch appear in Table 1. The various
sample periods used here were chosen with the idea of looking

separately at various monetary policy regimes (see Appendix) in
two countries, the U.S. and the UK. There is a       very   substantial

amount   of data used here that is out of the    sample used by

Modigliani   and Butch [1966]. Here, the estimates are produced by

ordinary    least squares, without the Almon constraint. With these
annual data, the multicollinearity that necessitated a procedure
like the Almon is less of a problem
       While these estimates do not show evidence of the

extrapolative expectations hypothesized by Hodigliani and Sutch'
it does appear indeed that for widely different sample periods
and -For two different countries there is some consistency in the

pattern of response of long rates to short rates. In all cases.,

the estimated coefficients (L        are positive.. In all cases the

distributed lag has an exponential appearance, gradually tailing
off. In several estimates1 the last coefficient           is larger
than the rest, suggesting that the last coefficient is proxying
for omitted further lags.

      There are, however, some differences in response patterns
across sample periods.. The more recent data sets show a much
higher R—squared than do the pre—depression data sets, that

represented gold—standard monetary regimes. The pre—depression
data -for-   the   U. K., where the dependent variable is the British
Consol yield, are conspicuously different in that the sum of the

U. S. data sets..

      One might note that the Durbin—Watson statistic in these
regressions is uniformly low, meaning that we ought not to trust
the t—statistics from the regression. Phillips and Pippenger
[1979] siezed upon this fact to criticize Modigliani and Butch

[1964] and Modigliani and Shiller £19733.. They found that with
their quarterly U. S. data from 1955 to 1971 i-f one

first—differences the data4 both long and short rates, and runs a
similar regression, the coefficients of lagged short rates are
significant at the 17. level only if           corporate   yields are used.

They reported that the lagged interest rates were not significant
at the 5% level if treasury yields were used. However, their
results with the treasury data still show a distributed lag

pattern that was similar to that estimated with corporate

yields.   In all of the regressions shown in Table 1,, the

coefficient      o-F   the   short rate lagged a year is significant at
the 5% level   whether       a Cochrane—Orcutt serial correlation was
used or whether the data were first differenced prior to running

an ordinary least squares regression. Similarly., coefficient IL,
was significant at the 5% level in half of these regressions.6
     The original Modigliani—Sutch relation can also be
interpreted in terms of the spread between the long interest rate
and the short rate. Subtracting the current short rate from both
sides of the Modigliani—Sutch equation, one finds that the spread
depends negatively on the current short rate and positively on a
distributed lag of short rates The R squared in this
transformed regression is usually quite high (see the R' squared
shown in Table 1..) Thus, the spread shows a distinct tendency to

be negative when the current short rate is below a sort of

were presented in Table I because the former allows us to make an
argument in the context of a rational expectations model that the
expected values of the coefficients are unaffected by omission in

average of lagged short rates and to be positive when the current
short rate is above the average of lagged short rates. The sum
of the coefficients in the trans-formed regression is often about

zero,, indicating that the level of short interest rates has

little effect on the spread. If we added a constant to all of
the short rates over the last 5 years. the prediction for the

spread would be nearly unchanged..
     The changes across sample periods in the relation of long
rates to short rates documented in Table 1 might be justified in
terms of the rational expectations theory o-F the term structure

if the time series properties of short rates had changed

appropriately across sample periods. Whether the distributed lag
coefficients like those in table 1 are consistent with the

rational expectations theory of the term structure has been the
subject of discussion for some time, starting with Richard
Sutch's Ph.D. dissertation [1967]. and my own Ph.D..
dissertation [1972]. and then with Modigliani and Shiller [1973].
Sargent [1979]. Hansen and Sargent [1981] and others. However.
these authors did not investigate whether broad changes in the
time series properties of the short rate across sample periods
could account for the changes in the relation between the long
rate and the short   rate..

Structure of Interest Rates


       linearized version of the expectations theory a-f the term

structure of interest rates -for   coupon bonds was presented   in

Shiller f 1972] and Modigliani and Shiller [1973] and developed

further in Shiller [1979] Shiller Campbell and Schoenholtz
[1983] and Campbell and Shiller [1984). The underlying
assumption of this linearized expectations theory is that
long—term interest rates (yields to maturity) on coupon bonds not
far from par can be written as a weighted average of expected
future short—term interest rates with more weight on the interest
rates less far in the future.      In the extreme case of a consol.,

whose maturity is infinite., the long rate is a weighted average

of all future short—term rates! with weights which decline
geometrically into the future. The conventional assumption in
the literature testing the expectations theory of the term
structure had been that the long—rate is an unweighted average of
expected future short rates. This conventional assumption is

really appropriate as an approximation only for relatively
short—term bonds and could of course not be used to study
cansols which are part of the data for this paper.
     It is helpful to write the expectations theory of the term
structure with the   help of   the concept of duration (Macaulay



                                 — ij-) —
E1938]).. The duration o-f            a   bond is a

discount—factor—times--payment—weighted average of all the times
to payments of a bond. It is supposed to give a better measure
of how long—term a bond is than does the time to maturity.. The

formula gives less weight to the coupons and principal which
occur far into the future because these contribute relatively

less to price today, as they are heavily discounted. For par

coupon bonds whose yield to maturity in percent is r. Macaulay's
duration is:



(2)                    Dn =    (ig")/(ig)
Where g=1/(1+r) and where n is the number of periods to maturity
o-F the bond.7 Thus, the duration of a consol (nap) is not
infinite but equals (1+r)/r. The duration of very long—term
bonds is just less than (1+r)/r. For example, i-f r = 57. then a

conso].   has a duration of          2(1 years and a 25 year bond has a

duration      of   15 years. Indeed, we would expect its price or yield
to resemble somewhat those of consols.
        The linearized expectations theory o-f the term structure o-F

interest rates is then:



                               n—i
                        (l/D

7.    The rate r is expressed as a proportion per period, while
interest   rates in the data used in the tables are in percent per
annum.

Where Et denotes expectation conditional on all information
publicly available at time t.                is a risk or liquidity premium

which is assumed constant through time.8 In this formula, each
future one—period rate is given weight corresponding to the
contribution to total duration o-f the time period to which it

applies. Since time periods further into the future have less
contribution to duration, the short rates corrsponding to these
time periods will be given less weight. Equation 3 can be
motivated in a number o-f ways. One is by linearizing the present
value formula for coupons and principal (discounted by
       (0)
EtRt
             -   -   .   )   around r.

       ccompanying the model are various expressions for
linearized holding period yields and forward rates, so that
(except for the constants ) all expected linearized holding

period yields equal the spot rate of the corresponding maturity
and all linearized forward rates equal the corresponding expected
spot rates (see Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz E1983] where
the accuracy o-f the linearizations was also studied). These
linearizations allow us to interpret the expectations model in
various ways without encountering the "Jensen's inequality"

problems emphasized by Cox, Ingersoll and Ross E1981] problems



B. We might call    a "rolling risk premium" since it relates to
the difference between the long rate and a rolling—over of short
rates. This will distinguish it -from the holding period risk
premia or forward rate risk premia with which it is often
confused. See Campbell and Shiller E19831

here, we need only the linearized one—period holding yield on

This formula is a linearization around r of the one—period

and the coupon. The one—period holding return is the return from
buying an n—period bond at time t, receiving its coupon between t
and t+i, and selling the bond at time t+i, when it is an
(n—i)—period bond. The model (3) implies that Etht =                       plus
a constant, or,, conversely, the latter (subject to a terminal
condition) implies the model (3). When maturities are distant as
with the long bonds in this paper there is no significant

distinction between the yield                  and Rt+i"'.. With
consols,, the two are of course identical. In each application of
the formula (4) in this paper, a single long—term bond yield will

      0+ course, the assumption that market forecasts of future
interest rates equal autoregressive forecasts is quite

restrictive, and could easily be rejected since long—term
interest rates cannot be explained perfectly by a distributed lag
on short—term interest rates.. However, if long rates are set in
accordance with (3) with more information than is contained in
the history of short rates, then it Follows        that   a theoretical
regression of long rates on a distributed lag of short rates will
show p. as the coefficient 0+
                                  r_1,    i=O....,4.

     One can thus evaluate the expectations model (3) by
estimating the autoregression (5) + or- the one—period rate and

then solving the system of equations (7) for the weights p1
i=O,._,4 and comparing these with the estimates of B., i=O.,. ..,4.

Except for sampling error, the two must be the same.. Such
estimates of p. i =   O,..,4.   + or the data sets of this paper

appear in Table 3 alongside the estimates of IL           We may say that
except for the very recent data sets, data set number one when
estimated through 1983 and data set number 2, the long—term
interest rate appear to overreact to short—term interest rates,

i.e.., p. tends to be less than the corresponding (1, i0... .,4.

     There is however reason to suspect that this procedure may
be biassed toward finding overreaction, at least in some o-f the

sample periods.. In both the recent U.. S. and U. K. regressions

2 is about one, suggesting that the characteristic equation
corresponding to the autoregression may have a root equal to
one.    It is well established that in the case of a simple

autoregression. with one lag only, if the coefficient            equals
1OO    the   ordinary least squares estimate of it will be biassed

downward. In      this   case, there is a bias in the method toward

finding spurious overreaction.9 There do not appear to be Monte
Carlo results that would tell us the extent of the bias for the
fifth—order autoregression used here.
       Those who studied whether the p. equal the          dealt with

this problem generally by imposing a unit root and estimating the
forecasting equation for short—term interest rates in
first—di-Fferenced form. The unit root was assumed in Modigliani

and Shiller [1973] and Campbell and Shiller [19833.10 Sutch
[1967] did not assume a unit root, but he proceeded the other

way, computing .         i1,..   ,5 from (7) and comparing these with the

estimates of        -From an autoregression.. His procedure appeared
to have an effect on these comparisons similar to that o-f

assuming the unit root.

       The problem of assuming the unit root is that it forces the
p. to sum to one. Imposing the unit root thus assumes the
conclusion that there is no overreaction as defined here. It



9.   similar point was raised by Mankiw and Shapiro [1985]
regarding Flavin's [1981] observation that consumption appears to
overreact to income
10.. Sargent [1979] and Hansen and Sargent (1981] also imposed the
unit root in their rather different procedures..

remains possible, however, that some other sort of overreaction
might be revealed with this procedure.. In Campbell and Shiller
[1983] overreaction was defined as that the L showed relatively
too much weight on the current short rate relative to short rates

lagged mare periods.
        As a way of exploring this possibility, the autoregressive
equations for the short rate in Table 2 were reestimated subject
to the constraint that E. = 1,     i.       e., a fourth order
autoregressive model + or the first difference of the short rate

was estimated.. Using (7) with p..' in place of p... the

coefficients p..' iO,4 were computed, and these also appear in
Table 3. 0+ course, we no longer find that there is overreaction
as defined above since the Ep..' =      1   by construction. It probably
makes sense to look at these estimated p..' only for the twentieth

century data, where short rates seem to show evidence o-f

nonstationarity. Here, the long rate appears to underreact to
the current short rate (confirming results in Campbell and
Shiller [1984]) and to put relatively too much weight or-i the

past.

        None of these methods readily allows f or any formal testing
of the model. We can look to see whether the estimated
coefficients (L are similar in appearance to the implied
coefficients p i0...,4. in Table 3. but we cannot tell directly
whether the difference is statistically significant. This
shortcoming of the procedure was rectified by Sargent [1979] who
showed how a likelihood ratio test can test the cross—equation

uncorrelated with R_<1 i=O,.,4. By the model (3) all
coefficients f. i = O,.....,4 should be zero (the short rates are in
the public information set at time t) and moreover the error
terms are serially uncorrelated.11 As a test o-f the model (3),
we may perform significance tests with the estimated values of
      j =               These tests may be regarded as "forward—filtered
tests" as defined by Hayashi and Sims [1983] of the model (3).

Such tests are much simpler to perform than the tests Sargent
[19791 and Hansen and Sargent [1981] performed tests that they
described as involving complicated nonlinear cross—equation
restrictions.. Their tests were much more complicated because




11. The t—test here may be unreliable in small samples, of
course. A simple example will illustrate why this may be a
problem. Suppose that the short rate is a first—order
autoregressive process with autoregressive coefficient h just
under one., and the long rate is equal to the short rate times
(1—g)/(1—hg).  If (8) were run truncating the distributed lag at
zero, then in finite samples f. will tend to be negative, falsely
suggesting that long rates tend to overreact to short rates.

their relatively short maturities, such a distinction may be more

important.

significance levels at which the expectations hypotheses can be
rejected by an F—test vary from .01 -For data set 3 to .26 for
data set 2 =    There does seem to be some evidence against the
expectations model here., although not always impressive evidence
judged -From the standpoint of conventional significance levels.
There seems to be a pattern -for the coefficients. Except for
data set 1 when estimated through 1983., the sum of the

coefficients f. i=0,... .4 is positive. Moreover, for each data
set the coefficient of the current short rate is negative, and
the sum of the lagged coefficients is positive. This pattern of
coefficients is crudely consistent (given the estimates of
equation (1)) with the notion that the excess return is explained
by the spread between the long rate and the short rate, as will
be discussed below.

       The results o-f the above regression can be interpreted in

terms of an overreaction or underreaction a-F long rates to short
rates.    Call j.

which the long rate "overreacts" to                                  Then it can be
shown that, assuming the error term u in (1) is uncorrelated
with all current and lagged                             the following relation holds:

     It should be noted that the standard errors of the estimated

j. here may riot be trustworthy. One factor not accounted for
here is that while the error terms under the null are each

serially uncorreIated the assumption that cross correlations are
zero at other than zero lag does not follow from the model. And
of caurse any assumption about error terms under the alternative
hypothesis is lacking in motivation. Moreover there is also the

above—mentioned problem concerning applicability of asymptotic
distribution theory.
     The estimated forecasting equations + or the short rate in

Table 2 always have a negative value at one laq and this tends
to produce a small value of p1 compared to adjacent values of
p.. In other words there ought to be the extrapolative
expectations hypothesized by Modigliani and Sutch [1966) and the

absence of evidence for it in Table 1 here stands in
contradiction of the rational expectations model.

using equations (7)q in Table 3, the estimated p   i = O,..,4

implication a-f the rational expectations theory of the term

structure      is that relatively upward sloping term structures
(whern the long rate is greater than the short rate by more than
the usual term premium) ought to portend a subsequent increase in
interest     rates. Relatively downward sloping term structures
(where the long rate is less than the short rate plus the usual

term premium) ought to portend subsequent decreases in interest
rates. The expectations model (3) allows us                                to   say this more

on the spread Rt                          Rt         should yield a positive slope
coefficient, equal to 1/(D—1).1 It is easy to see why the
correct      formulation must look                     like this. Let us suppose to
simplify the argument that the term premium                                     in the model (3)

is zero, so that expected returns on both long and short debt
must be the same, and suppose that the bond is a consol. If the
long rate is above the short rate, there must be a capital loss
to offset the higher current yield an long bonds, if the high
yield is not to indicate a relatively higher expected return on
the long bond. A capital loss of course means a rise in

long—term      interest rates.
        It   was Franca Modigliani who -first pointed out to me that

the -fact is just the opposite: when long—term interest rates are
above short rates the long—term interest rate shows a tendency to

decline subsequently rather than rise. Thus, when long rates are
relatively high there tends to be a subseqent capital gain on
long bonds which further augments their higher current yield.. As
far as I can tell, this fact had not been documented before.14
     I showed evidence for this fact for a number of sample
periods (Shiller [1979]) and the fact was further confirmed in

Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz (1983], Campbell and Shiller
[1984], and Mankiw and Summers [1984]. Table 6 shows the
regressions for the data sets used in this paper.. The
t—statistics presented in Table 6 are not the usual t—statistics
but are for the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the
spread is 1/(D n—1)

     This perverse behavior of the term structure relative to the
expectations hypothesis could be due to the way the long rate
responds to the short rate, as estimated in Table 1, or it could
be due to noise in the long rate series that is unrelated to the
history of short rates.. To decide which, the spread       —

      was decomposed into two components: that corresponding to

the fitted value in the regressions of Table 1 and the residuals
of Table 1. Regressions of excess returns on these two variables
appear in Table 7. We see that both variables play some role.

The coefficients of the fitted spread greater than one indicate
that the pattern of reaction of long rates to short rates is part
of the reason the shape of the term structure gives wrong signals



14. This observation was made by Macaulay [1938] p. 33, who,
however, did not document it or emphasize it.

as to the future course o-f interest rates
         Mankiw and Summers [19841 looked at regressions of changes
in long rates on the long—short spread f or evidence for a

different notion of overreaction.. For them., overreaction occurs

if long—term bounds are priced in accordance with (3) but with

too short a duration, i e., with a duration less than implied by
the actual maturities and average levels o-f interest rates. They
pointed out that this sort o-f overreaction could never explain
the wrong sign of coefficient o-f the spread variable in
regressions like those in Table 6 here-

         in contrast, the wrong sign o-f the coefficient of the spread

variable could in the recent sample periods instead be due to the
sort of underreaction defined above in that the long rate reacts
relatively too much to the past and too little to the current
short rate. In those cases where Zf3. z 1 the spread variable
tends to be high when short rates are low relative to their
average level over the preceding few years. If long rates were
to tend to increase subsequently, as the expectations model would
predict, then given the fact that long rates tend to behave like
a moving average of short rates, it would have to be the case
that the short rate tends to increase substantially at such a

time..     In fact it does riot..

         An extreme caricature for the U.. S. data would be that the

long—term interest rate is a moving average of the short rate
with exponentially decaying weights that sum to one:




                                    —   26 —
             Rt   =   (1—h)    h'R     -

                                     t—1
                              10

I-f   this   is the case, then the change in the long rate                        —

         equals (1—h)(R+1'> —                         For this to be positively

correlated with the yield spread                                it would have to be
the case that when the short rate is below the long rate (or-

equivalently below its recent average value as defined by the
moving average) it would have to tend to be above it the

following year        in factq the short rate is more persistent than
that and tends to stay on the same side of the long rate                    The
caricature would be more realistic i-f we added a transient error

term (representing an exogenous drift of long rates unrelated to
short rates) to the above equation, another factor which would

tend to make for a wrong sign in the regression of the change in
the long rate on the spread_




       It was shown in Shiller [1979] that the model (3) for n=w
implies that, for a given variance of ht there is a lower bound

to the possible variance of                      A high variance of ht can only
be justified i-f there is enough variation in short term interest
rates themselves.         The variance inequality was extended



15 Analogous variance inequalities were also used to evaluate
the cnodel that corporate stock prices equal the present value at


                                           4-
for!nally to   the   finite n case in Shiller [1981].            In   the   present
notation   this is:

  -
(1t)       var(R
                   (1) )   a   var(h (n) )IDn (g 2

where D(g2) =        (i_g2fl)/(ig2). When           sample variances were

substituted into (9> then the inequality was found generally to

be violated for g in the relevant range as is verified for all
of the data sets of this paper. Table 8.. Rejection a-f the

expectations model for violation o-F this inequality was
criticised by Flavin [1983] [1984] and others on the grounds that

small sample properties of the estimates of these variances may
be unreliable. This criticism of the use of this inequality is
certainly valid, especially with regard to more recent interest

rate data that seem mare likely to show nonstationarity.. The
violation of the variance equalities only show., as I originally

noted that the variability of changes in long—term interest
rates can only be reconciled with the expectations theory o-f

anticipated    variance o-F      short   rates was much higher than the
historical variance This is true as well for the i9th century
data

       My concern here is merely to judge which component of the
long rate accounts -f or the violation of this inequality in the

data sets used hers. Table 8 also shows standard deviations f or
the various data sets in this paper of the excess return computed


a constant discount rate of expected future dividends, Shiller
[1981] and LeRoy and Porter [1931].

of the regressions o-f Table 1. Clearly the fitted values violate
the inequalities too..




Conclusion



     This paper began with the plausible notion that a
conventional valuation rule -for long term bands causes their

yields to behave as a sort a-f moving average of lagged short

rates. If people are relying on their memories to price bonds,.
then it is plausible that they would blur the pastq and that the
distributed lag would have a simple form, as the roughly

e>ponential decay form estimated here.. Whether this is an
overreaction or underreactian depends on the stochastic
properties of the shart—-term interest rate..

     The sharpest contrasts are between the old historical data
and the most recent data. For the British data 1G28-193O     the
short rate seems to be quickly mean—reverting..   In this periods

it appears that the long—term interest rate overreacted somewhat
to short rates, and this caused excess volatility in long—term
interest rates.. With the recent U.. S.. data on the other hand

(whether the sample ends in 1979 or 194). there is not such
evidence a-F quick mean reversion in the short rate. One cannot
rule out either that there is substantial mean reversion or

alternatively that the aLltoreqressive forecasting equation has a



                                 —   —
unjt root1 should be estimated in first—differenced form, that
short rates are unstationary and have no mean to revert to.             If

one   assumes that short rates are mean reverting, as many a-f the
estimated equations without the imposition a-f the unit root
suggest, then the long—rate appears to have overreacted to short
rates in all but the most recent sample period. If one makes the
it root assumptiort it appears that the long rate was not
excessivly volatile       relative to the expectations theory of the

term structure and in fact underreacted to short rates. There
was   underreactian in     the sense that the long rate should have

reacted relatively more to the current short rate than the past

short rates.
       The tendency of lonq rates to rely too heavily on the past

rather   than current short rates accounts partly for the dramatic
failure of the slope o-F       the   term structure to predict changes in

ionQ—-term interest rates. ThLtS, for example, the term structure

tends to be      upward sloping when the short rate has dropped below
its   average value for the past -five or so years. Since the short
rate does not revert quickly above its average value over the
last five   or    so   years, the result   is that the long rate will be

subsequently lower, not higher as          the   expectations theory would

predict
     The dramatic failure in U S. data of the slope of the term
structure to predict the direction o-f future interest rates is
not due only to the underreaction noted above. The failure is
also   due to a component n-f the long--term interest rate (one might
suppose it a "fads" or "Fashions"       component or alternatively a
"time—varying   risk premium" component) that is mean—reverting and
unrelated to the history o-1      short rates. This component also
contributes   to the     high volatility of short—term holding yields
on   long--term bonds.
       The expectations theory.    however, is not completely without
value. The reaction of long—term interest       rates to   short term
interest rates appears to show some relation to the stochastic
properties o-f short rates. With the pre—depression British

series, the short rate appeared quickly mean—reverting and the
duration of the consol was much longer than with the other series
studied. Indeed the consol yield showed much less reaction to
short rates than did long yields in other periods. The notion
that bonds yields are determined strictly by some conventional
valuation formula without regard for the stochastic properties of
short rates is contradicted by these data        Instead, conventional
valuation seems to account for a bias in the behavior of long
rates relative to the expectations model, and does not alone
amount to a theory of the term structure.
