                                         ABSTRACT

We randomly assigned male migrant workers in Qatar invitations to a motivational workshop aimed
at improving financial habits and encouraging joint decision-making with spouses back home in
India.13-17 months later, we surveyed migrants and wives to estimate intent-to-treat impacts in
their transnationalhouseholds. Wives of treated migrants changed their financial practices, and
became more likely toseek out financial education themselves. Treated migrants and their wives
became more likely to make joint decisions on money matters. Treatment effects on financial
outcomes show potential heterogeneity, with those with lower prior savings saving differentially
more than those with higher prior savings.

1.   Introduction
     The dramatic recent growth of international migration means that increasing numbers of
households in the developing world have members working in other countries, and are therefore
engaged in transnational household finance. By this we mean household financial management
that faces the complexities of extended separation from important income earners, management
of international remittance transfers, and, often, large increases in household income.
     A better understanding of financial decision-making in transnational households –
households with one or more migrant members – is practically important due to the large
increases in income afforded by international migration (see, among others, Clemens et al. 2009
and Clemens 2011) and the large size of migrant remittance flows to developing countries. In
2012, migrant remittances sent to developing countries amounted to US$401 billion.2
     A number of governments and international financial institutions are exploring policies to
facilitate remittance flows and to enhance their impacts on the economic development of
migrants’ home countries.3 However, there is currently limited empirical evidence on the impact
of many types of policies related to migrants and remittances. Promoting savings accumulation
in transnational households is a common objective, as it is often found in observational studies
that households receiving international remittances have high consumption levels, but do not
have substantially higher savings than the general population (Adams 1991, Acosta et al 2005).4
Low savings may be a matter of concern at the household level if migrants are overseas on
temporary labor contracts, since savings is central to strategies for ensuring that consumption
does not return to pre-migration levels after migrants return.5
     We shed light on the impact of a simple intervention that is commonly carried out among
migrant workers in destination countries. In a population of male migrant Indian workers in
Qatar, we randomly assigned invitations to a motivational workshop aimed at improving their

  Policy-oriented publications include Pew Hispanic Center (2002), Terry and Wilson (2005), and World Bank
(2006, 2007). Yang (2011) reviews recent research on the economics of migrant remittances.
4
  Clemens and Tiongson (2013) find in a natural experimental context that international migration of a household
member does not raise savings levels in migrant source households in the Philippines. Ashraf et al (2013) find in a
randomized study that improving monitoring and control by migrants leads to higher savings in the home country.
5
  Of course, investment in human or enterprise capital in the household can also help achieve higher living standards
post-migration. For evidence on human capital and enterprise investment in migrant households, see (among others),
Massey and Parrado (1998), Cox-Edwards and Ureta (2003), Taylor et al (2003), Woodruff and Zenteno (2007), and
Yang (2008). Stark et al (1997), Dustmann and Kirchkamp (2002), Mesnard (2004), and Yang (2006) focus in
particular on investments tied to return migration.

                                                                                                                   1
financial habits (with a particular focus on savings), and at fostering joint decision-making with
their wives back home in India. Our randomized methodology allows us to credibly estimate the
causal impact of the treatment. Outcome variables come from a survey of migrants and wives
that we implemented 13-17 months post-treatment. We estimate impacts on financial practices,
savings goals, joint decision-making over financial matters, and financial outcomes (savings and
remittances) in these transnational households.
    Because the decision to attend the workshop is endogenous, and because the treatment also
led migrants to engage in other types of financial education (such as listening to a financial
education radio show), we focus on intention-to-treat (ITT) effects that compare the entire
treatment group with the entire control group. We also explore heterogeneity in treatment effects
vis-a-vis key baseline (pre-treatment) migrant characteristics: 1) savings, 2) years of working
abroad, 3) annual income, and 4) whether the migrant is the sole decision-maker on money
matters in the household.
    This paper is related to the growing body of work examining the relationship between
financial education and financial decision-making. Financial education has been shown to be
associated with the quality of financial decision-making, in both observational and randomized
experimental studies, in developed-country contexts.6 Randomized studies of the impact of
financial education interventions have been carried out in developing country populations,
several of which find impacts on business practices of micro-entrepreneurs, while impacts on
household and individual decision-making are typically more muted.7
    Two recent randomized studies of financial education interventions among migrant
populations are complementary with ours. Gibson, McKenzie, and Zia (2012) randomly assigned
financial education training targeted at improving migrant remittance decision-making, and find
limited impacts. They do not examine impacts on households in the home country. Doi,
McKenzie, and Zia (2012) randomly assigned financial education training immediately prior to
Indonesian migrants’ departure for overseas. Doi et al. (2012) distinguishes between the impacts
of training migrants alone, family members alone, or migrants and family members together.

training on micro-entrepreneurs, while studies of impacts on individuals include Carpena, Cole, Shapiro, and Zia

Impacts examined are on the home-country family alone, not the migrants. They find that
training of migrants and family members is most effective and has positive impacts on financial
practices and on savings, while training of migrants alone does not affect families back home.
Our paper is distinguished from these previous studies in two key ways. First, the intervention
we study is aimed at motivating migrants to change specific behaviors (e.g., savings, joint
decision-making), rather than at systematically imparting financial knowledge. Second, we
survey both migrants and their spouses remaining behind in the home country; we therefore can
examine behaviors of both parties as well as outcomes (such as total savings) for the
transnational household as whole.


2. Background, Sample, and Description of Intervention
    A. Background on international migration to Qatar
    The State of Qatar has a sizeable migrant population, particularly from South and East Asia
(Kapiszewski 2006). Approximately 90 percent of the population in the country age 15 or older
was foreign born in 2010, making it the nation with the highest share of immigrants in the
world.8
    Migration to Qatar and to neighboring countries is typically temporary, with work contracts
stipulating the duration of stay (Shah 2008). These contracts are usually for two years and some
may extend to five years, renewable at the discretion of the employer. Only workers earning
incomes above a minimum level are allowed to bring their dependents with them; in Qatar, the
figure was QR 8,000 a month in 2010, the equivalent of US$26,300 annually.9
    Keralites made up more than half of Indian migrants to the Gulf in the 1990s (Prakesh 1998).
Results from the population-representative 2011 Kerala Migration Survey indicated that 17.1
percent of households in Kerala, India received remittances, and remittances were estimated to
make up 31 percent of the state’s net GDP (Rajan and Zachariah 2011).




8
  The fraction of foreign born was computed from Qatar’s 2010 census, undertaken by the Qatar Statistical
Authority. Qatar’s total population in April 2010 was 1.7 million. The country ranked at the top of immigration
countries in 2010 (measured by the population share of immigrants) based on data published in the Migration and
Remittances Factbook 2011.

  The Qatari Riyal (QR) is pegged to the US dollar. One US dollar is equivalent to QR 3.65.

     B. Sample, Baseline Survey, and Follow-up Survey
     The sample consists of married, male migrants working in Doha, Qatar whose wives
remained in Kerala, India. The sample restriction to married couples reflects our interest in
decision-making within transnational households.
     A baseline survey took place between August and November 2010 with migrant interviews
taking place in person, while interviews with his wife were conducted over the phone. A total of
232 couples were interviewed at baseline. After the baseline surveys were completed, the survey
firm was provided with a list of randomly selected migrant subjects to contact and invite to
attend a financial strategies workshop held at the end of November 2010. Out of the sample of
232 male migrants, 157 were assigned to the treatment group.10 The migrant subjects were
encouraged to attend the workshop and told it was exclusively organized for them in appreciation
of their participation in the baseline survey. Apart from the dinner provided, there was no other
compensation for attendance. See Appendix 1 for the invitation script.
     Follow-up surveys occurred over a year after the baseline surveys, between December 2011
and April 2012. A total of 202 follow-up surveys were completed and we then dropped two cases
where the migrant reported having divorced his wife prior to the follow-up survey.11 In both
survey rounds, detailed data were collected from the migrant and his wife on demographics,
financial behaviors, savings goals, savings and remittances. Savings and remittances reported
separately by migrants and wives in the follow-up survey are of course not identical; we
reconcile differences by simply taking the average of the migrant and wife reports of these
variables. See Appendix 4 and 5 for more details about the sample design and variable
definitions, respectively.
     Baseline summary statistics are presented in Table 1. The sample is limited to the 200
couples that completed the follow-up survey. The mean time the migrant spent working overseas
was 11.8 years. Average annual income in Qatar was the equivalent of 313,746 Indian rupees
(INR) or US$6,175 and mean annual remittances sent home was INR 133,967 (US$2,637).12

10
   Originally, each subject was assigned with 50% probability to the treatment. Initial indications were that many
subjects would not be able to attend the workshop due to schedule conflicts. Because we had promised the workshop
speaker a certain number of attendees, some of the remaining subjects were also randomly assigned to treatment,
each with 1/3 probability. Each study participant therefore had a 2/3 probability of being in the treatment group.
11
   One got divorced during March 2011 and was in the control group and the other migrant divorced in November
2011 and was in the treatment group.
12
   When converting from Indian rupees to US dollars, we use an average of the daily US-Indian rupees exchange
rate from Jan 1st to April 18th, 2012, when US$1 = 50.81 INR.

                                                                                                                4
Average personal financial savings of the migrant held in Qatar and India was the equivalent of
INR 121,687 (US$2,395). Financial savings is the sum of cash in hand, bank and postal account
balance, chitty fund (ROSCA), life insurance and pension plan contributions, gold holdings
valued at the monthly retail price per gram at the time of the interview, market value of stocks
and other forms of savings.13 The migrant was also asked to report on savings held jointly with
his wife, which averaged INR 10,587 (US$208). About 37 percent of the migrants stated that
they were saving regularly. In India, the household’s annual income (excluding members
overseas) averaged INR 5,556 (USD 109). Average years of schooling were slightly higher for
wives, at 11.7 years compared to 10.2 years for husbands. On average, wives reported INR
206,322 (US$4,061) in financial savings.14 Mean joint savings held with the migrant as reported
by the wife was INR 6,910 (US$136). 47 percent of wives reported that they saved regularly.
     We proceed to confirm whether randomization achieved the goal of balance in terms of pre-
treatment variables. Orthogonality tests for control versus treatment group are examined in Panel
A for all 18 baseline variables and a variable measuring duration between the baseline and
follow-up survey, and in Panel B for the indicator variables used in examination of
heterogeneous treatment effects. With some exceptions, baseline variables for the treatment
group are well balanced in all samples (see p-values in column 6 of Table 1). The exceptions are
that the migrants in the treated group are more likely to be older, have worked abroad longer and
have older wives. Attrition from the baseline to follow-up survey was 13.8%, and is uncorrelated
with treatment status (Appendix Table 1, column 1). We regressed a dummy variable for not
being included in the final (N=200) sample on the treatment indicator and a full set of baseline
controls examined in Table 1 (excluding the variable for months between baseline and follow-
up, which is missing for attrited observations). Separately, we also regressed an indicator
variable for migrants who were surveyed by phone for the follow-up survey and found it to be
uncorrelated with treatment status (Appendix Table 1, column 2).
     C. The Intervention
     In contrast to programs typically studied in financial education research more generally, the
intervention we study here is quite short in duration, at just a few hours in a single session. The

   Wives held relatively more of their savings in the form of gold, averaging 88.7 grams that was valued at INR
177,400 in December 2010.

                                                                                                                     5
intervention should therefore be thought of more accurately as a motivational workshop aimed at
altering the financial habits of participants, rather than an extended course intended to improve
financial literacy or knowledge.15
     The workshop was conducted in late November 2010, after the baseline surveys were
completed. It was held on a Friday evening by Mr. K.V. Shamsudheen (henceforth KVS). KVS
is originally from Kerala and heads the Pravasi Bandhu Welfare Trust, a UAE-based entity
registered in Kerala, India.16 KVS had been offering motivational sessions on improving
financial habits in the UAE for over a decade, targeting migrants from Kerala. As of late 2010,
he was starting to offer similar workshops in Qatar, typically at the request of a Kerala migrant
association. KVS also has a weekly Malayalam radio program advising callers on financial
matters, which is broadcast from Dubai, UAE and accessible in Qatar. We invited KVS to run
the workshop in Qatar to which our treatment group was invited. The workshop was held for our
study participants only.
     The workshop’s central theme was the importance of setting in place a plan for savings
accumulation that would allow migrants and their families to maintain higher living standards
after the migrants returned home to Kerala. In support of that objective, the workshop covered
topics such as creating and following a budget for both migrant and the household in India,
making financial planning a consultative family exercise, setting aside money from remittances
to save regularly, and the pros and cons of various investment options. The speaker also exhorted
the audience to use time wisely, have a positive attitude towards work and life, establish good
work ethics and lead a healthy life. The workshop was conducted in an interactive manner with
substantial audience participation. For example, the speaker at one point asked audience
members to stand and take a pledge to lead a healthier lifestyle, and in particular to stop
smoking. The entire workshop lasted approximately five hours (3 hours for the workshop itself
and 2 hours for the subsequent dinner). For further details, see Online Appendix 2.
     The workshop was held on a weekend night (Friday) to maximize take-up, in a conference
room at a hotel chosen so that it was accessible by public transportation in a commercial area
popular with South Asian migrants. 41.0 percent of the migrants in the treatment group (55 out

   The education session on remittances studied in Gibson et al (2012) was similarly brief, lasting for just two hours.
The program studied by Doi et al (2012) was more extensive, lasting for 18 hours over two days for migrants and
eight hours over two days for migrant family members.

of 134) attended the workshop. In addition, 3.0 percent of the control group (2 out of 66) showed
up to the workshop (presumably because of some informational spillover from treated
individuals) and were allowed to attend.


3.   Empirical Results
     The treatment (the invitation to the motivational workshop) was randomly assigned, allowing
us to estimate the causal impacts with the following simple equation:
                          𝑦!" = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡! + 𝜹′(𝑿𝒊𝒕!𝟏 ) + 𝜖!" ,                                      (1)
where i indexes a migrant household, yit is the post-treatment outcome of interest, Treatmenti is

an indicator for being invited to the workshop and Xit−1 is a vector of baseline (pre-treatment)

characteristics of the migrant and his wife in Kerala. The coefficient of interest is β which
represents the intent to treat (ITT) effect of the workshop invitation (rather than attendance). The
ITT estimate is of greatest interest in most contexts, where financial education is voluntary and
cannot be required for the migrant population.17 The inclusion of Xit−1 controls for a range of

baseline variables related to the migrant’s and his household’s pre-treatment characteristics that
might by chance be correlated with treatment in spite of randomization, and also helps improve
precision of the estimated treatment coefficient. The baseline control variables are those
examined in Table 1. We report robust (Huber-White) standard errors in all cases.
     We examine a large number of outcomes in the follow-up survey, which raise the likelihood
of finding statistically significant effects due to chance. To deal with concerns about improper
inference in multiple hypothesis testing, we follow Katz, Kling, Liebman and Katz (2007) and
Karlan and Zinman (2010) to produce summary indices for domains of related outcomes and test
for treatment effects using these indices. For example, we create an index of financial practices
for the migrant that averages together 11 measures covering planning of financial goals and
budgeting. Indices are constructed by first rescaling each component outcome so that higher
values correspond to more beneficial outcomes. Next, z-scores are calculated for each
component outcome by subtracting its control group mean and dividing by the control group
standard deviation. The summary index is an equally weighted average of z-scores of its
components. The treatment effect for the index would show where the mean of the treatment

  Our ITT estimates would likely represent lower bounds of the treatment effects of a mandatory financial education
program for migrant workers.

                                                                                                                 7
group lies in the distribution of the control group in terms of standard deviation units.
   We also examine heterogeneous treatment effects with respect to a number of baseline
characteristics of interest. The motivational workshop’s strong emphasis on savings suggests
examining impacts on migrants with low (at or below median) baseline savings. Median migrant
savings at baseline was INR 50,601 (roughly US$1,000). The workshop also encouraged
migrants to involve their families in financial decision-making. A migrant who was the sole
decision-maker on how money is spent or saved prior to the workshop (which is true for 36
percent of the migrants at baseline) may have higher responsiveness to the workshop advice.
   In addition, recent migrants may be more amenable to the workshop recommendations
compared to those who have spent an extended period of time working abroad with more
ingrained financial habits. We therefore test for heterogeneity in treatment effects for migrants
with low (at or below median) years of working overseas. The median years spent in
employment overseas was 8.4 years. We also examine whether treatment effects are
heterogeneous for migrants with high (above median) baseline income as they are in a better
position to accumulate savings relative to low income migrants. Median migrant annual income
at baseline was INR 313,746 (roughly US$6,275).
   In all results tables to follow, we present average intent-to-treat effects in Panel A, and
examine heterogeneous effects in Panels B and C. Panel B provides the simplest analysis of
treatment effect heterogeneity, by showing whether treatment effects are different across
subsamples of the data. Subsamples are defined by each value of these four baseline indicator
variables (a total of eight regressions for each dependent variable). Below each pair of estimated
treatment effects associated with a particular baseline variable (e.g., migrant savings), we report
the p-value of the F-test of the equality of the treatment effect across corresponding subsamples.
   In Panel C, we examine treatment effect heterogeneity simultaneously across all four
baseline indicator variables (in one regression per dependent variable). We interact the treatment
indicator with indicators for low migrant savings, low years of overseas work, high migrant
income, and an indicator that the migrant reports being the sole decision-maker on money
matters. A coefficient on an interaction term in Panel C is interpreted as the extent to which the
treatment effect is different when the baseline indicator variable is equal to one, controlling for
heterogeneity in treatment effects vis-à-vis the other baseline indicator variables. The analysis in
Panel C therefore deals (partially) with omitted-variable concerns that might cloud interpretation


                                                                                                      8
of Panel B’s results.18
     A. Take-up
     We first establish that the treatment affected the financial education activities of study
participants. In the first three columns of Table 2, we report results of regressions in the form of
equation 1, where the dependent variables are financial education activities engaged in by
migrants in Qatar and their wives in India. We first examine self-reported migrant attendance of
the KVS workshop held by our study in November 2010. In column 1, the dependent variable is
an indicator for the migrant attending the KVS workshop, as reported by the migrant in the
follow-up survey. The treatment effect estimate in Panel A indicates that the treatment led to a
large increase in the likelihood of attending the KVS session, amounting to 44.6 percentage
points. This is a nearly 15-fold increase over self-reported attendance in the control group (3.0
percent). This treatment effect on self-reported on KVS workshop attendance is very similar to
results from our administrative records on attendance at the November 2011 session. In Panels B
and C, we find no indication that the treatment effect on workshop attendance exhibits
heterogeneity with respect to baseline characteristics.
     It is of interest to examine whether the treatment also affected other types of financial
education. For example, attendance at the KVS seminar may have encouraged participants to
listen to KVS’s radio show, which could have reinforced the workshop messages. In addition,
migrants who were invited to but could not attend the KVS workshop could have listened to the
radio show instead. In column 2 of the same table, we examine the impact of treatment on an
indicator for having ever listened to the KVS radio show (reported in the follow-up survey). The
estimate in Panel A indicates that the treatment led to a 14.6 percentage point increase in the
likelihood of listening to the KVS radio show (statistically significantly different from zero at the
10% level), a substantial effect compared to the 40.9 percent radio show listening rate in the
control group.
     There does appear to be heterogeneity in the treatment effect on KVS radio-show listening.
In Panel B, the treatment effect is large, positive, and statistically significantly different from
zero for migrants with low savings and high years abroad, but smaller and not statistically
significantly different from zero for migrants in the corresponding other subsample (i.e. high

18
  An example of an omitted-variable concern in this context would be that a higher treatment effect for the low-
savings subsample simply reflects the fact that the low-savings subsample also has migrants who have been abroad
for fewer years (so that “low years abroad” is the more relevant dimension of treatment effect heterogeneity.)

                                                                                                                   9
savings and low years abroad). In each case, the treatment effects are found to be different across
corresponding subsamples at conventional significance levels. The pattern is confirmed in Panel
C, where all dimensions of heterogeneity are examined in one regression: the coefficients on the
interaction terms with low savings and low years abroad are, respectively, positive and negative,
and are both statistically significantly different from zero at the 5% level. These patterns, in
particular the heterogeneity with respect to low savings, may be relevant for explaining the
heterogeneity in treatment effects that we find for financial outcomes (in Table 3 below).
     It is also possible that migrants could have encouraged their wives in India to engage in
financial education activities. We examine in column 3 the treatment effect on wives’ attendance
of any financial education workshop in India (an indicator variable, reported by wives in the
follow-up survey). In Panel A, the treatment effect is positive and significantly different from
zero at the 10% level, indicating a 4.4 percentage point increase off a low base of 1.5% in the
control group. We find no evidence of heterogeneity across baseline characteristics in the
treatment effect on wife’s attendance of any financial education workshop (Panels B and C,
column 3).
     B. Financial practices and savings goals
     Given that the treatment did affect financial education activities (workshop participation and
radio show listenership), we turn to whether the treatment also affected the self-reported
financial practices and savings goals of study participants. In Panel A, we do find that the
treatment affected self-reported financial practices of the migrants’ wives (column 5), but not of
the migrants (column 4). The overall treatment effect on the financial practices index for the wife
is positive, large (0.2 standard deviation units) and significant at the 1% level. The treatment
effect on the wife’s financial practices does not exhibit substantial heterogeneity across baseline
characteristics (Panels B and C, column 5).19


19
   The estimated treatment effects for the component outcomes of the financial practices indices are presented in
Appendix Table 2 (for migrants’ responses) and Appendix Table 3 (for wives’). The set of variables is the same in
both tables, except for the very first variable in the migrant table (“Discussed and planned financial goals with
family in Kerala”) which was only asked of the migrant. We asked a series of questions during the follow-up survey
to the migrant, and separately to his spouse in India, related to management of their financial affairs. These cover
topics such as whether the migrant discussed and planned financial goals with the family in India and if either the
migrant or household in India worked on a budget plan as to how much to spend and save. In addition, we asked
couples to state how frequently they reviewed financial goals, made sure that expenses do not exceed what was
budgeted, spent less on one or more items if more was spent elsewhere, anticipated the size of future expenses and
encouraged family members to stick to a budget. There are no substantial impacts of note on migrant financial
practices. For wives, on the other hand, the treatment has a positive effect (that is statistically significant at the 5%

                                                                                                                      10
    In contrast to changes in financial practices, we found no statistically significant treatment
effect on the savings goals index of either migrants or wives (column 6 and column 7,
respectively). The savings goals index combines questions asked separately of the migrant and
wife on saving habits, hypothetical interest in a commitment saving account in India, satisfaction
with level of savings and the purpose of savings.20,21 There is some indication of treatment effect
heterogeneity for these outcomes in Panels B and C. In Panel B, the treatment effect for the
wife’s savings goal index is negative and statistically significant at conventional levels for
migrants with low savings and low income and not statistically different from zero in the
corresponding pairs. The treatment effect on the migrant’s saving goals index for the subsample
of migrants who are sole deciders at baseline is positive and significant at the 5% level and not
statistically significant for those who were not sole decision-makers. An F-test rejects the equality
of the treatment effects across these subsample pairs. The pattern is mostly confirmed in Panel C.
The coefficient on the Treatment * low years abroad interaction term is negative and significant
at the 5% level in the regression for the wife’s saving goals index, while the coefficient on
Treatment * migrant sole decider is positive and significant at the 5% level in the regression for
the migrant’s saving goals index.
    B. Joint decision-making
    The workshop advocated that migrants involve their families in financial decisions. In the
control group, joint financial decision-making in these transnational households is far from
universal: 27.3% of control group migrants say that they and their wives jointly decide on money
matters and 19.7% of control group wives say they and their migrant husbands both decide on
money matters.
    Treated migrants are 13.2 percentage points more likely to make decisions on money together
with wives (this coefficient is significant at the 10% level in column 8, Panel A of Table 2).
Wives concur with husband reports that they are now more likely to make joint money matters


level or greater) on the likelihood that wives report making a budget plan (column 1), save on a regular basis
(column 5), list anticipated expenses in advance (column 8), and encourage family in Kerala to follow a budget
(column 9).
20
   The hypothetical question to the migrant and his wife is whether they would be interested in a commitment saving
account in India that would help them save up for a particular purpose, where withdrawal is conditional on reaching
a target amount or date. The purpose for savings cover the following goals: buy land, buy or build a home, buy
vehicle, pay for children’s expenses, marriage expenses, emergencies, retirement and to start or expand a business.
21
   The impact of the workshop offer on component outcomes of the saving goals indices are presented in Appendix
Table 4 (for migrants’ responses) and Appendix Table 5 (for wives’).

                                                                                                                11
decisions with their husbands (column 9, coefficient statistically significant at the 10% level.)
The treatment effect on wife’s report of joint decision-making is larger in the low-savings than
the high-savings subsample (Panel B, difference significant at the 10% level); the corresponding
interaction term is positive (but only marginally statistically significant) in Panel C.
     C. Savings
     We now turn to effects of the treatment on financial outcomes reported in the follow-up
survey. First, we examine impacts on total transnational household savings (in Indian rupees) in
column 1 of Table 3. 22 Because outliers might have outsize influence on the results on financial
outcomes expressed in rupees, we also examine treatment effects on the inverse hyperbolic sine
transformation (IHST) of total household savings (column 2).23
     In Panel A, the treatment effect on total household savings is positive but not statistically
significantly different from zero in either the rupees or IHST specification.
     In Panel B, where we examine treatment effects in subsamples of the data, evidence for
treatment effect heterogeneity is strongest in the subsample split by baseline savings. Treatment
coefficients in columns 1 and 2 are positive in the low-savings subsample, and negative for the
high savings subsample. In both rupee and IHST specifications, equality of the treatment effects
across the low- and high-savings subsamples is rejected at the 5% level. (By itself, the treatment
effect in the low savings subsample is statistically significant at the 5% level in the rupees
specification.) There is also suggestive evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity vis-à-vis
baseline income: treatment effects are positive (negative) in the high-(low-)income subsample,
and an F-test rejects equality of the treatment effects across those subsamples in the IHST
specification.
     Panel C examines heterogeneity in treatment effects with respect to all four baseline
characteristics simultaneously. These results provide less clarity as to which baseline
characteristics may be driving treatment effect heterogeneity. Coefficients on the interaction
terms are all positive in sign but are mostly not statistically significantly different from zero. The
exception is the Treatment * low savings interaction term in column 1, which is positive and

22
   Total household savings reported by the migrant is the sum of the migrant’s own savings, joint savings and the
migrant’s estimate of his wife’s savings. Total household savings reported by the wife is the sum of wife’s own
savings, joint savings and the wife’s estimate of the migrant’s savings. We examine the average of the migrant and
wife reports of total household savings.
23
   The inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of yi is log(yi+(yi2+1)1/2). Interpretation is analogous to that of a
logarithmic dependent variable, without suffering the problem of being undefined at zero (Burbidge et al. 1988).

                                                                                                                  12
statistically significant at the 10% level. The fact that the heterogeneity in treatment effects vis-à-
vis baseline savings (seen Panel B) becomes less apparent when other dimensions of
heterogeneity are controlled for (in Panel C) suggests that other baseline variables (correlated
with savings) may be more fundamental sources of treatment effect heterogeneity.
     D. Remittances
     Impacts of the treatment on remittances sent by migrants to wives in India are also of key
interest.24 Results are presented in column 3 of Table 3 for annual remittances sent in rupees, and
in column 4 for the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of this variable. In Panel A, the
coefficient on treatment is negative in each regression, but both are small in magnitude and
neither one is statistically significantly different from zero.
     Panel B’s results reveal heterogeneity in the treatment effect on remittances. As in the
savings regressions, treatment effect heterogeneity vis-à-vis baseline savings is apparent.
Treatment effects are positive in the low-savings subsample, and negative in the high-savings
subsample. Three out of the four estimated treatment effects in these subsamples (across columns
3 and 4) are individually significant at the 5% level, and the fourth (remittances in rupees, in the
high-savings subsample) is nearly so. In both columns, we reject equality of treatment effects
across the low- and high-savings subsamples at the 1% level.
     There is also tentative evidence of heterogeneity with respect to baseline income and migrant
sole-decider status. Treatment effects are positive in the high-income and migrant-sole-decider
subsamples, and negative in their respective counterparts. For each of these subsample splits,
treatment effects are different across subsamples in at least one of the specifications at
conventional levels of statistical significance.
     In Panel C, where we examine all these sources of treatment effect heterogeneity
simultaneously, the same patterns identified in Panel B stand out as well. Across both the rupees
and IHST specifications of remittances, both low savings and migrant-sole-decider status are
associated (at conventional significance levels) with more positive treatment effects. High
income is also associated with more positive treatment effects, and statistically significantly so in
the IHST specification.25,26


24
   As in the analysis of household savings, we examine here the average of the migrant and wife reports of
remittances sent by migrants to wives.
25
   The negative and statistically significant main effect of treatment in Panel C is also intriguing, indicating that the
treatment reduces remittances for observations that have zero values of all the interacted baseline indicators (in other

                                                                                                                      13
4. Conclusion
    We randomly assigned invitations to a motivational workshop on improving financial habits
to migrant Indian workers in Qatar, and fielded surveys of both migrants and their wives
remaining behind in India to measure changes in financial decision-making in these transnational
households. We find that the treatment affects self-reported financial practices of the migrants’
wives (but not the migrants) and leads migrants to be more likely to make joint financial
decisions with their wives. The workshop was offered only to the migrant, so these results
provide evidence of cross-national impacts of a financial education program offered to just one
member of a transnational household.
    While there are no apparent average treatment effects on financial outcomes (savings and
remittances), we do find evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity vis-a-vis key baseline
characteristics. For example, low savings, high incomes, and migrant sole decision-making power
over household money matters are all associated with higher treatment effects on remittances sent
by migrants to wives.
    Treatment effects may have been negative in nontrivial subsamples of the data. In particular,
treatment coefficients are negative in the savings and remittances regressions for the high-savings
and low-income subsamples. In the remittance regressions, three out of the four negative
coefficients in these subsamples are statistically significantly different from zero at conventional
levels (and the fourth is marginally statistically significant). We advance no theory as to why
treatment effects might be positive or negative in particular subgroups. While the negative
coefficients were unexpected, we simply note that, as a conceptual matter, individuals could
respond to an intervention such as the one we implemented by modifying their financial decision-
making in either direction. Behavioral responses to informational or motivational interventions
may in general depend on prior circumstances, attitudes, or information sets, so that the same
intervention could lead to very different (and even directionally opposing) responses within a
heterogeneous subject population. In our study context, high-savings individuals could have
concluded from the intervention that their savings and remittances exceeded optimum levels,
perhaps due to the informational content of the session or via interpersonal comparisons with

words, observations with high savings, high years abroad, low income, and migrants who are not sole deciders).
However, we do not highlight this result since there are only 12 observations with this combination of
characteristics.
26
   We also examine impacts on expenditures and loans. Results are in Appendix Table 6. There is no large or
statistically significant impact on either expenditures or loans, reported by either migrants or wives.

                                                                                                                 14
other workshop participants. Reducing subsequent savings and remittances would then be a
natural response.27
     Future work in this vein could seek to shed light on the underlying reasons behind the patterns
of treatment effect heterogeneity that we found. Post-treatment surveys could probe rationales for
changes made in key financial behaviors, whether positive or negative. Future studies could also
explore more fundamental dimensions (such as present bias or low financial knowledge) that
could be the underlying sources of treatment effect heterogeneity. A better understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity could lead in the future to differentiated financial education
interventions targeted to specific populations, which could have higher impacts than a single
undifferentiated offering.

Notes: Each regression includes full set of control variables included in Table 1 with robust standard errors. Number of observations in Panel A and C are 200
each. For Panel B, separate regressions are estimated for each subsample to obtain the respective treatment effect. Each p-value reported is for F-test of the
equality of the two subsample treatment coefficients directly above. For Panel C, the regression includes additional indicator variables for low savers (at or
below median migrant's savings at baseline), low years abroad (at or below median years worked abroad), low income (at or below median migrant's annual
income at baseline) and migrant being sole decision-maker on money matters in household, and interaction of the treatment term with those indicators. All
dependent variables reported are from the follow-up survey. Summary indices are created by adding related outcomes measures together after standardizing
(using control means and standard deviations) and taking their unweighted average. The component outcome measures for financial practice index of the
migrant and wife respectively, are listed in Appendix Table 2 and 3. The component outcome measures for the saving goals index of the migrant and wife,
respectively can be found in Appendix Table 4 and 5.                                                                                                           21

Notes: Each regression includes full set of control variables included in Table 1 with robust standard errors. Number of observations in Panel
A and C are 200 each. For Panel B, separate regressions are estimated for each subsample to obtain the respective treatment effect. Each p-
value reported is for F-test of the equality of the two subsample treatment coefficients directly above. For Panel C, the regression includes
additional indicator variables for low savers (at or below median migrant's savings at baseline), low years abroad (at or below median years
worked abroad), low income (at or below median migrant's annual income at baseline) and migrant being sole decision-maker on money
matters in household, and interaction of the treatment term with those indicators. All dependent variables reported are from the follow-up
survey. Savings include liquid savings (cash plus savings in banks and chitty funds) plus value of financial assets (gold, stocks, life insurance
and pension plan, and other), whether in Qatar or India. Savings of different kinds and locations were reported separately in survey, converted
to Indian rupees, and totaled. Total household savings is the sum of own savings, joint savings with spouse and spouse’s own savings
averaged across migrant’s and wife’s reports. Annual remittances is the average of migrant's and wife's reports. All savings and remittance
figures are expressed in Indian rupees and its inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (IHST).
