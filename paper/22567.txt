                                         ABSTRACT

The global economy has been buffeted by several unprecedented economic events during the past
35 years. We survey the impact of these events on Israel’s development, institutions, and
economic policies. Israel had a remarkable development during this time, from a low income
high-inflation developing economy in the 1970s, to a medium to high income stable- inflation
advanced economy in the 2000s, while increasingly integrated into the world economy. The
extraordinary events surveyed include:(1) The collapse of the Soviet Union and the massive
immigration to Israel which followed; (2) The Great Moderation in inflation and employment
fluctuations in the advanced economies; (3) The 2008 global financial crisis, epi-centered in the
US, and the contagion of the financial crisis to Europe; and (4) The rise of East Asia high-growth
economies.

Moderating spillovers from the advanced economies during the Great Moderation, the global
information technology revolution, the influx of skilled immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, the gradual buildup of robust and well-regulated financial institutions over decades after
the hyper-inflation crisis, and the deep and extensive integration into the global economy, all
provided the Israeli economy with an entry “ticket” to the OECD; the 35-member group of the
world advanced economies. It came, however at a cost of rising income inequality.

Introduction

      Israel had a remarkable development, emerging from a low-income high-

inflation developing economy in the 1970s, to a medium to high income advanced

economy in the 2000s, while increasingly integrated in trade and finance into the

world economy. The global economy itself has been buffeted by several

unprecedented economic events during the past 35 years.


      We survey the impact of these events on Israel’s development, institutions,

and economic policies. The extraordinary events surveyed include: (1) The

collapse of the Soviet Union and the massive immigration to Israel which

followed; (2) The Great Moderation in inflation and employment fluctuations in

the advanced economies; (3) The 2008 global financial crisis epi-centered in the

US and the contagion of the financial crisis to Europe; and (4) The rise of East

Asia high-growth economies.


      Immigration has been long known to have far reaching economic and social

consequences. These include the labor market, international trade, economic

growth, the social and political structure, etc. The exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel

in the 1990s, especially its impacts on income inequality and the political balance

of power is analyzed in Section I. We describe the extraordinary experience of

Israel which within a short time period in the early 1990s received three quarter of

3
a million migrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU). This wave was distinctive

for its large skilled cohort which raised disposable income inequality without

increasing market income inequality. That is, the welfare state took a sharp

regressive turn. These events are surveyed in Section 1.


      The Great Moderation that occurred from 1985 to 2007 during an era when

the Federal Reserve and other advanced economies’ central banks provided a

broadly stable macroeconomic environment to facilitate rational private sector

choice. In those 22 years, the rate of inflation in advanced economies rose above 5

percent for only 3 years and fell below 2 percent for only 2 years. GDP growth was

relatively stable, and unemployment was low. Inflation substantially declined

across the globe. The average annual inflation rate among developing countries

was 41 percent in the early 1980s, and declined to 13 percent toward the end of the

1990s. Global inflation in the 1990s dropped from 30 percent a year to about 4

percent a year. Globalization swept emerging markets in Latin America, European

transition economies, during this period. Restrictions on market transactions in

emerging markets fell from 78 percent in the 1970s to 58 percent in the 2000s.

Israel avidly globalized during this period, and its inflation decelerated from three

digit rates in the 1980s to the low single digit range as its financial sector became

more and more globally integrated (Section 2).



4
      Traditional macroeconomic models had not adequately captured the real

world business cycles: small recessions that occur in the interval between deep and

long recessions; because the macroeconomic models totally ignored the role of

financial intermediaries. These financial institutions were treated simply like a

neutral conduit between savers and investors; not as a source of crisis by

themselves. This deficiency is being remedied, but uncertainties remain. These are

crucial for comprehending the 2008 global financial crisis and its aftermath. Until

they are resolved, Israel and the global economy may generally have difficulty

coping with the Great Recession, the Eurozone crisis and perhaps Secular

Stagnation in some of the advanced economies, especially in Europe.


      Section 3 analyzes the Israel’s superior post-crisis performance to pinpoint

the sources of its success, the role played by building its financial and monetary

institutions; similarities with the Asian emerging economies are emphasized.


      Section 4 builds on this investigation by considering parallel behavior of

other success stories, particularly China, Vietnam, India and Indonesia, after they

abandoned autarky in favor of export led growth in the mid-1980s. Suddenly, and

with little warning, more than a third of the world’s population joined the post-war

globalization parade powerfully effecting global demand everywhere, including

Israel. Israel has significantly pivoted its trade to the emerging East Asia markets.

      Section 5 looks back at the saga of Israel’s high-inflation, the conquest of

the hyper-inflation, and the emergence of more stabilizing monetary and fiscal

policies, as well as the well-regulated financial sector.

    1. Soviet-Jew Exodus

     1.1.        Introduction

        Immigration has been long known to have far reaching economic and social

consequences. These include the labor market, international trade, economic

growth, the social and political structure, etc. (see, e.g., Lucas (2014) for a recent

treatise). The exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel in the 1990s, especially its impacts on

income inequality and the political balance of power vivifies Lucas’s findings.1

Israel is known for the unique ways it absorbs immigrants who tend to arrive in

waves. Each one has its unique origin, distribution of skills, and often socio-

economic characteristics. Thus, the exodus of Soviet Jews in the 1990s adds useful

insights into this ongoing experiment.


        The importance of the Soviet Jewish exodus is best appreciated in historical

perspective. Immigration to the pre-state Palestine and to the state of Israel came in

waves from the late 19th century onwards.2 During the pre-state era (prior to

1948), immigration was at times controlled by the British rulers.3 But since the

birth of the state in 1948, immigration was free, and even encouraged, under the

umbrella of the “Law of Return”. Table 1.1 suggests that immigration at times,

especially in the nascent statehood and in the last wave from the Former Soviet

Union (FSU) constituted about 20% of the established population.

    1.2.     Recent Wave of Immigration: The Trigger

       The recent wave of Soviet Jews was triggered by the disunion of the Soviet

Union and the destruction of communism in the USSR 1987-1991 (Table 1.2).

      This was surprising to the extent that Mikhail Gorbachev, President of the

Union of Soviet Socialist Republics inaugurated a liberalization campaign in the

political (“demokratizatsiya”), economic (“perestroika”), social and international

spheres (“novoe myshlenie”) that expanded opportunities for Soviet Jews to

increase their welfare. However, the prospect of brighter tomorrows was

countervailed by mounting political, social and economic turmoil which increased

Jewish national consciousness, raised the risk of civil war, created the specter of a

military coup d'etat, threatened economic collapse and catastrophic excess deaths.

None of these fears were unfounded. All came to pass, and Jews who chose to flee

were wise to do so.


      These dangers were downplayed in the Western press and scholarly

literature, which lionized Gorbachev for his progressive policies. The Soviet

President advocated ending the Cold War, reducing defense spending, expanding

arms control, establishing democracy, tolerating the secession of disgruntled

republics from the USSR and satellite states from Russia’s sphere of influence,

creating leasehold and some freehold property rights, and encouraging markets,




10
entrepreneurship and joint ventures with foreign companies. Gorbachev described

these initiatives collectively as "Russia returning to its common European home".4


        His initial reforms were timid.5 The President called for accelerated

economic growth (“uskoreniye”), and authorized the creation of cooperative

restaurants and other small private consumer businesses. Facilities were leased

(“arenda”) from the state and cooperatives were restricted to a maximum of five

participants. Peasants were permitted to sell their goods in urban farmers’ markets

and joint cooperative ventures were encouraged with foreign companies. All these

changes were welcome, beneficial and had little impact on the dominant command

- planning controlled state sector.


        The first hint that Gorbachev ambitions were being radicalized came in his

enterprise reform law of January 1988 which allowed state enterprise managers to

use company funds at their discretion instead of complying strictly with central

plans (“tekhpromfinplans”).6 Soon thereafter, central plans ceased being

obligatory. The stated intention of the enterprise reform law was to give managers

more latitude in dealing with day to day operations, but the opportunity to divert

funds from operations and investment to personal consumption and round-a-about

insider privatization wasn’t missed (“kleptostroika”). This raised serious doubts

about Gorbachev’s competence and the wisdom of his intentions. While a gradual

transition from command communism to some ill-defined mixed market system

was considered progressive in elite circles, most opposed a helter-skelter approach.

Specialists and the public began worrying whether Gorbachev had a coherent

transition program or was just a “harebrained” schemer like Nikita Khrushchev.7

These apprehensions were confirmed when the economy ceased growing in 1989

and then plummeted nearly 10 percent in 1990 as enterprise managers focused on

privatizing state assets to themselves (“spontaneous privatization”), liquidating

them and transferring balances abroad instead of dedicating them to current

operations.8 Inter-industrial supplies, the backbone of modern economies were

shattered because managers ignored their contractual obligations to intermediate

input users.


        This was shock therapy in action without Jeffrey Sachs’s conditionality.9 In

theory Soviet managers who had no experience designing and marketing products

to satisfy consumer demand were expected to transform themselves into efficient

competitors under duress. But they could not do it. The reality was a hyper-

depression that caused GDP to fall between 37 and 50 percent between 1989 and

1998,10 and eventually caused 3.4 million excess deaths.11 Full economic recovery

wasn’t achieved until 2006.


        The primary driver of Jewish exodus from Russia 1990-1996 was the Soviet

Union’s and subsequently Russia’s economic collapse, often dubbed “katastroika”.

The Jewish community sensed the pain, anticipated the danger and fled for this

compelling reason, but also due to the twin threats of a military coup d’tat and civil

war. The first storm warning came in a series of protests by East Germans, which

led to free elections on 18 March 1990, and to the negotiations between the

German Democratic Republic and the Free Republic of Germany that culminated

in a Unification Treaty. Gorbachev could have, but didn’t intervene.12 The Baltic

States (Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia) sensing the mood, asserted their “historical”

independence. Unlike East Germany, they were official Soviet Republics. Their

secessionist drives could have been construed as casus belli by the Kremlin, and

were interpreted as such by the “siloviki” (power services), but again Gorbachev

acquiesced without quid pro quo. Many Russian politicians today consider

Gorbachev a traitor and are trying to declare the Baltic secession null and void

arguing that he acted illegally.13


           Politicians in other republics (Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus) then launched

their own secessionist drives. Gorbachev countered with a Soviet Union-wide

referendum on preserving the federation,14 but the State Committee on the State of

Emergency (GKChP) seeing the handwriting on the wall launched a putsch on

August 19, 1991. Gorbachev was placed in forced detention, but ultimately the

conspirators yielded, culminating in the dissolution of the Soviet Union on

December 25, 1991. As a consequence, Russia lost approximately a third of its

population and territory. All of these events were given an optimistic spin by

Western governments, the World Bank and the IMF, but Jewish emigres clearly

were unimpressed, preferring to be safe rather than sorry. Vladimir Putin’s

annexation of Crimea on March 18, 2014 illustrates the ongoing danger.


           Finally, sight should not be lost of the demonstration effect. The Soviet

Union’s crumbling sphere of influence in Central Europe and East Germany,

together with the successful secession of the Baltic States alerted the Russian

Jewish community to the wisdom of carpe diem. A window of opportunity had

opened, and Jewish emigres of the 1990s chose to seize the day.


The "Aliyah”

      The professional, social, attitudinal and behavioral characteristics of the

1990s Jewish exodus cohort proved to be distinctive. Immigrants came mostly

from urban areas, with fairly advanced education systems. Their skill (education)

composition was skewed towards high education levels. This skew was reflected in

their relatively higher labor income (see Table 1.3). Their share in the population

was sizable - 14.5%. Their average family size (2.32 standard persons) was lower

than the national average (2.64 standard persons). This indicates fewer dependents.

Most important was their higher education level and consequently their higher

labor income. The average number of schooling years of the new immigrants was

14.0, compared to the national average of only 13.3.

           Even more striking was the percentage of heads of the households with

bachelor degrees: 41.1% among the new immigrants, compared to a national

average of just 29.5%. The higher education level and the lower family size can

presumably explain the income gap: the average labor income per standard person

of the new immigrants was NIS 4,351, compared to a national average of only NIS

4,139. Noteworthy, this gap existed even though the new immigrants had lower

work seniority than the established population.


           The educational achievement figures of the immigrants from the FSU are

impressive compared to the EU-15. Relying on data from the International

Organization for Migration (IOM) and the OECD, Razin and Sadka (2014) report

that only 18% of the stock of immigrants in the EU-15 in 1990 and 24% in 2000

had tertiary education.


       1.3.        Migration and Wages

           Cohen and Hsieh (2000) show that average effective wages of native Israelis

fell and the return to capital increased during the height of the influx in 1990 and

1991. By 1997 however, both average wages and the return to capital had returned

to pre-immigration levels due to an investment boom induced by the initial

increase in the return to capital. As predicted by the standard intertemporal model

of the current account16, the investment boom was largely financed by external

borrowing. Furthermore, despite the high educational levels of the Russian

immigrants, the Russian influx did not lower the skill-premia of native Israelis.

They explain this effect by the rise in Total Factor Productivity during the 1990s

1980s.


     1.4.     Migration and Income Inequality

        Countries receiving immigrants are typically welfare states, Israel included.

Putting it differently, inequality is significantly lower in a typical welfare state

disposable income than non-welfare state market economies. Transfers and the

taxes of a typical welfare state serve to reduce disposable income inequality. Israel

is not an outlier in the OECD countries with respect to the market-driven (pre-tax-

cum-transfer) income inequality. However, Figure 1.1 indicates that disposable

income inequality in Israel, which was roughly stable until the beginning of the

1990s, rose sharply thereafter, even though no such change occurs with respect to

the market-generated inequality.

The Political-Economy Mechanism

        Unique to Israel, the Law of Return not only enabled free immigration but

also grants returnees immediate citizenship and consequently voting rights.

Nevertheless, an early study by Avner (1975) finds that the voting turnout rate of

new immigrants had been markedly lower than that of the established population.

This means that immigrants did not fully exercise their voting rights and did not

therefore influence the political economy equilibrium in Israel as much as the

established population.


20
        A similar migrant low voting turnout pattern is reported also by Messina

(2007) and Bird (2011) for Western Europe. However, a later study about voting

turnout pattern of new immigrants to Israel in the 2001 elections, conducted by

Arian and Shamir (2002) reverse this finding for 2001. The new immigrants in this

study are pre-dominantly from the FSU. Arian and Shamir find no marked

difference in the voting turnout rates between these new immigrants and the

established population. This is indeed a unique feature of the 1989-2001

immigration waves from the FSU. Razin and Sadka (2016) address the issue of

how migration can reshape the political balance of power, especially between

skilled and unskilled and between native-born and migrants, and consequently to

political-economic equilibrium redistribution policy of the welfare state. Razin and

Sadka (2016) develop a general equilibrium model which can explain how a

supply-side shock of skilled migration can reshape the political-economy balance

and the redistributive policies. First, it depresses the incentives for unskilled

migrants to flow in, though they are still free to do so. Second, tax-transfer system

becomes less progressive. Third, the unskilled native-born may well become

better-off, though they lose their political clout which they had before the

migration wave.


     1.5.     Concluding Remarks


21
     The section described a unique experience of Israel which within a

short time period in the early 1990s received scores of migrants from the

Former Soviet Union (FSU). Its distinctive feature was the migrants’ high

labor skill. It caused a sharp new upward trend of disposable income

inequality but without a parallel change in market income inequality. That

is, the welfare state took a sharp regressive turn. This underscores the role

played by the post migration political balance which triggered less

redistribution.




22
 2. The "Great Moderation" and Israel's Disinflation

      The Great Moderation from 1985 to 2007 is the period where the Federal

Reserve, and other advanced economies central banks, provided a broadly stable

macroeconomic environment to facilitate private sector economic decisions. In

those 22 years, the rate of inflation in advanced economies rose above 5 percent for

only 3 years and fell below 2 percent for only 2 years. GDP growth was relatively

stable, and unemployment was low. During the Great Moderation, inflation around

the world fell substantially. The average annual inflation rate among developing

countries was 41 percent in the early 1980s and declined to 13 percent toward the

end of the 1990s. Global inflation in the 1990s dropped from 30 percent a year to

about 4 percent a year.


      Concomitantly, a globalization process has swept emerging markets in Latin

America, European transition economies, and East Asian emerging economies in

the past two decades. The 1992 single-market reform in Europe and the formation

of the euro zone were watersheds of globalization. Emerging markets, including

China and India, likewise became significantly more open. Wynne and Kersting

(2007) note that in the 1970s more than three quarters of industrial countries had

restrictions of some sort on international financial transactions. By the 2000s, none

did. Likewise, restrictions on these transactions among emerging markets fell from

23
78 percent in the 1970s to 58 percent in the 2000s.Israel was involved intensively

in the globalization process and climbed down from the 1980s three digit and

double digit inflation rates.


        An important aspect of openness relates to labor flows. International

migrants constituted 2.9 percent of the world population in the 2000s, up from 2.1

percent in 1975. In some countries, changes have been more dramatic. In Israel in

the 1990s, there was a surge of immigrants of up to 17 percent of the population,

and the central bank achieved a sizable decline of inflation. It is possible that the

two events are related. In Spain in 1995, the percentages of foreigners in the

population and in the labor force were below 1 percent and below 0.5 percent. At

the end of 2006, these rates were around 9 percent and 14 percent. The impact of

the Spanish immigration boom on the Phillips curve has recently been addressed

by Bentolila, Dolaldo, and Jimeno (2007).


     2.1.     International Transmission Mechanisms




24
        Kenneth Rogoff observes that global inflation declined from 30 percent to 4

percent between 1993 and 2003. 1819 Rogoff (2003, 2004) conjectures that

favorable factors have been helping to drive down global inflation in the past two

decades. A hypothesis, which he put forth, is that “globalization—interacting with

deregulation and privatization—has played a strong supporting role in the past

decade’s disinflation.” He attributes the moderation primarily to the increasing

independence of central banks, and the broad-based move towards having them run

by conservative anti-inflation oriented central bankers; similar developments

happened also in Israel. The increased competitiveness was a result of the interplay

of globalization, deregulation and a decreased role for governments in many

economies. Given this diagnosis he foresaw continued disinflation and even

deflationary pressures (which came into a stark relief in the Great Recession)

arguing that the most important factor supporting world-wide disinflation has been

the mutually reinforcing mix of goods market and financial deregulation and

globalization, and the consequent significant reduction in monopoly pricing power.

These developments increased competitiveness; diminishing the gains a central

bank can reap via unanticipated inflation because it reduces the gap between the


18
   The globalization effect has been reinforced by the transition from communism to capitalism in the former Soviet
Union. Spontaneous privatizers, including the military industrial complex (vpk) began mass sales of natural
resources abroad. The USSR’s entire prolonged war strategic mineral reserves were shipped out of Russia’s Far East
ports to Asia, contributing to a decade long plunge in natural resources prices, setting in motion a broad drop in
energy products’ inflation.

economy's monopolistically competitive equilibrium and the more socially

desirable competitive equilibrium. In addition, both theory and empirics suggest

that more competitive economies have more flexible nominal prices, making

smaller the Barro-Gordon-type output gain the central bank can achieve by

inflating; and making them more ephemeral. Rogoff shows in a very standard,

stylized political economy model that it is easier to credibly sustain low inflation in

a competitive than in a highly monopolistic economy.


            Rogoff’s prediction has proven correct.20 Global inflation moved sideways

after 2003, and then fell sharply asymptotically approach zero after 2008, despite

massive monetary and credit expansion in the United States and the European

Union. The forces behind global disinflation and deflation apparently are more

complex than Rogoff supposed but the trend is incontrovertible (given official

statistics with goods' quality adjustment biases).


           Evidence of the effect of globalization on the Phillips curve is provided by

Loungani, Razin, and Yuen (2001), Razin and Loungani (2007), and Clarida

(2008). Previously, Romer (1993, 1998) and Lane (1997) showed that inflation and

trade liberalization are negatively and significantly correlated among the large

(flexible exchange rate) OECD economies.

26
      The core mechanism in the New Keynesian paradigm depends on the

Phillips Curve; that is, the tradeoff between surprise inflation and the level of

economic activity. The reason why the New Keynesian framework is capable of

generating such a trade-off between inflation and economic activity is that

producer-desired prices (once prices are adjusted) rise with the economy’s output,

when marginal costs slope upward due to diminishing returns to scale.

Furthermore, when the labor supply increases, workers tend to experience

increasing marginal disutility of labor efforts. The resulting increased real-wage

demands must rise. Increased wage demands put an upward pressure on the

marginal cost, and consequently on the producer-desired price setting. The New

Keynesian Literature (e.g., Binyamini and Razin (2010) shows how increased

volume of trade in goods, greater financial openness, and labor migration affect the

trade-off between output and inflation by flattening the Phillips curve. Minimizing

utility loss function entails more moderate inflation, akin to the Great Moderation.

Bean (2006) succinctly summarizes the effect of globalization on the Phillips curve

in the era of globalization:


      “One of the most notable developments of the past decade (that is, the

1990s) has been the apparent flattening of the short-run trade-off between inflation

and activity. The seventies were characterized by an almost vertical relationship in

the United Kingdom, in which attempt to hold unemployment below its natural rate

27
resulted in rising inflation. In the eighties, the downward sloping relationship

reappears, as inflation was squeezed out of the system by the slack of the economy.

However, since the early nineties, the relationship looks to have been rather flat.

Three factors—increased specialization; the intensification of product market

competition; and the impact of that intensified competition and migration on the

behavior of wages—should all work to flatten the short-run trade-off between

inflation and domestic activity.”21


         Binyamini and Razin (2010) performed an analytical exercise whereby they

opened up the economy separately to trade in goods, international borrowing and

lending and migration. In every successive round of the opening up of the

economy, globalization contributes to flatten the aggregate supply curve. The

intuition is that when an economy opens up to trade in goods, it tends to specialize

in production but to diversify in consumption. This means the number of

domestically produced goods, is less than the number of domestically consumed

goods. Consequently, the commodity composition of the consumption and output

baskets, which are identical if the trade account is closed, are different when trade


21
  Similarly, Mishkin (2007) writes about the U.S. inflation-output trade-off: “The finding that inflation is less
responsive to the unemployment gap, suggests that fluctuations in resource utilization will have smaller implications
for inflation than used to be the case. From the point of view of policy makers, this development is a two-edged
sword: On the plus side, it implies that an overheating economy will tend to generate a smaller increase in inflation.
On the negative side, however, a flatter Phillips curve also implies that a given increase in inflation will be more
costly to wring out of the system.”


28
in goods is possible. As a result, the correlation between fluctuations in output and

in consumption (which is equal to unity in the case of a closed trade account) is

less than unity if the economy is opened to international trade in goods.


      When the capital account is open, then the correlation between fluctuations

in consumption and domestic output is further weakened, this is because with open

capital accounts the representative household can smooth consumption through

international borrowing and lending and thereby separate current consumption

from current output. The inflation effects of shocks to the marginal cost are

therefore reduced, because the fluctuations in labor supply are also smoothed, as a

consequence of the consumption smoothing.


      When the labor market is internationally closed to outward-migration, wage

demands faced by domestic producers are upward sloping, both under in-migration

and under a completely closed labor market. However, when the labor market is

open to in-migration, domestic producers face an expanded labor supply:

additional to the skilled native born labor supply (with upward sloping wage

demand), they also face a complementary unskilled foreign labor supply (with

exogenously determined wage demand). That means that in-migration acts on the

Phillips Curve essentially like a domestic productivity shock.




29
        There has been some evidence of greater restraints on domestic prices and

wage growth in sectors more exposed to international competition, such as textiles

and electronics. Chen, Imbs, and Scott (2004) analyzed disaggregated data for EU

manufacturing over the period 1988–2000. They find that increased openness

lowers prices by reducing markups and by raising productivity. In response to an

increase in openness, markups show a steep short-run decline, which partly

reverses later, while productivity rises in a manner that increases over time. If

globalization reduces the markup, our model predicts that this effect, by itself,

leads to a more forceful anti-inflation policy and lessens the attention given by the

policy maker to the fluctuations in economic activity. One can conjecture that more

frequent price updating steepens the trade-off between inflation and activity;

however, to our knowledge, neither theory nor empirical evidence exists in support

of any systematic relationship between globalization and frequency of price

updating. Notably, Gopinath and Rigobon (2007) report that the time frequency of

price adjustment of U.S. imported goods trended downward, on average, during the

Great Moderation. Borio and Filardo (2007) present cross-country evidence in

support of their contention that global factors have recently become empirically

more relevant for domestic inflation determination. 22

     2.2.         Inflation Convergence

  There are several countries, including Israel that went through hyperinflation

     crisis in some stage of their development. Following the 1977 change of guards

     at the government level (the political “Ha'Mahapach”) in Israel, the newly

     elected “Likkud” government abruptly eased its control over the economy. In

     particular, capital controls were largely lifted, initially bringing in short-term

     capital, followed later by a reversal when the economy faltered. At the same

     time, a populist economic policy led to high budget deficits and big wage

     increases. The absence of constraining rules on actions of the central bank

     rendered it strongly accommodating the treasury in its expansionary monetary

     policy. With improper bank regulation, (“Visut Menayot”) banks were on the

     verge of collapsing. All these led to a hyperinflation, which climaxed in mid-

     1985. Following the hyper-inflation crisis in the early 1980s under the

     populistic “Likkud” government, a major political restructuring in Israel toward

     the political center enabled a unity government (“Likkud” plus “Avoda”) to

have shown that their result is very specific to the econometric method used. Based on cross-country analysis,
Badinger (2007) finds that globalization is also correlated with more aggressive policy toward inflation. Tetlow and
Ironside (2007), although not dealing with globalization, find that for the United States, the slope of the Phillips
curve has—largely and continuously—lessened during recent years. However, Ihrig et al. (2007) have shown that

     stabilize the economy. Indeed, some key measures, requiring a political

     consensus were taken and new legislation helped to immunize, in part the

     economy from similar extreme crisis features. In particular, a new legislation

     (“khok Hahesderim”) allowed the government to exercise more tight control

     over the budget. A new law forbade the Central Bank to monetize the budget

     deficit (“Khok Iee Hadpassa”). A Tri-Party agreement between the government,

     the Federation of Labor (“Histadrut”) and the association of private sector

     employers dampened the wage-price dynamics and enabled a sharp nominal

     devaluation that ended in a real devaluation. Because the exchange rate change

     had weak immediate repercussions onto wages and prices. The macroeconomic

     changes, brought about by the stabilization program, have been lasted until

     these very days. The Hyperinflation episode has not reoccurred.23

     2.3.    Concluding Remarks




35
        The absence of constraining rules on actions of the Bank of Israel and on

Israel's fiscal authorities induced strongly accommodative monetary policies and

uncontrolled inflation. With improper financial sector regulation, (e.g., the so-

called “Visut Menayot”) banks were on the verge of collapsing in the 1984 crisis.

They were able to recapitalize making their investment portfolios less risky over

the next two decades, thanks to more rigorous bank regulations.


        The 1990s globalization trends in Israel facilitated tighter controls on

monetary and fiscal policies and triggered the great convergence to low advanced

economies' inflation rates. However, globalization abetted increased income

(market based) inequality. Improvements in the quality and range of financial

services while broadening access to new financial services and products, may

narrowly improve the quality of financial services for high income households with

access to financial services (Greenwood and Jovanovic 1990). But such access to

financial investments may not exist for low income households. International

financial liberalization helps lower the borrowing constraints of high income

households without changing the tight borrowing constraints of low income

households. Indeed, De Haan and Sturm (2016) bring new evidence that support

the argument that financial liberalization increase income inequality. 26

redistribution policies.

 3. The 2008 Global Crisis and Israel

     3.1.     Introduction

        Economists had difficulty coping with the 2008 global financial crises

because prevailing analytic frameworks weren’t up to the task, mainly because the

financial sector fragilities were not addressed. They took inadequate account of

four major factors:


(1) the destabilizing cumulative effects of financial deregulation, hedge funds,

electronic trading, financial entrepreneurship such as subprime mortgages,

derivatives and mortgage-backed securities; moral hazard, regulatory laxness,

regulatory hazard (such as “mark to market”);


(2) One-way-street speculation which led to risk-shifting incentives, “too-big-to-

fail” financial intermediaries, hard asset bubbles (real estate, commodities,

energy);

(3) Structural deficits with fiscal hidden liabilities, special interest transfers, global

imbalances; and more.

(4) Low inflation target leading to liquidity traps in the presence of financial

shocks.




38
      All these unrecognized pressures simmered without any policy response

perhaps because economists had come to believe that policy makers had learned

how to tame the financial beast, decades after the Great Depression. With the

advantage of hindsight, a decade after the global crisis, both the strengths and

weaknesses of the pre-crisis economic consensus can usefully be discerned and

appraised, with an eye toward parsing future research.


      Figure 3.1 illustrates how different was the employment decline under the

Great Recession compared to all post world war II downturns. The 2008 global

financial crisis that erupted in the United States instantaneously swept across

Europe.

       A critical piece of the financial crisis and its perplexing aftermath is global

imbalances, often called the global savings glut. This means that some nations

(e.g., China) under-consume and over-export, while other nations, such as the

United States, over-consume and over-import, devaluing the latter’s currency and

pressuring its Federal Reserve to keep interest rates too high to adequately

stimulate recovery. Asia’s liquidity glut flooded into the lightly regulated

American shadow banking system (including mortgage institutions) and inundated

many smaller countries such as Iceland, Ireland, and Estonia sparking speculation


40
and asset bubbles that soon burst with dramatic adverse effects on risk perceptions

in the world’s short-term interbank loanable funds market. Burst asset price

bubbles reduced banks’ worldwide lending ability, a problem compounded by

tightened loan requirements that limited access to emergency credit infusions.


      The recent global crisis had some similarities with the Great Depression.

Both appear to have been triggered by a credit crunch following a sudden burst of

asset-price and credit bubbles. Recovery of world industrial production starts much

earlier in the Great Recession than in the Great Depression. Periods of depressed

output are significantly shorter in the former than the latter, thanks to different

policy reactions and improved financial and budget institutions. Figure 3.2

illustrates the similarity in terms of the initial financial shock which the world

industrial production suffered. It also indicates how the persistent decline in output

was more severe in the Great Depression than the Great Recession.

        This does not mean that economists understand how to use fiscal policy and

supplementary monetary instruments to recover optimally or prevent future

reoccurrences, given the often-destabilizing expectations of the private sector due

to conflicting incentives, finance fragility, and politically gridlocked governments.

Rather, it means that complacency based on incomplete knowledge of how the

system works is no longer tenable, and reassessment of past output, employment,

and finance stabilizing measures is in order.


     3.2.       Pre-Crisis Conventional Wisdom

42
      Pre-crisis conventional wisdom held that business cycle oscillations were

primarily caused by productivity shocks that lasted until price- and wage-setters

disentangled real from nominal effects (Lucas 1975, 2000, 2003), or monetary

shocks, in view of staggered wage and price adjustments. These real and monetary

shocks sometimes generated inflation or deflation, which it was best addressed

with monetary policy. Accordingly, central bankers were tasked with the mission

of maintaining slow and stable inflation. Zero inflation and deflation were

shunned, because they purportedly were incompatible with full capacity and full

employment (Phillips 1958; Phelps 1967; Friedman 1968) and well-managed

monetary policy. Central bankers were supposed to be less concerned with real

economic activity, many came to believe that full employment and 2 percent

inflation could be sustained indefinitely by divine coincidence. The divine

coincidence was said to be made all the better by the analytical discovery that the

real economic performance could be regulated, in theory, with only a single

monetary instrument, the short-term interest rate. Evidently, arbitrage across time

meant that central banks could control economy-wide temporal interest rates, short

and long, and arbitrage across asset classes implied that the Federal Reserve (“the

Fed”) could similarly influence risk-adjusted rates for a diverse set of securities.

Fiscal policy, which had “ruled the roost” under the influence of crude

Keynesianism from 1950 to 1980, in this way was relegated to a subsidiary role of


43
macroeconomic stabilization. This view was reinforced by macroeconomic

theorists’ beliefs in the empirical validity of friction-free Ricardian-equivalence

arguments and skepticism about lags and political gridlocks, which makes

discretionary fiscal policy as a stabilization tool practically irrelevant.


        It is also true that little attention was paid to the financial sector in

macroeconomic theory. The financial sector prudential policy was perceived as

regulatory, only affecting structural performance but not business cycle

performance. It wasn’t treated as an aggregate demand management issue. The

consensus view held that automatic stabilizers such as unemployment insurance

should be retained in order to share privately uninsurable risks. Federal deposit

insurance was preserved to deter bank runs, and commercial banks’ credit and

investments continued to be regulated to prevent moral hazard under the federal

deposit insurance, but otherwise finance was lightly supervised, especially

“shadow banks,” hedge funds, mortgages, and derivatives.


     3.3.      Two Camps

        Two separate narratives have emerged in the wake of the 2008 Global

Financial Crisis. One interpretation speaks of the bubble bursting role of private

ﬁnancial excess and the key role of the banking system in leveraging and

deleveraging the economy. The other emphasizes the risk of inflation arising from

44
the expansion of the central bank balance sheet, the public sector debt over the

private and worries about the risks of lax ﬁscal policies. Needless to say, most

macroeconomic theorists now concede that the pre-crisis monetarist consensus was

mistaken. Both recognize that with the Fed funds rate near the zero lower bound,

the burden for stimulating recovery and short-term growth falls to nonconventional

monetary policies, such as quantitative and credit easing. But, the agreement stops

here. From this point on, the profession has split into two contending camps.


      The “Ricardian faction” contends that further over-budget spending with

deficit to GDP ratios in many large nations such as the United States will drive up

interest rates, crowd out private investment, and have negative stimulatory impact.

This could easily generate recession (depression) coupled with a bout of high

inflation (deflation), due to excessive commercial bank liquidity. This is

reminiscent of Friedrich Hayek warning that a surge of excessive liquidity can

misdirect investments leading to a boom followed by a bust.


      However, members of the other intellectual camp, concerned about the non-

Ricardian conditions, such as credit frictions, market freezes, liquidity traps, and

deflation, see matters vice versa. They insist that austerity policies and deflation

are the danger under depressed markets (which via the Bernanke doctrine implies a

Great Depression with rising real wages and excess savings; see Bernanke (1983)).


45
They deduce that avoidance of disaster hinges on temporarily raising public

spending to fill in the gap of shrinking private spending, continued central bank

credit easing, and quantitative easing. They are aware that this could have

inflationary ramifications, which is helpful to lower the real interest rate, but brush

the soon-to-arrive inflation peril aside by claiming that speculators will absorb

most of the idle cash balances governments are prepared to print, because with

zero interest rate, money and bonds are perfect substitutes. At the same time,

inflationary expectations are to be replaced by deflationary expectations.

Moreover, they contend that excess base money can be drained from the system,

whenever banks decide to resume lending, but not fully, during a long period of

de-leveraging by households and firms. And, as the icing on the cake, they

proclaim that large multiplier effects during depression-like situations will not only

raise employment but also provide the wherewithal to repay the government debt.

They also emphasize the longer-term implications of deep unemployment that

create a segment of the labor force that may become unemployable.


      Notwithstanding these disagreements, the bottom line, therefore, is that the

pre-2008-crisis faith in just one monetary lever, ensuring stability and growth,

proved to be only wishful thinking. The dynamics of macro-aggregates depends on

heterogeneous expectations, information, and contractual and credit frictions of

erstwhile utility seekers under incomplete information, in morally hazardous and

46
incomplete financial markets, subject to sundry shocks. Policy management is

correspondingly complex, particularly in the presence of de-leveraging and

liquidity trap conditions; and still more challenging in imperfect regulatory

regimes where low inflation is targeted to ensure full employment and rapid

economic growth, susceptible to moral hazard, adverse selection, coordination

failures—the unavoidable characteristics of any financial intermediation. That is,

we should not lose sight of the financial sector as a central pillar of the

macroeconomic model. Fiscal policy also needs serious rethinking.


     3.4.     Recent Global and Regional Crises

        Insight into the central role of the financial sector in contemporary macro-

economies can be brought into sharp focus with four historical comparisons: a)

credit implosion leading to a severe banking crisis in Japan; (b) The meltdown of

foreign reserves triggered by foreign hot-money flight from the frothy economies

of developing Asian nations with fixed exchange rate regimes; (c) The global

financial crisis; and (d) The euro-zone crisis (see Razin (2015)).


        Japan was lashed by a speculative tornado in 1986–1991. It was localized,

brief, and devastating, with enduring paralytic consequences often described as the

“lost decades” (1991–2013; before Abe-economics). The phenomenon was a

selective price bubble, disconnected from low and decelerating GDP inflation all

47
the way to deflation, as well as diminishing rates of aggregate economic growth

converging asymptotically toward zero.


      The Asian financial crisis that erupted in 1997 was triggered by foreign

capital flight, which induced liquidity and credit implosions. It began as a run on

Asian banks by foreign short-term depositors and expanded into an assault on

government foreign currency reserves, sending shock waves as far as the shores of

Russia and of Argentina.


      The global financial crisis generated the deepest and longest recession since

the Great Depression of the 1930s. The defining event of the 2008 global financial

crisis was a “hemorrhagic stroke”: a paralytic implosion of the loanable funds

markets. The post–September 2008 emergency was caused by the terrifying

realization that major financial institutions, especially those connected with hedge

funds, could not cover their current obligations either with asset sales or short-term

bank credit because confidence in the value of their assets had been lost, and short-

term lending suddenly ceased. People everywhere were panicked at the prospect of

cascading financial bankruptcies, where the securities of failed companies

contaminated the value of other assets, triggering margin calls, shuttered credit

access, lost savings, bank runs, stock market crashes, liquidity crises, universal

insolvency, economic collapse, and global ruination.


48
        The global financial crisis, which erupted in the United States,

instantaneously swept across Europe and triggered the euro-zone crisis. Like the

United States, the European Monetary Union was ripe for a crash. As mentioned

earlier, the EMU had its own real estate bubble (specifically in Ireland and Spain),

had indulged in excessive deficit spending, was financially deregulated, and had

rapidly expanded credit (partly through derivatives). Policy responses and recovery

patterns for key European Union members such as Germany, France (within the

euro zone), and the United Kingdom (outside the euro zone) were similar.

However, after the bubble burst and the crisis began unfolding, it became clear that

the euro-zone plight differed from America’s in one fundamental respect. There

was no exact counterpart of euro-zone GIIPS (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and

Spain) in the United States. Some American states had over-borrowed, but the

sovereign debt crisis did not place individual states at deflationary risk or threaten

the viability of the federal union. Not so for some members within the euro zone


     3.5.     Financial-Sector Fragilities

        These fragilities and frictions that periodically erupt into financial crises are

rooted in coordination failures, incentive problems, asymmetric information, risk-

shifting behavior, and excessive optimism among participants in collateralized debt




49
markets. Each and every one of these forces is present in global financial problems

of the past few decades (see Goldstein and Razin (2015)).


      Banks are known to finance long-term assets with short-term deposits. The

advantage of this arrangement is that it enables banks to provide risk sharing to

investors who might face early liquidity needs. However, this also exposes the

bank to the risk of a bank run, whereby many creditors decide to withdraw their

money early. The key problem is that of a coordination failure, which stands at the

root of the fragility of banking systems: When more depositors withdraw their

money from a bank, the bank is more likely to fail, and so other depositors have a

stronger incentive to withdraw.


      A key policy question is how to avoid and/ or mitigate the damages from

coordination failures and runs in the financial system. While insurance has been

effective, its implications for moral hazard merit careful consideration. There is

room for more research on the optimal deposit insurance policy. Using recent

developments in economic theory, global-games models enable analysis of the

benefit of insurance in mitigating runs against the cost in generating moral hazard,

leading to characterization of optimal insurance policy. The focus in these models

is on the behavior of depositors or creditors of the banks. However, problems in

the financial sector often arise from the other side of the balance sheet. The quality


50
of loans provided by the banks is determined in equilibrium. Frictions however

make banks curtail lending to protect assets.


        While basic economic theory suggests that prices adjust so that supply

equals demand and no rationing arises in equilibrium, recent models show that this

will not occur in the credit market because of the endogeneity of the quality of the

loan. The key frictions causing rationing are moral hazard and adverse selection. If

a borrower has the ability to divert resources at the expense of the creditor, then

creditors will be reluctant to lend to borrowers. Hence, for credit to flow efficiently

from the creditor to the borrower, it is crucial that the borrower maintains “skin in

the game”; that is, that he has enough at stake in the success of the project, and so

does not have a strong incentive to divert resources. This creates a limit on credit,

and it can be amplified when the economic conditions worsen, leading to a crisis.


     3.6.     Currency-Crisis Theory: Three Generations

        Currency crises occur when a country is trying to maintain a fixed exchange

rate regime with capital mobility but faces conflicting policy needs such as fiscal

imbalances or a fragile financial sector that need to be resolved by independent

monetary policy.




51
      The best way to understand the origins of currency crises is to think about

the basic tri-lemma in international finance. A tri-lemma, as Mankiw (2010)

recently wrote in the context of the 2010 euro crisis, is a situation in which

someone faces a choice among three options, each of which comes with some

inevitable problems. In international finance, the tri-lemma stems from the fact

that, in almost every country, economic policy makers would like to achieve the

following goals: First, make the country’s economy open to international capital

flows, because by doing so, policy makers of a country enable foreign investors to

diversify their portfolios overseas and achieve risk sharing. The country also

benefits from the expertise brought to the country by foreign investors. Second, use

monetary policy as a tool to help stabilize inflation, output, and the financial sector

in the economy. This is achieved as the central bank can increase the money supply

and reduce interest rates when the economy is depressed and reduce money growth

and raise interest rates when it is overheated. Moreover, the central bank can serve

as a lender of last resort in case of financial panic. Third, maintain stability in the

exchange rate. This is because a volatile exchange rate, at times driven by

speculation, can be a source of broader financial volatility and makes it harder for

households and businesses to trade in the world economy and for investors to plan

for the future.




52
      The problem, however, is that a country can only achieve two of these three

goals. In order to maintain a fixed exchange rate and capital mobility, the central

bank loses its ability to control the interest rate or equivalently the monetary

base—its policy instruments—as the interest rate becomes anchored to the world

interest rate by the interest rate parity, and the monetary base is automatically

adjusted. This is the case of individual members of the European Monetary Union.

In order to keep control over the interest rate or equivalently the money supply, the

central bank has to let the exchange rate float freely, as in the case of the United

States. If the central bank wishes to maintain both exchange rate stability and

control over the monetary policy, the only way to do it is by imposing capital

controls, as in the case of China.


       Israel's hyper-inflation crisis in the early 1980s has elements of currency

crisis, credit crunch, and bank runs, all in one mega crisis. The 2001 Argentina

crisis has some similar elements. An important aspect of financial crises is the

involvement of the government and the potential collapse of arrangements it

creates, such as an exchange rate regime. Many currency crises originate from the

desire of governments to maintain a fixed exchange rate regime that is inconsistent

with other policy goals. This might lead to the sudden collapse of the regime. The

literature on currency crises begins with the first-generation model attempting to

understand the basic mechanism underlying the early 1970s breakdown of the

53
Bretton Woods global system. The literature on currency crises continues with the

second-generation model, attempting to understand the basic mechanism

underlying the 1992 collapse of European exchange rate Mechanism Monetary,

whereby the European exchange rates were to converge into a single currency.


           Such models are highly relevant to the current situation in the European

Monetary Union. The international financial trilemma approach is particularly

instructive. It stipulates that a country can choose only two of three policy goals:

free international capital flows, monetary autonomy, and the stability of the

exchange rate.27 Countries in the euro zone now realize that in their attempt to

achieve the first and third goals, they have given up on the second goal, and so

have limited ability to absorb the shocks in economic activity and maintain their

national debts, triggered by the global financial crisis. Coordination problems

among investors and currency speculators aggravate this situation and may have an

important effect on whether individual countries in Europe are forced to default

and/or leave the monetary union.


           The third-generation models of currency crises connect models of banking

crises and credit frictions with traditional models of currency crises. Such models

were motivated by the East Asian crises of the late 1990s, where financial



27
     See Razin (2015).

54
institutions and exchange rate regimes collapsed together, demonstrating the

linkages between governments and financial institutions that can expose the system

to further fragility.28


       3.7.         The Emerging Macroeconomic Paradigm

           Historical patterns of booms and busts typically exhibit frequent small

recessions interrupted by rare but deep and long recessions. These patterns,

however, have not been adequately captured by the traditional macroeconomic

models. Traditional macroeconomic models, used often by central banks and many

other policy-making institutions, are not capable of delivering crisis features in

history: frequent small recessions punctuated by rare depressions. Financial

intermediaries, who have largely been omitted from the traditional macroeconomic

framework, were treated simply like a veil that exists between savers and investors;

not as a source of crisis by themselves. Financial frictions however, have first-

order effects on economic activity, both in the long and the short runs.


           The key feature missing from the traditional macroeconomic model

described above is the role of financial intermediaries. Clearly, the 2008 crisis has

shown that financial intermediary capital has a crucial role in the economy, and



28
     See Razin (2015)

55
losses incurred by financial intermediaries can have strong spillover effects to the

rest of the economy. Recently, Gertler and Kiyotaki (2011) and Rampini and

Viswanathan (2011) add a financial intermediary sector (albeit the crisis is driven

by panic; unlike Holmstrom and Tirole (1997)) and analyzed the dynamic

interactions between this sector and the rest of the economy. Introducing this sector

into macroeconomic models enables elaborate discussions on various policies

conducted by governments during the recent crisis in the attempt to stimulate the

economy via the financial intermediation sector. Such policies are discussed by

Gertler and Kiyotaki (2011).


      A different angle on the role of credit frictions in the macroeconomics is

provided by Eggertsson and Krugman (2012). They study a model with

heterogeneous agents, where patient agents lend and impatient agents borrow

subject to a collateral constraint. If, for some reason, the collateral requirement

becomes tighter, impatient agents will have to go into a process of de-leveraging,

reducing the aggregate demand. This excess saving leads to a reduction in the

natural interest rate that might become negative, and the nominal (policy) interest

rate hits the zero bound, putting the economy into a liquidity trap. Then, traditional

monetary policy becomes impossible, but fiscal policy regains some potency. In

their model, unanticipated tightening in the credit market, manifested as a fall in

borrowing limits, forces consumers to cut spending. The borrowing-limit shock

56
triggers a vicious circle, whereby spending cuts lead to falling prices, which raise

the real value of the consumer nominal debt. The ensuing debt overhang depresses

consumption spending further, which leads to an additional fall in the price level

and consumer spending, and so on - a credit market shock led to a transitional de-

leveraging period with depressed demand and a liquidity trap The resilience of

Israel to the external financial shock during the global crisis is rooted in (a) the

absence of credit boom in the wake of the crisis, and (b) the relatively small

commercial banks' exposure in terms of toxic assets that for the European countries

played a major role.


      The newly emerging macroeconomic paradigm spans the gamut from an

analytical framework that features full capital-market arbitrage, smooth credit,

Ricardian-equivalence properties, representative agents, and efficient monetary

management, to a framework with multiple agents, incorporating debt frictions,

liquidity traps, and relatively ineffective monetary management and provides a role

for fiscal policy in aggregate demand management. The analytical framework

based on the frictionless paradigm captures well the role of globalization forces

and the reduction in inflation in the 1990s Great Moderation era. The multiple-

agent, market-friction revised analytical framework captures some key features of

the Great Recession that occurred in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial

crisis. It gives insight about the macroeconomic effects of debt overhang on

57
economic activity and inflation, when the monetary policy rate reaches its lower

bound.


     3.8.     Secular Stagnation and International Spillovers

        To understand the effects of monetary policy under financial depression we

begin with concept of the natural real interest rate. The issue is how the natural

interest rate is affected by an economy-wide financial shock; a shock that tightens

the borrowing limits. When a borrowing limit unexpectedly falls, borrowing

consumers are forced to cut spending, in order to consume and pay back old debt.

Through a standard general-equilibrium mechanism this cut in spending lowers the

natural interest rate. In a financially depressed economy the (full- price flexibility)

natural interest rate may become negative. But the nominal interest is bounded

below by zero. When the nominal rate reaches its zero lower bound, by the Fisher

equation the actual real rate must equal the rate of price deflation. A gap opens

between the natural and the actual real rates.


        Figure 3.3 illustrate how the real interest gaps are linked to the output gap.

In Figure 3.3, the output gap is measured by the horizontal difference between the

actual-saving schedule and the flexible-price saving schedule. Larry Summers

(2014) put forward a conjecture about the longer run implication of a liquidity trap.

In his view the world is demand short — that the real interest rates necessary to

58
equate investment and saving at full employment are very low and may be often

unattainable given the bounds on nominal interest rate reductions. The result is

very low long-term real rates, sluggish growth expectations.

      Following the 2008 global crisis the world is demand short — that the real

interest rates necessary to equate investment and saving at full employment are

very low and may be often unattainable given the bounds on nominal interest rate

reductions. Consequently, we witness very low long-term real rates, sluggish




59
growth expectations, and serious concerns about the ability to raise the rate of long

term inflation.29


         What are the potential spillovers from a secular stagnation in the advanced

economies to small open economy like Israel? Recall from Section II that long

term arbitrage for a financially integrated small economy whose natural real

interest rate is positive implies a trend in real appreciation; if the world natural real

interest is negative. Small country competitiveness weakens; harming its export-

led growth possibilities.


     3.9.          Israel’s Resilience

         The concern at the time was that Israel, being well integrated in to the world

markets and the world finance, may suffer contagion that will be long-lasting. At

the end of the day, Israel suffered only a temporary trade shock because of the

decline in world demand.


         As shown in figure 3.4, Israel did not have a significant credit boom in the

wake of the 2008 crisis. US and the UK, in contrast, were vulnerable to a gigantic

credit expansion (Germany, like Israel escaped such credit bubbles).



29
  Ben Bernanke (2016) recently analyzed the main reasons for the US FOMC’s change of view concerning current
interest policy. He advances three reasons: (1) Projections of potential output growth; (2) Projections of the natural
rate of unemployment; and Projections of the natural (real) interest rate. Projections of all three long term variables
have been reduced significantly. These projections are not inconsistent with the secular stagnation hypothesis.

Note: Domestic credit provided by the financial sector includes all credit to various sectors on
a gross basis, with the exception of credit to the central government, which is net. The
financial sector includes monetary authorities and deposit money banks, as well as other
financial corporations where data are available (including corporations that do not accept
transferable deposits but do incur such liabilities as time and savings deposits). Examples of
other financial corporations are finance and leasing companies, money lenders, insurance
corporations, pension funds, and foreign exchange companies.


          Nevertheless, GDP growth has averaged 4 percent over the 2005-2010

period years, compared with 0.7 percent on average for OECD countries. The

overall living standards continue to improve gradually, with per capita real GDP

growing more rapidly than in other OECD countries. The economy’s resilience has

been underpinned by solid economic fundamentals, including large foreign


61
reserves, a dynamic high tech export sector, and the absence of economy wide

deleveraging pressures which led to downfall in economic activity. Because, Israel

did not have a credit bubble in the years preceding the global financial crash, like

the other major advanced economies, which burst during the financial crisis.


      Israel's growth performance during and after the global crisis, however, was

not unique. Figure 3.5 shows that among similar small open economies Israel's

GDP grew over the recent 20 years, including the 2008-2010 period at a similar

cumulative rate as Chile; but at a much higher rate than Greece, Spain and

Portugal; which had a financial sector crash.

     3.10.      Capital Outflows from the US During the Crisis

          In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, expansionary monetary policy

in advanced economies conventional or unconventional, that were conducted to

boost up the economy, has affected emerging market economies and others, such

as Israel, through three channels:


          (1) Reduced exports;


          (2) Exchange rate appreciation; and,

64
         (3) Effects of capital inflows on the domestic financial system.


         A number of studies have found an effect of monetary policy on specific

gross flows. Bruno and Shin (2015) for example, using a VAR methodology over

the pre-crisis period (1995:4 to 2007:4) find an effect of the federal funds rate on

cross-border bank to bank flows; the effect is however barely significant.

Fratzscher et al (2013), using daily data on portfolio equity and bond flows, find

significant effects of different monetary policy announcements and actions since

the beginning of the crisis. Their results however point to the complexity of the

effects of apparently largely similar monetary measures. For example, they find

QE1 announcements decreased bond flows to EMs, while QE2 announcements

increased them. In terms of the equations above, this suggests that, in each case,

monetary policy worked partly through its effects on the risk premium. These

studies cannot settle the further issue of whether or not total gross inflows increase

with advanced economies monetary expansions: The increase in the inflows the

researchers have identified may be offset by a decrease in other inflows30.

However, studies of total inflows, or of the set of inflows adding up to total

inflows, yield some mixed conclusions. A representative and careful paper, by

Cerutti et al (2015), using quarterly flows over 2001:2 to 2013:2, suggests two


30
  See Blanchard (2016) who surveyed the literature about post 2008 crisis in advanced economies and emerging
economies that were hit to different degrees by the global financial crisis. To a large extent, the emerging markets
escaped the brunt of the crisis. Israel evidently belongs to the second group.

65
main conclusions. The most significant observable variable in explaining flows

into Emerging Markets (EMs) is the VIX index: An increase in the VIX leads to a

decrease in inflows to EMs. The coefficients on the monetary policy variables,

namely the expected change in the policy rate and the slope of the yield curve,

typically have the expected sign.


      It is worth looking now at capital inflows to EMs and Israel from the US, the

epicenter of the global financial crisis, and the country which adapted with

virtually no lag a brief expansionary fiscal policy and a persistent expansionary

monetary policy.


      Figure 3.7 describes the portfolio capital outflows from the US to selected

countries. Israel is in the middle of the pack of countries which enjoy inflow of

portfolio capital investments. These inflows put appreciation pressures on the

exchange rates. Some central banks, including BOI, conducted a massive purchase

of foreign currency denominated assets, to protect against the declining

competitiveness in the world trade.

     3.11.    Israel in the Midst of the “Currency War”

        In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, expansionary monetary policy

in advanced economies’ conventional or unconventional, that were conducted to

boost up the economy, has appreciated the currencies of the emerging market

economies, including Israel. The question for these economies was whether an

expansionary monetary policy, which tends to depreciate the currency and boost

exports requires also a direct foreign exchange market intervention; or whether the

latter can succeed without the former.
67
      Under perfect asset substitutability between foreign and domestic assets, the

money supply can fully adjust to bring expected rates of return on domestic and

foreign currency bonds into equilibrium, as in the standard interest parity.

Sterilized foreign- exchange-market intervention by the monetary authorities,

where the domestic money supply is unchanged, is incapable of pushing the

exchange rate up or down. However, the proposition may change in the presence of

imperfect asset substitutability, where domestic and foreign bonds command a

different liquidity premium and risk premium. Changing the composition of central

bank assets between foreign and domestic assets (the case of sterilized foreign

exchange rate market interventions) can then have real economic effects in the

presence of credit market spreads and frictions. In this case, sterilized foreign-

exchange-market intervention could effectively change the value of the foreign

currency in terms of domestic currency. A sterilized purchase of foreign assets may

change the liquidity premium that domestic bonds command, relative to foreign

bonds, even though the money supply is left unchanged. A similar outcome may

transpire when foreign exchange intervention changes market views of future

foreign-exchange-market interventions. Similarly, liquidity-based imperfect asset

substitution between domestic government and domestic private-sector bonds



68
during liquidity crises can be exploited by the central bank.31Recall that the most

significant observable variable in explaining short term flows into Emerging

Markets (EMs) is the VIX index: An increase in the VIX leads to a decrease in

inflows to EMs. The VIX index is directly related to the risk adjusted return on

domestic government bonds in the periphery countries, like Israel. Sterilized

foreign-exchange market purchase of US government bonds by the central bank, is

then capable of blocking exchange rate appreciation. This was the rationale for the

Bank of Israel policy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. But, the

effectiveness of such policy is short lived. Once the VIX index falls, sterilized-

foreign-exchange-market intervention becomes ineffective. Excessively high

foreign reserves also have fiscal medium term costs.


        Figure 3.7 describes the changes in foreign exchange reserves for selected

countries. Israel foreign exchange reserves grew significantly more than those of

the advanced economies but not much different from those among the non-OECD

countries.32


        Figure 3.8 describes the nominal exchange rate of various countries that

engaged in the "currency war" period: Israel, Sweden, Switzerland, Brazil and



31
  See Krugman et al. (2015).

  The phenomenon of a group of countries intervening to retain undervalued exchange rate is often referred to as
"currency war".

69
Indonesia. Israel seems to have undervalued its currency the least among these

countries; possibly because thanks for its international financial integration and

almost no capital controls, the effectiveness of sterilized intervention was weak.

     3.12.        Concluding Remarks

           Historical patterns of booms and busts typically exhibit frequent small

recessions interrupted by rare but deep and long recessions. Traditional


70
macroeconomic models, used often by central banks and many other policy-

making institutions, don’t capture the full features of crises: frequent small

recessions punctuated by rare depressions. They don't illuminate how small open

economies, like Israel, which are substantially integrated into the world economy,

perform when a global financial shock takes place, leading to recession as deep

and persistent as the Great Recession. We discussed in this Section the relatively

robust performance of Israel (as well as some other advanced economies (e.g.,

Canada), and major Emerging Markets in the aftermath of the 2008 global

financial crisis. Factors contributing to this robustness, are the absence of credit

and real estate bubbles, and banks’ tight regulation in the wake of the crisis which

precluded the deleveraging process following the financial crisis.




71
Appendix: Foreign-exchange-market intervention with, and without, risk-
related credit flow frictions

      A sterilized purchase of foreign-government bonds leaves the money supply

unchanged but raises the risk adjusted return that domestic government bonds must

offer to offset the alternative return on foreign government bonds. Figure A (see

Krugman et al. (2015), page 516) describes the shift in the return curve in the

upper panel up and to the right. This is the consequence of the substitution of

foreign government bonds for domestic government bonds in the asset side of the

(domestic) central bank, which conducts the sterilized foreign-exchange-market

intervention. That is the stock of domestic bonds held by the private sector rises

and so does the risk premium.


      Note that if the risk premium does not change the sterilized foreign-

exchange-market intervention cannot affect the exchange rate.

     4. The Emerging Economies of South-East Asia

           The global economy was jolted in the mid-1980s by China’s and Vietnam’s

decision to abandon autarky in favor of export led growth and embrace “market

communism”. Socialist India and Moslem Indonesia liberalized and emulated their

neighbors’ trade participation strategy soon thereafter.33 Suddenly, and with little

warning more than a third of the world’s population joined the post-war

globalization parade powerfully effecting global demand everywhere, including

Israel.


       4.1.        East Asia Rises

           Liberalization, globalization, outsourcing and technology transfer were the

key drivers, not domestic rates of economic growth. China claimed double digit

GDP growth from 1950-1976 during the Maoist epoch, but its trade participation,

outsourcing and inflowing foreign direct investment were negligible, as were its

contribution to global economic vitality. 34


           Beijing began distancing itself from autarky in the1980s when Deng

Xiaoping introduced special economic zones (SEZ) in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and

Shantou and Xiamen, and designated the entire province of Hainan as a special

economic zone. In 1984, China further opened 14 coastal cities to overseas

investment: Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Lianyungang,

Nantong, Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang and

Beihai.


      China leveraged the opportunities for outsourcing and technology transfer

afforded by SEZs by liberalizing its domestic economy. This involved a rapid

sequence of market oriented reforms that circumvented communist ideological

prohibitions against private ownership by allowing entrepreneurs and state

companies to lease assets while preserving the Party’s monopoly on freehold

property. The first reform called “Gaige Kaifang” (literaly, reforms and openness)

lasted more than a decade from 1976 until shortly after the Tiananmen Square

massacre, June 5, 1989. The idea at its core was the gradual reversal of the three

ideological pillars of command economy: criminalization of private property,

criminalization of private business, and criminalization of entrepreneurship.


      The centerpiece of the post-Mao system was “household-responsibility

system” (allowing peasant family households to operate their plots independently

of team and communal influences) which made it possible for them to prosper by

increasing productivity and selling above quota output in collective farm markets

and household (cottage) industries in 1980. The principle soon thereafter was


75
applied nationwide. The household-responsibility system was coupled with the

“town village enterprise” (TVE) movement, an effort to transform the separate

profit seeking activities of individual households into a coordinated agro-industrial

communal business. TVE were flexible, and enjoyed considerable discretion in

choosing and implementing agro-industrial activities. As time passed many TVEs

began operating as private enterprises, despite their cooperative form,35 and

prospered in part due to the absence of freehold property owning competitors,36

and newly decentralized state finance.37


        The second phase of Deng Xiaoping's march to partially consumer sovereign

markets (as distinct from market assisted command) can be conveniently dated at

1992, when he undertook his famous “Southern Tour” to Shenzhen. During the

trip, Deng characterized China's emerging productive order as a “socialist market

economy,”38 and asserted that "If China does not practice socialism, does not carry

on with 'reform and opening' and economic development, does not improve the

people's standard of living, then no matter what direction we go, it will be a dead

38
   The possibility of market socialism was debated in the 19th century, but rejected by most communists in 1929
when Stalin forcibly collectivized the Soviet Union. The idea was resurrected in the west by Oscar Lange in 1936-
37, and has been influential ever after. See Lange and Taylor, (1938). Stalin was impressed by Lange's theory. He
summoned him to Moscow for consultations and Lange lobbied Franklin Roosevelt on Stalin's behalf regarding the
government of postwar Poland. From 1961-65 Lange served as one of four acting Chairmen of the Polish State
Council (Head of State).

end." This clarion call to reinvigorate the marketization process in the aftermath of

the Communist Party's post-Tiananmen Square retrenchment was successful.


      Deng's team promptly transformed red directors into managers of market

competitive state owned enterprises (SOEs), and then ultimately into managers of

private companies by expanding and codifying their powers in "The Regulations

on Transforming the Management Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial

Enterprises," issued July 1992. The document granted managers 14 control rights

over: (1) production, (2) pricing, (3) sales, (4) procurement, (5) foreign trade, (6)

investment, (7) use of retained funds, (8) disposal of assets, (9) merger and

acquisitions, (10) labor, (11) personnel management, (12) wages, (13) bonuses, and

(14) internal organization, and refusal to pay unauthorized charges by the

government.


      These developments have been accompanied by parallel stock market and

banking reforms, allowing SOEs to increase equity (shares) sales to outsiders, and

banks to tighten credit discipline over profligate SOEs. They also facilitated

market-driven reshuffles of corporate structure through mergers and acquisitions

(M&A). China joined the WTO in 2002. Vietnam followed a nearly identical path




77
to liberalization and globalization under the banner of Doi Moi (renewal) and

joined the WTO in 2002. 39


         India and Indonesia never were communist nations and didn’t have to undo

the trammels of command economies, but both markets were severely over-

controlled. While details of liberalization and globalization differed, the thrust to

laissez-faire was the same.


         The reform process in India sought to accelerate economic growth and

eradication of poverty. The process of economic liberalization began in the late

1970s, picked up momentum in July 1991 a systemic shift to a more with open

economy with greater reliance upon market forces, a larger role for the private

sector including foreign investment. Subsequent reforms have gone a long way in

decontrolling the domestic economy,40 like China emphasizing gradual transition

rather than "shock therapy".




39
  China’s long-lasting fixed exchange rate policy put together with capital controls enabled the Chinese authorities
export-led growth (With the renminbi being frequently under-valued) while using monetary policy to control
domestic inflation. But, China is likely to have to let the renminbi exchange rate float freely sometime over the next
decade. It might seem odd that a country running a huge trade surplus ($600 Billion in 2015) would be worried
about currency weakness. But a combination of factors, including slowing economic growth and a gradual relaxation
of restrictions on investing abroad, has unleashed a torrent of capital outflows.
40
   Indian federal government embraced free market policies in 1991 and at the same time devolved the power of the
states, including authority over taxes. But only recently, the Indian lawmakers cleared the way for India to become a
single economic zone, by introducing the federal Goods and Services Tax (a value added tax) which can abolish the
overlapping federal and state taxes. This new law is in the process of being put in place after a long series of
legislative steps and the approval of the constitutional amendment by the upper house of the parliament.

78
      The changes initiated in 1991 eliminated the dominance of the public sector

in the industrial activity; discretionary controls over private industrial investment;

trade and exchange controls, tight restrictions on direct foreign investment, and the

over-regulation of the financial sector. The reforms unleashed powerful

entrepreneurial forces. Since 1991, successive governments, across political

parties, have successfully carried forward the country's economic reform agenda.

Most of the central government industrial controls were dismantled. Massive

deregulation of the industrial sector was done in order to bring in the element of

competition and increase efficiency. The list of industries reserved solely for the

public sector -- which used to cover 18 industries, including iron and steel, heavy

plant and machinery, telecommunications and telecom equipment, minerals, oil,

mining, air transport services and electricity generation and distribution was

drastically reduced to three: defense aircrafts and warships, atomic energy

generation, and railway transport. Further, restrictions that existed on the import of

foreign technology were withdrawn.


      Before the reforms, trade policy was characterized by high tariffs and

pervasive import restrictions. Imports of manufactured consumer goods were

completely banned. For capital goods, raw materials and intermediates, certain lists

of goods were freely importable, but for most items where domestic substitutes

were being produced, imports were only possible with import licenses. The criteria

79
for issue of licenses were non-transparent; delays were endemic and corruption

unavoidable. The economic reforms phased out import licensing and also to reduce

import duties. Israel’s exports to Asia grew substantially throughout the years,

relative to all other export destinations. Figure 4.1 shows Israel’s Exports Shares

by Destination Region.

      Financial reforms which emphasized liberalization, including the interest rate

and reserve requirements, has made India’s financial industry globally competitive.

The financial system has been deregulated and opened to international financial

markets, and employs derivatives and other modern innovations.


     4.2.        Israel Exports through the Prism of a Gravity-Model

        Recently, Israeli Exports to Asia has surged, then stayed stable with the US;

but exports to most of Europe sharply declined. The “gravity” model helps explain

these trends.


        Like the force between two objects in physics depends on the product of

their masses and the distance between them, so trade between two countries is

thought to depend on their economic mass (GDP) and all frictions affecting trade,

including transport costs and policy variables. The theoretical and empirical

foundations of the “gravity” model have been solidified in recent years by Eaton

and Kortum (2002), Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003), and Helpman, Melitz and

Rubinstein (2008)41. The Shifts in trade between Israel and Southern East Asia are

likely to be a direct consequence of the policy transformation in China and India

economies that can be captured via the “gravity” effect: the increasing economic

  While economists have been estimating gravity equations on bi-lateral trade data, the theoretical foundations of
these equations had been sketchy and only recent work has provided satisfactory formulations. See the recent survey
by Head and Mayer (2016).

“mass” (GDP) in Southern East Asia coupled with the tearing down of the border

restrictions (as indicated above).42


         Mohar (2009) studied the share of Israel’s goods exports in the total imports

of the destination country, by using a non-structural gravity model. The main

explanatory variables in the destination country are: GDP (representing the market

size), GDP per capita (representing the buying power of the average individual),

distance and a dummy variable representing whether or not there are trade

agreements between Israel and the destination country. The sample period is 2001-

2008.


         Figure 4.2 describes the excessive/deficient shares, above or below what is

predicted by the gravity model. Exports to China are under- predicted, while

exports to the US are over- predicted. The gaps predominantly reflect missing

variables such as lagged exports (the gravity model is static), measurement errors

associated the date and scope of bi-lateral trade agreements, and the heterogeneity

of the good composition of the destination-country imports.43

  Israel’s export share is especially high in countries that import electronics, chemicals, and communication
equipment; industries in which Israel has a significant comparative advantage.

     4.3.                                Concluding Remarks

         The global economy has been changed since China decided to abandon

autarky in favor of export led growth and India liberalized its trade. Israel, like

other export nations, is pivoting towards East Asia emerging markets.




83
        The gravity models have been a workhorse in analyzing the determinants of

bi-lateral trade. A non-structural applied to the trade between Israel, Europe and

the US (Israel’s traditional trading partners), as well as East Asia (Israel’s

emerging trading partner) indicate the importance of East Asia to the export led

growth of the Israeli economy; and the more sustainable growth in the decades to

come.


 5. Looking Through a Rear-View Mirror

        The political “change of guards”, the so called “Maapach”, was a game

changer for economic policy in Israel. The newly elected populistic government

abruptly switched away from a regime maintaining fiscal discipline (to a large

measure), underpinned by a fixed exchange rate shielded by capital controls. The

new government embarked on a non-sustainable path of fiscal expansion and

accommodating monetary expansion. Capital controls were lifted without replacing

them by prudent financial and monetary regulatory measures. The Bank of Israel

had continued to intervene in the foreign exchange market on a day-to-day basis. A

massive wave of capital flight caused a fast depletion of the stock of international

reserves. As we learned from the first-generation currency crisis literature,

inconsistent set of policies become quickly unsustainable; leading to massive

speculative attacks on international reserves, and to rounds of financial crashes.

84
One may recall the open economy tri-lemma; asserting that a fixed exchange rate

regime and perfect capital mobility must erode the ability of the central bank to

stabilize employment and price fluctuations. Therefore, Israel lost control over

inflation.


         The ensuing hyper-inflation crisis brought about major political rebalancing

towards the political center. The newly-established Unity Government (“Likkud”

plus “Avoda”) implemented key stabilization measures which required political

consensus.44 A new legislation (“Khok Hahesderim”) allowed the government to

exercise tighter control over its spending and taxation. A new law forbade the

Central Bank to monetize the budget deficit (“Khok Iee Hadpassa”), and brought

an end to the accommodating monetary policy. A Tri-Party agreement between the

government, the Federation of Labor (“Histadrut”) and the association of private

sector employers, stabilized the wage-price dynamics and enabled a sharp nominal

devaluation that ended in a competitiveness-boosting real devaluation. The

exchange rate change had no immediate repercussions onto wages and prices,

because the entire macro regime changed.45 Some of the macroeconomic and the

institutional changes, brought about by the inflation stabilization have lasted until

these very days. The hyperinflation cum financial collapse episode has not

reoccurred. Thanks to more disciplined monetary and fiscal policies, and well-

regulated banks, the inflation rate converged to low rates, enjoyed by the advanced

economies during the Great Moderation era.


      In contrast, inflation stabilization programs adopted by other developing

countries, especially in Latin America, proved not to have similar long term stay.

Argentine’s stabilization program, relying on a rigid currency-board setup as its

major pillar, was different. A lack of adequate budget discipline and importantly

inadequate bank regulations, were some of the major weaknesses of the program.

With a sovereign debt crisis and international capital flow reversal, “all hell broke

loose”. The abruptly collapsed currency board and the run on the banks created a

severe liquidity shortage. Sovereign debt default ensued. Argentina has been cut

off from the international capital market. More than 10 years later, prices are still

not stabilized and the country is only recently allowed better access to the

international capital markets. Chile’s stabilization program, however, had long-

lasting outcomes, similarly to the Israeli program.


      In contrast to the crisis-management experience in Latin America, the Asian

crisis has been a game changing event that put the Asian Economies (particularly

South Korea and Indonesia) on a durable growth track. To a large measure, the




86
post-crisis Asian financial and monetary institutions restructuring enabled the

entire region to escape the 2008 global crisis.


      To sum up, the moderating spillovers from the advanced economies during

the Great Moderation, the global information technology revolution, the influx of

skilled immigrants from the former Soviet Union, the gradual buildup of robust

and well-regulated financial institutions over decades after the hyper-inflation

crisis, and the deep and extensive integration into the global economy, all provided

the Israeli economy with the entry “ticket” to the OECD; the 35-member group of

the world advanced economies. However, it came at the cost of growing income

inequality.
