We
     investigate the efficacy of riding the yield curve. This strategy

dictates holding longer-term treasury bills when the yield curve is upward-

sloping. We find that the strategy is surprisingly effective. it

stochastically dominates buying and holding shorter-term bills for large

subperiods, and nearly dominates for the entire sample period, 1949 — 1988.

Our empirical results suggest that abnormal profit opportunities are

available from selectively increasing the maturity of a short-term

portfolio.

                      RIDING THE YIELD CURVE: REPRISE




       Riding the yield curve is a strategy of
                                                  buying longer-dated
 bills when the yield curve is
                                 upward-sloping and selling them prior
 to maturity in the hope or expectation of
                                               collecting any term
 premium that may exist. For example, three
                                                 ways of holding money
 for the next 30 days would be: (1)
                                         buy a 30-day bill and allow it
 to mature; (2) buy a 60-day bill and sell it as a 30-day bill 30

 days hence; or (3) buy a 90—day bill and sell    it as a 60-day bill 30
 days hence. Choices (2) and (3) are "riding the yield curve."

      While the practitioner literature
                                           (e.g., Stigum, 1983) cites
 this strategy as a common means of
                                      enhancing returns, it is by no
 means obvious that such a strategy
                                      ought to be pursued. First, if
 the expectations hypothesis is valid,    riding the yield curve should
not improve returns. If the
                              strategy is pursued because the yield
curve is upward-sloping, then interest rates should, on average.

rise by just enough to equalize holding period returns on all

bills. Alternatively, if there is a risk—related term premium,

riding the yield curve should simultaneously
                                                increase both risk and
return. In principle, this strategy ought not improve the

risk-reward profile (nor should any costless_to_compute rule enhance

performance). Righer-sloped yield curves ought to reflect some

combination of increasing expected interest rates and increased

interest—rate risk.

     Nevertheless, Dyl and Joehnic (1981) provide positive evidence

on the efficacy of riding the yield curve. Using data for the
  1970-75 period, they find that (1) riding the yield curve gives a

  small boost to average return without an appreciable increase in

  risk relative to buying and holding shorter-term bills, (2) that

 longer-dated bills are better than shorter-dated bills at
                                                              providing
 those returns, and (3) that a simple filter rule can enhance the

 risk-reward profile of the riding strategy. The filter allows one

 to ride the yield curve only when the curve has a positive slope

 greater than some critical threshold. These results
                                                         suggest a
 useful trading rule, but in view of the extremely short sample

 period, must be considered only indicative. Since the Dyl and

 Joehnk study, more extensive data sets have become available, and

 allow for more definitive testing.

      In this paper, we utilize a recently available data set to

 examine the efficacy of riding the yield curve for the period

 1949—1988. Our data also provide evidence of abnormal profit

opportunities. Riding the yield curve at some maturities appears to

increase average returns with no appreciable increase in risk. The

yield pickup, moreover, is well in excess of transaction costs. Our

most striking result is that in several
                                           subperiods (e.g., the past
10 years or the past 20 years) the sample distribution of returns

from riding the yield curve stochastical].y dominates the

distribution from the buy—and-hold
                                      strategy. Although the full
1949-1988 sample does not quite yield stochastic dominance, a

relative risk aversion parameter exceeding 260 would be necessary

for an investor to prefer the buy-and-hold short-term bill

distribution to that of the ride. In contrast, estimates in




                                 2
  financial research place the typical investors risk aversion

  parameter below 2.0. (See for example, Friend and Blume (1974) or

  Bodie, Kane, and Marcus (1989).)

        In Section 1 of this paper, we
                                           briefly discuss our data and
  their reliability. In Section 2 we explain and motivate the
                                                                    trading
  rules to be tested. Section 3
                                      presents results on the investment
  performance of riding the yield curve.       In Section 4, we Conclude
  and discuss the implications of our results.

       Our data come from Coleman, Fisher,
                                               and Ibboto (1989), Table
 9-4, Estimated Zero-Coupon prices.
                                          Coleman, Fisher. and Ibbotson
 used prices of Treasury securities from
                                              the CRSP tape to estimate a
 forward interest_rate function.,1     Those forward rates ware

 aggregated into zero-coupon yields, which in turn gave zero—coupon

prices. Therefore, while their prices are not taken from direct

observations of zero—coupon securities,
                                             they are consistent with
prices that were (for the most part) available for transactions.

      These data differ from Dyl and
                                         Joehnk, who collected bid and
ask prices from the fl Street Journpl once a week on the 26

regular T-bill issues outstanding. From that rich data set, they

were able to compute
                              holding period returns for several

alternative strategies. In addition, because those prices were

effective until noon the next day, their results reflect

transactions that could have been executed.

      Although one Obviously would prefer to use firm dealer quotes

to simulate trading strategies, Coleman et al. report that it is no




                                  3
 longer possible to gather Treasury prices which necessarily reflect

 transaction possibilities. As of 1980, interest rates had become so

 volatile that the dealer quotation sheets used by CRSP     contained

 only indicative prices on Treasury securities instead of available

 transaction prices. Therefore, it would be impossible to replicate

 exactly Dyl and Joehnk's research beyond 1979. Moreover, Coleman,

 Fisher, and Ibbotson (1987) found that the ask prices supplied to

 CRSP became unreliable after 1979.2 Therefore,      their zero-coupon
 prices are based on the average of bid and ask prices through 1979

 and bid prices alone thereafter.

      We utilized their end-of-month prices for three-month,

 six-month, nine-month, and twelve-month zero-coupon bonds. While

these prices were not necessarily available for
                                                  transactions, there
is no reason to suspect that the estimation
                                              technique introduces

systematic bias in comparisons of returns to the strategies we

investigate. To the extent that their zero—coupon prices are biased

(for example, by use of only bid prices), returns will not be

affected since the return on a
                                 zero—coupon security is measured by
P1/P0, implying that numerator and denominator bias will cancel in

the calculation of returns.3 While random price errors can cause

biases in returns via a Jensen's Inequality effect, we show in the

Appendix that in this application, such bias is   likely to be of

negligible magnitude, less than a tenth of a basis
                                                      point per quarter.

  2. TUODOLOGr
       We
            examine non-overlapping three-month returns to two competing

  strategies. The benchjytar strategy is to buy and hold three-month

  bills.4 The alternative strategy is to ride the yield curve
                                                                     by
  holding longer-maturity bills and rolling them
                                                       over every three
 months. In most of our simulations,
                                            we only ride the yield curve
 conditional on a filter. If the filter rule is not satisfied. we

 place our funds for that quarter in
                                           three-month bills.



 filter Rule

      To illustrate the filter rule
                                          used by Dyl and Joehnk, consider
 a riding strategy using 12-month bills.        Because a 12-month bill
 will have a 9-month maturity in
                                       three months, one can calculate the

 three—month holding period return on the bill as a function of the

 end-of-period yield on 9-month bills. It is
                                                   then straightforward to
 determine the amount by which the
                                        9-month yield must rise from its
current level before the holding
                                       period return on the 12-month bill
is driven below that available
                                 on the 3-month bill. If this
increase in the 9-month yield
                                exceeds a critical value called the
margin of safety, the ride strategy is
                                             pursued. Otherwise, one buys
and holds three—month bills.
                                Using a margin of safety of zero, one
will ride the Curve whenever
                               12-month yields exceed 3-month yields
and the yield Curve is not humped. This is the usual specification

of the riding strategy. For higher margins of safety, the yield

curve must be steeper before riding is pursued. While one should be




                                   5
 skeptical of a trading rule based on costless information, we

 consider the filter because of its apparent success in Dyl and

 Joehnk's work.

        Dyl and Joehnk show that the breakeven end-of-period yield that

 equates the holding period returns on the buy-and-hold and riding

 strategies is



                   R*(M_H) = R0(M) + [R0(M) —
                                              R0(H)) H/(M—H)


where

        R0(n) =   the   discount yield today on bills with maturity n

                  months

     M        =   maturity   of the bill ridden (12 months in our example)
     H        =   holding   period (3 months in our example)



Therefore, the margin of safety (MOS) for riding a bill of           current

maturity H is the percentage difference in R*(M_H) and R0(M-H).

                                 R*(M_H) - R0(M-H)
                         MOS =
                                                                          (1)
                                      R0(M-H)

We examine in the next section the results of investment
                                                                policies
using MOS =   -1.0      (always hold the longer maturity bill), 0 (the

usual strategy of riding the yield curve when the long rate

exceeds the short rate), and 0.025 (a version of the Dyl and

Joehnk filter). We consider rides on 6-month, 9-month,         and

12-month maturity bills.




                                        6
 Transaction Costs

      Before proceeding, however, we note that the riding strategy

 entails greater transaction costs than the buy-and-hold strategy,

 since the longer-term bills must be sold at the bid price at the

 end of the holding period. The bid-ask spread on 3-month bills

 (where we will focus most of our attention) is virtually
                                                              always
 below 6 basis points on a discount basis. Assuming that the

 "true' bill price is midway between bid and ask prices, the

annualized transaction cost to a seller would be 3 basis      points.
Because maturity is one—fourth of a year, the cost is 0.75      of a

basis point when the bill is sold after the 3-month holding

period. Therefore, we reduce the calculated return each quarter

on the riding strategy by 0.75 of a basis point in months that a

ride occurs to account for incremental trading costs.

(Transaction costs between 0.80 and 3.25 basis points   are

considered below.)



3. RSULTS

     Table 1 presents evidence on the efficacy of the MOS filter

for a 3—month holding period. For each MOS (-1, 0, 0.025),      we

present in the panels labeled frequency" the fraction of quarters

in each subperiod in which riding the yield curve was pursued and

in the panels labeled "success" the percentage of those rides that

turned out to be profitable (i.e., provided returns in excess of

buy-and-hold). For exaniple, referring to the 1984-1988 panel, we




                                7
 see that with an MOS of 0, the investor would have ridden the

 yield in 85 percent of the quarters in this 5-year period. Of

 these rides, 65 percent would have resulted in returns in excess

 of buying and holding 3-month bills, meaning 35 percent would have

 resulted in opportunity losses relative to the buy-and-hold

 strategy.

      The screen seems at best weakly effective. While fewer rides

are pursued as the filter becomes more stringent, the success rate

of the rides pursued does not uniformly increase. For example,

looking at the bottom panel for the full period, the frequency of

riding 6—month bills falls from 100 percent to 69 percent as the

MOS rises from -1.0 to 0.025. The frequency of success increases

somewhat from 66 percent to 71 percent as MOS rises to 0, but then

falls back to 70 percent when MOS increases to 0.025.

     Table 2 presents a different measure of the efficacy of

riding the curve. The top entry in each panel is the increment to

the average rate of return for the particular subperiod that

riding the yield curve provides over the buy-and-hold strategy.

The bottom entry is the increment to the standard deviation of

holding period returns. All entries are in units of percent per

quarter. The table shows that riding the yield ':urve generally

increases both average return and intra—period vclatility. Of

more interest is the fact that average return is increased in

almost all five-year periods. The 6—month ride shows higher

average returns in all periods. This result suggests that riding




                                 8
    the yield curve might be a beneficial strategy for investors   with

    long horizons but with a desire to invest in the money market, for

    example, investors placing portions of their retirement savings in

    money-market accounts. The Dyl and Joehnk screen does not appear

    to provide risk-free added value.5 The screen usually lowers

    average return as well as risk, as it filters out progressively

more rides on the curve.

        Tables 1 and 2 do not, in themselves, indicate any abnormal

performance from riding the yield curve. Indeed, they are broadly

consistent with a standard risk-return tradeoff. However a more

revealing view of riding the yield curve is provided in Figures 1

and 2. In Figure 1 we plot the cumulative sample distributions of

full sample 3-month buy-and—hold returns and returns from riding

the yield curve using 6-month maturity bills, a zero margin of

safety, and 0.75 basis point transaction costs. Despite the

higher volatility of the riding strategy. Figure 1 shows that the

returns from riding whenever the yield curve slopes upward (MOS       =

0) nearly stochastically dominates the buy-and-hold strategy. In

fact, the riding distribution would stochastically dominate6 the

buy-and-hold distribution except for the presence of the single

negative return to riding (which occurred in 1958, second

quarter). The two lines cross near the (0,0) point.

        Figure 2 presents sample return distributions again with MOS
=    0, 3-month holding periods, rides using 6-month maturity bills

and transaction costs of 0.75 basis points for the most recent




                                   9
 20-year subperiod 1969-1988. Stochastic dominance by the riding

 strategy in this period is complete.

      The 6-month rides using MOS of 0.025 also stochastically

 dominated the buy-and-hold strategy except for the one crossover

 in 1958. Because of the similarity of results, the figure is not

presented. The always-ride strategy (MOS =   -1.0)   did not fare as

well. There were several cross-overs in the sample return

distributions. Rides using maturities other than 6 months are

considered below.

     Of course, we know a priori that the true population

distribution of returns to riding cannot stochastically dominate

that of buying and holding, because only the riding strategy poses

a possibility of negative returns. Nevertheless, the dominance of

ridings sample distribution over such extended periods of time

encompassing different interest—rate regimes is striking, and is

highly suggestive of historically abnormal returns to the riding

strategy. Certainly for these substantial subperiods, riding has

provided abnormal risk-adjusted returns.

     It also is worth acknowledging again that these results must

be interpreted in the context of an investment horizon.    For a

three-month horizon, the three-month bill is riskless, and it

makes no sense to talk about the probability distribution of its

returns. However, a long-horizon investor who compares the

alternative strategies of rolling three-month versus six-month

bills each quarter would be interested in the empirical results




                                10
presented in the Figures. as these would definitively recornnend

the riding strategy.

     Although the returns distribution over the entire 1949-1988

period do not exhibit stochastic dominance, riding the yield curve

still has offered risk-return attributes far superior to the

buy-and-hold alternative. An investor with a constant relative

risk-aversion utility function would need a risk-aversion

parameter exceeding 260 before he or she would avoid riding

6-month bills (with a zero margin of safety) in favor of buying

and holding. In contrast, the mean excess return and volatility

of the S&P 500 index over Treasury bills have been consistent with

a risk-aversion parameter of about two.7

     These results may be sensitive to the assumed level of

transaction costs. To measure the historic advantage of the

6-month riding strategy over buy-and-hold, we calculate the

relative risk aversion parameter for which the tw strategies are

equally attractive under other assumptions for transaction costs.

Table 3 presents the risk aversion parameter which equates the

expected utility of each strategy for several levels of

transaction costs in excess of the already—posited 0.75 basis

point per quarter (which corresponds to a reported bid-ask spread

of 6.0 basis points). Expected utility is computed using the

sample distribution of returns to each strategy over the full

1949—1988 sample period.

 value of 0.75 basis points (consistent with a bid-ask spread on

 three—month bills of 26 basis points!) still leaves riding the

 yield curve as a preferable strategy for risk aversion

 coefficients below 10. Thus, it appears that fot any reasonable

 specification of risk aversion and transaction costs, riding the

yield curve using 6-month bills presents a return distribution

 superior to that of buying and holding three-month bills. If

transaction costs are about 0.75 basis points, as we have argued,

then riding the yield curve has provided abnormal risk-adjusted

returns in excess of 2.5 basis points per quarter or 10 basis

points per year. (Gross return differences——not adjusted for

risk—- were closer to 10 basis points per quarter. See Table 2,

bottom panel, which shows average incremental returns per quarter

over the whole sample.)

     MOS filters above zero would have destroyed value instead of

creating value. We see this by comparing columns MOS =     0   and
MOS = 0.025 in Table 3.
                          For every level of transactions costs in

excess of 0.75 basis points, the risk aversion parameter that

would leave an investor indifferent between buying and    holding and

riding the yield curve is lower with the higher screen. This

implies that for any given level of risk aversion, investors would

prefer returns from the zero screen strategy to returns from     an
MOS = 0.025 screen.




                                12
     Rides using longer maturities than six months did not perform

as well as the six-month rides. Figure 3 for example, provides

full-sample distributions for nine-month rides versus buy-and-hold

distributions for MOS of 0.0. While longer—term riding

distributions also lie generally to the right of the buy—and-hold

distribution, when riding longer-maturity bills fails, as in 1958

second quarter, long-term riding fares much more poorly than the

6—month ride because duration is higher, giving rise to a longer

left-hand tail. These results, together with Table 2, suggest

that the extra average return to riding beyond maturities of six

months increases risk by too much to qualify as a dominant

strategy.

     Finally, we ask whether riding the yield curve is an

effective strategy for holding periods other than three months.

In Figure 4, we present return distributions for 6—month

buy-and-hold versus 6-month rollovers of 12-month bills for MOS of

0.0. Clearly, the riding strategy is not dominant.



4. CONCLUSION

     We have found that riding the yield curve using six-month

maturity zeros has been an extraordinarily effective strategy

versus rolling over three-month zeros. Riding the yield curve

using longer maturity bills for three-month holding periods also

outperforms the simple buy-and-hold strategy, but does not

incrementally enhance performance versus use of the 6-month

bills. In fact, such longer rides perform slightly worse due to




                                13
increased interest-rate risk. Similarly, riding the yield curve

using 12-month bills and 6-month holding periods does not offer a

risk-reward profile arguably better than that obtainable from

buying and holding 6-month bills.

     These results are suggestive of some market segmentation for

maturities on either side of 3 months, in that it appears that

profitable trading strategies straddling this maturity have gone

unexploited. Possibly, maturities less than 3 months are viewed

as more liquid and better cash substitutes than longer maturity

instruments, even beyond a simple duration effect. In this case,

the apparent abnormal performance of longer maturity bills may be

viewed as the price of this liquidity attribute. However, this

interpretation suggests that modelling prices as solely a function

of risk and return attributes is too narrow a view of the market.

        The actual rate of return, r, realized by a trader is

defined by 1 +   r   =   P1/P0, where P0 denotes the price at which the
zero—coupon security is purchased, and i is the price at which it

is sold. We, however, measure prices with error, in part because

of unobserved bid—ask spreads, and in part because of statistical

error in the fitting of the yield curve. We therefore measure r

with error. If r* is the measured return, then

                                                         P +e
                                   l+r =                  1    1                         (A.l)
                                                         P0 + e0


where e denotes the random measurement error, assumed to have zero

mean.

        Rewriting (A.l) as

                                            P

                                                                   e

it is clear that measurement error in P1 will not bias returns as

long as e1 and e0 are independent, since in this case the second

term in (A.2) has zero expectation. However, the first term will

not provide an unbiased estimate of 1 +                       r.       To see this, expand

the first term around P0 in a second-order Taylor series:



                                       P         P                     P       2

                                                     2                     3
                                       P0        P0                    P0




                                            15
Taking expectations over e0, the expected value of the measured

return conditional on the true prices P0 and P1 is

                     E(1 +   ra)             (1        a2(e0)1

                                       P0

                                   =    (1   +    r)   (1 +   02(e0)/P02]

Thus, returns will be biased upward by the square of the standard

deviation of measurement error expressed as a fraction of the

security price.

       This bias, however, should be exceedingly small. As noted

above, the bid-ask spread is less than 6 basis points annualized,

or 3 basis points on a 6-month bill. Moreover, Coleman et al.

(1989, Table 10—3) present standard errors of their

cross—sectional forward rate curves for each maturity class.

Their results imply that for maturities less than one year, the

standard error of the implied bill prices is in most cross

sections considerably less than 0.25 percent. Together, these

data imply that the total value of (e0) would be less than 30

basis points, or 0.3 percent of price. If a typical 6-month

return is 3 percent, the bias would be determined by



                     E(l +   r*)   =   (l.03)(1        +0.0032)

                                   =   1.030009




                                       16
implying a negligible bias of 0.09 basis points. Even if the

standard deviation of the measurement error in price is 0.50

percent, a huge amount in the money market, the bias still would

be small, only 0.26 basis points:



                     E(l +   r*)   =    (]..03)(l   +   0.0052)
                                   =    1.030026

                        FOOTNOTES




Coleman et al. assume that forward rates are constant over
certain time intervals and then use a nonlinear least

squares technique to find the sequence of forward rates

that best fit the prices of all Treasury securities. They

obtain their best fit for short—term securities by allowing

the forward rates to change with maturity fairly frequently

at the short end of the term structure. In fact, the first

five weeks are fit exactly, because they allow different

forward rates for each of the first five weeks. The time

interval over which the forward rate is assumed constant is

short for all maturities less than one year, which means

that the inferred prices should be quite accurate for the

securities we examine in this paper. The exact scheme for

inferring forward rates is as follows:



Period         Span         Period

1. week 1      7 days       8. 3—6 months    92 days

2. week 2      7 days       9. 6—12 mos.     6 months

3. week 3      7 days       10. 1—2 years    1 year

4. week 4      7 days       11. 2—4 years    2 years

5. week 5      7 days       12. 4—8 years    4 years

6. 36-50 days 15 days       13. 8—16 years   8 years

7. 51-90 days 40 days       14. 16-32 years 16 years




                           18
2.   They report that whereas bid prices for T-bills reported in

     the Wall Street Jouriiai. and CRSP are always close (they

     differ slightly because the former is a 3:00 pm price and

     the latter is a closing price), the ask prices in CRSP and

     the Journal vary widely. Because the bid prices are

     consistent while the ask prices in CRSP imply bid-ask

     spreads as high as $2.00, Coleman, at al. chose to use only

     bid prices from CRSP for dates after 1979.

3.   The returns on investnents held to maturity will be biased

     upward by the use of a bid price since in this case, the

     numerator in the return calculation is exactly par value

     (rather than a calculated quantity) while the denominator

     is downward biased. However, this property only

     strengthens our empirical conclusions below, in that we

     find that riding the yield curve dominates the buy and hold

     strategy even with the upward bias in buy and hold returns.

4.   Strictly speaking, these are not three-month T-bills, but

     three-month zero-coupon bonds priced based on the Treasury

     yield curve. However, for expositional ease, we will

     continue to refer to them as bills.

5.   Because these filter rules worked for Dyl and Joehnk, we

     would like to compare our results to theirs for the sample

     period in which our data overlap. This, however, is not

     possible. Our data set contains zero—coupon prices at

     maturities of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Our rides must




                               19
     therefore be at 3-month increments. In contrast, Dyl and

     Joehnk have bills with maturities staggered each week.

     Their rides generally involve very small increments to the

     maturity of the bill being held, and most of their tables

     present returns from overlapping periods averaged across

     rides of different maturities.

6.   One investment stochastically dominates another if the

     cumulative probability distribution of its returns lies

     strictly to the right of the others. This means that the

     dominating investment has a higher probability than the

     dominated investment of beating any target return. All

     risk—averse investors will prefer the investment with the

     dominant distribution in a pairwise comparison (see

     Ingersoll, 1987).

7.   We follow Bodie, Kane, and Marcus (1989). The historical

     average risk premium and standard deviation in the market

     portfolio have been about 8.5 percent and 21 percent

     respectively. In an CAPM-type model, where all investors

     hold the market portfolio, the risk premium should equal

     AcTM2 where A is the risk aversion parameter and aM2 is the

     market variance. These values imply that A =   0.085/0.212
     1.93.
