            The Insensitivity of Consumption to News About Income




                                   ABSTRACT




     This paper uses a variance bounds test to see whether consumption is
too sensitive to news about income to be consistent with a standard permanent
income model, under the maintained hypothesis that income has a unit root.   It
is found that, if anything, consumption is less sensitive than the model would
predict. This implication is robust to the representative consumer having
private information about his future income that the econometrjcjan does not
have, to wealth shocks, and to transitory consumption. This suggests the
importance in future research on the model of allowing for factors that tend
to make consumption smooth.

  L Introduction

       A standard rational expectations version of the permanent income model of

  consumption implies that the unanticipated component of
                                                            consumption equals the

 unanticipated change in the expected present discounted value of labor income

 (Flavin (1981)). Flavin's (1981) and Kotlikoff and Pakes's (1984) tests,

 however, indicated that post World War II aggregate U.S. consumption responds

 too strongly to news about income for this model to be correct. Flavin (1981),

 for example, found that the consumption response to an income innovation was

 over three times the value predicted by the model.

      Flavin (1981) and Kotljkoff and Pakes (1984) accounted for the observed

 upward movement in per capita income by detrending their income series. Mankiw

 and Shapiro (1985) have pointed out that if income has a unit root with drift

 rather than a time trend, then the use of time trends in empirical tests will

tend to spuriously suggest excess sensitivity of consumption to income.

Mankiw and Shapiro left open the question of whether or not consumption is

excessively sensitive, if in fact income has unit root. Deaton (1986) has

argued that if such is the case, there is some evidence that consumption is in

fact less sensitive to news about income than the model predicts--precisely the

opposite conclusion that is reached when detrending is used.

     This paper uses a variance bounds test to consider in detail the issue of

the sensitivity of consumption to news about income, largely under the

maintained hypothesis that the income process has a unit root. In section 2, I

develop the implications of the model for the relationship between the relevant

consumption and Income variances. All of the papers cited in the previous

paragraphs assumed that the representative consumer uses only lagged income to

forecast future income, and exploited the resulting prediction that the
                               2

unanticipated consumption component is equal to a certain function of the

innovation in the univariate income process. This implication will not hold,

however, if the representative consumer uses additional data, such as say, tax

or labor market variables, to forecast his income.   In this case, the variance

of the relevant consumption component will be less than the variance of this

function of the univariate innovation. One can, however, use just consumption

and income data to calculate precisely how much less variable consumption

should be, and thus determine whether consumption is in fact too smooth.

       In section 3, the paper uses some post World War II quarterly data to test

both the inequality and equality derived in section 2, under the assumption

that income has a unit root. As in the estimates reported in Deaton (1986), it

is   found that the relevant consumption variance is indeed less than the
relevant income variance. The evidence does not strongly suggest, however,
that   this implied insensitivity of consumption results from additional

information used by the consumer to forecast income. In various ARIMA

specifications for the univariate income process, the point estimate of how

much less variable consumption should be, given the consumer's superior

information, is never more than a third, and is usually less than a tenth, of

the point estimate of the difference in the variances. Neither wealth shocks

nor white noise transitory consumption help explain the residual difference.

The difference is significantly different from zero at the 5 per cent level in

almost all specifications.

       This means that allowing for a unit root in the income process implies

that the aggregate data are not quite as inconsistent with the permanent income

model as is suggested when one allows instead for a time trend (Plavin (1981)).

On the other hand, the model by no means comfortably characterizes the data.
                                3

  It would seem that if one accepts the unit root
                                                    specification, consumption is
 even smoother than the model predicts.

      A final introductory word is appropriate, on why variance tests are useful

 in studying the permanent income model. An alternative would be to test the

 cross-equation restrictions of the model. Hansen and Sargent (1981) have

 pointed out that the cross-equation restrictions of a linear rational

 expectations model summarize all the restrictions of the model. So if these

 are obeyed, so, too, are any variance inequalities implied by the model.

 Indeed, one can show that unpredictability of changes in
                                                            consumption implies
 the variance inequality studied here.

      The additional power of the tests of cross-equation restrictions does not,

however, seem to be of critical importance in studying the permanent income

model. Tests of the model have tended to suggest that whether or not one

detrends, the model can be rejected by formal statistical tests (e.g., Blinder

and Deaton (1986), Campbell (1985), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Marshall (1987),

Flavin (1981), Hall (1978), Nelson (1985), Watson (1986)).    It is natural,

then, to ask what stylized facts about consumption appear to be inconsistent

with the model. In this connection, a variance test can be very revealing. It

suggests that if income has a unit root, there is not much appeal to the

argument that consumption is excessively sensitive to news about income.

Rather, in future research that maintains the assumption of a unit root, it is

important to allow for factors that tend to make consumption even smoother than

the permanent income model predicts.



2. The Model and Test

    The model is as in Flavin (1981). It is assumed that consumption equals
                                     4

permanent income, with permanent income the infinite horizon annuity value of

the sum of human and nonhuman wealth:



             =        +                                                              (1)
                 rw
               =   r(1+r) Z        (l+r)EYt+jIIt                                     (2)



          w = (l+r)wt      1
                               +
                                   -i     -                                          (3)

Here, c is consumption, r is the constant real interest rate, w. is nonhuman

wealth at the beginning of period t, 'T                is   the annuity value of human wealth,

   is labor income, E(.IIt) denotes expectations conditional on the consumer's

information set I' assumed equivalent to linear projections. Summations in

(2) and throughout the paper run              over   j. When "income" is used without

qualification, it. should be understood to refer to labor income

     Flavin (1981) showed that the model implies that the change in consumption

equals the unpredictable change in the annuity value of labor income:


          c -                      Ac =                                               (4)

So var(Ac) =     E(yi_EytiIIti)

and lagged labor income. Define tH r(1+r)'E(l+r)EYt+IHt. Let cij denote

the variance of the innovation in tH' 4 = E(ytH_EytHIHt_l)2.                    If Ht =


representative     consumer uses nothing but lagged income to forecast future
                                                                2     .         .
income- -then the model implies that var(ct) = 0H                   This is examined in Deaton

(1986). (The mechanics of calculating 4 are explained below.) Suppose

instead that H is a subset of ' because consumers use additional data to
                                        5

    form better forecasts of future income. These data
                                                                might be private signals
    about future income seen by the consumer, or observable macroeconomic variables

    such as, say, taxes or unemployment rates. It follows from Proposition 1 in

 West (1987) that in this case,                       The forecasts made from Ht, which

 use less information, tend to be noisier. The model implies, then, that

 var(c) <     . Intuitively,          the reason for this is that the permanent income

 model says that consumers try to smooth consumption in the face of income

 fluctuations. Additional information above and beyond that in the income

 series therefore will tend to make consumption smoother.
                                                                     Consumption being
 insensitive to income, in the sense that var           (c) <       is   perfectly
 consistent with the model.

       The model does, however, say how much smaller var(Ac) should be than a.

The difference between ci and               is proportional to the variance of               To
understand why, observe first that by the law of iterated
                                                                     expectations, EYtI}1t
=
    tH    The permanent income model says that yti=ctrw, so YtIYtH =
                                                                                     c1-rw
E(ct_rwtIH). Now, var[ct_rwt_E(c_rwJH)] is a measure of how much of the

movement of c_rw is not predictable by (is orthogonal to) past income.

Naturally, the model says that this variance is larger the greater is the

extent to which the consumer uses information above and beyond that in Ht in

choosing consumption and wealth, i.e., the greater is the difference between

and 4
       Specifically,   the relation between          and o is:

                  2    =   2
                               + [(1+r) 2 _l]var(yI_yH).


The permanent income model therefore implies

                                                                                          (6)

     Equation (6) may become clearer if the procedure used in part of the

empirical work is detailed. Suppose that the univariate y process follows an

ARIMA (p,l,q) process,



              =   m   + lt-l +              +           + e + ... +                        (7)
                                                                         eqetq.


Hansen and Sargent (1980) show that tH =                   constant + 6y + ... + 6p+1"t-p +

     + ...        +                   the       and     are functions of r, the        and the
                      lTq_let_q+l;

(e.g., 61=[l_1(l+r) 1--(l+r)] 1, 161Ie1(l+r)'+...+8q(1+r)']). Then
ytll_EytHIHt_l =         (61+1r1)e         4ie, where




              [l+61(l+r) +. .+eq( 1+r) ]/[l1(l+r) 1_. .-(1+r)J
     4' =                         .

So    =                and 4 may be calculated from r and the usual estimates of the
     process. One can then test var(Ac) H To calculate a,,, one first

computes the variance of c_rw-yH using the y, the estimates of the                               and

i,., and, if q>0, the residuals from the estimates of the Ayt process, to

compute tH for each t. This is then multiplied by the proportionality factor

(1+r)2-1.



3. Emidrical          results
                               7


      The Blinder and Deaton (1986) data were used, and were kindly supplied by

 Angus Deaton. The data were real (1972 dollars), seasonally adjusted, and per

 capita, 1953:2 to 1984:4. The consumption data were for nondurables and

 services, excluding shoes and clothing. These data were divided by .7855,    the
 mean fraction of such consumption in total consumption over this period, before

 any statistics were calculated.

      Blinder and Deaton constructed separate series for labor income and

 disposable income. I measured rw1, income from nonhuman wealth, in two ways.

 The first followed Campbell (1985) and set rw to the difference between the

 two income series. The second set w to the MPS series for household net

worth, converted to real (1972) per capita dollars, and then calculated the

 implied '     The estimates of var(c_rwt_yH) that resulted from the first

measure are called 2 , those from the second measure are called 2        A

quarterly real interest rate of .5 per cent was assumed throughout the results

reported below. Point estimates (though not standard errors) were also

calculated for quarterly interest rates of .25, .75, 1.0 and 1.25 per cent.

These are not reported, since the results were very similar, but are available

on request.

     As just noted, the test of the inequality and equality variance relations

requires estimates of the parameters of the univariate     process. This was
done assuming that Ay follows an ARMA(p,q) process, with            This wide

variety of processes was used to make sure that the results were not sensitive

to the exact specification chosen. The ARMA parameters were estimated by

nonlinear least squares, with the presample disturbances set to zero. The

Monte Carlo evidence in Ansley and Newbold (1980) suggests that this technique

has attractive small sample properties when roots are not near the unit circle,
                                8

as appears to be the case in these data. All variances were calculated with

the appropriate degrees of freedom adjustment.

       The estimated parameter vector included not only the autoregressive

coefficients, but all the variances that needed to be computed. The covariance

matrix of the estimated vector was calculated using the methods of Newey and

West (1987). The technique properly accounts for the uncertainty about all the

elements of the parameter vector, and allows, for example, arbitrary serial

correlation of the difference between c-rw and tH' and for arbitrary

heteroskedasticity of the disturbances conditional on past values of Ay.4 A

tenth order Newey and West (1987) correction was used because the asymptotic

theory requires that the order of the correction be the square root of the

sample size, which was about 120. A small amount of experimentation with fifth

and fifteenth order corrections indicated that the calculated standard errors

are not sensitive to the order of the correction.

       Table 1 contains the estimates of the univariate Ay process. Application

of Box-Jenkins techniques would probably suggest an AR(l), or, perhaps an

MA(l): neither      nor e2 are significantly different from zero at the five

percent level in any specification. Except for (p,q)(0,0) (which is the only

specification that has a Q statistic significantly different from zero), the

implied values of 4i are very similar. They range from about 1.4 to about 1.9.

       Table 2 contains the results on the tests of the innovation variances. As

may be seen in column (4), the null hypothesis that a-ci is zero can be

comfortably rejected at the 5 per cent level for all specifications. The

permanent income model does not fare as well when one tests instead the null

that       = a2 + 2 See columns 5 and 6 when rw is measured as the difference

  choice of p and q. Except when (p,q) =     (0,0),   the point estimates of a and

   v2 are never more than one sixth the estimate of a2ci2.

                                                           and (p,q)=(2,2), where the
 differences are significant at the 10 per cent level.

        In sum, then, column 4 suggests that a2 is less than a, which is what the

 permanent income model predicts. Unfortunately, it appears from columns 6 and

 8 that the implied insensitivity of consumption to news about income is

 unlikely to result purely from the use by the consumer of additional variables

 to forecast income.

       The remainder of this section briefly considers two minor modifications to

 the model (l)-(3), and four technical modifications to the procedure used.

 None of these appear likely to explain the insensitivity. The modifications to

the model:

 (l)Wealth shocks. Let us modify the budget constraint (3) to allow for shocks

to wealth, say, unanticipated capital gains (Campbell
                                                            (1985)): w (l+r)wt_i +
              Ã· a, where a is a white noise random variable. This implies that

equation (4) becomes Ac =
                             yti-EytiIIt_i   + rae. If the wealth shock a is

negatively correlated with the innovation in the present value of labor income,

then var(Ac) will be less than a. Such a shock therefore potentially

explains the results in Table 1.

       To accomodate this possibility, subtract   ra =    r[wt_(l+r)w1_(y1_c1)J
from Ace. This yields   x - (y+rw_c)         +
                                                 (l+r)(yt_i+rwt l-t ) +        =
- ra = yti-EytiIIi.      One can then calculate the variance of x instead of

act.
                             10

    This was done for all the specifications in Table 1. When the first

measure of rw was used (difference between disposable and labor income), the

estimates of    were slightly higher than those reported in the      column in

Table 1; when the second measure was used (r times MPS wealth), the estimates

were slightly lower. For (p,q)(0,0),        was slightly over one third of

 22    no other estimates were more than one sixth of    2_2.

(2)Transitory consumption. Suppose that c =          +    + transitory

consumption, where transitory consumption is a zero mean stationary variable.

If transitory consumption is uncorrelated with any of the variables used to

forecast income, then var(Ac) =       + var(linearly filtered transitory

consumption) (see Flavin (1981) for the exact formula when transitory

consumption is white noise) and so var(Ac) is bigger than       .   Also,
                                  + var(transitory consumption) is larger than
var(c-rw-yH) =     var(yI-yH)
{r2[l-(1+r)2]}'O. As noted in Deaton (1986), then, such transitory

consumption cannot explain excess smoothness of consumption. The same applies

to transitory consumption positively correlated with news about income (say,
                                                 5
because of within quarter multiplier effects).

      The four technical modifications to the procedure used:

(l)Monte Carlo estimates of significance levels. It is possible that there is

a strong finite sample bias towards rejection, even when the model is true. To

investigate this possibility, a small Monte Carlo experiment was performed.

For ARNA (1,0) and ARNA (0,1) processes, the permanent income model was used to

generate one hundred artificial samples of consumption and income data of size
                                                                           6
125 were generated. The ARNA parameters matched those reported in Table 1.

For each sample, the relevant variances were estimated as described at the

beginning of this section, and the estimated               was calculated. There
                               11

  was a tabulation of the number of times this fraction
                                                               was positive and less
  than that implied by the Table 1 estimates.
                                                   This experiment, then, is intended
  to get an idea of how likely it is that the point estimates will suggest that

 only a fraction of the difference between     2        2.
                                                   and a is explained by the
 consumer having additional variables to forecast income, when in fact the

 entire difference is so explained.

      The results are in Table 3. To read the table, consider the entries in

 line 1. The column 2 entry is .091 = 161.6/1782.1 =
                                                     (Table 2, line 2, column
 5)/(Table 2, line 2, column 4). Now, 100 samples were generated with the true

 (population) value of    = 246.1, the true         = 161.6.     The column 3 entry of
 .02 indicates that in only 2 of these 100 was the estimated
                                                                        less than .091
 of the estimated a-cy2. The column (4) entry in line 1 is .054 =
                                                                          95.5/1782.1 =
 (Table 2, line 2, column 7)/(Table 2, line 2, column 4). The
                                                                      column (6) entry
of .00 indicates that in none of the samples generated with cJ2=246.l,

a2
 v2 95.5, was the estimated v2
                            2 less than .054 of the estimated
                                                                         H c
     The significance levels in columns 3 and 5 of Table 3 are consistent with

those implied by columns 6 and 8 in Table 1.       In particular, the Monte Carlo
experiment suggests that the odds are less than .05 that the results for the

ARMA(1,O) and ARHA (0,1) specifications are purely due to sampling error,

rather than to a shortcoming of the model. Since only 100 samples were used to

establish the Monte Carlo significance levels, this experiment does not

establish the small sample distribution of the Table 2 estimates with any great

degree of precision. But the experiment also does not suggest that there is a

systematic bias towards rejection of the model.

(2)Estimates for subsamples. Point estimates (though not standard errors) of

all the entries in Table 2 were calculated for samples ending in 1973:3 and
                              12

beginning in 1974:1. This was done to guard against the possibility that the

first OPEC shock caused an unexpected shift in the stochastic process for c

and       thereby biasing the estimates in an unpredictable way. In each of the

two subsamples, however, the point estimates of the            were only a fraction of

the point estimates of the corresponding 4-a In particular, the ratio of

a2     i=1 or 2, to a2-a2 never exceeded one fifth. This suggests that biases
vi.                  H c
induced by any such a shift in the stochastic processes for c, and                    are

unlikely to explain the Table 2 results.

(3)Nonparametric estimates of 4.     In   a different context, Cochrane (1986) has

argued that the use of low order ARMA models can cause large errors in

estimation of quantities like 4.     Angus Deaton has pointed out to me that 4

can be approximated by the frequency domain quantity that Cochrane (1986)
suggested for a different purpose.

       Write the moving average representation of Ayt as AYt_EAYt                d(L)et,

d(L)1+d1L+d2L2+..., L the lag operator. Hansen and Sargent (1980) show that
                                                           l                 2
      = [d[(l+r)        where d[(l+r)'] = 1 +                  +                  +
4                                                d1(l+r)           d2(l+r)
Consider approximating td[(1+r)            by [d(l)]2a, which may be a reasonable

approximation since r is very small. If Ay is AR(1) with first order serial

correlation coefficient of .44 (the estimate in these data), for example,

[d(l)]2 =    3.19, td[(l+r)']}2 = 3.16 when r.005.7
        Now, [d(l)]2a is just the spectral density of Ay at frequency zero.

Thus we can use the spectral density to approximate td[(l+r)']12, without

parametrically specifying the A process. It should be noted that this

approximation is applicable even if y is stationary around a time trend. It

is also applicable if y is a mixture of stationary and unit root processes, as

in Watson (1986).
                               13

       I estimated this using what Anderson (1971, p512) calls a modified

 Bartlett estimator. This estimator is simply a weighted sum of the sample

 autocovariances of Aye. (Recall that           spectral density evaluated at

 frequency zero is simply the sum of its autocovariances.) I tried
                                                                          summing
       first 5, 10, 15 and 20 sample autocovariances.       The smallest estimate
 happened to occur when 20 were used.    (I report the smallest because this gives

 the model any possible benefit of the doubt.) It was 1630, in the middle of

 the Table 2 estimates of .    Using the asymptotic normal approximation to the
 finite sample distribution (Anderson, 1971, p540), a 95 percent confidence

 interval for this estimate is about (857, 16582).       Unsurprisingly, the
 nonparainetric estimate is somewhat noisier than are the parametric ones. The

values of most of the point estimates of            in Table 1, are nonetheless
outside this confidence interval.8

(4)Using data from every fourth quarter, rather than every quarter. This

obviously will reduce any biases induced by seasonal adjustment. it also may

reduce any biases from moving average components due to time aggregation: if

instantaneous consumption is a continuous time random walk, it is well known

that measured cc1 is MACi) with a coefficient of 1/4 (Christiano and

Eichenbaum (1986)); it is straightforward to verify that in such a case,

measured cc4 is MA(1) with a coefficient of 1/22.

     The relationship that was used to derive equation (6) above is


          E(1+r)3[d(l+r)']e+ =                       +
                                     E(i+rYJAct+j        (ct_rw_y11               (9)



This can be rewritten


         tHt + E(1+r)[d(1+r)]e             =                   +
                                               E(l+r)JAc+j         (ct-rwt-y) (10)
                                 14


Under the null, EAc+(ct_rw-Yt) = 0 for all j>0; since e is the univariate

innovation in '                       =   0 for all J>0. Upon calculating the variance
                   Ee+J(YHYt)
of each side of (10), then, and multiplying by (l+r)2-l, we obtain


                          [d(l+r)]2a2        =         +
[(1+r)2_l]var(yHyt) +                            ci2
                                                           [(l+r)2-1]var(c-rwy)       h1

                                             0    c
                                                       +0v'

    The variance      may be consistently (though inefficiently) estimated as

[(l+r)2-l] times the sample variance of every fourth observation on c-rw-y;

  can be consistently (though inefficiently) estimated as (1/4) times the

sample variance of every fourth observation on c-c4. There does not appear

to be any simple way of estimating the left hand side of (11) using every
                                                                               = [d(1)]2o2
fourth observation. We have, however, urn >                   (l/n)var(y-y_)
(Cochrane (1986)). Consider approximating the left hand side of (11) with

          (l/4)var(y-y4)
This obviously can be estimated using data from every fourth observation. Note

that the approximation ignores the [(1+r)2_1Jvar(y_y) term and therefore may

underestimate the left hand side of (11). In particular, if                is an AR(1) or

MA(1) with a positive â€¢   or   e (either of which seems plausible, in light of the

Table 1 estimates), it may be shown that [(l+r)2-1]var(yH-y) Ã·

 a. For either of these two ARMA specifications, then, and perhaps more

generally, if             +       the     implication is once again that consumption is

too insensitive to news about income.

    The variances were calculated for each quarter in four separate tests. (A

more powerful test would of course result from pooling the four sets of

estimates, and performing a joint test. This, however, seemed pointless, in

light of the result.) Thirty observations were available for the first quarter
                                    15


  of the year, thirty one observations for the other quarters. A fifth order

 Newey and West (1987) correction was used in calculating the standard errors.

      The results are in Table 4. The point estimates of
                                                                     are slightly higher
 than in Table 2, indicating some positive serial correlation in
                                                                               The point
 estimates a2 are of course quite similar to the Table 2 estimates of 2 for
                                                                      V
 (p,q) = (0,0). The estimates of 2
                                 aH are, however, so high that consumption
 once again appears to be insensitive to news about income. The statistical

 significance of the rejections is quite strong, though with only 30 or 31

 observations the asymptotic normal approximation perhaps should not be taken

 very seriously.



 4. Conclusions

     The variance bounds test applied here suggests that consumption is even

less sensitive to news about income than the permanent income model predicts.

The test maintained the assumption that income has a unit root (although there

was one nonparametric estimate that is valid even if income is
                                                                       stationary
around a time trend). If, then, income does have a unit root, as is argued in

Mankiw and   Shapiro   (1985) and   Deaton   (1986), a stylized fact is that

consumption is insensitive to news about income. This does not suggest (to me)

liquidity constraints, as is considered in, for example, Flavin (1985).

Extensions of the model that seem more likely to be consistent with consumption

insensitivity include nonseparability of preferences, so that consumption

expenditures in a given period yield utility in future periods (e.g.,

Eichenbaum, Hansen and    Singleton      (1986)), costs of adjusting consumption (e.g.,
Bernanke (1985)) and    habit   persistence (e.g., Deaton (1986)).
Footnotes

1. Mankiw and Shapiro (1985) conclude this in the sense that one will tend to

spuriously find that lagged income helps predict changes in consumption.      It

follows from the sign of the biases reported in Table 2 in Mankiw and Shapiro

(1985), and from the algebra in Flavin (1981, p993), however, that one will

also tend to spuriously find excess sensitivity of changes in consumption to

the income innovation.

2. One key technical condition used in West (1987) is worth noting. This is

that arithmetic differences suffice to induce stationarity in all the

variables in I. This is consistent with most of the permanent income

literature. Exceptions are Nelson (1985) and Watson (1986), who assume that

log differences are required. Incidentally, if I. contains variables in

addition to lagged y, the variance-covariance matrix of the consumption and

income innovations will not be singular, a problem noted in Hall (1986).

3. See equations (9) to (11) below for the intuition behind the (l+r)2-1 term

in equation (5). Equations (5) and (9) are established in West (1987)

(although that paper only studies in detail the implications of the inequality

            for   stock prices and dividends.) Incidentally, equation (5) does not

say that HI depends on r in any simple way, since trtH potentially

varies with r in a complicated manner.

4. The (p+q+1) past values of Ay that are used as instruments in nonlinear

least squares are ae/m, ae/a#1, ... ,                 ae/e1, ...,   ae/3e.
Heteroskedasticity of e conditional on these past values of Ayt was accounted

for.

5. Another extension to the model deserves mention, namely, allowing for

variations in expected returns. While this is a possible avenue for future

research on consumption variability, this is not pursued here. The basic
 reason is that consumption models that allow for such variations still find

 evidence against the model (e.g., Grossman and Shiller (1981)). This suggests

 that simply generalizing the model to allow for this variation will not

 reconcile the consumption and income data, especially since Michener (1984)

 has argued that in general equilibrium, this variation will make consumption

 more sensitive to income than the permanent income model predicts.

 6. Specifically, for the AR(l) process (the MACi) simulation was analogous):

write the Ay process as Ay. =      +        + e.    It was assumed that         =

                 where
                         e=z+x60, with x and z mutually and serially
uncorre].ated zero mean normal random variables. It is routine to use the

formulas in Hansen and Sargent (1980) to calculate y1]. The values of i and

 1
     were chosen to match those estimated in the data, those of       and       so
                                                                  z         x
that       and c,, i1 or 2, would match those estimated in the data and

reported in Table 2. A different random number seed was used to initiate the

generation of the z id x for each of the four different specifications in

Table 3.

7. Even though [d(i)J2 >    [d[(1+r1fl2   in this example, there is no

presumption of an upward bias in general.

8. The 95 percent confidence interval is not valid if the true value of the

spectral density is zero, as would be the case if       is stationary around a

time trend. The interval is valid, however, if        is a mixture of trend

stationary and unit root components, as in Watson (1986).

of an explicit continuous time consumption model.

 I. Description of Data

        The consumption and income data are described in Blinder and Deaton

 (1986). They are real, seasonally adjusted, and per capita, expressed at

 annual rates. Consumption is NIA (national income and product accounts)

 nondurables and services, with (i)clothing and shoes removed, and (ii)state and

 local nontax payments (e.g., tuition payments to state colleges) added in.

 Disposable income is NIA disposable income, with (i)interest payments from

 consumers to business netted out, (ii)state and local notax payments added in,

 and (iii)the 1975:2 tax rebate removed.

        The MPS series for nominal net worth of households comes from unpublished

 quarterly flow of funds data, except that the flow of funds estimate of

 household holdings of stock is replaced by an MPS estimate. The corresponding

 annual flow of funds figures may be found in, e.g., pp 11-15 of Federal Reserve

Board publication G.9 (October 1986) "Balance Sheets of the U.S. Economy, 1946-

85." The series includes tangible and financial assets and liabilities. All

fixed income assets and liabilities are measured at par. Blinder and Deaton

created a real, per capita series for household wealth by first converting

household holdings of government debt from par to market, and then deflating

with the price level appropriate for their measure of nondurables and

consumption.      I multiplied this series by four so that the MPS measure of

income from nonhuman wealth would be expressed at an annual rate.     Hayashi

("The Permanent Income Hypothesis: Estimation and Testing by Instrumental

Variables," , 1982, 895-916) points out that under the Ricardian assumption
that consumers expect future tax liabilities to be required to service

government debt, a nonhuman wealth series should include government debt;
