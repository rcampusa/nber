We investigate whether individuals’ risk preferences change after experiencing a natural disaster,
specifically, the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Exploiting the panels of nationally
representative surveys on risk preferences, we find that men who experienced greater intensity of
the Earthquake became more risk tolerant after the Earthquake. Furthermore, these men gamble
more, which is consistent with the direction of changes in risk preferences. We find no such
pattern for women. Finally, the effects on men’s risk preferences are persistent even five years
after the Earthquake at almost the same magnitude as those shortly after the Earthquake.

1     Introduction

Risk preferences are fundamental determinants of individual decision-making about economic be-
havior, such as saving, investment, and consumption. Standard economic models assume that
individual risk preferences are stable across time (Stigler and Becker, 1977).1 More recently, a
number of studies suggest that individuals’risk preferences and, hence, risk-taking behavior can
be altered by a variety of negative shocks such as early-life …nancial experiences, …nancial crises,
trauma from con‡ict or violence, and natural disasters.2 However, there is little consensus about
the direction in which such negative shocks a¤ects risk preferences. Some of these studies …nd that
negative shocks may induce people to become more risk averse, while others …nd that negative
shocks may make people more risk tolerant.
    A common feature of these studies is that they rely on cross-sectional data collected after
the negative shocks have occurred.3 This can plague the estimates in two ways. First, selective
migration of particular types of individuals may bias the estimates. For example, risk-averse
individuals may be more likely to leave an area after a disaster, and hence, they may not be
observed in post-disaster cross-sectional data. Second, unobserved heterogeneity of individuals
may produce biased estimates under cross-sectional studies. For example, individuals in areas
with frequent disasters may form very di¤erent risk preferences in unobservable ways. At the
same time, the local history of past disasters could be correlated with the negative shock in
consideration, and hence, could bias the estimates.
    In this study, we investigate whether individuals’risk preferences change after they experience a
natural disaster— speci…cally, the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (the Earthquake, hereafter).
In particular, we test whether individuals who live in locations that endured higher intensity of
the Earthquake become either risk averse or risk tolerant.
    The novelty of our study is that we use panel data of 3,221 individuals from 226 municipalities in
    1
      “One does not argue over tastes for the same reason that one does not argue over the Rocky Mountains — both
are there, will be there next year, too, and are the same to all men” Stigler and Becker (1977).
    2
      On one hand, Cassar et al. (2011) and Cameron and Shah (forthcoming) …nd increased risk aversion after
exposure to natural disasters in Indonesia, and Thailand, respectively. Kim and Lee (2013) also …nd that those who
spent their early childhood during the peak of the Korean war remain more risk averse at their adulthood. On the
other hand, Eckel et al. (2009) and Voors et al. (2012) demonstrate decreased risk aversion (i.e., increased risk
tolerance) after exposure to Hurricane Katrina and civil con‡ict in Burundi, respectively. In addition, Malmendier
and Nagel (2011) show that early life …nancial experiences are associated with more conservative investing behavior
in later life, and Cohn et al.(2015) also documents that negative shocks makes …nancial professionals more risk averse
in laboratory experiments. Imas (2014) suggests that these inconsistent …ndings can be explained by individuals’
di¤erential responses to “realized” versus paper losses. See also an excellent review by Haushofer and Fehr (2014).
    3
      Notable exceptions include Sahm (2012) and Guiso et al. (2013). Sahm (2012) uses Health and Retirement
Survey to investigate the e¤ect of life-cycle event on risk preferences but the sample is limited to the elderly over
age 40 and the duration between the pairs of risk measures are 6 years on average. Guiso et al. (2013) use a repeat
survey of a bank’s clients to study the e¤ect of 2008 …nancial crisis. Our study di¤ers from these as our data are
nationally-representative survey covering all types of individuals.


                                                          2
a nationally representative survey. Thus, we can track the changes in risk preferences of the same
individuals before and after the Earthquake to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity.
Furthermore, the panel structure allows us to examine if selective migration takes place in our
data.
       How the Earthquake or negative shocks in general potentially alter individuals’risk preferences
is not well understood. The literature points out that emotional responses to negative shocks
may alter individuals’risk preferences (e.g., Lerner and Keltner, 2001; Loewenstein et al., 2001).
Furthermore, psychology literature suggests that gender can be a factor in‡uencing such emotional
responses.4
       We …nd that men who are exposed to higher intensities of the Earthquake become more risk
tolerant. As for women, we occasionally …nd the opposite patterns (i.e., they become more risk
averse) at the high-intensity locations, although the results for women are not very robust. While
previous studies show that men are less risk averse than women in many dimensions,5 to the best
of our knowledge, ours is the …rst study that documents gender di¤erences in susceptibility of risk
preferences and their direction. Our …ndings suggest that men’s risk preferences are more likely
to change than those of women and that men become less risk averse in response to a negative
shock, despite their already low level of risk aversion.
       In terms of magnitude, as the intensity of the Earthquake increases by 2— which corresponds to
10-fold increase of ground acceleration— the relative risk aversion for men decreases by 5.3 percent
from the mean before the Earthquake for men. Put another way, the size of the reduction is
roughly half of the mean di¤erence in relative risk aversion between men and women before the
Earthquake.
       Our results are robust to a number of potential concerns. First, we verify that selective migra-
tion does not occur in our setting by exploiting the panel structure of our data. Then, we conduct
a variety of speci…cation checks. Our results are hardly a¤ected after controlling for changes in
income, assets, property price, and home ownership. Moreover, our results are robust to di¤erent
ways of constructing the intensity measure and risk preference measures of the Earthquake.
       Throughout our study, the intensity measure used is the seismic intensity of the Earthquake
(Shindo in Japanese), which is a metric of the strength of an earthquake at a speci…c location.
We do not use other metrics, such as the level of radiation and fatality rate, because both these
measures are too concentrated in a small number of municipalities and little variation exists for
   4
     For example, Lerner et al. (2003) document that emotional responses mediate the gender di¤erences in risk
attitudes.

     See, for example, Eckel and Grossman (2008) and Croson and Gneezy (2009) for surveys of economics, and
Byrnes et al. (1999) for a survey of psychology on gender di¤erences in preferences. See also Charness and Gneezy
(2012).

the municipalities covered in our survey. Moreover, we add radiation level and fatality rate as
controls and con…rm that our results on risk preferences are robust to these controls.
    In addition to the change in risk preferences, we ask whether risk-taking behavior is a¤ected
by the Earthquake. We …nd corroborative evidence that men who live in the hardest-hit locations
gamble and drink more as the intensity of the Earthquake increases. However, because risk-
taking behavior is a¤ected not only by risk preferences but also by many other factors (e.g., time
preferences and peer e¤ects), we need to view the results on risk-taking behavior with caution.
    Finally, by comparing the estimates from cross-sectional and panel speci…cations, we demon-
strate that the estimate relying on cross-sectional data collected after the negative shocks may
be biased. In fact, we fail to obtain the same results using cross-sectional speci…cation: men who
were exposed to larger intensity of the Earthquake no longer become more risk tolerant. This
result indicates that the estimate is biased, at least in our setting, by unobserved individual het-
erogeneity, which cross-sectional speci…cation cannot fully control. In fact, we show that, at the
time of the Earthquake, risk-averse individuals tended to live in locations with lower estimates
of future catastrophic earthquakes, implying unobservable di¤erences in risk preference formation
before the Earthquake.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, and Section 3
presents our identi…cation strategy highlighting the di¤erence between panel and cross-sectional
speci…cations. Section 4 reports our …ndings, and Section 5 discusses their implications. Section
6 concludes.


2     Data

2.1   Intensity of the Great East Japan Earthquake

Although Japan has a long history of coping with earthquakes, the 2011 Earthquake is by far
the largest in the country’s history since modern measurement of earthquakes began. It is the
fourth largest earthquake on record in the world with a magnitude of 9.0 on the Richter scale.
The Earthquake occurred in the afternoon of March 11, 2011, triggering a tsunami and causing
more than 15,800 deaths and 3,000 cases of missing people (Fire and Disaster Management Agency,
2013). One of the Earthquake’s features is that its e¤ects spread over a very wide area of East Japan
in various ways. About 130,000 homes were destroyed. Both cellular and landline phones were
dysfunctional over a wide area for a few days (Ministry of Internal A¤airs and Communications,
2011). In addition, approximately 8.6 million households experienced power outages, and 2.3
million households, disruption in water supply (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science


                                                 4
and Technology, 2012). Further planned power outages were inevitable because of the accident at
the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station.
       The degree of negative shock di¤ers signi…cantly, depending on location. As our interest is
to understand how risk preferences are a¤ected by negative shocks, an ideal explanatory variable
would be one that captures the wide variation of negative shocks for people who su¤ered most
severely to people who are not a¤ected at all. One straightforward variable would be distance
from the epicenter of the Earthquake. This variable, however, is not necessarily ideal because it
may not necessarily capture local di¤erences in the intensity of negative shocks— the severity with
which an earthquake hits a particular location depends heavily on subsurface structure. Instead,
the main explanatory variable we use is seismic intensity of the Earthquake, which is a metric of
the strength of an earthquake at a speci…c location (see, e.g., Scawthorn, 2003).6
       The seismic intensity of earthquakes (Shindo) is constructed by the Japanese Meteorological
Association (JMA).7 The JMA operates more than 1,700 monitoring stations to measure the
intensity of earthquakes at each location. People in Japan are very familiar with this intensity
measure, Shindo. In fact, Shindo is regularly used in media coverage for intensity of an earthquake
at each location (it is similar to a weather report). We focus on seismic intensities measured for
the main Earthquake on March 11, 2011. Approximately, an increase of the seismic intensity by
two means 10-fold of acceleration (See Appendix A for details). Our intensity measure is the
weighted average of seismic intensities from the three closest monitoring stations, where weight is
the inverse of the distance between the city hall of the municipality and each monitoring station.
Our results are robust to di¤erent ways of constructing an intensity measure.
       In addition, we collect data on the level of fatalities (which were largely due to the tsunami
following the Earthquake) and radiation (following an accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Plant). However, we use these two measures only as complementary explanatory variables
for a robustness check (in Subsection 4.3) mainly because radiation and fatalities are too concen-
trated in a small number of municipalities and little variation exists for the municipalities covered
in our nationally representative survey data (see Appendix Table A11 for details of these variables).
       Figure 1 shows the intensity of the Earthquake measured by Shindo in quintiles, together with
the location of the epicenter. The darker color indicates higher levels of intensity. As the intensity of
an earthquake depends not only on distance from the epicenter but subsurface structure, there are
reasonable variations in intensity measure, even within the same distance from the epicenter.8 Of
   6
     The magnitude of an earthquake is a metric of the energy released by the earthquake, and hence, takes a single
value for each earthquake, while seismic intensity varies by location.
   7
     Torch (2011) uses seismic intensity as a proxy for maternal stress to study the e¤ects of stress on birth outcomes.
   8
     The correlation between the distance from the epicenter of the Earthquake and our seismic intensity measure at
the municipality level is –0.896 (N=226) in all locations, –0.662 (N=79) in locations with intensity of 4 and higher,

Japan’s 1,724 municipalities as of April 1, 2011, the survey covers 226 municipalities (as described
in Subsection 2.2), which are shown with black outlines in Figure 1. The …gure shows that our
survey data cover throughout Japan, and thus, there is considerable variation in intensity level
among our surveyed municipalities. In addition, the …gure demonstrates that our sample includes
very few coastal municipalities in the high intensity regions, where the vast majority of casualties
were caused by the tsunami. In fact, of our 226 municipalities, only 6 (2.7 percent) report some
population living in ‡ooded areas. In addition, none of the 11 municipalities directly a¤ected by
the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant are covered in the survey.


2.2    Panel survey on risk preference

Our measure of risk preferences is elicited directly from a hypothetical lottery question in the
Japan Household Panel Survey on Consumer Preferences and Satisfaction (JHPS-CPS) in 2011
and 2012. The JHPS-CPS is a nationally representative annual panel survey of the resident
population in Japan. The sample is strati…ed according to two criteria: geographical area and
city size.9 The data are collected using self-administered paper questionnaires, which are hand-
delivered to and picked up from the houses of participating households.10 The initial wave of the
survey was conducted in 2003. The data before the Earthquake are from the 2011 survey and the
data after the Earthquake are from the 2012 survey.11 Both surveys are conducted in January and
February each year. Thus, the data before the Earthquake were collected 1 or 2 months before the
Earthquake, and the data after the Earthquake were collected 10–11 months after the Earthquake.
    The JHPS-CPS asks respondents about their willingness to pay for a hypothetical lottery with
a 50 percent chance of winning JPY 100,000 (USD 1,000) or nothing otherwise.12 Appendix B
shows the exact format of the survey question. A respondent is presented with 8 di¤erent prices
in ascending order, from a price of JPY 10 (USD 0.1) in the …rst row of the survey question to a
price of JPY 50,000 (USD 500) in the last row. For each row, starting from the …rst, a respondent
is required to choose one of two options: buy a lottery ticket at the price (option A) or not buy the
ticket (option B). Thus, the reservation price ( ) should lie in the interval between the two prices.
This is the price at which a respondent switches from option A to option B and the price in the
and –0.837 (N=147) in locations with intensity lower than 4.
   9
     All municipalities are classi…ed into 40 stratums: 10 geographical areas and 4 categories corresponding to pop-
ulation size. The number of sample subjects in each stratum is distributed in proportion to the resident population
aged 20–69 years. The unit of sampling spot in each stratum is the census unit and is selected by random systematic
sampling.
  10
     All respondents are given a JPY 1,500 (USD 15) cash voucher by completing the survey.
  11
     Unfortunately, we cannot use the data before 2011 because the queries on risk aversion di¤er from those used
in 2011 and 2012.
  12
     This approach is similar to that used in Cramer et al. (2002), Hartog et al. (2002) and Guiso and Paiella (2008).



                                                          6
row immediately before the switch. In this study, we de…ne the reservation price as the midpoint
of the two prices.13 This provides an implicit point estimate of the measure of an individual’s risk
preference. Note that the question we use is the only survey question eliciting risk preference in
the JHPS-CPS that is available as panel data.14 Unfortunately, other important measures, such
as time preferences and social preferences, are not available in the panel fashion, and thus, we do
not examine them in this study.
       Respondents who switch more than once (multiple switches) comprise 5.8 percent of the sample
and are eliminated.15 For those who choose option A in all choices (1 percent of the sample), risk
preference is estimated using the lower bound of the reservation price, that is, the price in the last
decision row. Similarly, for those who choose option B in all choices (4 percent of the sample), we
use the upper bound of the reservation price, that is, the price in the …rst decision row.
       Our measure of risk preference has several advantages. First, one cannot easily isolate the
change in risk preference from the change in risk perception because risk perception is likely to
change when risk preference changes. However, we can identify changes in risk preferences owing
to the fact that we present survey respondents with the same explicit stakes and probabilities both
before and after the Earthquake. Second, because of low complexity of the lottery question in the
JHPS-CPS, the nonresponse rate is quite low— 2.4 percent of the original data— in contrast with
a high nonresponse rate observed in previous studies with more complex questions.16 Third, while
the samples in previous studies are highly restricted (e.g., to investors or clients), the measure in
this study is obtained using a large nationally representative sample.
       One concern of self-reported measures based on a non-incentivized hypothetical question is
whether they actually re‡ect an individual’s underlying risk traits. Several studies document that
risk measures obtained by hypothetical survey questions are reliable predictors of actual risk-taking
behavior (e.g., Barsky et al., 1997; Donkers et al., 2001; Anderson and Mellor, 2008; Dohmen et al.,
2011). In order to check the validity of our risk measures, described in detail in what follows, we
simply run regressions of risky behavior on our risk measures. One expects a negative correlation
between risk-aversion measures and risk-taking behavior. Appendix Table A2 con…rms the validity
  13
     We treat the discrete variable for our risk aversion measure as continuous. Because our risk aversion measure is
censored above at the price of JPY 50,000 and below at the price of JPY 10, the econometric methods should account
for the censoring of the risk aversion measure. As a robustness check, we use the estimation method proposed by
Honoré (1992), which explicitly accounts for the censoring of a dependent variable with …xed e¤ects. The results are
nearly identical to those using our basic speci…cation, suggesting that our …ndings are likely una¤ected by treating
the discrete variable for our risk aversion measure as continuous (the results are available upon request).
  14
     Because this is the only question we can use as panel data, we cannot disentangle risk preference and loss
aversion as Callen et al. (2014) did, based on Andreoni and Sprenger (2011).
  15
     As a robustness check for multiple switches, we use the …rst switch as the reported willingness to pay and
re-estimate the models. The estimates are quantitatively unchanged (the results are available upon request).
  16
     For example, Guiso and Paiella (2008) report a 27 percent nonresponse rate.



                                                         7
of our risk measures; the results show a signi…cant correlation between our risk measures and risky
behavior (gambling, drinking, and smoking) with the expected signs.17
       We take two approaches to convert the reservation price ( )— obtained from a respondent’s
choice in hypothetical lottery— to a measure of risk aversion, following Cramer et al. (2002). We
denote Z as a prize of the lottery and          as the probability of winning the prize. In our case, Z is
JPY 100,000 (USD 1,000), and            is 0.5, and thus, the expected value Z is JPY50,000.
       The …rst approach is a simple transformation of the reservation price:


                                   Transformed price = 1              = Z

                                                            = 1       =50; 000                                 (1)


Note that the greater a respondent’s value of transformed price, the more risk averse the respondent
is. In our setting, the values of transformed price only take values between zero and one, where
the value of zero corresponds to the case of perfectly risk-neutral preference.18 The …rst table in
Appendix Table A1 shows the values of transformed price in our settings.
       The second approach is to use the Arrow–Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion (Pratt, 1964),
           00   0
  =      U =U , where U (W ) is a standard concave utility function of wealth, W . In expected utility
theory, the utility of wealth without participation in the lottery is equal to expected utility when
participating at reservation price : U (W ) = (1              )U (W       ) + U (W + Z             ). By taking a
second-order Taylor expansion around U (W ), we obtain an estimate of the Arrow–Pratt measure
of absolute risk aversion as follows


                     Absolute risk aversion = ( Z           )=[(1=2)( Z 2      2 Z +      2
                                                                                              )]               (2)


See Cramer et al. (2002) for details on derivation. Note that the greater a respondent’s value of
absolute risk aversion, the more risk averse the respondent is. In our setting, the values of absolute
risk aversion are bounded below and above in a similar manner to the transformed price, where
the value of zero corresponds to the case of perfectly risk-neutral preference. The …rst table in
Appendix Table A1 reports the values of absolute risk aversion. As shown in Subsection 4.3, our
  17
      Another concern is that our risk measures capture only risk preferences in the …nancial domain. However,
Dohmen et al. (2011) show that risk preferences in di¤erent domains or contexts are not perfectly but strongly
correlated to each other.
   18
      The lottery’s expected value is JPY 50,000 and, thus, risk-averse individuals should be willing to pay less
than JPY 50,000 while risk-loving individuals should opt to pay more than JPY 50,000. Because the maximum
ticket price in our survey is indeed JPY 50,000, risk-loving individuals can only choose up to JPY 50,000, possibly
underestimating risk tolerance. However, this may be of little concern because only a small fraction of respondents
chooses JPY 50,000 (1.4 percent in 2011 and 1.3 percent in 2012).




                                                        8
results are robust to the choice of two risk aversion measures.19
         We also conduct analysis that does not depend how we construct these two cardinal risk-
preference measures in Subsection 4.3. Speci…cally, we exploit the panel nature of the data, and
create an ordinal risk measure that takes 1 if the choice of risk category after the Earthquake is
higher (i.e., more risk-averse) than the one before the Earthquake, –1 if opposite, and 0 if there is
no change. Our results are robust to using this alternative outcome.
         The original data consists of 4,934 respondents in the 2011 survey. The attrition rate is fairly
low at 7 percent. We focus only on those who have no missing values for the lottery question,
risk-taking behavior, age, gender, and household income in both surveys. This procedure reduces
the sample to 3,829. Of those remaining, 198 respondents who switched more than once in the
lottery question are eliminated. Of the remaining 3,631 samples, 147 respondents who moved
municipalities between surveys are eliminated. Of the remaining 3,484 samples, 263 respondents
who drop from the sample in 2012 are eliminated. This produces a …nal sample size of 3,221
respondents located across 226 municipalities. We demonstrate in Subsection 4.2 that migration
and attrition do not seem to a¤ect our results.
         We merge the JHPS-CPS data with the earthquake intensity data at the municipality level
because the municipality is the most detailed unit of location available in the JHPS-CPS.
         Table 1 presents the summary statistics of our …nal sample. The mean of transformed price,
which takes a value between 0 and 1, is 0.8. The intensity measure of the Earthquake takes a
value between 0 and 6.06, with a mean of 2.83. The mean age of the individuals is 52.1 years and
47 percent are male. About 70 percent are employed, more than 80 percent are married, and 55
percent of educational attainment is at the level of high school graduation or below.


3         Identi…cation strategy

We examine the e¤ect of the Earthquake on risk preference using panel data before and after the
Earthquake. Our identi…cation strategy exploits the variation in the intensity of the Earthquake,
while controlling for time-invariant individual characteristics using the individual …xed e¤ects
model. Our basic idea is similar to di¤erence-in-di¤erence: we capture the e¤ect of the Earthquake
by comparing individuals with zero intensity (control group) and non-zero intensity (treatment
group), assuming that the response would have been the same in the absence of the Earthquake.
    19
    Because both risk aversion measures are bounded above and below, we alternatively use the logit transformation
of each risk preference measure as outcomes. This method is conventionally used for regression analysis when a
dependent variable is a fractional variable bounded between zero and one, such as fractions (McDowell and Cox,
2001). The results using logit-transformed values are quantitatively the same (the results are available upon request).
Here, we replace the 0 values in risk preference by 0.0001 when they are logit transformed.



                                                          9
By using panel data, we can isolate the e¤ects of the exogenous treatment (the Earthquake)
by comparing the di¤erences before and after the Earthquake across individuals who experienced
di¤erent levels of intensity of the treatment. The departure from di¤erence-in-di¤erence is that our
treatment is not binary and we can exploit the variation in intensity of the exogenous treatment.
   More formally, the basic model to test whether the Earthquake in‡uences risk preference can
be written as follows
                                Yijt =   t   + Xjt + Zijt + Wi + "ijt                             (3)

where   t   is a year e¤ect and Yijt is a measure of risk preference for individual i at location j at
time t. Xjt is intensity of the Earthquake at location j at time t and takes the value of zero before
the Earthquake. Zijt represents time-varying individual characteristics, Wi represents unobserved
time-invariant individual characteristics, and "ijt is a random shock. The coe¢ cient        captures
the e¤ect of the Earthquake that is common to all individuals and          measures the e¤ect of the
Earthquake on risk preference, depending on the intensity of the Earthquake.
   A major econometric issue is the possible presence of unobserved individual …xed e¤ects, Wi ,
such as di¤erential risk preference formation in response to past earthquake damage. For example,
individuals that have experienced severe earthquakes in the past might form di¤erent social norms
and attitudes toward risk that results in unobservable di¤erences in risk preferences (Postlewaite,
2011). At the same time, severity of the part earthquake damage could be correlated with the
intensity of this Earthquake, Xjt (e.g., because of geological factors), leading to omitted variable
bias.
   Fortunately, we have panel data and can take advantage of the …xed e¤ects estimator to isolate
the e¤ects of the unobserved individual characteristics by considering the following speci…cation


                                   Yijt =      + Xj +     Zijt +   "ijt                           (4)


where       indicates the di¤erence of variables before and after the Earthquake. We denote       Xjt
as Xj for notational convenience (given that Xjt = 0 for all observations before the Earthquake).
The speci…cation is di¤erence-in-di¤erence, with Xj taking a continuous variable (Xj takes a value
of zero if the intensity of the Earthquake is zero.)
   If unobserved characteristics Wi do not play an important role, the estimates from …xed e¤ects
speci…cation (4) and the estimates using cross-sectional speci…cation must be similar. However,
we …nd a signi…cant di¤erence between the estimates from the two speci…cations (see Subsection
5.1), which implies the existence of potential bias resulting from the unobserved …xed e¤ect.
   In addition to the issue of unobserved …xed e¤ects, another econometric issue is possible non-


                                                    10
linearity in the e¤ects of intensity of the Earthquake. In fact, JMA classi…es an intensity level
of four as a level at which “many people are frightened.” Appendix A documents the de…nition
of the JMA’s intensity scale as well as its description of di¤erent levels of intensity. Re‡ecting
the characterization of intensity scale by the JMA, our main speci…cation considers the possibility
that the e¤ect of the Earthquake can be kinked as follows


                          Yijt =      + Xj + I[Xj              4](Xj   4) +      Zijt +    "ijt                    (5)


where the coe¢ cient       captures the additional linear e¤ect of the Earthquake intensity for locations
with intensity higher than four. In addition, we consider speci…cations in which we use I[Xj                      4:5]
and I[Xj      5] instead of I[Xj       4], and most of our results are robust to the change in the cut-o¤
between 4, 4.5, and 5, as shown in Subsection 4.1. We also adopt a speci…cation with X squared
instead of I[Xj      4] to account for the nonlinearity, and most of our results also remain unchanged.
We estimate Equation (5) using ordinary least squares (OLS).20 We cluster the standard error at
the municipality level to allow for arbitrary serial correlation within each municipality (Bertrand
et al., 2004).


4        Results

4.1      Main results

Figure 2 shows the relationship between the intensity of the Earthquake and changes in risk
preference. Here, we plot the changes in residual of transformed price regressed on individual
characteristics.21 Each dot in the graph represents the mean of observations within each bin of 0.2
in intensity measure and the size of the dot re‡ects the number of observations in each bin.22 The
solid …tted line is the lowess curve with a bandwidth of 0.5. Panels (a)–(c) show the …gures for
    20
     Alternatively, one could use estimation models that account for the discrete, ordinary nature of our risk aversion
measure as the dependent variable. However, in short panels, it is known that the …xed e¤ect estimators in discrete
models appear to be biased substantially (e.g., Greene, 2004). Therefore, we rely on …xed e¤ect estimation in linear
models. One concern with our approach is that the risk aversion measure is treated as a continuous variable by
using the midpoint of the interval between the two risk aversion categories. As a robustness check, we construct an
ordinal risk aversion measure that does not rely on the interval of the risk aversion categories described in detail in
Subsection 4.3. The results shown in Appendix Table A7 are essentially unchanged from our main results, suggesting
that our linear model approach probably has no e¤ect on our …ndings.
  21
     Speci…cally, the individual controls we use are age, age squared, a female dummy (only for the full sample),
income, marital status, and education. Alternatively, for robustness checks, we use the logarithm of income or the
dummy variables for each income bracket instead of a continuous measure of income. The results are unchanged
(the results are available upon request). As some marital status and education data are missing, we replace them
with zeros and add a dummy to indicate that they are missing.
  22
     Each bin includes 12.4 municipalities on average, ranging from 1 to 30 municipalities, and 173.5 individuals on
average, ranging from 6 to 400 individuals.



                                                          11
the full sample, men, and women, respectively. We divide the sample by gender as a large body
of literature provides evidence that gender plays an important role in decision making under risk
(e.g., Croson and Gneezy, 2009).
          Panel (a) shows that there is no systematic change in risk aversion with respect to the intensity
of the Earthquake for the full sample. However, Panel (a) masks striking gender di¤erences shown
in Panels (b) and (c) for men and women, respectively. Panel (b) shows that men who live in
locations above the intensity level of roughly four become more risk tolerant as the intensity of the
Earthquake increases (recall that a higher number indicates higher risk aversion).23 Interestingly,
Panel (c) shows that the same pattern is not observed among women. Unlike men, we do not
observe much change in risk preference after the Earthquake, except a slight increase in risk
aversion at very high intensity locations.
          Here, note that risk aversion is much higher among women than men at the level before the
Earthquake. In fact, the mean of risk aversion (transformed price) before the Earthquake is 0.738
for men and 0.868 for women. This observation is consistent with the large body of literature
that documents that men are less risk averse than women in the vast majority of environments
and tasks (for reviews, see Eckel and Grossman, 2008, and Croson and Gneezy, 2009). However,
the literature is silent on whether men’s risk preference is more “malleable” to the experience of
negative events than that of women, and to which direction risk preferences may change. Our
…ndings suggest that men’s risk preferences are more likely to change than those of women and,
furthermore, that men become less risk averse, despite their already low level of risk aversion, at
least in this setting.
          Table 2 con…rms our …ndings in the …gures. Table 2 summarizes the estimates for running spec-
i…cation (5) in which the outcome is the transformed price. Note that a negative coe¢ cient implies
a decrease (increase) in the slope of risk aversion (tolerance) as the intensity of the Earthquake
increases. Columns (1)–(4) show no observable or discernable relationship between the intensity
of the Earthquake and risk aversion among the full sample, as can be seen in Panel (a) in Figure
2.
          However, Column (5) shows that men become more risk tolerant at high intensity locations.
While the estimate of intensity is slightly positive, the sign on the interaction term is negative,
which suggests there is a decline in slope at an intensity of around four. Because the magnitude
of the interaction term (–0.039) is much larger than that of the intensity term (0.009), we can
easily calculate the intensity where the change in risk aversion becomes negative, that is, where
     23
    See the second table of Appendix Table A1 for the transition matrix of risk aversion category before and after
the Earthquake (men only).




                                                       12
men become risk tolerant. Note that in Table 2, we present this level of intensity as Value of X
when       Y = 0 below the row on the estimate of the constant.24 Such intensity level is 5.34, which
is consistent with Panel (b) in Figure 2. Furthermore, we test the null hypothesis that individuals
with intensity level, X larger than 5.34 have          Y = 0. The null is rejected with a p-value of 0.02.
       With regard to magnitude, as the intensity of the Earthquake increases by 2— which corre-
sponds to 10-fold increase of acceleration— above the threshold of 4, our risk aversion measure
decreases by 0.06 [= 2        (–0.039 + 0.009)]. This corresponds to 8.1 percent reduction from the
mean risk aversion of 0.738 before the Earthquake for men. Put another way, the size of the
reduction is roughly half of the mean di¤erence in risk aversion between men and women (0.13 =
0.868–0.738) before the Earthquake.
       Columns (6) and (7) show that our estimates are robust to the alternative intensity thresholds
of 4.5 and 5; the estimates on the interaction term are negative and statistically signi…cant at
the 1 percent level, and the magnitude of the estimates are much larger than those on X. As a
result, the intensity level at which men become risk tolerant is very similar across speci…cations.
Finally, Column (8) shows estimates from a more ‡exible form of speci…cation. Speci…cally, we do
not impose kink and instead include the quadratic of intensity measures. It is reassuring that the
value of intensity measure when         Y = 0 is similar across these di¤erent speci…cations.
       Interestingly, women show the opposite pattern to men. The result in Column (9) suggests
that women become more risk averse at some point above an intensity of 4, speci…cally, 4.9, which
is consistent with Panel (c) in Figure 2.25 Note, however, that the result is barely signi…cant in
Columns (9), (10), and (12) and is not signi…cant in Column (11). While we view the contrast
between men and women as interesting, the results for women are much less robust than those for
men. Thus, henceforth, we focus only on men.


4.2      Selective migration

Selective migration of particular types of individuals has potential to bias the estimate when post-
disaster data are used. For example, risk-averse individuals may be more likely to leave an area
after a disaster (Callen, forthcoming), and hence, they may not be observed in the cross-sectional
data collected after the negative shock. One advantage of panel data is that, in fact, we can
examine whether selective migration takes place.
       First, we test the null hypothesis that the mean risk preference of those who migrated after
  24
     Without any time-varying individual characteristics in the speci…cation (5) (i.e., Zijt = 0), such intensity X
should satisfy Y = + X + (X               4)=0. Thus, X = (4 + )=( + ). In similar vein, we can calculate X
when threshold intensities are 4.5 and 5.
  25
     We estimate the speci…cation (5) fully interacted with a gender dummy and …nd that the slope is di¤erent
between men and women at 1 percent level (results are available upon request).


                                                        13
the Earthquake (N=60) and those who did not (N=1,514) are the same. The null could not be
rejected with a p-value of 0.46, which implies that the risk preferences of those who migrated after
the Earthquake are not statistically di¤erent from those who did not.
       Second, we regress a dummy for migration (1 if migrated after the Earthquake, and 0 otherwise)
on the same set of variables as in Equation (5) to check if the migration decision is correlated with
intensity of the Earthquake. Table 3 shows that migration is not systematically correlated with
intensity of the Earthquake.
       Both these exercises provide no evidence of selective migration after the Earthquake in our
setting. This is probably because our data do not include municipalities that were hit most
severely by the tsunami or directly a¤ected by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Plant. In our analysis, we drop individuals who migrated from the …nal sample because it
is di¢ cult to assign intensity of the Earthquake to such individuals.26
       Furthermore, attrition may plague our results in a very similar way to selective migration.27
We conduct the same procedure to verify that attrition is not a concern in our data. We …rst test
the null hypothesis that the mean risk preference of those who did not complete the survey after the
Earthquake (N=147) and those who did (N=1,514) are the same. The null could not be rejected
with a p-value of 0.975, which implies that the risk preferences of those who did not complete
the survey after the Earthquake are not statistically di¤erent from those who did. Second, we
regress indicators for attrition on the same sets of variables in Equation (5) as we do for selective
migration. Appendix Table A3 demonstrates that attrition is not systematically associated with
intensity of the Earthquake.


4.3      Robustness checks

4.3.1      Income and wealth

An alternative explanation for our …nding is that households and/or individuals hit hardest by
the Earthquake gained an income windfall after the Earthquake. A signi…cant increase in income
might have an e¤ect on risk aversion. We do not include income or assets as controls in the main
regressions in Tables 2 because they are potentially endogenous.
       Broadly speaking, there are two types of income windfall for households that are hit by the
Earthquake.28 One source comprises income transfers from donations by the Japanese Red Cross,
  26
     As a robustness check, we estimate the same speci…cation as (5) using all samples in which we assign the intensity
measures from the municipalities reported in 2011 to those individuals who moved between 2011 and 2012. The
results are essentially unchanged (the results are available upon request).
  27
     The reasons for non-response are available as follows (no breakdown for men is available) : refused (51.3 percent),
moved away (22.9 percent), temporarily absent (7.2 percent), and others (18.6 percent).
  28
     Speci…cally, income is the total income before taxes of all earnings of a respondent’s entire household, including


                                                          14
and other organizations, channeled through local governments to a¤ected households. Require-
ments for eligibility for these transfers include either the loss of a family member or the damage
(half or complete) of housing. In fact, our sample of 226 municipalities includes only 25 munici-
palities that channeled these transfers. In addition, the possibility that the surveyed individuals in
the municipality happened to be eligible for the transfer is extremely small for the municipalities
in our data set because the number of surveyed individuals in each municipality is less than 15
on average. Furthermore, the amount of payment is rather small.29 Hence, by construction of
the dataset, our results are unlikely to be driven by government transfers to households in these
municipalities.
    The second channel of income transfer is compensation from the Tokyo Electric Power Company
(TEPCO) to households and organizations directly a¤ected by the accident at the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The total cumulative payment was roughly JPY 2 trillion (about
US$ 20 billion) at the end of March 2013, which is about 6 times larger than payments via the
…rst channel. Compensation to households is limited to those located in 11 municipalities within
a 30-kilometer radius from the power plant or those speci…ed by the government. None of these
11 municipalities is included in our data set. Thus, the only way TEPCO compensation could
matter systematically to the individuals in our data set is through compensation to organizations,
such as agricultural and …shing cooperatives. Compensation to organizations accounts for 21
percent of total compensation and payment to agricultural and …shing cooperatives (87 percent)
dominates payment to organizations. However, the proportion of workers in these two industries
is very small in the municipalities in our dataset. In fact, among 1,514 men in our sample, only 43
individuals (2.8 percent) work in the agriculture and …shery industries. Even if we limit the sample
to individuals who live in locations hit by an intensity level of more than 4, only 20 individuals
(1.3 percent) work in these two industries.
         Table 4 summarizes our robustness checks against concerns about income transfer.30 To
facilitate the comparison, Column (1) in Table 4 replicates the estimate from our baseline in
Table 2. Column (2) adds interaction of a dummy variable of the intensity measure above four
and a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 for men who work in the agriculture and …shery
industries in order to capture the di¤erential impact of the Earthquake by most a¤ected industries.
The estimates for both intensity and its interaction terms barely change, which is not surprising
bonus payments and transfers. In addition, assets comprise …nancial assets and house ownership; …nancial assets
are the balance of …nancial assets (savings, stocks, bonds, insurance, and so on) of a respondent’s entire household
and house ownership is determined by whether any household member is the owner of the residence.
  29
     For example, a family that lost one family member receives JPY 350,000 (about USD 3,500) as compensation.
  30
     We also conduct the robustness checks for income and assets using the alternative measure of risk preference and
the di¤erent intensity threshold, and …nd that the results are very similar (the results are available upon request).



                                                         15
given that the proportion of workers in these two industries is very low. Column (3) controls for
self-reported income but the estimate is again hardly a¤ected. We need to view this result with
caution because income is reported in brackets of JPY 2 million (roughly USD 20,000 in 2012),
and thus, it is possible that income does indeed change within each bracket.
       To compensate for the rough measure of income, even though it is far from perfect, Columns
(4)–(6) show separate estimates for those who experience an increase, decrease, and no change in
reported income across brackets. Column (4) shows that our results are driven mainly by men
whose income does not change within brackets. Furthermore, it is reassuring that we do not
observe any discernable patterns for the subsample of men who experience an income increase
across brackets in Column (5).
       Our results are also robust to changes in expected future income. We control for two survey
measures for the percentage change in expected income 1 year or 5 years after the survey, instead
of the reported change in current income, as shown in Column (3). The results remain unchanged
(the results are available upon request).
       In addition, we control for assets in Columns (7) and (8). Column (7) controls for assets
measured in brackets of JPY 2.5 million (roughly USD 25,000) and the estimates are hardly
a¤ected. Column (8) adds a dummy that takes the value of 1 if the person owns a house but
the estimates on intensity measure and its interaction are once again una¤ected.31 The result
is in accordance with previous literature that …nds no wealth e¤ects on elicited risk tolerance or
risk-taking behavior (e.g., Sahm, 2012; Brunnermeier and Nagel, 2008). Finally, we control for the
ratio of property values before and after the Earthquake at the municipality level. Column (9)
shows that estimates are unchanged.32


4.3.2      Radiation and fatalities

Throughout the study, we use the intensity of the Earthquake as the measure of the severity of the
Earthquake. However, one may argue that radiation due to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Station may be another factor that a¤ects people’s risk preferences (Goodwin et
al., 2012).33 Another possible intensity measure, which is often used in the literature (especially
  31
     For Columns (7) and (8), we replace the missing value for assets and housing ownership with 0, and add a dummy
for such observations in the estimation. In addition, we drop these observations and perform a re-estimation, but
the estimates are essentially identical.
  32
     Data on property values are not available for …ve municipalities. We replace the missing value with zero and
add a dummy for such observations in the estimation. We also drop these observations and perform a re-estimation
but the estimates are essentially identical.
  33
     Using the data collected 11–13 weeks after the Earthquake, Goodwin et al. (2012) show that anxiety about
future earthquakes and nuclear threats is correlated with changes in both preventive actions (keeping an earthquake
kit and modifying living quarters) and avoidance behavior (avoiding certain foods or going outside, wearing masks,
and contemplating emigration).


                                                        16
in violent con‡icts), is the fatality rate.
    As mentioned in Subsection 2.1, we do not use radiation level or fatality rate as our intensity
measure in the main speci…cation because both measures are too concentrated in a small number of
municipalities and little variation exists for the municipalities covered in our sample. In fact, while
the nuclear accident forced thousands of residents in the vicinity of the plant to evacuate, none
of these municipalities is included in our data. In addition, a very large proportion of fatalities is
due to the tsunami following the Earthquake, and again, very few municipalities in our data set
have a coastline facing the Paci…c Ocean, as seen in Figure 1. In fact, only 6 of 226 municipalities
(2.7 percent) report non-zero population who lived in ‡ooded areas.
    Nonetheless, to assess whether radiation and fatalities are driving our results on changes in
men’s risk preferences, we add the level of radiation and the fatality rate for each municipality to
our baseline speci…cation (5) as controls.34 The results are summarized in Table 5.
    Column (1) in Table 5 replicates the baseline estimate from Table 2 for ease of comparison
across speci…cations. Columns (2) and (3) add the level of radiation and fatality rate, respectively,
while Column (4) adds both measures simultaneously. The estimates on the interaction term are
quantitatively similar to the baseline in Column (1). In addition, the estimates on radiation and
fatalities are not statistically signi…cant.35 Note that we do not claim that radiation and fatalities
do not a¤ect risk preferences; we simply do not have enough variation to precisely estimate their
e¤ects.


4.3.3     Outliers and mean reversion

A potential concern for the results is that they may be driven by outliers. One way to address this
concern is to use M-estimation (Huber, 1964), which puts less weight on residuals that are more
likely to be outliers. In addition, we reestimate the model by excluding some observations that
look like outliers. The results are not di¤erent, as shown in Appendix Table A5.
   34
      Alternatively, as a further robustness check, we exclude subjects who lived in locations hit hardest by the
Earthquake from the estimation sample and re-estimate equation (5). As for radiation, we exclude subjects who
lived in locations exposed to 2.3 Sv/h or more, which is the level adopted as a standard for planned evacuation
zones after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (20 of 226 municipalities, or 8.8 percent of
the sample). As for fatalities, we exclude subjects who lived in locations that reported non-zero population who
lived in ‡ooded areas (6 of 226 municipalities, or 2.7 percent of the sample). The results are similar (the results are
available upon request).
   35
      Some studies show that fear of or risk perception about nuclear power plants increased after the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Plant accident in countries far from Japan, speci…cally in Germany (Goebel et al., 2013) and China
(Huang et al., 2013). Therefore, one may argue that our intensity measure captures the e¤ect of fear among those
who live close to nuclear power plants other than the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. In fact, there are 52 nuclear
power plants in 18 locations across Japan. To address this concern, we control for the log distance from nearby
nuclear power plants interacted with the Earthquake intensity measure. Appendix Table A4 shows that the estimates
hardly change with this control. In addition, the estimate on the distance interacted with the intensity measure is
not statistically signi…cant at the conventional level.


                                                          17
       Another potential concern for the result is whether we may simply capture the mean reversion
of people with high-risk aversion. However, mean reversion is not likely to drive our results. We
are not aware of any event that occurred during the survey before the Earthquake for those who
lived in high-intensity regions. In addition, from our data, we can show that such a concern may
not be valid. We reestimate the same speci…cation (5) in Table 2 by excluding the individuals
whose risk categories are highest and second highest (categories 8 and 9 in Appendix Table A1)
before the Earthquake. Our estimates remain unchanged, as shown in Appendix Table A6.36


4.3.4      Alternative measures of risk preference

To examine whether our results are driven by a particular form of risk preference measure, we
consider two alternative ways to measure risk preferences. First, we construct another cardinal
measure of risk preference de…ned by Equation (2) in Subsection 2.2, absolute risk aversion. We
estimate our baseline speci…cation (Equation (5)) using this alternative risk aversion measure in
Appendix Table A7. The results show similar patterns to the corresponding columns in Table
2, though the estimate on square of intensity measure in Column (4) is marginally insigni…cant.
Though the coe¢ cients across the two tables are not comparable due to the di¤erence in the
de…nition of the two measures, the intensity level at which men become more risk tolerant is
similar across speci…cations. Using the estimates from Column (1) in Appendix Table A7, as the
intensity of the Earthquake increases by 2 above the threshold of 4, absolute risk aversion decreases
by 0.094 [= 2     (–0.059 + 0.012)], which corresponds to 5.3 percent reduction o¤ the mean of 1.758
before the Earthquake. Note that since the relative risk aversion is approximately the product
of absolute risk aversion and wealth (Cramer et al., 2002; Hartog et al., 2002), the change in the
relative risk aversion is also 5.3 percent, which is the same as that of the absolute risk aversion.
Alternatively, the size of decrease is again roughly a half of the mean di¤erence in risk aversion
between men and women (0.177=1.935–1.758) before the Earthquake.
       Second, as an alternative to the cardinal measure of risk preferences that we use so far, we
consider an ordinal risk aversion measure. A potential concern we would like to address is that
  36
    A natural way to examine the mean reversion would be to compare the data between 2010 (two years before
the Earthquake) and 2011 (a year before the Earthquake). Unfortunately, as mentioned in Footnote 11, we cannot
compare 2010 and 2011, because the questions on risk aversion before 2011 di¤er from those used in 2011 and 2012.
Instead, we compare the data between 2009 and 2010 which asks the same (but di¤erent from those of 2011 and 2012)
questions for measuring risk aversion though such comparison is not necessarily ideal because elicitation technique
are di¤erent between two years (a matching technique in 2009 and a choice technique in 2010). Lévy-Garboua et al.
(2011) point out that di¤erences in elicitation technique a¤ect the levels of risk aversion measures but we are not
aware of any evidence indicating that di¤erences in elicitation technique induce changes in these measures over the
intensity of the Earthquake, which is our focus. We estimate our main speci…cation (5) using the data in 2009 and
2010 and …nd no systematic di¤erence in risk preferences measures in the pre-period years (the results are available
upon request).



                                                        18
our results could be driven by the cardinal nature of the risk aversion measure as well as potential
dependence on the particular way we construct these cardinal measures. To mitigate this concern,
we construct an ordinal measure that takes 1 if the choice of risk category after the Earthquake
is higher (i.e., more risk-averse) than that before the Earthquake, –1 if the opposite is the case,
and 0 if there is no change between the two surveys. Appendix Table A8 shows that the result is
very similar using this measure. The intensity level at which the change in risk aversion becomes
negative is almost the same across speci…cations as well as those reported in Table 2 and Appendix
Table A7, where the outcomes are cardinal risk preference measures.


4.3.5    Alternative measures of intensity

Finally, Appendix Table A9 demonstrates the robustness of our results to di¤erent ways of con-
structing the intensity measure. Column (1) replicates our baseline estimates; we use the weighted
average of the three closest monitoring stations. As noted in Subsection 2.1, the weight is the
inverse of the distance from the city hall of each municipality to each monitoring station. Columns
(2)–(4) construct the intensity measure using only the two closest monitoring stations, the simple
average of intensity at the three closest stations, and the only closest station. The estimates are
quantitatively similar to the baseline estimates, and thus, the intensity levels at which men become
risk tolerant are quite similar across speci…cations.37


5     Discussion

5.1     Panel vs. cross-sectional estimates

The biggest advantage of our research design is that our data comprise a panel, and thus, we can
track changes in risk preferences among the same individuals before and after the Earthquake.
To the extent that unobserved time-invariant individual characteristics are correlated with both
the intensity of the Earthquake and risk preference, there is potential for an omitted variable bias
in the estimates obtained from cross-sectional data collected only after the negative shocks have
occurred (i.e., using only “after” data), which is often the case in the literature.
  37
     One may be concerned also with measurement error in the intensity measure. We use the location of residence
to assign the severity of the Earthquake. However, the Earthquake took place on a weekday (Friday) afternoon, so
some adult men were probably at work. Thus, their assigned value of earthquake severity is possibly measured with
an error. To mitigate this concern, we exclude men whose commute to work takes 15 minutes or longer (remaining
N = 564), and 30 minutes or longer (remaining N = 753). The results are quantitatively similar. In fact, with an
intensity threshold of 4, the value of the intensity measure (X) when Y =0 is 5.06 when N = 564 and 4.93 when N
= 753 (the results are available upon request). In any case, measurement error in the intensity measure causes our
estimates to be at the lower bound because of attenuation bias.




                                                       19
       Past experience of earthquakes can be such an example, as it may be correlated with both for-
mation of risk preferences and intensity of the Earthquake. For instance, individuals in areas that
were damaged severely by earthquakes in the past might form di¤erent social norms (Postlewaite,
2011), which can a¤ect risk preference formation in an unobserved way. At the same time, the
local history of earthquakes could be correlated with the intensity of the Earthquake.
       In fact, Figure 3 shows that there are substantial regional variations in pre-Earthquake risk
preference measures.38         These regional variations before the Earthquake indicate that studies
that rely on cross-sectional data can be biased, even if the location of the earthquake is indeed
random. For example, if the earthquake occurs near regions where individuals with high (low)
pre-earthquake risk measures live, a cross-sectional study may …nd a spurious positive (negative)
relationship between the severity of the earthquake and the risk aversion measure, even in the
absence of any changes in risk preferences.
           While the exact reason for such regional variations is outside the scope of the current
study, Figure 4 shows that before the Earthquake, risk-averse individuals indeed tended to live
in locations with lower probability of future catastrophic earthquakes, predicted by a Japanese
government agency using the criteria for the probability of experiencing a large earthquake in
the next 30 years (see Appendix Table A11 for details of this variable).39 To the extent that
such residential choice and/or formation of risk preference are driven by unobserved individual
characteristics that the cross-sectional model cannot fully account for— such as physical and mental
stress tolerance and susceptibility to local social norms (Postlewaite, 2011)— the estimates based
on the cross-sectional data after the natural disaster can be biased, at least in this setting.40
       To investigate whether such unobserved heterogeneity is present and indeed biases the estimates
of cross-sectional speci…cation in practice, we run the same speci…cation as (5), but this time use
the cross-sectional data collected after the Earthquake and compare it to the estimate from the
panel speci…cation. The results on comparing the two speci…cations are reported in Table 6. To
facilitate the comparison, Column (1) replicates the results from the baseline speci…cation in Table
2 using panel data. Column (2) reports the estimates based on cross-sectional data collected after
  38
     We control for the usual individual covariates (age, age squared, income, marital status, and education) and
plot the residuals.
  39
     Interestingly, such a pattern is more apparent among women than men. Of course, it is di¢ cult to separate
whether this result re‡ects residential sorting (i.e., more risk-averse people migrate to safer locations) or di¤erential
formation of risk preferences at each location. Using data from Germany, Jaeger et al. (2010) and Bauernschuster
et al. (2014) show that individuals who are more willing to take risks are more likely to migrate. On the other hand,
Dohmen et al. (2012) document that risk preference among children is signi…cantly related to the prevailing risk
preferences in the region, controlling for parental risk preferences.
  40
     As a robustness check, we add these pre-Earthquake hazard predictions as well as their interaction terms with
intensity measure to our baseline speci…cation (5) as controls. The estimates are unchanged (the results are available
upon request).



                                                           20
the Earthquake without any individual controls. Column (2) shows that the coe¢ cient on the
interaction term is no longer statistically signi…cant and the magnitude of the coe¢ cient is much
smaller than the estimate reported in Column (1). In addition, the sign is di¤erent from that
of Column (1). One may argue that the di¤erence between Columns (1) and (2) is explained by
a lack of proper individual controls. To address such a concern, we add observable individual
controls, speci…cally, age, age squared, and income in Column (3). However, the estimate on the
interaction term is not statistically signi…cant at the conventional level either.41 Furthermore, the
estimate on the interaction term in Column (3) barely changes from that in Column (2). This
result implies that unobserved individual characteristics that are positively correlated with risk
aversion are more likely to cause upward bias of the estimate obtained from cross-sectional data
in our setting.
       In order to test our claim further, we test the null hypothesis that the explanatory variables are
uncorrelated with unobserved individual-speci…c error.42 If the null hypothesis were rejected, then
it would be necessary to consider a model that accounts for the correlation between unobserved
individual-speci…c error and the explanatory variables. We use a cluster-robust version of the
Hausman test based on the di¤erence between the …xed e¤ect estimator and the random e¤ect
estimator, proposed by Wooldridge (2002). The statistics of a Wald test show the null hypothesis
is rejected: 20.5 (p-value = 0.0001). Again, this …nding supports the notion that the estimates
obtained from a cross-sectional approach are likely to be biased.


5.2       Risk-taking behavior

So far, our focus has been on how the Earthquake alters individuals’ risk preferences. In this
section, we examine whether risk-taking behavior, such as drinking, also changes with the intensity
of the Earthquake. It is important to mention that because risk-taking behavior can be a¤ected
by many factors other than risk preferences (e.g., time preferences and peer e¤ects), we have to
view the results on risk-taking behavior with caution.43
       Figure 5 plots the proportion of people who drink 5 or more 12 oz-cans of beer or its equivalent
almost every day. Following Figure 2, we plot the changes in outcomes of residuals regressed on
individual covariates in relation to the intensity of the Earthquake. Panels (a)–(c) show the …gures
  41
     Recognizing the sample size reduction due to missing values, we further add the following controls: marital
status, employment status, …nancial assets, house ownership, and years of education. However, the estimate is
quantitatively unchanged (the results are available upon request).
  42
     The test is conducted using the “xtoverid” command in Stata software, which is developed by Scha¤er and
Stillman (2006).
  43
     Unfortunately, the survey we use does not have questions on time preference and social preference in a panel
manner.




                                                       21
for the full sample, men, and women, respectively. Panel (b) shows an increasing trend of intense
drinking at very high intensity locations as the intensity of the Earthquake increases among men.
While we see similar patterns among women in Panel (c), the magnitude is much smaller.
    Table 7 summarizes the estimates from running speci…cation (5) for the following three forms
of risk-taking behavior for men: gambling, drinking, and smoking.44 Note that all the variables
we construct here capture the most extreme form of behavior that we can observe in the data.45
Speci…cally, a gambling dummy takes one if the person is engaged in gambling (such as horse
racing and Japanese pinball, or pachinko) at least once a week. Similarly, a smoking dummy takes
1 if the person smokes more than 30 cigarettes a day. A drinking dummy is the same variable
as in Figure 5. The mean of gambling, drinking, and smoking dummies among men before the
Earthquake is quite low— 14.5, 2.4, and 2.4 percent, respectively.
    Column (1) shows the estimates for gambling. The interaction term is positive and statistically
signi…cant, and much larger in magnitude than the negative coe¢ cient on intensity. This result
suggests that men who live in locations hit by an intensity level higher than four become more
engaged in gambling as the intensity of the Earthquake increases. This result is consistent with our
results that men become more risk tolerant after the Earthquake. In addition, Column (2) shows
that men in these locations become more engaged in heavy drinking, even though the estimate
on the interaction term is marginally statistically signi…cant. Column (3) shows that we do not
observe a similar pattern for smoking.
    An alternative interpretation of our results is that men who lost their jobs because of the
Earthquake have spare time for risk-taking behavior, such as gambling and drinking. However,
job loss does not seem to drive our results. First, we control for the change in employment status,
recognizing its endogeneity. Second, we limit the sample to men whose employment status does
not change before and after the Earthquake. The point estimates are quantitatively una¤ected in
either case (the results are available upon request).46 For completeness, we present the result for
women in Appendix Table A10. The results do not show any e¤ects on risk–taking behavior for
women.47
  44
     Even though our risk measure is based on the …nancial question, our analysis on risk-taking behavior do not
examine …nancial risk-taking behavior (e.g., saving, investment, and portfolio choice). This is because …nancial risk-
taking behavior is confounded with the change in risk perception and risk preferences. Moreover, our data includes
only a very coarse measure of such behavior.
  45
     In fact, we do not observe any statistically signi…cant change in the mean number of drinks, gambling, and
cigarettes (the results are available upon request).
  46
     In addition, we attempt to limit the sample to retired men (i.e., those whose income and time available are less
subject to change) but the sample size is too small (N=142) to gain any meaningful estimate.
  47
     Note that the mean of each outcome among women before the Earthquake is by order of magnitude smaller
than that of men, making it hard to detect any changes, if any.




                                                         22
5.3    A potential mechanism: Emotional responses

Thus far, we show solid evidence that men who are exposed to higher intensities of the Earthquake
become more risk tolerant. However, how does the experience of high intensity of the Earthquake
alter men’s risk preferences? The literature points out that emotional responses to negative shocks
may alter risk preferences (e.g., see Loewenstein et al., 2001, for a “risk as feelings”framework). In
addition, many studies document the relationship between anxiety/stress and risk-taking behavior,
such as gambling and drinking (e.g., Coman et al., 1997; Dawson et al., 2005). While it is beyond
the scope of our study to understand fully the mechanism behind our …ndings, we attempt to shed
light on a potential underlying mechanism here.48
    Fortunately, the survey collects three variables that may be related to the emotional stakes of
respondents. Speci…cally, the survey asks respondents to indicate how well each of the following
applies to them: feeling stressed lately (“stressed”); feeling depressed lately (“depressed”); or have
not been sleeping well lately (“sleep problems”). Each variable is answered on a scale of 1–5, where
1 means “particularly true for me” and 5 means “does not hold true at all for me.” Therefore, a
higher score indicates that respondents have less mental/emotional issues.
    Because these variables are highly positively correlated, we construct a summary index measure
by taking the unweighted average of the standardized values of three emotional variables. For each
variable, the standardized value is calculated by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard
deviation using two years of data, so that each component of the index has a mean of zero and
standard deviation of one. The aggregation improves the statistical power to detect e¤ects that
are in the same direction among similar outcomes (Kling et al., 2007).49 One limitation of this
approach is that we implicitly weight each outcome equally, which may not be appropriate.
    Table 8 summarizes the estimates from running speci…cation (5), in which the outcome is
the summary index measure. Note that the higher the score, the lower the mental issues of
the individual (i.e., he or she is more mentally healthy). Column (1) for men shows that the
interaction term is negative and statistically signi…cant, and much larger in magnitude than the
positive coe¢ cient on intensity measure. This result suggests that men who live in locations hit
by an intensity level higher than four become less mentally healthy.50 This pattern is consistent
   48
      There is a growing body of literature in economics on the e¤ects of emotions (e.g., fear, sadness, and anger)
on decision making under risk, especially in laboratory settings in which …lms or stories are often used to induce
emotions. For example, see Raghunathan and Pham (1999), Fehr-Duda et al. (2011), Kugler et al. (2012), Tre¤ers
et al. (2012), Drichoutis and Nayga (2013), Campos-Vazquez and Cuilty (2014), and Conte et al. (2014).
   49
      Another approach of aggregation is to calculate the average standardized treatment e¤ect in which the coe¢ cient
of regression for each outcome is divided by the standard deviation of each outcome to be standardized, and a simple
average of all standardized coe¢ cients is calculated. See Kling and Liebman (2004) and Finkelstein et al. (2012) for
this approach to aggregation. The approach yields very similar estimates (the results are available upon request).
   50
      Some studies document the impact of natural disasters on short- and medium-run mental health (Frankenberg



                                                         23
with our results that men become more risk tolerant and engage more in risk-taking behavior after
the Earthquake at high intensity locations. Interestingly, Column (3) shows that the estimate on
the interaction term for women is not statistically signi…cant at the conventional level.51
    An alternative explanation for these results is that men who lost jobs due to the Earthquake
have greater mental issues. In fact, some studies document the link between job loss and mental
health (e.g., Burgard et al., 2007; Schaller and Stevens, 2014). Therefore, we control for change
in employment status, once again recognizing its endogeneity, in Column (2). The estimate is
essentially unchanged.
    We cannot conclude that emotional responses drive our results on changes in risk preferences
because there are many alternative explanations. However, it is interesting that the emotional
response patterns correspond to those of risk preferences and risk-taking behavior, and that we
observe such a strong pattern only among men, while the pattern among women is much weaker.


6    Conclusion

Attitudes toward risk under uncertainty are the key determinants of economic decision making.
Standard economic models assume that risk preferences are stable across time but recent studies
suggest that risk preferences may be altered by various shocks. However, little is yet known how
risk preferences can be altered.
         To shed light on this research question, we test whether experience of the Great East Japan
Earthquake alters risk preferences of individuals. We exploit a unique panel dataset that enables us
to track changes in risk preference of the same individuals before and after the Earthquake, unlike
previous studies that use cross-sectional data collected only after the negative shocks occurred.
Furthermore, the panel structure of our data allows us to address the issue of selective migration.
         We …nd that men who experienced higher intensity of the Earthquake become more risk
tolerant. Furthermore, we …nd corroborative evidence that these men become more engaged in
gambling and drinking.
         This study may be especially important because natural disasters are becoming increas-
ingly prevalent all over the world, including in developed countries. Past studies have predomi-
nantly examined cases in developing countries. Our results show that the risk preferences of people
in Japan— a developed country with a history of coping with frequent natural disasters— are also
a¤ected by a very large negative shock.
et al., 2008; Paxson et al., 2012; Rhodes et al., 2010).
  51
     Note that we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the estimate on the interaction term I[Xj 4](Xj 4) are
the same for male and female ( 2 (1) = 0.48 (p-value = 0.4868)). The estimates come from Columns (2) and (4) in
Table 8.


                                                      24
        Our study has some limitations. First, we can examine the e¤ects of the Earthquake
on only a limited number of risk-taking behavioral forms, such as gambling. Second, we do not
examine the persistence of such changes in risk preferences because of data limitation. Third,
we cannot fully understand the mechanism of how experience of high intensity of the Earthquake
alters individuals’risk preferences. The intensity measures of the Earthquake we use indeed capture
the degree of shock physically felt by each individual, and thus, such shocks can plausibly a¤ect
people’s risk preferences. While we show some suggestive evidence of emotional responses stories,
it is impossible to identify whether our results are driven entirely by the emotional responses, by
other channels, or by combinations of these channels. These questions are beyond the scope of our
study but clearly remain as an avenue for future research.

Appendix A: JMA seismic intensity scale (Shindo)
    Various seismic intensity scales are used in different countries to measure the degree of
shaking at a specific location. The seismic intensity scale by Japanese Meteorological Association
(JMA) is used in Japan and is computed using acceleration data for each monitoring station. After
adjusting the raw digital acceleration data to the adjusted acceleration (a gal), the JMA seismic
intensity scale (I) can be obtained by I=2log10a+0.94. Thus, the measure can be considered
essentially as the logarithm of the acceleration. In other words, an increase of the JMA intensity
scale corresponds to an exponential increase in acceleration. Approximately, an increase of JMA
seismic intensity scale by two means 10-fold of acceleration. For details, see the JMA
announcement describing seismic intensity (in Japanese, last assessed on July 30, 2014)
http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/hakusho/nc/k19960215001/k19960215001.html

                 Figure 1. Seismic Intensity of the Great East Japan Earthquake




Note: The epicenter of the Earthquake (38.322°N 142.369°E) is marked with a cross. Of the 1,724
municipalities in Japan on April 1, 2011, 226 municipalities in our survey are shown with black outline.
The intensity of the earthquake comes from the seismic intensity of the Earthquake (Shindo in Japanese),
which is a metric of the strength of the earthquake at a specific location, and is constructed by the Japanese
Meteorological Association (JMA). See the main text for construction of our measure and Appendix Table
A13 for the source.

Note: The data are from the JHPS-CPS. Risk aversion on the y-axis is the transformed price. See the main text for construction of the variable. The seismic
intensity of the Earthquake (Shindo in Japanese) on the x-axis is a metric of the strength of the earthquake at a specific location. We plot the changes in
residual of transformed price regressed on individual characteristics (age, age-squared, gender (for full sample only), income, marital status, and years of
education). Each dot in the graph represents the mean of observations within each bin of 0.2 in intensity measure and the size of the dot reflects the
number of observations in each bin. The solid fitted line is a lowess curve with a bandwidth of 0.5. The vertical dotted lines correspond to seismic intensity
of four. In total, there are 3,221 individuals and 226 municipalities. We address the potential concern of outliers in Section 4.3.3.

Note: Risk aversion before the Earthquake on the y-axis is the residual of transformed price
regressed on individual characteristics (age, age-squared, gender, income, marital status, and
years of education). In total, there are 47 prefectures in Japan. The null hypothesis that
residualized risk aversion at each prefecture is the same is rejected at the 1 percent level
(F(46, 225) = 265.65, p-value = 0.0000).

Note: Pre-Earthquake hazard prediction on the x-axis is the probability of future catastrophic
earthquake, predicted by a Japanese government agency with the criterion being the probability of
experiencing a large earthquake in the next 30 years (see Appendix Table A13 for details). Risk
aversion on the y-axis is the residual of transformed price regressed on individual characteristics
(age, age-squared, gender, income, marital status, and years of education). See the main text for
construction of the variable. The line is a lowess curve with a bandwidth of 0.3.

Note: The data are from the JHPS-CPS. The y-axis is the changes in residual of the fraction of people who report drinking 5 cans of beer (12 oz. per can) or
its equivalent a day, almost every day, regressed on individual characteristics (age, age-squared, gender (for full sample only), income, marital status, and
years of education). The seismic intensity of the Earthquake (Shindo in Japanese) on the x-axis is a metric of the strength of the earthquake at a specific
location. Each dot represents the mean of observations within each bin of 0.2 and the size of the dot reflects the number of observations in each bin. The
solid fitted line is a lowess curve with a bandwidth of 0.5. The vertical dotted lines correspond to seismic intensity of four. In total, there are 3,221
individuals and 226 municipalities.

Note: Outcome is the simple average of the standardized values of three emotion variables:
“stress,” “depression,” and “sleep problems.” All emotion variables are based on
respondents indicating on a 5-point scale how well each of the questions applies to them.
The “Stress” question asked whether a respondent has been feeling stressed lately. The
“Depression” question asked whether a respondent has been feeling depressed lately. The
“Sleep problems” question asked whether a respondent has not been sleeping well lately. A
scale of 1 means “particularly true for me” and 5 means “does not hold true at all for me.”
Therefore, a higher score indicates that the respondent has less mental/emotional issues (i.e.,
is mentally healthier). X is the seismic intensity of the Earthquake (Shindo in Japanese), a
metric of the strength of an earthquake at a specific location. Columns (2) and (4) control for
employment status. Significance levels are *p < 0.10, **p < 0.05, and ***p < 0.01. Standard
errors clustered at the municipality are reported in parentheses. Results for specifications
with (X – 4.5) * 1[X ≥ 4.5], (X - 5) * 1[X ≥ 5], and X-squared are very similar (available
upon request).

     smoking dummy takes 1 if the person smokes more than 30 cigarettes per day.

Note: Outcome is a dummy that takes one if the person drops from the sample in 2012 (after the
Earthquake). The attrition rate is 8.9 percent (147 of 1,661 respondents). X is the seismic intensity
of the Earthquake (Shindo in Japanese), a metric of the strength of an earthquake at a specific
location. Significance levels are *p < 0.10, **p < 0.05, and ***p < 0.01. Standard errors clustered at
the municipality are reported in parentheses. Covariates in Columns (2) and (4) are age, age squared,
and income. Results for specifications with (X – 4.5) * 1[X ≥ 4.5], (X - 5) * 1[X ≥ 5], and
X-squared are very similar (available upon request).

       are *p < 0.10, **p < 0.05, and ***p < 0.01. M-estimation (Huber, 1964) minimizes the residual function which puts less weight on residuals that are more
       likely to be outliers. M-estimation is run using the “robreg” user-provided package in Stata software (Jann, 2010). Standard errors for OLS are clustered at
       the municipality and those for M-estimation are robust standard errors as suggested by Croux et al. (2003). Value of X when ΔY=0 is the level of intensity
       measure (X) where change in risk aversion (ΔY) switches signs.

Standard errors clustered at the municipality are reported in parentheses. A gambling dummy takes
one if the person is engaged in gambling once or more a week. A drinking dummy takes 1 if the
person drinks 5 or more cans of beer (12 oz. per can) or its equivalent a day almost every day. A
smoking dummy takes 1 if the person smokes more than 30 cigarettes per day. Results for
specifications with (X – 4.5) * 1[X ≥ 4.5], (X - 5) * 1[X ≥ 5], and X-squared are very similar

1. Intensity of the Earthquake
   Detail: http://www.kyoshin.bosai.go.jp/kyoshin/quake/
   Accessed: 12:32pm CST, Sep 13, 2013
       Data on seismic intensity of the Earthquake is obtained from the Earthquake and
   Volcano Data Center, National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster
   Prevention (NIED), Japan. The Center maintains a strong-motion seismograph network
   (K-NET, Kik-net) that includes more than 1,700 observation stations distributed
    uniformly every 20 km, covering Japan. The seismic intensity data as well as the
    geocode information of each observation station are collected for all major earthquakes
    in Japan.


2. Radiation
   Detail: https://mapdb.jaea.go.jp/mapdb/portals/60/
   Accessed: 3:55pm CST, March 11, 2014
        Data on radiation are collected by the Airborne Monitoring Survey of the Ministry
   of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan. The data were
   collected by airplane flight with altitudes between 150 and 300m. The flight paths had
    a width of at most 5 km and cover almost all municipalities in Japan. The air dose rate
    of radiation (µSv/h) is adjusted to reflect the number at a height of 1 m above the
    ground. This is the only radiation survey that covered all municipalities across Japan
    after the Earthquake and accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The
    survey was conducted between June 22, 2011 and May 31, 2012. Most of the affected
    municipalities were surveyed in 2011 while some of the less or almost non-affected
    areas, such as Hokkaido, Hyogo, Kyoto, Mie, Shiga, Shimane, and Tottori, are
    measured after March 2012.


3. Pre-Earthquake Hazard Prediction
    Detail: http://www.j-shis.bosai.go.jp/download
    Accessed: 12:54pm CST, March 12, 2014
        This earthquake prediction is based on a 2010 report of the National Seismic
    Hazard Maps for Japan by the Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion of the
    Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan. The report


                                            13
    presents a detailed prediction on the probability of earthquake occurrence at a 250 m
    mesh code level. The prediction combines earthquake occurrence models, seismic
    source models, and subsurface structure models to calculate the predicted probability
    of different intensity levels at each mesh code level.


4. Fatality Rate
   Detail: http://www.stat.go.jp/info/shinsai/zuhyou/data0422.xls
   Accessed: 12:30pm CST, Sep 13, 2013
         Fatality rate is created from the number of fatalities collected by the Fire and
    Disaster Management Agency (Shobo-cho, Saiagi Taisaku Honbu in Japanese) of the
    Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan. The number is as of March
    11, 2013, two years after the Earthquake. The numbers of deaths and missing people
    are reported at the municipality level for each affected municipality. We use the natural
    logarithm of one plus the numbers of deaths and missing people per million at the
    municipality level.


5. Property value
   Detail: http://nlftp.mlit.go.jp/ksj/jpgis/datalist/KsjTmplt-L01-v1_1.html
    Accessed: 11:28am, CST, June 26, 2014
         Property value data are constructed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
    Transport and Tourism for the purpose of property tax evaluation based on the
    transaction price of nearby properties and other related factors. Property values as of
    January 1 for each year are published and the original data include more than 26,000
    properties. We use the change of property values for the same property between 2011
    and 2012 and take took a simple average of all properties located in each municipality.
