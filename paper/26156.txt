                                          ABSTRACT

We link future members of Congress to the de-anonymized 1940 census to offer a uniquely
detailed analysis of how economically unrepresentative American politicians were in the 20th
century, and why. Future members under the age of 18 in 1940 grew up in households with
parents who earned more than twice as much as the population average and who were more than
6 times as likely as the general population to hold college degrees. However, compared to
siblings who did not become politicians, future members of Congress between the ages of 18 and
40 in 1940 were higher-earners and more educated, indicating that socioeconomic background
alone does not explain the differences between politicians and non-politicians. Examining a
smaller sample of candidates that includes non-winners, we find that the candidate pool is much
higher-earning and more educated than the general population. At the same time, among the
candidate pool, elections advantage candidates with higher earnings ability and education. We
conclude that barriers to entry likely deter a more economically representative candidate pool, but
that electoral advantages for more-educated individuals with more private-sector success also
play an important role.

1        Introduction

American politicians are much wealthier and more educated than the general population
(e.g., Carnes 2013, 2018; Eggers and Klasnja 2018). To what extent does this reflect a sys-
tem that blocks people of less privileged backgrounds from seeking political office, and to
what extent does it reflect a system that is open to a broad set of candidates but which
favors higher-earning and more-educated individuals electorally? Existing data reflects the
wealth and educational backgrounds of winning candidates, but because it lacks analogous
individual-level data for non-politicians, it does not allow researchers to compare the earn-
ings ability and education of politicians to non-politicians with similar socioeconomic back-
grounds. Existing data also rarely details the socioeconomic status of politicians' parents,
and it does not allow for the comparison of the backgrounds of losing candidates to winning
candidates. These constraints have prevented us from understanding in greater detail the in-
equality of socioeconomic backgrounds in the political system and the different mechanisms
by which the political process might generate a highly unrepresentative legislature.
       To overcome these issues, we link future members of Congress to the full-count, de-
anonymized 1940 U.S. Census, allowing us to observe their education, occupation, earnings,
geographical location, and demographic characteristics along with those of roughly 45 million
similarly aged Americans.1 This dataset allows us to go beyond existing work in three main
ways.
       First, our dataset gives us fine-grained information on the parents of children who go
on to become members of Congress, allowing us to offer a uniquely detailed picture of
how unrepresentative the backgrounds of members of Congress were in the mid-to-late 20th
century. Future members of Congress who were below the age of 18 in 1940 grew up in

1
    We are by no means the first scholars to use historical census records to study American politics. For
    example, Querub´   in and Snyder (2013) uses historical census data to evaluate the degree to which 19th-
    century politicians were able to enrich themselves in office. Hall, Huff, and Kuriwaki (2019) uses the 1860
    census to investigate the link between slaveownership and fighting for the Confederacy in the Civil War.
    But ours is the first paper to our knowledge to use historical census data to analyze the process of political
    selection in America.

                                                         1
households with average earnings more than twice as large as the population average, and
had parents who were more than six times as likely as the general population to hold college
degrees.
   Second, we take advantage of the scale and detail of our data to evaluate the earnings abil-
ity and educational attainment of future politicians compared to socioeconomically similar
non-politicians. We track family members across censuses so that we can compare politi-
cian and non-politician siblings to one another, thereby holding socioeconomic advantages
fixed as in Dal B´
                 o et al. (2017). Using this approach, we find that brothers who entered
politics had higher levels of education than their non-politician siblings, on average, had
higher earnings, and were substantially more likely to have non-wage income. We also find
that future members of Congress earned significantly more in 1940 than non-politicians of
the same occupation, education, socioeconomic background, place of birth, and geographical
location. These comparisons suggest that members of Congress tend to be highly successful
in the private sector before becoming politicians, even compared to non-politicians with the
same socioeconomic advantages.
   Third, we study the role of elections in this selection process. The pattern of high in-
equality plus strong selection for individuals with strong private-market skills and high levels
of education that we document could indicate that elections favor these types of candidates,
or it could reflect a process in which there are high financial barriers to entering politics, so
that only high earners can afford to become viable candidates in the first place (Bonica 2017;
Carnes 2018). To shed light on this, we use historical newspapers to link candidates who
run for office between 1940 and 1950 to the 1940 census (this sample is important because
it includes losing candidates in addition to winning candidates.)
   Using this sample, we find that the candidate pool as a whole is highly unrepresentative of
the population of similar citizens who do not seek political office. We also find that winning
candidates are higher earners and have higher levels of education than losing candidates,
on average, and this gap is somewhat larger than the gap between the losing candidates


                                               2
and the population of non-politicians. This suggests to us that there are significant barriers
to entry, but also that the electoral process considerably advantages higher-earning and
more-educated candidates.
       Our work is most closely related to Dal B´
                                                o et al. (2017), which studies the process of
political selection in Sweden using individual-level registry data. The paper shows that, in
Sweden, there are similarly strong patterns of political selection for higher-earning and more-
educated individuals (previous work also shows that, in Sweden, earnings ability is correlated
with IQ scores and leadership scores from psychological tests (Besley et al. 2017)). However,
in Sweden, this process of selection does not lead to a political class that is economically
unrepresentative of the population in terms of parental earnings. This key difference between
our results and the Swedish results may be the fact that economic mobility is higher in
Sweden than in America.2 In America, political selection for individuals with higher-earning
ability and education is likely to lead to a political class with substantially unrepresentative
family backgrounds, because there is a strong correlation between parental earnings and
child earnings ability. This correlation is weaker in Sweden, allowing for the possibility of
political selection for these skills without a cost in terms of representativeness.
       Our findings could have important normative implications, but they depend critically on
one's views about how earnings ability and education map to political ability, and on one's
views regarding the potential tradeoff between favoring higher-ability representatives vs.
having an economically representative set of legislators. If earnings ability and education
have no bearing on political ability, as Carnes and Lupu (2015) argue, then our findings
2
    Specifically, Bolotnyy and Bratu (2018) finds that the slope of the line relating parental income rank to
    child income rank is 0.182, while Chetty et al. (2014) finds that this same slope is 0.341 for the United
    States. Vosters and Nybom (2017) compare the US and Sweden more directly and find significantly more
    mobility--less persistence--in Sweden across intergenerational measures of income, education, occupation,
    as well as latent variables built from combinations of these economic status measures, for parent-child links
    with children born in the 1950s. In the early twentieth century, differences in mobility may not be as
    stark between the US and Sweden. In Sweden, Lindahl et al. (2012) estimate intergenerational earnings
    elasticities of 0.356 between the generation born around 1900 and their children born between 1925 to 1930
    and an elasticity of 0.303 between those children and their children. Meanwhile, linking parents and children
    from the Iowa 1915 Census and the Federal 1940 Census, Feigenbaum (2018) found IGE estimates between
    0.199 and 0.391, depending on the specification, for that geographically restricted sample of fathers and
    sons.

                                                         3
suggest that the electoral system's favoring of higher-earning and more-educated candidates
is an impediment to having an economically representative legislatures that provides no value.
If on the other hand earnings ability and education do correlate with political ability--as
an important strand of research in political economy argues (Besley, Montalvo, and Reynal-
Querol 2011; Besley and Reynal-Querol 2011; Besley et al. 2017; Meril¨
                                                                     ainen 2018)--then the
relevant question is how much we want our political system to prioritize these abilities at the
cost of preventing those with less access to education, and therefore less ability to earn, from
becoming politicians. The value of having legislators with strong educational backgrounds
and private-market success could be high, if these traits are useful for crafting better policy,
but the costs of an unrepresentative legislature are also high, in part because rich legislators
may be out of touch with the desires of their constituents (e.g., Gilens 2012), in part because
having a broadly representative legislature might add legitimacy to the democratic process
(e.g, Mansbridge 1999), and in part because such a legislature might be a normative goal
in and of itself. It is not our purpose to offer a judgment on these difficult philosophical
questions, but the evidence we offer should help provide empirical grounding for the terms
of the debate.



2    Linking Legislators to the 1940 Census

To study the earning ability and socioeconomic backgrounds of legislators, we need to link
members of Congress to their records in the 1940 Federal Census. In addition, we find mem-
bers' siblings and parents by tracing members back to earlier Censuses. Because there are no
unique identification numbers that link individuals across Censuses--or to our Congressional
biographical data--we rely instead on a fuzzy matching process, making use of both manual
matching and algorithmic matching.




                                               4
2.1     Record Linking Procedures

In this section, we describe the linking procedures we use.


Biographical Information on Members of Congress

To link legislators to the 1940 U.S. Census, we begin by collecting data on the name, birth
year, and birth place of every member of the U.S. House and Senate from the Biographical
Directory of the U.S. Congress.3 We match legislators to the 1940 Census because it is the
most recent U.S. Census with personally identifiable information.4 For the main analysis,
we link future members of Congress who were between the ages of 18 and 40 in 1940 to
their Census records, so we can compare their education and private-sector wages prior to
entering Congress to comparable citizens who do not go on to become elected politicians.


Obtaining Potential Matches in 1940 Census

Using the biographical information on members of Congress, we next collect a set of possible
matches in the 1940 Census for each legislator. We pull every record from the 1940 U.S.
Census where a legislator matches to the Census record exactly on birth state, where the
birth year in the Census is within two years of the legislator's birth year in the Congressional
biographies, and where both the last name and first name are sufficiently similar using
approximate string matching.5 This outputs a list of Census records that are potential
matches for each future legislator.

  Personally identifiable information on the Federal Census is restricted for 72 years after the enumer-
  ation of the Census: https://www.Census.gov/history/www/genealogy/decennial_Census_records/
  the_72_year_rule_1.html.
5
  Such blocking on state of birth and range matching on birth year and names is common in the historical
  census linking literature, for a review see (Abramitzky et al. 2019). For the approximate string matching,
  we use the Jaro-Winkler distance metric with a penalty parameter p = 0.1, implemented by the stringdist
  package in R. Jaro-Winkler string distances are common in record linkage procedures. The distances grow
  with character edits and transpositions and put more weight on character matching in the beginning of a
  string. We keep Census records where the last name and first name distances are both less than 0.3.

                                                     5
Manual Disambiguation of Potential Matches

For each future member of Congress we then manually search the list of potential matches
and identify the correct Census record.6 For our comparisons, the main source of bias would
be from the risk of false positives in the linking process, where a legislator is mistakenly
linked to the Census record of a different individual. The number of future members of
Congress is many orders of magnitude smaller than the number of non-members, so falsely
linking the Census record of an individual from the general population as a future member
of Congress will bias our estimates much more than vice versa. Therefore, our strategy is to
minimize the potential for false positives in the linking (in the Appendix, we discuss potential
biases associated with false negatives in our linking process). The Census includes a number
of other pieces of information about each record that helps us to disambiguate between
potential matches. First, the 1940 Census name entries often include middle initial or middle
name, which we can cross-reference with the middle name in the legislator's biography.
Second, the Census includes an occupation description as of 1940. Third, the Census includes
a city code for where the individual resided in 1940, which we can occasionally compare
with the member's biographical information.7 Using this information, along with a manual
comparison of name and birth year, we select the Census record that correctly matches to
the future member of Congress, if there is one.8 In Section A.1 of the Appendix, we provide
some suggestive evidence that our match improves when we use our manual method.




6
  We discuss various automated record linking methods shortly. While we manually link members of Congress
  to 1940, we use automated procedures to link the to earlier census waves and to link their parents and siblings
  across censuses.
7
  Census city codes are listed at https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/CITY#codes_section.
8
  To illustrate why manual matching is necessary, we find Lyndon B. Johnson, who was born in 1908, in
  the 1940 Census with his first name transcribed as "Lymdan B" and the birth year 1909. His occupation
  is listed as "Congressman," so we know it is the correct match. Of course, Lyndon B. Johnson does not
  ultimately enter into our analysis because he was already a member of Congress by 1940.

                                                       6
Finding Parents and Siblings in Earlier Censuses

We also want to collect data on the parents and siblings of the future members of Congress we
found as adults in 1940. Because few members are living with these relatives when we observe
them in the 1940 Census, this requires us to link backwards to the 1910, 1920, and 1930
Censuses. We start by locating the future members of Congress in these previous Censuses.
Because this task multiplies the number of matches we must locate, we are no longer able to
do it manually. Therefore, we follow the method described in Feigenbaum (2018), training an
algorithm to make links based on a sample of manually linked observations.9 The procedure
is as follows. First, we start with the future member of Congress in 1940. We search for the
set of possible matches for that member in the 1910, 1920, and 1930 Censuses.10 Second, we
manually evaluate and identify links for a sample of congress members. Third, we train a
record linkage algorithm using the manually constructed data. The algorithm uses various
features of a potential match--including string distances in names, year of birth differences,
agreement on specific characters, phonetic name differences, and name commonness--to


9
 In addition to the machine learning approach to census linkage, recent work in economics and political
 science have also used other algorithms, including a fully automated approach based on work by Ferrie (1996)
 and Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson (2012) and an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm approach
 (e.g., Abramitzky, Mill, and P´    erez 2018; Enamorado, Fifield, and Imai n.d.). Abramitzky et al. (2019)
 document that empirical analysis based on samples constructed by the three methods--machine learning,
 Ferrie- or ABE-style, and EM--all tend to produce to similar conclusions: estimates of intergenerational
 mobility are statistically indistinguishable across the methods in multiple census linking examples. We turn
 to the machine learning approach for three main reasons. First, our set of matching variables are more
 limited than in contemporary contexts--like linking voter files as in Enamorado, Fifield, and Imai (n.d.).
 We observe not date of birth in the Census but reported age (in years) and we do not have information
 on street address in the legislator's biography. Second, because Census data is spoken, then enumerated
 in cursive, and then transcribed nearly a century later, we suspect the error rates are much higher in all
 variables. Third, while both ABE-style methods and the EM algorithm have low rates of false positives
 in historical data, they do so at the cost of relatively low match rates, failing to recover many links that
 manual review would code as links, as shown by Abramitzky et al. (2019). While the various state of the
 art linking methods reviewed in Abramitzky et al. (2019) all sit on the frontier of minimizing false positives
 and false negatives, the machine learning approach recovers far more of the matches that would be made
 by manual linking than other methods. In our case, we are not linking a full 100 million record historical
 census to another census but instead searching for only several thousand specific individuals--MCs and
 their family members--and higher match rates are essential.
10
   Similar to our Congress to 1940 link, this set of possible matches is anyone born in the same state, within 3
   years of the 1940 year of birth, and with Jaro-Winkler string distance in first and last name of less than 0.3.
   The bounds on year of birth are slightly larger because there is more age and year of birth misreporting
   in the Census than in the Congressional data.

                                                        7
generate a match score. When a human is record linking, these features are used implicitly
to parse matches and non-matches; the algorithm makes these implicit weights explicit and
allows us to apply the linkage at scale.11 Fourth, we identify the matches to each Census--if
a sufficiently confident match exists--for each legislator.
     Once we have located a future member of congress in a previous Census, we then collect
data on his or her parents and siblings. In the historical federal Censuses, households are
recorded together. Thus, once we observe a legislator in 1910, we can collect data on his or her
parents including name and occupation. Though earnings and education are not collected
in the Federal Census until 1940, we make use of occupation score, a variable economic
historians and other scholars have relied on to map disparate occupations to a continuous
measure of socioeconomic status.12 Occupation score is based on the median earnings in each
occupation in the 1950 Census and constructed by IPUMS. We can also collect information
on the legislator's siblings, including first and last names and state and year of birth. We
then use this information to link the brothers ahead to the 1940 Census.13 We use the
same machine learning approach to the Census linking described in the previous paragraph,
this time searching and training data with reference to the siblings. Linking brothers to the
1940 Census enables us to observe the brothers' earnings, education, and occupation, exactly
the data we collected from the 1940 Census about the legislators themselves. We consider
potential biases from error in these sibling links in the estimation section below.




11
   Following, Feigenbaum (2018), we train a probit model as the gains from more complex machine learning
   models are minimal in the historical census linkage context.
12
   Saavedra and Twinam (2017) review recent studies in economic history using occscores as a measure of
   economic outcomes when income or earnings are unavailable. Prominent examples include Abramitzky,
   Boustan, and Eriksson (2012) on returns to immigration, Aaronson, Lange, and Mazumder (2014) on
   Rosenwald schools, Olivetti and Paserman (2015) on intergenerational mobility, and Bleakley and Ferrie
   (2016) on the Georgia Land Lottery.
13
   We focus on brothers because sisters are likely to change their names if and when they marry, making
   linking on names impossible and highly biased.

                                                   8
2.2    Dataset of Future Politicians and the General Population

Before proceeding to our analyses, we provide a brief overview of the final linked dataset. The
dataset contains information on 557 adults in 1940 who go on to be members of Congress,
359 children in 1940 who go on to be members of Congress, and another roughly 45 million
men and women of similar ages from whom we draw our various comparison groups.


Congressional Time Period Covered by the Data

Our dataset is a snapshot of individuals in 1940. Of the future members of Congress in the
data, some are middle-aged adults in 1940 and are elected into office in the 1940s; others
are young adults who will work in the private sector for decades before seeking office. In
thinking through the subsequent analyses, it is useful to understand which congressional
terms the results generally reflect. Figure A.2 presents a count of the number of members
of Congress in our sample, by the years in which they entered office. The first year anyone
in our sample serves in office is 1941, because we restrict to only adults who are not already
members of Congress in 1940. The bulk of the adults in 1940 who go on to serve in Congress
enter Congress in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, with smaller numbers entering as late as the
1970s and 1980s. Since these are the individuals whose earnings we are able to investigate,
the reader can think of the political selection analyses below as speaking primarily to the
mid-20th century Congress.
   Among the future members of Congress who are children in 1940, the bulk enter Congress
in the 1970s and early 1980s. Because we are able to use both youths and adults in 1940
to study the socioeconomic background of members of Congress, the reader can think of
the socioeconomic background analyses as covering a wider timeframe, spanning from 1940
through the 1980s, roughly.




                                              9
Occupations in 1940

To give a flavor of what the data looks like, Table A.1 presents the top five most common
occupations in 1940 for future members of Congress vs. the general population.14 In both
cases, the very most common occupation is "Nonclassifiable," a catch-all category. For
future members of Congress, the next most common occupation is Lawyer, covering nearly
25% of the future members in our data. The next three for future members of Congress
are Unemployed (which may include time spent as a student), Proprietor/Manager, and

3        How Unrepresentative are Members of Congress?

We begin by using our data to quantify the unrepresentativeness of members of Congress
in the time period of our study. Table 1 studies the families of children in 1940, defined as
anyone under the age of 18. Consistent with existing research, we see that future members of
Congress come from much higher-earning households. Because individuals earning business
income often have no labor earnings to report, we set earnings to missing for individuals
who report 0 earnings but who report having non-wage income for this and all subsequent
earnings analyses. Average parental labor income is about $2,440 for future members, in the
94th percentile of working men in 1940, but only about $1,204 for the parents of similarly
aged children, in the 68th percentile in 1940. As such, parents of future members of Congress
earned about twice as much labor income as the average parent of similarly aged children.
       Parents of future members also exhibit a large education gap, with 32% of future members
living in households where at least one family member had completed college--more than six
times the rate at which other similarly aged children lived in such households. Interestingly,

     These occupations are coded from the raw census occupation strings by IPUMS and turned into a four-digit
     occupation category that we use throughout. For more on this process, see: https://usa.ipums.org/usa-

we find no difference in the probability that future members of Congress live in households
with at least one family member who immigrated to the U.S.15
       Although it is not news that members of Congress are not economically representative of
the population, the precise quantification we are able to offer puts this inequality in sharp
relief. The remainder of the paper is concerned with understanding the mechanisms by which
the American political system generates this extreme unrepresentativeness.

     Because of WWI and immigration restriction acts in 1917, 1921, and 1924, the shares of the foriegn-born
     in the US fell dramatically during the early 20th century (Abramitzky and Boustan 2017).

4     Characterizing Political Selection in Congress

In this section, we use our data to characterize the differences in earnings, education, and
family backgrounds between future members of Congress and the general public.


4.1    Simple Comparisons of Future MCs and the General Public

We first compare the self-reported earnings of future members of Congress to the general
public. Table 2 shows key summary statistics for future members of Congress and the whole
population of similarly aged individuals, focusing on adults who are 18-40 years old in the
1940 Census. We chose the lower threshold of 18 to focus on future MCs who could conceiv-


                                                 12
ably be earning an informative amount of money in the 1940 Census; we chose the upper
threshold of 40 because we wanted to observe future MCs before they become politicians, to
the extent possible. In addition to this age cutoff, we also remove any individuals who are
already members of Congress in 1940.
   As the table shows, future members of Congress earn far more than the general popula-
tion, on average. Future members in 1940 earned on average approximately $2,010, in the
90th percentile of labor earnings among working men in 1940, while the average for similarly
aged individuals in the population was about $544 (37th percentile in 1940). Future mem-
bers exhibit a much more right-skewed distribution of earnings, with large differences at the
median and the 75th percentile, and with a much higher probability of being top-coded for
having earnings of $5,000 or more (only 1% of working men were top coded labor earners in
1940). Future members are also much more likely to have non-wage earnings of $50 or more
and less likely to be out of school without any earnings.
   Separate from their earnings, future members of Congress were overwhelmingly more
likely to complete high school, attend college, and complete college than the population as
a whole. Almost three quarters of future members had attended college by 1940, while only
12% of the population of similarly aged individuals had. Finally, and here we are merely
stating the obvious for any observer of the history of American politics, future members of
Congress in 1940 were almost entirely white men.


4.2    Distribution of Earnings for Future MCs and General Public

Figure 1 presents histograms of the distribution of earnings and education for each of the
two groups. As the left panel of the figure shows, future members of Congress tended to
out-earn other individuals, with their whole distribution shifted to the right. The large spike
at the far right of the plot indicates top-coding, and the histogram shows that members of
Congress were far more likely to be top-coded than other individuals. The spike at the far
left of the plot indicates individuals who reported no labor income--as a reminder, we set

income.
                  The right panel of the figure likewise shows a pronounced rightward shift in the educa-
tional attainment of future members of Congress, as measured by total years of education.
A remarkably large proportion of future members of Congress attend or complete college, a
level of attainment unusual in the general population in this time period.16
                  These descriptive patterns show that members of Congress substantially out-earn the
general public and have much higher average levels of education. What these patterns do
not reveal, however, is how much of the overall earnings gap reflects built-in advantages of
future members of Congress, vs. how much reflects political selection for those with higher
earning ability. Among the relatively privileged elite who have a much greater chance of
becoming politicians, do those with the ability to earn more money pursue politics?


16
     Though the return to education varied during the 20th century and may have been relatively lower in 1940
     than it had been earlier in the century or in more recent decades (Goldin and Katz 2009), schooling was
     valued on the labor market in 1940. As Clay, Lingwall, and Stephens Jr (2016) show, exploiting variation
     in compulsory schooling laws across states and age cohorts, the return to an additional year of education
     for white men was between 0.064 and 0.079 log points of wage earnings.

                                                                            14
4.3     Political Selection Among Male Siblings

In order to hold socioeconomic advantages fixed, we locate the male siblings of future mem-
bers of Congress who are adults in 1940. Doing so is challenging because, as adults, these
future members of Congress are unlikely to be living at home in 1940; their siblings could
be anywhere in the census. To solve this issue, we follow future members of Congress back-
wards in time through the 1910, 1920, and 1930 censuses, until we find them living at home.
We then identify their male siblings who also live in these households, and we follow them
forwards to the 1940 census so that we can track their earnings alongside those of their politi-
cian siblings. Since these siblings grew up in the same households with the same parents,
they share precisely the same socioeconomic background. This same strategy is pursued in
Dal B´
     o et al. (2017).
   Table 3 presents the results. In the first column, we include no controls; in the latter two
columns, we control for age (we cannot match exactly on age since siblings have no overlap
in age), either linearly or quadratically. The rows present the estimated differences between
future members of Congress and their siblings on a variety of outcome variables.
   In the first row, we see that future politicians out-earn their siblings in 1940, whether or
not we control for age. In our preferred specification (column 3), future members of Congress
are estimated to out-earn their brothers by roughly $280, a substantial gap. Future members
of Congress are more likely than their brothers to have top-coded labor income, and to have
non-wage income. Finally, they have more years of schooling and are substantially more likely
to complete high school (8 percentage points in third column), attend college (11 percentage
points in third column), and complete college (12 percentage points in third column), even
after controlling for age, suggesting again an important link between education and selection
into politics.
   It is possible that remaining error in the process that links future members to their
siblings overstates these differences. We know that raw differences between future members
of Congress and the general population are large; if some of the "siblings" in this analysis

are not true siblings, they may upward bias the resulting comparisons. In the Appendix,
we re-estimate the results using a subset for which we are especially confident of the links.
Although these results are necessarily less precise, they still suggest important differences.
Especially when it comes to non-wage income and years of schooling, future members of
Congress still seem importantly different than their non-politician siblings.


4.4     Decomposing the Overall Earnings Advantage of Future MCs

We now compare future members of Congress to increasingly strictly matched sets of in-
dividuals who do not become politicians, finding consistent evidence that future members
out-earn relevant comparison sets. The purpose here is not to obtain a causal effect, but
rather to explore which of the characteristics that might differ between future members of
Congress and non-politicians might explain the overall gap in their earnings. This is why
we sometimes match on variables that could be the downstream consequences of individual
competence and ability, particularly occupation and education.
   Figure 2 visualizes these comparisons. Each pair of bars in the plot indicates the mean
1940 earnings of members of Congress and a comparison set of non-members, with labels un-
der each pair of bars indicating the covariates used to construct exact-matched comparisons
sets.
   In the first pair of bars to the leftmost side of the plot, we match exactly on age. For each
member of Congress, we find all individuals in the Census who share the same birth year,
compute their average earnings, and pair it with the earnings of the member of Congress
before computing the difference in means. As we see, future members of Congress earn
substantially more than their matched set of same-aged non-members.
   Next, we match exactly on gender in addition to age. Here, we see that the comparison
group's mean earnings rises by roughly $300, reducing the overall gap between future mem-

                                Congress in this time period are overwhelmingly likely to be men, and men are likely to earn
                                more than women in this time period (Goldin et al. 1992).
                                    Next, we further match exactly on race. This leads to only a very modest increase in
                                earnings for the comparison group. Although members of Congress are nearly all white in
                                this time period (see Table 2), the general population is also 90% white in this time period.
                                    Next, we further match exactly on birth state and city of residence in 1940. This barely
                                changes the overall differences, suggesting that differences in place are not an explanation of
                                the overall labor income gap.
                                    Next, we also match on socioeconomic background, which we measure using parental
                                occupation scores. As a reminder, occupation scores are based on the median earnings in
                                each occupation in the 1950 Census and are constructed by IPUMS. Since this measure takes
                                80 unique values, we find matches whose family occupation scores are in the same 5-unit bin
                                as future members of Congress. Adding socioeconomic background only modestly shrinks the
                                difference between future members of Congress and their peers--perhaps because occupation
                                scores are a coarse measure of socioeconomic background. As a robustness check, we match
                                on the exact value of parent's occupation score and find very similar results with slightly

                                                                                  18
smaller differences between future members and their peers while losing an additional 20%
of members for whom we cannot find exact matches.
   The next set of bars suggests that a major part of the earnings advantage of future
members is related to their high levels of education. When we add years of education to the
match set, we see a substantial increase in the comparison group's average earnings. In fact,
roughly half of the overall difference between future members of Congress and the general
public falls away once we match on education. We explore this pattern in greater detail
below. Despite this advantage, though, future members still earn substantially more than
other individuals of the same age, race, gender, geographical location, and education level.
   Finally, we additionally match exactly on occupation. This actually decreases the com-
parison group's average earnings--evidently, conditional on education, future members of
Congress tend to opt into somewhat lower-paying occupations. However, since the set of
future members for whom we can find exact matches also has somewhat lower earnings, the
estimated gap in earnings does not change much when we add occupation.


Overall Results: Future Members are Higher Earners

In sum, consistent with the siblings analysis from before, it appears that a significant part of
the earnings gap between future members of Congress and non-politicians reflects differences
in earnings ability. Comparing the rightmost pair of bars with the full set of matched covari-
ates to the leftmost pair, we see that the included covariates together appear to reduce the
overall earnings gap between future members of Congress and non-politicians by a little more
than half, leaving a substantial earnings gap even between future members and individuals
with the same education level, occupation, and socioeconomic background.

 Each cell reports the difference between members and their matches on a particular summary statistic of the distribution
 of income in 1940. Each column corresponds to a particular set of covariates. Robust standard errors in parentheses.
 The standard errors come from regressions that include a fixed effect for ever unique set of values of the covariates.
 The reported statistics for matched groups are calculated by matching future members of Congress with people who
 never become members of Congress but who have the exact same values on the matching covariates indicated at the
 bottom of the table. The non-members are reweighted so that the joint distribution of all covariates is identical for the
 member and non-member groups.



Formal Estimates

Table 4 presents these graphical comparisons in a more formal manner, allowing the reader
to see the precise estimated differences and their standard errors, as well as information
about sample sizes and more formal details about the matching approach.

4.4.1   Matching on Neighborhood

Parent's occupation is a coarse measure of the socioeconomic environment in which someone
grew up. Unfortunately, the 1910, 1920, and 1930 Censuses where we collect family back-
ground information did not measure earnings or education, preventing us from matching on
more detailed information about parental background. To further consider socioeconomic
background, we construct a measure of average occupation score for adult men with occupa-
tions in the childhood neighborhood of each future member of Congress and their potential
matches.
   Matching on mean neighborhood occupation score for men does not meaningfully change
any of the results. Compared to column 7 in Table 4, the earnings differential increases by
$24, and the difference in the percent earning over $5,000 in wages declined by less than
one percentage point. We take this as evidence that matching on a larger and larger set of
childhood characteristics would not meaningfully change our main findings. Since one third
of the 118 future members of congress with a match in column 7 do not also have a match
on mean neighborhood occupation score, we have chosen to leave the formal estimates out
of the table.


4.5     The Earnings Gap Across Age in 1940

The results above include all adults from age 18 to 40 in 1940, but we might think that
it is harder to observe earnings ability among individuals who are still teenagers. These
individuals may still be in school--part of why we find that members of Congress have a
larger spike at 0 labor income--or they may not have had an opportunity yet to advance in
their careers to a point where their talent manifests itself.
   Figure 3 focuses on future members of Congress and their matched comparisons as in
column 7 of Table 4, where matches are based on the full set of covariates, and it presents
earnings across respondent age in 1940. As the plot shows, we see little difference in earnings
for those still in their teens or early 20s. The earnings gap grows substantially for individuals

in their 30s, which is also where we see the appearance of top-coded observations. Based on
this plot, in the Appendix we pursue a set of analyses where we subset to future members
who are 25 years or older in 1940.


4.6    Political Selection Among Lawyers

One problem with the analyses thus far is that occupation is somewhat coarsely measured.
Roughly one quarter of future members of Congress in our sample have an occupation that
can't be classified in the 1940 Census, so matching on occupation is not as restrictive a match
as we might like. To see how this might affect the results, Table 5 replicates the analysis
restricting only to lawyers--constituting roughly 25% of all future MCs in our sample--in
the 1940 Census. Now all comparisons are between lawyers who go on to become members
of Congress, and other lawyers who do not. As the table shows, we continue to find large

4.7        Political Selection in Terms of Education

We now turn to studying differences in education between politicians and non-politicians in
greater detail. Table 6 shows the estimated differences in education levels between future
members of Congress and various comparison groups in the general population, similar to
previous tables.

     We omit the specification that additionally exact matches on education because we are left with only 8
     future MCs in this specification. In this specification, the difference between future MCs and non-MCs is
     larger ($1,227.66; se=425.8), but the small sample size is tiny.

         Each cell reports the difference between members and their matches on a particular summary statistic of the
         distribution of educational attainment in 1940. Each column corresponds to a particular set of covariates.
         Robust standard errors in parentheses. The standard errors come from regressions that include a fixed effect
         for ever unique set of values of the covariates. The reported statistics for matched groups are calculated by
         matching future members of Congress with people who never become members of Congress but who have
         the exact same values on the matching covariates indicated at the bottom of the table. The non-members
         are reweighted so that the joint distribution of all covariates is identical for the member and non-member
         groups.



   In column 1, we present raw comparisons to the whole population of similarly aged
individuals. The first row shows the difference in total years of education between future
members and the population, finding a large difference. The second, third, and fourth rows
re-estimate these differences in terms of the probability of completing high school, attending
college, and completing college, respectively, again finding extremely large differences.
   As we go across the columns, we continue to find large differences. In column 5, we match
on age, gender, race, state of birth, city of residence in 1940, and parent occupation score,
and we still find massive differences in education levels.
   Finally, in column 6, we match on occupation (a "post-treatment" variable from the
perspective of education, if we were focused on a question of causal inference.) Here, the

differences do shrink, but they are still extremely large. Compared to individuals of the
same age, gender, race, birth state, city of residence in 1940, parent occupation score, and
occupation, future members of Congress have almost 3 more years of schooling, on average,
are 36 percentage points more likely to complete high school, and are 28 percentage points
more likely to finish college.
    In sum, future members of Congress possess much higher levels of education, compared
both to the general population and to matched individuals with the same demographic
characteristics and family backgrounds.



5     The Candidate Pool and Electoral Selection

The selection of high-earning and highly educated individuals for Congress could reflect
an electoral system that favors these types of candidates, or it could reflect a system that
discourages other types of candidates from running, preventing voters from supporting them.
To understand these mechanisms, we need to observe both who runs for office and, from
among the candidate pool as a whole, who wins office. This is challenging because finding
losing candidates in the 1940 census is more difficult than finding winning candidates. Most
names are not unique in the census; previously, when we linked winning candidates to the
census, we took advantage of biographical information provided by Congress to disambiguate
between potential name matches. Finding this biographical information for losing candidates
is much harder, because no centralized repository exists.
    We solve this problem by developing a manual workflow in which we find potential name
matches of people who lived in the same state in 1940 in which the candidate ran. We focus
on races close in time to 1940--specifically, 1942 to 1950--in order to minimize the likelihood
of individuals having moved states between the 1940 census and when they ran for office.
    Our workflow involves searching the names of potential matches in newspapers.com,
focusing on the year and state of each election in our dataset. We use newspaper articles



                                              25
from the time to obtain useful information about candidates, including in various cases their
city of residence, their age, their occupation, and so forth. We use whatever information we
are able to obtain to then locate their record in the 1940 census on ancestry.com, which in
turn allows us to link their record to our dataset.
   Using this approach, we are able to locate a total of 549 candidates, of which 398 lose
the election in which they ran (we are only able to use all 549 candidates for the education
analysis, as quite a few have earnings set to missing because they report no earnings but
have business income; we have 306 candidates in the earnings analyses, for which 82 are
winners). We then proceed with the same exact matching approach employed throughout
the paper, running regressions in which we compare earnings and years of education for
losing candidates, winning candidates, and matched sets of non-politicians. Table 7 presents
the results.
   As the first row of the table shows, the set of people who run for office are substantially
higher earners than those who do not run. This is true when we match only on age, gender,
and race (first column), when we also match on birth state and city in 1940 (second column),
and when we also control for education and occupation (third column). Looking at the third
column, we estimate that the candidate pool earns roughly $340 more than matched non-
politicians, roughly 29% higher earnings than the mean for matched non-politicians.
   The second row shows that there is positive electoral selection from among the pool.
Winning candidates are estimated to earn roughly $570 more than losing candidates (third
column), a substantial increase.
   The final two columns show that there are large gaps in terms of education, too. The
candidate pool possesses 4.38 more years of education than matched non-politicians (fifth
column), a 48% increase from the overall mean for non-politicians, and among those who
run, winners have on average an additional 1.31 years of education, roughly (second row,
fifth column).

             public who did not run only enter the regression if the share the exact same profile as someone
             who ran based on a set of covariates. Each column corresponds to a particular set of covariates.

   Together, these results suggest an electoral advantage for higher-earning and more-
educated candidates. At the same time, both losing and winning candidates tend to be
substantially higher-earning and more educated than other individuals of the same age, gen-
der, and race who were born in the same state and live in the same city in 1940. Because
individuals may run for office in anticipation of their electoral prospects, it is hard for the
data to distinguish whether the candidate pool is unrepresentative because of barriers to
entry, anticipated electoral defeat for lower-earning and less educated individuals, or both.
Whatever the political equilibrium, the electoral advantage for higher-earning and more-
educated candidates appears to play an important role in making Congress unrepresentative
of the general population in this time period.

6     Conclusion

It is a well-known fact that American legislators are far wealthier and more educated than
the general population. Exactly why this is the case remains a matter of debate. American
legislators could be richer and more educated because the costs of running for office prevent
normal people from seeking political office, or because elections favor individuals with par-
ticularly high levels of education and earnings ability, or because of some combination of the
two. This paper has contributed to this topic by studying the earnings ability, education,
and socioeconomic backgrounds of future members of Congress as of 1940, taking advantage
of a unique historical dataset allowing us to make fine-grained comparisons between future
politicians and over 40 million comparably aged citizens.
    Our data has allowed us to observe the parents of future members of Congress in much
greater detail than existing work. We find that parents of future members of Congress
earn much more than the general public, and are much, much more likely to have attended
college. This is a key difference from previous findings in Sweden (Dal B´
                                                                         o et al. 2017).
Because intergenerational mobility is much lower in the United States than in Sweden, even
a pure political meritocracy on the basis of earnings ability and education in America would
translate into high inequality in political opportunities.
    Turning to earnings ability, we first showed that future members of Congress earn more
and are more-educated than their siblings who do not go into politics, suggesting that there
is political selection for these traits over and above socioeconomic background. We also
found that future members of Congress earned substantially more money in 1940 than did
individuals in the same occupation, with the same level of education, living in the same
area and sharing the same race and gender, and coming from comparable socioeconomic
backgrounds. Moreover, future members of Congress are substantially more educated than
comparable individuals who do not go into politics. Despite reasons to think that democratic
systems might struggle to attract highly skilled and highly educated individuals who have



                                              28
lucrative outside options in the private market, the U.S. system is evidently able to make
such individuals a compelling offer.
   Finally, after characterizing these patterns, we have offered some preliminary evidence
to explain their roots in the electoral system. The set of candidates who run for office are
much higher-earning and more educated than comparable non-politicians, suggesting barri-
ers to running for office could be an important driver of the differences between members of
Congress and the general public. However, we also found evidence that elections favor can-
didates with higher earnings ability and higher levels of education. The electoral advantage
for these types is likely to be an important part of the inequality we observe.
   Our study has two main limitations. First, the ability to earn more than compara-
ble people measures only one component of personal ability, and could be uncorrelated or
even negatively correlated with the attributes that make individuals "good" representatives.
While the positive results of our study are important for understanding how the Ameri-
can political system, and democracies in general, operate, on their own they have no clear
normative implications for American government or democracy.
   Second, because the U.S. Census is only made available to researchers after a 72-year gap,
we can only study people who were alive--and, in many of our analyses, already adults--in
1940. This means that our analyses primarily speak to political selection in the United States
from roughly 1950 to 1970. While an important period in its own right, many factors have
changed about American politics from then to today. In particular, it appears that running
for office today, in an era of severe campaign-finance demands and 24-hour tabloid media
coverage is more difficult than it used to be. Moreover, salaries for members of Congress
have not kept up with inflation, meaning that holding a seat in Congress may have higher
opportunity cost than it used to (Hall 2019). This may deter high-earners more than it did
in the past.
   These limitations aside, our paper adds to the relatively new literature on political se-
lection (for a recent review, see Dal B´
                                       o and Finan n.d.) by characterizing how strongly


                                             29
the American system favors the selection of highly educated individuals with strong private-
market skills over the selection of a broadly representative set of legislators who share the
economic backgrounds of their constituents. We hope that documenting these patterns will
encourage additional research on the mechanisms of political selection in the United States.

A.1                          Comparing Techniques for Record Linkage
Here, we compare a variety of linking strategies to validate our hand matching procedure.
The red bar in Figure A.1 shows the mean earnings in 1940 dollars among the general popula-
tion, while each of the blue bars shows the mean earnings in 1940 dollars among members of
Congress using increasingly constrained linking criteria. We find that the difference in earn-
ings between the members of Congress and the general population grows as we become more
confident in the match accuracy. For example, the "No pruning" bar computes the mean
earnings of all Census records we identify in our first pass as potential matches for members
of Congress. Specifically, this includes all Census records with the same birth state, birth
year within two years of the legislator's, and both last and firstname Jaro-Winkler string dis-
tance less than 0.3.18 Using that linking procedure, most legislators have multiple potential
matches in the 1940 Census, so we know there are false positives when computing the mean
earnings for the "No pruning" bar. As expected, this attenuates the estimated difference
between mean earnings for MCs compared to the general population.

                             Figure A.1 ­ Difference from Population Grows with Match Ac-
                             curacy.

    Next, we try constraining the linking criteria in other ways. In the "Min Jaro-Winkler"
bar, for each legislator we select the potential Census match that minimizes our name dis-
tance metric. We take the Jaro-Winkler distance between the legislator's last name and
Census record's last name along with the Jaro-Winkler distance between the legislator's first
name and the Census record's first name, and we sum the absolute value of those two quanti-
ties to construct our distance metric. The difference in mean earnings between the members
of Congress and general population grows when we use this more constrained linking proce-
dure. We try a few other linking strategies, matching on exact name and exact birth year,

           We use the stringdist package in R to compute the Jaro-Winkler distance, setting the penalty parameter
           p = 0.1.

                                                                      35
for example, but for all results in the body of the paper we hand match members to the list
of potential matches in the Census. In the paper, we describe the criteria we use to select
hand matches. As we can see in Figure A.1, the earnings difference grows even more using
the hand matching procedure, which suggests that we are minimizing the presence of false
positives in the record linkage. In the final bar, we show the mean earnings for the hand
matches where we have high confidence in the match, but to keep as many observations as
possible we use all of the hand matched legislators in the body of the paper.


A.2      Years Served in Congress in Our Sample
Our analyses rely on observing future members of Congress in the 1940 Census. In our main
analyses, we focus on the earnings of future members of Congress who are adults in 1940,
restricting the sample to future members who are between the ages of 18 and 40 as of 1940.
Later, we also study those who are under the age of 18 in 1940, in order to understand
socioeconomic background. Given the range of ages in 1940, what years do these individuals
go on to serve in Congress? Figure A.2 shows the distribution of years that our sample serves
in Congress, plotted separately for youths and adults in 1940.

A.3       Most Common Occupations in 1940
Table A.1 reports the top five occupations for future members of Congress and the popula-
tion. 26% of future members of Congress and 20% of the population are working in a role
that did not fit into the classifications offered by the Census or were looking for their first
job. The second most common group of occupations for future members of Congress was
in the law, with 24% of future members working as lawyers or judges. 17% of members of
Congress were unemployed. The remaining top occupations were both professional roles.
Among the population, 10% of people were unemployed. The remaining top occupations for
non-members were all blue collar: laborer, farmer, and machine operator.


A.4       Comparing Members of the House vs. the Senate
As we saw in Table A.6, the earnings differential is much larger among future senators than
representatives. In table A.2, we track the size of the gap as we match on more and more
covariates. The earnings differential between future senators and members of the public
their same age in 1940 is roughly $1,550, while that same difference is $925 for future
representatives. This leaves a gap between senators and representatives of about $625. By
column five, when we are matching on age, gender, race, birth place, city, and education level,
the difference between senators and representatives shrinks to $180, but is still present. The
remaining columns are difficult to interpret given the relatively small set of future senators
who have a match on all covariates in the Census.


A.5       Replicating the Results For 25-40 Year Olds
Table A.3 reports the earnings differentials for future members of Congress who are between
25 and 40 in 1940. Looking at Figure 3, it is clear that this should increase the differences,
since the future members earn a similar amount as their peers at 18. The differences between
future members and their peers start to appear in their mid 20s. We confirm that the
differences are larger when future members are older in Table A.3. Across all seven columns,
the differences are larger for future members over 25 than for future members over 18. The


                                              37
earnings differential for future members is approximately two-thirds larger when we exclude
people under 25, based on the estimates using the full set of covariates in column seven.


A.6      Socioeconomic Advantages Across Generations
In Table 1 we saw that future members of Congress who were between the ages of two and
seventeen in 1940 came from families with higher earnings and more education. Using the
1910, 1920, and 1930 Censuses, we can compare the families of future members who were
between ages two and seventeen in 1940 to those who were between eighteen and forty in
1940. Table A.4 presents these results. We find that youth in 1940 come from families
working in higher-earning occupations than the future members who are adults in 1940.
This result must be taken with a grain of salt: getting the occupation scores for the parents
of adults requires automated record linkage that may introduce some error, whereas the
occupation scores the parents of a young person living at home are easily available.

Each cell reports the difference between members and their matches on a particular summary statistic of the distribution of
earnings in 1940. Each column corresponds to a particular set of covariates. Robust standard errors in parentheses. The standard
errors come from regressions that include a fixed effect for ever unique set of values of the covariates. The reported statistics for
matched groups are calculated by matching future members of Congress with people who never become members of Congress but
who have the exact same values on the matching covariates indicated at the bottom of the table. The non-members are reweighted
so that the joint distribution of all covariates is identical for the member and non-member groups.

           variates is identical for the member and non-member
           groups.

A.7      Link Error in the Siblings Analysis
As we discussed above, we find siblings through an automated record linkage approach while
we find future members of Congress using a more manual strategy. Previous work finds that
the approximately 15% of the links made by this automated record linkage strategy would be
rejected by humans (Feigenbaum 2018). Given the large difference we report between future
members of Congress and people with very similar background, labeling an average member
of the public as a future member of Congress's brother would increase the gap between future
members of Congress and the people we think are their brothers. To address this we change
the target of the algorithm­rather than maximizing the average of the positive predictive
value (PPV) and the true positive rate (TPR), we minimize the .02  T P R + .98  P P V .
This focus on PPV while essentially ignoring TPR brings our false positive rate below 9%.
    Despite using a much higher threshold of certainty for counting a member of the public
as the future member of Congress's brother, we find largely similar results. As expected,
most of the estimates shrink toward zero to some degree, but all of the estimates continue
to show a small but noticeable positive selection.


A.8      Bias From Future Members We Can't Link
One threat to our interpretation of our results throughout the paper is error in our manual
process for finding future members of Congress. If it is easier to find higher earners, this
would bias our estimate of the raw earnings differential between future members of Congress
and the general population. To provide a bound on this, imagine that all of the future
members of Congress who we could not find in the 1940 Census were average earners. Since
we were able to find 63% of all members, this would reduce our estimate of the raw earnings
difference by about 40% to $595. This is a large potential bias in the overall results, but
it relies on a set of assumptions about the future members who we failed to match that is
incredibly strong and may even suggest the wrong bias. Perhaps instead it is easier to find
future members of Congress who earn less on average; this error would produce a bias in the
opposite direction. More importantly, these potential biases are not a major concern in the
main analysis of the paper.
    The main goal of this paper is to measure the degree of positive selection into politics
and decompose its sources. The bulk of this exercise involves comparing future members
of Congress to people who look like them on many observables and measure the remaining
differences in private market earnings and education levels. In these analyses in which we
condition on a large set of observables, we only care about biases in our linkage that still
exist conditional on that large set of observables. We cannot directly test for this form of
bias, but we have no reason to believe this bias exists or is driving our results.


A.9      Size of Selection Across Contexts
In this section, we investigate variation in the size of the selection effects across contexts.
The key result is that selection does not appear to be lower in the south, despite the lack of
general-election competition in that region in this time period, again consistent with the idea

                                              42
that electoral competition is not the mechanism selecting individuals with higher earnings
ability and education for political office.
     Before looking at the south and non-south comparison, we start with a sanity check on
the benefits of office. A common theme in many models of electoral accountability and
running for office is the idea that larger benefits of office encourage the entry and selection
of highly skilled individuals (Besley and Coate 1997; Besley 2004; Osborne and Slivinski
1996).19 Empirical work also suggests that larger politician salaries leads to stronger electoral
selection for quality (Gagliarducci and Nannicini 2013) and ideological moderation (Hall
2019). Although we do not have any variation in salaries to exploit--members of the House
and Senate generally earn the same salary, except if they hold leadership positions--we
can take advantage of the fact that the Senate is a more prestigious and more sought-after
office than the House. Senators serve longer terms and hold more power by virtue of their
lesser numbers, making the office more appealing. Competition is greater for senate seats,
senatorial candidates raise more money, on average, and they serve on corporate boards after
retiring at higher rates than members of the House (Palmer and Schneer 2016, 2018).
     Table A.6 compares the earnings gap between future members of Congress and non-
members across contexts. In the first two columns the outcome variable is labor income in
1940, while in the second two columns the outcome is an indicator for attending college. For
comparison, column 1 simply replicates the overall earnings gap for future members from
column 4 of Table 4, for comparison purposes. This is the specification matching on age,
gender, race, and geographical location. We do not match on education in this table because
it is an outcome variable in the second two columns.
     In the second row of the table, looking across the columns, we see that future senators
have a much larger earnings gap than future House members--in fact, the earnings gap is
more than twice as large for future senators. This indicates that, consistent with the findings
in Dal B´ o et al. (2017), selection is larger where the benefits of office are higher. However,
this does not separate the two mechanisms from one another because where the benefits of
office are higher, the barriers to entry may also be higher. It is much more expensive to be
a viable senatorial candidate than to be a viable candidate for the House.
     The third row is where we examine the south/non-south difference. In column 2 we
see that the earnings doesn't appear to be meaningfully different in the south vs. in the
rest of the country. In this time period, the south is dominated by the Democratic party,
with virtually no general-election competition (e.g., Key 1949). That there is equally large
selection even in this setting suggests that electoral competition is not a necessary condition
for positive selection.
     Columns 3 and 4 replicate these analyses for college attendance. As the second row
shows, we again find a premium for future senators. The gap in rates of college attendance
for future Senators is roughly 7 percentage points higher than the gap for future members
of the House. The other comparisons are more mixed. We see that future members from
the south are more likely to have attended college, in contrast to the earnings analysis in
column 2. We find no evidence that future Democratic members have more education than
future Republican members.

     In citizen-candidate models, higher office benefits leads to equilibria with more moderate candidates, a
     particular kind of "ability."

A.10        Comparing America and Sweden
Figure A.3 examines the relationship between parental occupation scores and earnings for
adults ages 18 to 40 in the 1940 Census. Lines are estimated separately for future members of
Congress and for the comparable set of non-members exactly matched on age, race, gender,
birth state, city of residence in 1940, parental occupation score, years of education, and
occupation as in column 7 of Table 4. As the figure shows, intergenerational labor income
is highly correlated in the United States. Evidence for political selection can be seen in the
plot, as the line for future members of Congress is shifted up from the line for non-members;
across levels of parents' earnings, future members of Congress earn more than comparable
non-politicians.
    This figure is important because it helps to square our evidence from the United States
with the Swedish evidence from Dal B´   o et al. (2017). In Sweden, intergenerational mobility
is high, so that parental income does not correlate strongly with children's income. Positive
electoral selection in terms of earning ability then means that Swedish politicians earn more
than comparable non-politicians, but can still be drawn from across the parental income
spectrum.
    In the United States, in contrast, positive electoral selection in terms of earning ability--
even if it were purely meritocratic--makes an economically representative legislature unlikely,
because parental earnings and children's earnings are correlated relatively strongly.
