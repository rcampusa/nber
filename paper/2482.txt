      Fiscal Policies and the Dollar/Pound Exchange Rate: 1870-1984



                                ABSTRACT




     This Paper investigates the conseouences of fiscal policies for the

exchange rate. After deveiopin a simple theory of how government

financing policies should effect the exchange rate, we test it using data

on the dollar/pound exchanoe rate. Previous analyses have concentrated

mainly on the post—Bretton Woods flexible exchange rate system, thus

ignoring potentially useful information contained in fixed exchange rate

periods or in previous flexible exchange rate periods. This paper shows

that it is theoretically proper and econometrically feasible to merge

evidence from different nominal exchange rate systems. The gain ot this

procedure is that we can extend the sample period back to the i870s. Our

results suggest that permanent government expenditures are the only fiscal

variables that significantly affected the dollaripound nominal exchange

rate. Budget deficits appear to be irrelevant in this respect.

 1. Introduction



      That there exists a strong relationship between government policies and

 the nominal exchange rate has long been recognized.   Monetary policies, in

 particular, have been the object of several theoretical and empirical attempts

 to explain exchange rate movements during periods of flexible exchange rate

 regimes. More recently, considerable effort has been devoted to the

understanding of exchange rate discontinuities caused by the collapse of fixed

exchange rate regimes. Most of this theoretical and empirical work has

focused on the monetary causes of these exchange rate movements.   They all

stress the fundamental incompatibility of continuous inflationary policies

with the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate.

     Even if monetary policies have been a prime subject of investigation,

little attention has been paid, either by the flexible exchange rate

literature or by the collapsing exchange rate literature, to theunderlying

determinants of monetary policies. This paper, on the other hand, explicitly

considers the rationale behind money supply decisions, by formalizing the link

between fiscal and monetary policy. Inflation, in particular, is seen as the

result of the optimal financing of an exogenous stream of government

expenditures.

     By stressing the role of inflation as a financing instrument, this

analysis provides useful insights into the understanding of the evolution of

the international monetary system. At the basis of this approach is the idea

that both the dynamics of flexible exchange rates and the choice of exchange

rate regime are endogenous variables. In this paper we take the view that

government spending is the fundamental exogenous variable driving both the

exchange rate (during flexible regime periods) and the switches between the
                                                                                3



two   alternative   exchange rate regimes. A brief overview of the history of the

dollar/pound exchange rate reveals, in fact, an alternation of periods of

fixed exchange rates (during times of relative tranquillity in government

spending), and periods of flexible rates (during periods of high and divergent

level of expenditure).

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simple model in

which inflation, income taxes and deficits are the results of an optimal

government budget decision. Section 3 derives the implications for exchange

rate behavior1 and estimate the model using ordinary least squares.      Section 4

describes a variant of censored data techniques that can be fruitfully used in

this circumstance, and provides maximum likelihood estimates following this

approach. Section 5 concludes the paper with a summary of the results.



2. A Model of Optimal Seizniorage



       In this section we describe a simple model in which the dynamics of

income taxes, seigniorage and government debt are the result of a rational

decision of the government seeking to finance a given flow of expenditure in

an optimal manner. The model is close in spirit to work on optimal inflation

tax by Phelps (1973). A similar approach is used by Mankiw (1987) to explain

the post World War II behavior of nominal interest rates in the U.S.

       The intuition behind the model is quite simple. The government can use

different means of financing its expenditure: income taxes, monetization or

deficits. The government has to choose the optimal mix of these instruments.

If the problem has an interior solution, part of expenditure is going to be

financed by money creation.

       Consider an economy whose representative agent is interested in
                                                                                  4


maximizing his expected lifetime utility, U, which is given by



     U —             E
              E0(
                    t—O



where c is the consumption at time t, and 0 < < 1 is the discount factor.

Randomness in this economy is the consequence of stochastic government

spending and output, which will be introduced below. The agents of this

economy have access to the international credit market, where real bonds

are traded at the world given interest rate r that, for simplicity, is

postulated to be such that fi          The individuals are assumed to hold cash

balances in order to economize on the transaction cost of exchange.

Transactions are costly in the sense that a certain fraction of individual's

real income is used up in the transaction process. This fraction, v, is a

convex function of the ratio of real balances held by the agent to his real

income, i.e.



                          v'<O
     Vt
          —
              vipt)              < 1



where P is the price level and y the exogenous real income.' In addition,

agents are required to pay taxes       in real terms. In order to capture in a

simple way the distortionary effects of income taxes, we assume that a

fraction of real income is absorbed n the tax collection process. The

fraction, z, is a convex function of the ratio of taxesto real income:

The individual optimization problem is therefore given by:

                tO [i)t

where m are the real money balances,                is the nominal interest rate which

satisfies the Fisher equation (i+Rt) —          (l.it)(l+r)   and    is the rate of

inflation.

      In deriving problem P-i we also assume that b1 —                   — 0 and that the
                                                                    M1
usual transversality condition holds.

      The first order conditions of this problem imply:



      Eu'(c+i) —      u'(c)                                                  (2.1)
                                                                                 6




                                                              (2.2)
             V( l+Rjt

 Equation (2.1) is the well known random walk property of the marginal utility

 of consumption, while (2.2) reveals that, since we assumed v" > 0, increases

 in inflation are costly since they reduce desired cash balances as a fraction

of income.

      The next step is to endogenize inflation by considering the optimization

problem of a government seeking to maximize the welfare of the representative

agent in the economy. In this case the authorities will choose the paths of

inflation, taxes and deficits which minimize the cost of raising the revenue

necessary to finance their expenditures. The period t budget constraint for

the government is given by:



                                   (Mt -   Mt - l
         + (l+r)Bi =      ÷ Bt +



Making use of the usual transversality condition, the government optimization
problem can be written as:

                                   t




     As (2.3) reveals, the solution of this problem involves equating the

ratios of the marginal cost to the marginal revenue of the two alternative

financing instruments (since output is exogenous, the marginal revenue of

income taxes is one in this model). The optimum must be in the positively

sloped side of the inflation tax Laffer's curve, where the marginal revenue

from money creation is positive, i.e.
                                             as    > 0. Equation (2.4) equates the
                                             itt

ratio of marginal cost to marginal revenue of the income tax today and in the

future. Equation (2.5) does the same for the inflation tax. In the special

case in which taxes are not distortionary, i.e. z —         0,   the solution to P-2

policy is to set inflation in such a way that    — 0.   This is Friedman's

optimum quantity of money rule. In this case seigniorage will be nil, and

government expenditure will be financed only through taxes. The opposite

extreme is one in which inflationary policy is non-distortionary, i.e. v           0.

In this case, as long as the marginal revenue from money financing is

positive, taxes will be set to zero. In the intermediate case in which both

types of financing are distortionary, we would expect that both will be used

to assure solvency.

     In a recent paper, Kimbrough (1986) challenges the view that seigniorage

should be part of an optimal tax policy. He argues that, even if taxes are

distortionary, Friedman's optimal quantity of money rule should be followed.

In his model, inflation decreases the potential output of the economy, by

reducing the individual's time endowment (an hypothesis analogous to the one

we made above). On the other hand, he assumes that the only alternative

financing instrument is a consumption tax, which does not have the same direct

negative effect on the production possibility frontier (it alters the marginal

choice between consumption and leisure, but does not affect the total time

endowment). Because of this asymmetry, in that model it is optimal to refrain

from raising revenues through seigniorage.

     In our model, instead, taxes and inflation lead to a similar contraction

of potential output, so that they are both used as financing instruments.
                                                                               9



Moreover, because of the deadweight losses imposed by taxes and inflationary
finance, in our environment it is optimal to use deficits as a buffer for

temporary deviations of government expenditure from its permanent level.

Income taxes and inflation should be used to finance only the permanent part

of government expenditure, a generalization of the well-known tax smoothing

result obtained by Barro (1979). This result can be derived explicitly, by

assuming that the ratio of seigniorage to output can be expressed as a linear

function of inflation:




       —
       St — b,r
                t

and   that v(t) is a quadratic function of inflation:



       v—a+ air2.
             1      2t
Then, inflation, as well as the nominal interest rate and seigniorage, is a

martingale. The same is true for the income tax rate, under the assumption

that z(t) is quadratic2. Making use of the expectation operator, and assuming

for simplicity that the relevant covariance terms are equal to zero, we can

manipulate the government budget constraint at period t to give:




                                                                     (2.6)

I. Implications for Exchange Rate Behavior and Empirical Application



     Consider a foreign country which is in all ways analogous to the domestic

economy.3 The exchange rate and the price levels in the two countries are

assumed to be linked by:




     et_pp*-i-u                                              (2.9)



e,       are the logarithms of nominal exchange rate, domestic and foreign

price level, respectively. In accord to a considerable body of empirical

evidence, we also assume that the deviations from purchasing power parity are

permanent in nature, i.e.:




   Here we still maintain the assumption that the real interest rate is world
determined and cannot be effected by either of the two economies.
                                                                                   11



    Ut —      u1 +   1t                                       (2.10)




where         is iid. We can now express the rate of change of the exchange rate

(áe) as:



    Ae —           + P11 us,t + l2        +                   (2.11)




where         and g represent the U.S. and U.K. ratios of permanent government

expenditure to output, respectively.

        We now investigate whether the effects of fiscal policy on exchange rate

predicted by the above model can be detected for the dollar/pound rate.    The

data set used in this study is composed of annual observations, for the period

1870-1984. We argued above that temporary expenditure should be financed

through budget deficits. Therefore, empirically we identify the temporary

component of expenditure with the real deficit, defined as:




        D —
              B - B1                                            (3.1)
         t
              1t   1•t-1




where Bt is the amount of government bonds outstanding at time t. The

permanent component is given by the difference between the actual real

expenditure and its temporary element.4

        We included in the specification not only permanent expenditures but also




   In this paper we used government expenditure of the central government,
inclusive of interest payments and net of transfers The results, however, are
quite robust with respect to the choice of spending aggregate. Debt is total
debt outside the central bank. Appendix B provides a detailed description of
the data.
                                                                                           12


 budget deficits as a percentage of output (d, dk). This allows us to test

 whether, contrary to the above theory, they have had any effect on the

 exchange rate. We also include government receipts as a
                                                                    percentage of output
 (r, rUk). The above model predicts that, once we control for permanent

 spendings, government revenues should not have any independent effect on

 inflation (exchange rate). However, unexpected shifts in the relative welfare

 cost of the two financing instruments (i.e. changes in the z() and v()

 functions) would induce switches between income taxes and inflation, for given

 permanent government expenditure (see 2.3). Under these circumstances,

 increases in revenue would imply a reduction in inflation and have an

 appreciative effect on the exchange rate. The estimated exchange rate

 equation had, therefore, the following form:



                 —   .o + 11      g5 +   12     +

where Eit   is   assumed to be independently normally distributed.

     The time series of the exchange rate for this sample is plotted in Figure

1. As it is well known, and as Figure 1 evidences, periods of fixed exchange

regimes have alternated with periods of flexible rates. In table 1, we report

the estimate of (3.2) obtained by using only data corresponding to periods of

flexible exchange rates. Both permanent expenditures are significant and have

the expected signs. Moreover, U.S. revenues appear to have had a significant

(appreciative) effect on the dollar, indicating that shifts in the relative

cost function may have occurred in the U.S..

    Even if our data set extends over 115 years, the above estimate are based
                                                                                 13


only on 25 data points. This is because, for most of the sample, the exchange

rate was fixed, making it difficult to detect the effects of changes in

government expenditure. In the next section it will be shown how to improve

our estimates by properly utilizing the information contained in periods of

fixed exchange rates. For the moment, however, assume that one ignores the

problem of the existence of periods of fixed exchange rates, and uses ordinary

least squares to estimate equation (3.2) over the whole period 1870-1984. The

results of this experiment are reported in Table 2. The results are very

similar to the one obtained above. Both U.S. and U.K. permanent expenditures

have the expected sign and are significantly different from zero at least at

the 5% level. Of the other variables, U.S. government revenues seem to have a

significant impact on the exchange rate.



4. Censored Regression Models With Unobserved Thresholds



     During period of fixed exchange rates, variations in permanent

expenditure would not be reflected in exchange rate changes.   This does not

imply, however, that the study of these periods cannot provide any useful

information about our theory. On the contrary, the type of exchange rate

system may be itself a function of the level of government expenditure.

Periods of moderate spending (taking the conditions in the other country as

given), and therefore of moderate monetization, can be compatible with a fixed

parity. On the other hand, continuous or substantial increases in permanent

expenditure may undermine the viability of a fixed exchange rate system,

producing its collapse and a switch to a floating regime.   For example, if we

divide the observation into two groups depending on whether they belong to

periods of fixed or flexible exchange rates, we notice that, while the U.S.
                                                                                    14


 has essentially the same average level of expenditure in the two subsets (6.5%

 of output during fixed and 8.1% during flexible rates) the U.K.'s average

 expenditure is considerably higher during flexible rate periods (15.5% vs.

 22.1%).

      The issue of collapsing exchange rate regimes has been extensively

 analyzed by the speculative attack literature.5 The focus there is to

 determine the timing and the magnitude of a devaluation (revaluation), which

 is seen as the consequence of an attack on the official reserves by rational

 speculators. One of the main insights of this literature is that the crucial

variable determining a switch from fixed to flexible exchange rate regime is

the shadow exchange rate, i.e. the equilibrium exchange that would prevail in

the post-collapse floating regime. Assuming that only a dollar revaluation is

possible (as it has been the case in our sample), we can describe the

condition for the viability of a fixed exchange rate as:



           >
                                                                   (4.1)



i.e., the rate of growth of the shadow exchange rate (e) must be above some

minimum level (e mm            .  . .
                    ). By definition,            .
                                      in a £lexible exchange rate regime the
shadow and the actual rate coincide   ,   i.e.       —    If the shadow rate were

observable during the period of fixed rate, we could estimate (3.2) by using

such data. The problem is that the floating shadow is not observable during

fixed exchange rate regimes, since        is observable only if:




  See, for example, Flood and Garber (1984), Blanco and Carber (1986), Crilli
(1986).
                                                                                        15


             <



Therefore, in part of the sample          does not have zero mean. This implies

that the OLS estimates are both biased and inconsistent. The way in which we

propose to estimate (3.2) is to consider



             —
                 1x1 +

as a censored regression (x1t is the 7 x 1 vector of the fiscal variables, and

   is the 7 x 1 vector of parameters) where the threshold             ,
                                                                          above which

the data are censored, is itself unobservable. It is assumed, however, that

we observe the variables determining it, that is:



         mm
                     2'2t +


where x2 is a vector of observable variables. It is useful to partition the

sample observations into three distinct groups. The first group is composed

of N1 observations referring to fixed exchange rate periods. The only

information that we have for these observations is that           >        i.e. (El -

    >            -
                     X1.
       The    second   group is composed of N2 observations referring to the periods

in which a collapse of the system and a revaluation of the exchange rate

occurred. In this case we know that a collapse occurred because ie <

that is: l - E2) < 82x2 -
        The last group is composed of N3 observations referring to the flexible

exchange rate periods. In this case we freely observe             which coincides

obtain consistent estimates to use as starting values in the maximum

likelihood procedure, we used a variant of a two-stage method described by

Maddala (1983). A description of this estimator is given in Appendix A.

     The estimates of the parameters obtained by maximizing (4.2) are given in

Table 3, where x2 is composed of the lagged difference between the ratios of

permanent expenditures to output of the two countries (óg) and the fixed

parity (a).   These maximum likelihood estimates would seem to support the

theory of optimal financing as a partial explanation of the movements of the

Dollar/Pund exchange rate between 1870 and 1984. In fact, the two permanent

expenditure ratios are both significant and have the expected sign. A one

percent increase in the ratio of U.S. permanent expenditure to output induces
                                                                                 17



a three percent devaluation in the dollar. On the other hand, a one percent

increase in the ratio of British permanent government expenditure to output

revalues the dollar by almost one percent. U.S. revenue, on the other hand,

seem to have lost part of their explanatory power.



5. Conclusions



     A novel aspect of this paper is the choice of the time period in which

the empirical investigation is conducted. Previous studies have mainly

concentrated on the post Bretton Woods flexible exchange rate system. In this

paper, we make use of econometric techniques that exploit information

contained in data from periods of fixed exchange rates. Thus, our empirical

analysis ranges from the 1870's to the 1980's. The study of this extended

time period is of particular importance since major changes in the nominal

exchange rates seem to be connected with major changes in government

expenditure, like the ones occurring during war times.

     The results of this paper suggest that the permanent components of public

expenditures have been a crucial factor in driving the evolution of the

dollar/pound rate in the last hundred and fifteen years. U.S. revenues also

contribute to the explanation of exchange rate movements, indicating possible

changes overtime of the welfare cost of alternative financing instruments.

Moreover, the paper provides further evidence in favor of the thesis of

irrelevance of budget deficits in the determination of nominal variables.
