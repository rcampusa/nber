                                              ABSTRACT

Policies aimed at reducing the harmful effects of air pollution exposure typically focus on areas with
high levels of pollution. However, if a population’s vulnerability to air pollution is imperfectly correlated
with current pollution levels, then this approach to air quality regulation may not efficiently target
pollution reduction efforts. We examine the geographic and socioeconomic determinants of vulnerability
to dying from acute exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution. We find that there is substantial
local and regional variability in the share of individuals who are vulnerable to pollution both at the
county and ZIP code level. Vulnerability tends to be negatively related to health and socioeconomic
status. Surprisingly, we find that vulnerability is also negatively related to an area’s average PM2.5
pollution level, suggesting that basing air quality regulation only on current pollution levels may fail
to effectively target regions with the most to gain by reducing exposure.

         Abstract: Policies aimed at reducing the harmful effects of air pollution exposure
         typically focus on areas with high levels of pollution. However, if a population’s
         vulnerability to air pollution is imperfectly correlated with current pollution levels,
         then this approach to air quality regulation may not efficiently target pollution
         reduction efforts. We examine the geographic and socioeconomic determinants of
         vulnerability to dying from acute exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
         pollution. We find that there is substantial local and regional variability in the share
         of individuals who are vulnerable to pollution both at the county and ZIP code level.
         Vulnerability tends to be negatively related to health and socioeconomic status.
         Surprisingly, we find that vulnerability is also negatively related to an area’s
         average PM2.5 pollution level, suggesting that basing air quality regulation only on
         current pollution levels may fail to effectively target regions with the most to gain
         by reducing exposure.


I. Introduction

         Recent research has found that acute pollution exposure is harmful to health even in areas
where ambient pollution levels are generally low, such as in the US (e.g., Ward 2015; Knittel et
al. 2016; Schlenker and Walker 2016; Deryugina et al. 2019). This research suggests that there
may be substantial social benefits to further reductions in US air pollution. However, additional

emissions reductions may require increasingly costly measures, making it crucial to understand
where such reductions would be most beneficial.
        The benefits of air quality regulation in a region depend on many factors, including the
amount by which air pollution is reduced, the vulnerability of the local population to air pollution,
local population density, and, if the pollution-damage function is nonlinear, the initial level of
pollution. Traditional approaches to air quality regulation have targeted regions that have high
levels of pollution. For example, the Clean Air Act requires “non-attainment” areas that fail to
meet air quality standards to take action to reduce pollution and to achieve attainment status as
soon as possible, while areas that meet the standards do not need to take additional actions to
further improve air quality. However, if pollution levels are imperfectly or negatively correlated
with population vulnerability and density, areas with high pollution levels may not be the most
cost-effective places to target for pollution reduction.
        We investigate factors that predict elderly vulnerability to fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
and measure how well they correlate with local PM2.5 levels. By improving our understanding of
the geographic and socioeconomic characteristics that matter for vulnerability, our results can help
policymakers identify the most promising targets for air pollution reduction or for compliance and
enforcement efforts.
        Deryugina, Heutel, Miller, Molitor, and Reif (2019, henceforth DHMMR) show that there
is substantial heterogeneity in vulnerability to acute PM2.5 exposure in the US elderly population.
While acute pollution exposure increases mortality among the elderly overall, a machine-learning-
based analysis involving extensive individual and local characteristics estimates that acute PM2.5
exposure increases the probability of death for only about 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries.
        In this paper, we extend DHMMR’s analysis to identify the geographic and socioeconomic
correlates of such vulnerability and investigate the extent to which factors correlated with
vulnerability are related to local pollution levels. If, for example, poor areas tend to attract pollution
sources, such as factories and traffic, and poor people tend to be in worse health, then targeting
pollution regulation at high-pollution areas may be an effective way of protecting individuals who
are at the highest risk of pollution-related illness or death. However, if vulnerable populations do
not tend to locate in high-pollution areas, then current pollution policy may be poorly targeted. As
a result, existing pollution reduction efforts could be adapted to achieve greater increases in health,
or similar increases in health could be achieved at lower resource costs.



                                                    2
       Although the methods used in the DHMMR vulnerability prediction are computationally
complex, the basic idea is straightforward. Following this approach, we generate two mortality
predictions for each elderly individual who was enrolled in Medicare in 2013. The first captures
their likelihood of dying based on the experiences of similar people on days when they are exposed
to high pollution, while the second predicts the likelihood of death based on the experiences of
similar people on days when they are not exposed to high pollution. The average difference in the
two predictions, which we refer to as the person’s vulnerability index, represents the increased
likelihood of the person dying on a day due to elevated acute PM2.5 exposure.
       After identifying those who are most and least vulnerable to death from pollution exposure,
we compare the prevalence of various characteristics of individuals who are predicted to be highly
vulnerable to PM2.5 to individuals who are predicted to have low vulnerability to PM2.5.
Importantly, we base our predictions on a large set of individual-level measures from Medicare
data and ZIP-code-level socioeconomic factors from the US Census and related datasets. These
rich data allow us to construct accurate and precise measures of vulnerability.
       We find that the individuals identified in our data as most vulnerable to pollution are less
healthy than the least vulnerable on a variety of measures, including the presence of chronic
conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease or related dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), lung cancer, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure, as well as measures of
health care use and spending. Geographically, we find that areas with high proportions of
vulnerable individuals tend to form an L-shaped pattern, extending south from the Dakotas to
Texas and then east along the Gulf Coast states. Areas with high proportions of vulnerable
individuals are poorer; are less urban; have a higher prevalence of obesity and smoking and a lower
prevalence of exercise; have higher overall elderly mortality rates; and have hotter climates, as
measured by the annual number of cooling-degree days.
       We also find significant heterogeneity at the county level within states and also at the ZIP
code level within counties. Average vulnerability and average PM2.5 levels are negatively related
even though average PM2.5 levels are positively related to the prevalence of an array of adverse
health conditions. Finally, the total number of vulnerable individuals in a county is positively but
imperfectly correlated with average PM2.5 levels.
       Overall, these results cast doubt on the presumption that a region’s baseline pollution level
is sufficient to target pollution reduction efforts—whether through regulation or direct



                                                 3
expenditure—on those individuals and communities who will benefit the most. In particular,
regulations such as the Clean Air Act, which impose penalties on high-pollution areas but do not
require reductions in average pollution or mitigation of pollution spikes in low-pollution areas,
may fail to direct resources to their highest-benefit uses. Further, the substantial within-county
heterogeneity in vulnerability that we identify suggests broad, geographically defined approaches
are also likely to be imprecisely targeted and that additional attention should be paid to policies
that account for local population socioeconomic characteristics such as income, education, and
health; local amenities such as hospital quality and capacity; and local environmental
characteristics.
        While DHMMR focused only on individuals living in counties with pollution monitors
(902 counties in total), the sample we use in this paper includes beneficiaries who reside in any
county in the conterminous US (3,101 counties in total), whether or not the county has a pollution
monitor. Adding these new beneficiaries allows us to greatly expand our inquiry into geographic
heterogeneity, as over two-thirds of US counties lack pollution monitors.
        Our study is not without limitations. Most importantly, our analysis focuses on the elderly,
a large vulnerable population likely to benefit from reductions in air pollution, and excludes
working age adults and children. Prior studies have documented significant effects of air pollution
on infant mortality, even in developed countries (Chay and Greenstone 2003; Knittel et al. 2016).
While the elderly represent a large and important fraction of the US population, we emphasize that
our results are not readily applied to younger age groups.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief background on
PM2.5 and describes the data we use. Section III summarizes our analytical approach. Section IV
presents the results, and Section V concludes.


II. Background and Data

        PM2.5 is a mixture of various particles with diameters of less than 2.5 micrometers,
including nitrates, sulfates, ammonium, and carbon (e.g., Kundu and Stone 2014). Manmade PM2.5
comes from power plant and car emissions and can be carried for hundreds of miles away from
where it is emitted. In many parts of the country, particularly the East, regional, rather than local,
emissions make up a significant share of local particulate matter (Environmental Protection




                                                  4
Agency 2004). The extent of pollution transport depends on a host of factors, including wind
direction and speed, precipitation, and chemical reactions with other airborne molecules.
         Many studies have examined the effect of air pollution on various health outcomes,
including mortality. Much of the scientific literature focuses on the health effects of PM2.5 because
fine particulate matter can penetrate lung tissue and get into the bloodstream. Numerous
epidemiological studies have documented a positive correlation between short-term exposure to
particulate matter and mortality, especially from cardiovascular and respiratory disease (e.g., Pope
and Dockery 2006; Samet et al. 2000; Environmental Protection Agency 2011). However, quasi-
experimental methodology such as the one we utilize, has been argued to be much more reliable
than associational studies (Dominici et al. 2014).
         Our health and health care use data come from Medicare administrative files. To inform
our vulnerability index, we use the sample of all elderly beneficiaries aged 65 through 100 enrolled
in Medicare in 2001–2013. We then focus our analysis on a single cohort: those aged 65–100 who
were enrolled in Medicare in 2013. This sample comprises over 97 percent of elderly US residents
that year. 2 Medicare enrollment files provide verified dates of death, age, sex, and county of
residence. The Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) file provides data on health
care use and cost for individuals enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Detailed data on
health care use are not available for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage managed care
plans. 3 The MedPAR file, derived from Medicare Part A (facility) claims, provides information
on each inpatient stay in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. The MedPAR data include
information on the date of admission, length of stay, and total monetary cost of the stay. 4
         Spending on inpatient stays accounted for about 70 percent of all Medicare Part A costs
and about 43 percent of all Medicare spending (including Parts A, B, and D) on elderly fee-for-
service beneficiaries during 1999–2013, the years on which our machine-learning model is trained.
We complement this dataset with data on outpatient ER visits that do not result in admission to the
hospital from Medicare outpatient claims files, although we do not observe the cost of these visits.
Because our unit of analysis is the county-day, we aggregate the Medicare data using patients’

  Focusing on a single cohort ensures that each individual who was alive in 2013 appears in our data only once.

  In 2013, 28 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.

  Our measure of cost is the total allowed charges due to the provider and includes all monetary costs of the stay,
consisting of payments made by Medicare, the beneficiary, and/or another payer.

county of residence and the admission date (for inpatient stays) or the date of service (for outpatient
ER visits).
        The chronic conditions segment of the Master Beneficiary Summary File provides
individual-level indicators for the presence of 27 different chronic conditions, such as heart
disease, COPD, diabetes, and depression. These indicators are generated by professional medical
coders who infer these conditions from a detailed examination of the claims data. Because they
are based on claims data, this information is only available for beneficiaries in fee-for-service
Medicare. And because it may take time for the relevant claims to appear in the data, the chronic
conditions indicators are most reliable for individuals who have been enrolled in fee-for-service
Medicare for several years.
        Air pollution levels are correlated with temperature and precipitation, which may have
independent effects on mortality. Our analysis therefore controls for these variables to avoid
confounding their effects with the effects of pollution. Our temperature and precipitation data
come from Schlenker and Roberts (2009) and include total daily precipitation and maximum and
minimum temperatures for each point on a 2.5-by-2.5-mile grid covering the conterminous US
from 1999 to 2013. The Schlenker and Roberts (2009) data are derived from combining underlying
data from PRISM and weather stations. 5 We aggregate to the county-day level by averaging the
daily measures across all grid points in the county.
        ZIP-code-level characteristics include various income and employment measures (e.g.,
median income, median home value, fraction of the population below the poverty line, labor force
participation rate), measures of overall population health (e.g., the fraction of population with
hearing or vision difficulties), and some other characteristics (e.g., travel time to work, prevalence
of different heating fuels). These data are taken from the American Community Survey’s 2007–
2011 five-year estimates. Health-related variables such as disability and health coverage come
from the 2008–2012 ACS, the first years that this information was included in the ACS.

        Similarly, our county-level characteristics, which we correlate with the vulnerability index,
come from a variety of sources, including Medicare administrative records, the US Census, the

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), and variables used and constructed by
Chetty and Hendren (2018) in their study of neighborhood impacts on intergenerational mobility.
Characteristics we consider include average income; average Medicare spending; population
health indicators such as the rate of smoking, exercise, and obesity; average temperatures; the
crime rate; and measures of intergenerational income mobility. These characteristics are intended
to capture an area’s key environmental, economic, and public health conditions.



III. Empirical Strategy

       We are interested in estimating the causal effect of air pollution on mortality. Quantifying
this effect in non-experimental data is complicated because air pollution is correlated with many
other factors that matter for health. For example, traffic jams increase both pollution levels and
stress, and low-income individuals are more likely to reside in high-pollution areas. Moreover, air
pollution is not well measured: even monitored counties typically have only a few Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) pollution monitors. But an individual’s air pollution exposure likely
depends on finer measures of geography—such as which side of a highway she lives on. Such
measurement errors can lead to biased estimates of the effect of air pollution even in settings where
the variation in air pollution is as good as random.
       To overcome these difficulties, our empirical strategy builds on DHMMR, who exploit
quasi-random transport of PM2.5 by the wind to estimate the mortality costs of acute air pollution
exposure. Because changes in daily wind direction are unlikely to be related to other factors that
affect health (such as traffic levels), this approach is likely to capture health effects attributable
solely to air pollution. This approach also addresses measurement error concerns because it
employs variation in air pollution that is blown in from far away and affects an entire area.
       The amount of transported pollution is significant (Zhang et al. 2017). For example, the
EPA estimates that most of the PM2.5 in the Eastern United States was transported from hundreds
of miles away (EPA 2004). DHMMR exploit this variation by instrumenting for daily PM2.5 with
the local wind direction. Their study shows that local wind direction is strongly predictive of
changes in local PM2.5, even after conditioning on extensive controls for other atmospheric
conditions and a host of fixed effects.




                                                  7
        DHMMR’s analysis focuses on areas with EPA monitors, which includes 902 counties
covering about 70 percent of the national elderly population. Their instrumental variables design
estimates that, on average, a one-unit increase in PM2.5 (about 10 percent of the daily mean)
increases same-day mortality by approximately 0.36 deaths per million beneficiaries in their
sample. To estimate heterogeneity in the vulnerability to dying from acute air pollution exposure,
they then apply a recently developed machine-learning method (Chernozhukov, Demirer, Duflo,
and Fernandez-Val 2018, hereafter CDDF) to the rich set of characteristics available in the
Medicare data. CDDF’s method demonstrates how to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects
using machine-learning techniques in the context of a binary treatment variable.
        To form a binary treatment variable, DHMMR assign a person-day observation to the
“treatment” group if the local wind direction on that day is associated with an above-median level
of PM2.5, as measured in their first-stage specification. Otherwise, the observation is assigned to
the “control” group. They then train a gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm (Chen and Guestrin
2016) to predict one-day mortality, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , as a function of various measures of weather
conditions, Census division fixed effects, local economic conditions, and individual-level
characteristics, all denoted by 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . The model is estimated separately for observations in the
treatment and control groups, resulting in two mortality prediction models.
        In this paper, we apply the models estimated by DHMMR to the 2013 Medicare cohort
(i.e., all individuals 65 and older who were alive and enrolled in Medicare at some point in 2013).
Notably, our sample includes beneficiaries who reside in counties without pollution monitors and
who were thus not included in DHMMR. The addition of these new beneficiaries allows us to
greatly expand our inquiry into geographic heterogeneity, as about two-thirds of US counties lack
pollution monitors. We can include these beneficiaries in our vulnerability analysis because, as we
explain below, pollution data are not required to calculate the vulnerability index. (PM2.5 data are
required only to estimate the model, which has already been done in DHMMR.)
        To ensure that we have reliable chronic condition indicators, we restrict our attention to
beneficiaries who have been continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare for at least two
years. 6 We create an observation for each day such an individual is alive and then predict their



6
 There were 43.5 million Medicare beneficiaries in 2013 (Deryugina et al. 2019). After excluding individuals without
sufficient health history information and those individuals used to train the DHMMR prediction algorithm, we are left

daily mortality probabilities using both the treatment group and control group prediction models. 7
The difference between these two predictions, 𝑆𝑆̂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), represents the change in the observation’s
predicted likelihood of death due to being exposed to a high-pollution wind direction, and it is
referred to as a proxy predictor of the (true) conditional average treatment effect, 𝑠𝑠0 (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). We then
take the person-level average of these daily proxy predictors to calculate a single proxy predictor
for each beneficiary, 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖̅ (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ).
         𝑆𝑆̂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and, by extension, 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖̅ (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) can be used to infer where in the distribution of
treatment effects an observation lies. DHMMR estimate average treatment effects for various
percentiles of the proxy predictor in their sample and conclude that about 25 percent of the
Medicare population is vulnerable to acute fluctuations in PM2.5. Given this finding, we focus our
analysis on individuals whose average proxy predictors place them in the top 25 percent of the
overall distribution of 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖̅ (𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) in the 2013 Medicare cohort. We hereafter refer to these individuals
as “vulnerable to acute PM2.5 exposure.”


IV. Results

IV.1 The geographic distribution of air pollution vulnerability
       Table 1 compares the characteristics of 2013 elderly Medicare beneficiaries who are
vulnerable to acute PM2.5 exposure to the characteristics of those who are not vulnerable. On
average, those who are vulnerable are almost four-and-a-half years older and are four percentage
points more likely to be male. They are more than twice as likely to suffer from Alzheimer’s or
related dementia, lung cancer, and congestive heart failure and are almost twice as likely to have
chronic kidney disease or COPD. Consistent with their poor health indicators, beneficiaries who
are vulnerable to acute PM2.5 exposure also have substantially higher medical spending and are
much more likely to have experienced various medical events, such as dialysis and hospice stays.

  The mortality models from DHMMR include controls for two leads and two lags of the treatment indicator. Because
we cannot determine treatment status for observations in counties without pollution monitors, we omit these controls
from this paper. Omitting these high-level controls is unlikely to have any meaningful impact on our individual-level
vulnerability index.

         Figure 1 shows the geographic distribution of elderly who are vulnerable to acute PM2.5
exposure as a percentage of the overall number of elderly Medicare beneficiaries in a given
county. 8 Values below 25 percent indicate that a county’s beneficiaries are, on average, less
vulnerable than the average fee-for-service beneficiary in the nation, while values above 25 percent
indicate a disproportionately vulnerable population. As is readily apparent in Figure 1, there is a
great deal of dispersion in this measure of vulnerability: some counties have less than 10 percent
of their beneficiaries classified as vulnerable, while others have over 50 percent classified as
vulnerable. In addition, there is substantial local variation in this measure, with some adjacent
counties having very different scores. Although some of this variation may be due to noise, county-
level variation can also be due to variation in factors like income and urbanity, which can vary
discontinuously from one county to the next.

         The counties shaded light blue or blue have between 20 and 30 percent of beneficiaries in
the top 25 percent of vulnerability, which is near the 25 percent that would be expected if the
county were representative of Medicare as a whole. Counties in lighter shades of blue and shades
of purple represent counties where there are substantial deviations from the average of 25 percent.
These deviations could be due to differences between the health or socioeconomic characteristics
of the beneficiaries in that county and in Medicare overall, or they could be due to differences
between characteristics of the county (e.g., healthcare infrastructure, baseline pollution, etc.) and
those of the typical county where Medicare beneficiaries live. Our analysis below will identify
some of these associations and illustrate the potential importance of both types of factors.
         Figure 1 reveals several important patterns. First, areas with the highest concentration of
vulnerable people tend to be concentrated in an L-shaped band running south from the Dakotas to
Texas and then east through the Gulf Coast states. An additional group of counties with high
concentrations of vulnerable people runs through eastern Kentucky and West Virginia. Second,

 Recall that we define an individual as “vulnerable” if our model predicts that individual to be in the top 25 percent
of the vulnerability distribution.

there are marked differences in average vulnerability across states. For example, the West Coast
states tend to have the lowest fraction of vulnerable people, while New England is in the middle,
and Nebraska and West Virginia have high levels of vulnerability. Third, while many states, such
as those along the Pacific Coast, are fairly uniform in terms of vulnerability, there are a number of
states where there is significant within-state variation in vulnerability. For example, counties in
western Kentucky tend to have lower concentrations of vulnerable people than eastern Kentucky,
the Florida Panhandle has more vulnerability than the southern part of the state, and the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan is more vulnerable than most of the Lower Peninsula.
       Given the substantial amount of county-level heterogeneity in vulnerability depicted in
Figure 1, a natural question is what drives this vulnerability. Because our analysis is not a causal
one, we cannot speak directly to that question. But we can investigate the association between
vulnerability and an array of county-level characteristics.
       Figure 2 shows the relationship between the county-level share of vulnerable beneficiaries
and various county-level characteristics. We emphasize that these relationships are descriptive and
should not be interpreted causally. Some of these characteristics will be directly correlated with
ZIP-code-level variables that were used in constructing the mortality models underlying our
vulnerability index (e.g., median income and home value). Other characteristics are not used
directly in constructing the vulnerability index (e.g., share urban, percent obese) but may
nonetheless be correlated with characteristics that were included.


                                   Insert Figure 2 About Here


       Each estimate reported in Figure 2 was obtained from a separate county-level regression
where the outcome variable was the share of vulnerable beneficiaries in a county and the
independent variable was a county characteristic. We consider one county characteristic at a time
because some characteristics are highly correlated; in such cases, including multiple characteristics
in the same regression can lead to a loss of precision and misleading conclusions. To make the
results directly comparable to each other, we report coefficients and confidence intervals scaled
by the interdecile range of a given characteristic (i.e., the difference between the 90th and 10th
percentiles in our sample of counties). Thus, the results can be interpreted as the change in the
share of the population that is vulnerable (in percentage points) when comparing a county in the



                                                 11
90th percentile of the distribution of a particular characteristic to a county in the 10th percentile of
that distribution.
        The associations shown in Figure 2 illustrate that vulnerability tends to be negatively
related to health. Healthy behaviors, such as exercising, significantly decrease vulnerability,
although in our elderly sample exercising may be acting primarily as an indicator of baseline
health. In contrast, obesity and smoking prevalence are positively correlated with vulnerability,
although this association may arise because obesity and smoking are correlated with other
comorbidities rather than suggesting a causal effect on vulnerability. This possibility is supported
by the fact that a high mortality rate is positively related to vulnerability. Indicators of high
socioeconomic status are generally negatively related to vulnerability. High-income and high-
median home values are both associated with low vulnerability, while a high poverty rate is
positively related to vulnerability.
        The climate variables, cooling degree days and heating degree days, are also related to
vulnerability. Cooling degree days (which are high in generally hot places) are positively related
to vulnerability, while heating degree days (which are high in generally cold places) are not
significantly related to vulnerability. This result is somewhat surprising since studies have shown
that both very hot and very cold days increase overall elderly mortality. The fact that heat interacts
with vulnerability to air pollution in a way that cold does not suggests that different mechanisms
likely underlie these two phenomena.
        In addition to identifying areas with a high proportion of vulnerable people, optimal policy
might also depend on identifying where the most vulnerable people live for a few reasons. First,
while approximately 25 percent of the US elderly population are vulnerable to acute PM2.5
exposure in the sense that they have a higher expected probability of death on polluted days than
on clean days, for some of these people the increased risk is small, and thus it may be more
effective to target air quality regulation at areas where the potential benefits of pollution reduction
are large. Second, focusing on the top 25 percent of vulnerability may mask heterogeneity in the
proportion of individuals who are most vulnerable to pollution exposure. To investigate these
issues, we next turn to an analysis of geographic heterogeneity in this extremely vulnerable group.
        Figure 3 shows the geographic distribution of beneficiaries who are extremely vulnerable
to acute PM2.5 exposure: those who are in the top 1 percent of the distribution of the proxy predictor
𝑆𝑆̅(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). The patterns are overall similar to those depicted in Figure 1, with areas with a high



                                                  12
proportion of extremely vulnerable people falling along an L-shaped band from the Dakotas to
Texas and then east along the Gulf Coast states.


                                          Insert Figure 3 About Here


         Figure 1 and 3 illustrate the geographic distribution of vulnerable and “extremely”
vulnerable populations, respectively. To quantify how correlated these two measures are, we
estimate a population-weighted regression of the county-level share of vulnerable beneficiaries on
the county-level share of extremely vulnerable beneficiaries. The R-squared from this regression
is 0.61, indicating that considering the share of beneficiaries who are in the top 1 percent of the
vulnerability index is highly but not perfectly informative about those who are in the top 25
percent. 9 An advantage of employing the broader (top 25 percent) definition of vulnerability is that
it is subject to less measurement error in less-populated areas, so we focus on the top 25 percent
for the remainder of the paper. There are, however, some differences in the patterns that we will
briefly remark upon here. For example, at the southern tip of Texas, there are areas where the
proportion of individuals in the top 1 percent of vulnerability is very high (purple) relative to other
counties, but the proportion of individuals in the top 25 percent is more moderate. The opposite is
also true, with counties where the relative frequency of individuals in the top 1 percent is low but
the frequency of individuals in the top 25 percent is moderate.
         We next turn to a ZIP-code-level analysis to illustrate heterogeneity at a very granular level.
Figure 4 shows the geographic distribution of vulnerable beneficiaries (those in the top 25 percent
of the 𝑆𝑆̅(𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) distribution) at the ZIP code level. To comply with disclosure rules, we do not show
ZIP codes that have fewer than 100 Medicare beneficiaries in 2013. We observe 32,331 ZIP codes
in our data, 21,506 of which have at least 100 Medicare beneficiaries.

 Analogous to Figure 2, Figure A.1 shows the correlation between various county-level characteristics and the share
of beneficiaries in the top 1 percent of vulnerability. Figure A.2 presents a scatterplot between the county-level share
of beneficiaries in the top 25 percent of vulnerability and the share of beneficiaries in the top 1 percent of
vulnerability.


                                                          13
        Comparing the ZIP-code-level map in Figure 4 to the county-level map in Figure 1 reveals
the existence of significant within-county heterogeneity. For example, the northern part of the
lower peninsula of Michigan appears to have low vulnerability in Figure 1’s county-level map, but
Figure 4 reveals several highly vulnerable ZIP codes. Similarly, seen at the county level, Maine
appears to be uniformly moderately vulnerable, while the ZIP-code-level analysis reveals a mix of
high- (purple) and low- (light blue) vulnerability ZIP codes. While some of this variation may be
due to noise, many of the important correlates of vulnerability identified in Figure 2, such as
income, are known to vary within counties.
        To illustrate the degree of ZIP-code-level variability in the share of vulnerable
beneficiaries, Appendix Figures A.3–A.7 display ZIP-code-level maps of five commuting zones,
some of which exhibit a lot of variability and some of which have very little variability. 10 To
quantify the amount of within- versus across-county variation more systematically, we regress the
ZIP-code-level share of vulnerable beneficiaries (including ZIP codes with less than 100
beneficiaries) on county fixed effects, weighting by the number of beneficiaries in that ZIP code.
The R-squared in this regression is 0.33, suggesting that the majority (67 percent) of the ZIP-code-
level variation depends on within-county differences. We perform a similar exercise using the
share of beneficiaries who are extremely vulnerable (top 1 percent) and find that 76 percent of the
ZIP-code-level variation depends on within-county differences.

IV.2 Vulnerability and pollution levels
         Given the high degree of geographic variation in vulnerability, it is natural to investigate
whether that variation is correlated with variation in underlying pollution levels. For example, it
may be that a given pollution shock is more deadly in regions that already have high pollution
levels. Indeed, this hypothesis is at least consistent with the idea that pollution regulation should
be targeted at locations with high pollution levels.
        To give a sense of the geographic distribution of pollution, the map in Figure 5 shows the
average annual PM2.5 level for each US county in 2013. PM2.5 pollution tends to be highest in
California and in the Rust Belt states ranging from Illinois to Pennsylvania and lowest along the
Rocky Mountains.


10
  Commuting Zones (CZs) are geographies similar to Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) that group nearby
areas based on commuting patterns. For our purposes, CZs are preferred due to their superior coverage of rural areas
and the fact that they are defined at the supra-county level.


                                                        14
                                       Insert Figure 5 About Here


         Figure 6a shows the county-level relationship between the share of elderly beneficiaries
who are vulnerable and 2013 PM2.5 levels, with a population-weighted trend line drawn to aid in
visualizing the statistical relationship between the two. Perhaps surprisingly, less polluted counties
tend to have a higher share of vulnerable beneficiaries: for each one-unit increase in average PM2.5
levels, the share of vulnerable beneficiaries decreases by 0.83 percentage points. While this
correlation could be coincidental (e.g., urban areas may be more polluted and attract more frail
elderly because of superior medical care), another potential explanation is that those who are
vulnerable to air pollution explicitly avoid more polluted areas. Indeed, residential sorting on the
basis of air pollution levels has been documented in numerous prior studies (see Banzhaf et al.
2019 for a review). In addition, if we were to interpret this relationship causally, it suggests that
reducing average pollution levels makes individuals more vulnerable to pollution spikes and vice
versa.
         Figure 6b shows the county-level relationship between the number of elderly beneficiaries
who are vulnerable (on a log scale) and 2013 PM2.5 levels. 11 In this case, less polluted counties
tend to have fewer vulnerable beneficiaries. However, because the relationship is far from perfect,
targeting counties based on pollution levels would still be less effective in reaching vulnerable
individuals than targeting based on vulnerability. For example, targeting the 406 counties that are
at or above the 75th population-weighted percentile of 2013 PM2.5 levels (above 10.3 µg/m3) would
reach 26.5 percent of all vulnerable beneficiaries. By contrast, a policy targeting the same number
of counties based on how many vulnerable beneficiaries live there would reach 60.9 percent of all
vulnerable beneficiaries. Overall, Figure 6 lends additional support to the idea that targeting
regulation at highly polluted areas may be less beneficial for population health than simple
intuition would suggest.




11
   Analogous to Figure 2, Figure A.8 shows the relationship between the number of vulnerable beneficiaries and
various county-level characteristics. Although a few county-level characteristics—such as median home value, local
taxation, and local government spending—cease to be significant predictors of vulnerability, the ranking of
characteristics by the magnitude of the correlation is virtually identical to Figure 2.


                                                       15
                                   Insert Figure 6 About Here


       As shown in Table 1, the Medicare beneficiaries who are most vulnerable to air pollution
are less healthy than the average beneficiary. If beneficiaries in good general health are more likely
to reside in areas with high levels of air pollution, then this might explain why we find an inverse
relationship between a county’s pollution levels and its average vulnerability.
       We investigate that possibility by estimating the correlations between PM2.5 levels and the
other predictors of vulnerability we identified in Table 1. Figure 7 displays scatterplots of annual
PM2.5 levels against the county-level share of beneficiaries with a particular chronic condition.
Although overall vulnerability is negatively correlated with PM2.5 levels, more polluted counties,
on average, have a higher share of beneficiaries with congestive heart failure (panel (a)), stroke
(panel (b)), and Alzheimer’s/dementia (panel (e)). More polluted counties also have higher average
Medicare spending (panel (f)). However, we do not detect a significant relationship between
ambient pollution levels and COPD (panel (c)) or lung cancer (panel (d)). Overall, these results
suggest that the negative relationship between ambient PM2.5 and vulnerability is not driven by
chronic condition or average total Medicare spending.


                                   Insert Figure 7 About Here


       The lack of a significant relationship between background pollution levels and COPD is
particularly interesting since the harmful effects of the small particulates comprising PM2.5 are
thought to arise when the particles are inhaled and irritate the lungs. The fact that we do not find
increased incidence of COPD in areas with high pollution levels is consequently surprising. This
null result could be due to the presence of confounders that are correlated with PM2.5 levels.
Alternatively, the impact of high pollution levels on the lungs could manifest in some way that is
not classified as COPD. In either case, this issue warrants further study.


V. Conclusion

       This paper has explored the socioeconomic and geographic correlates of vulnerability to
acute PM2.5 exposure in the United States. Building on the analysis in DHMMR, we apply the
model from that paper to the 2013 Medicare cohort. While DHMMR was restricted to 902 counties


                                                 16
containing pollution monitors, our sample includes all Medicare beneficiaries living in the
conterminous US (3,101 counties in total), which permits a detailed investigation of geographic
heterogeneity. Our paper computes a proxy indicator for the conditional average treatment effect
for each individual in our data and uses that to classify individuals as vulnerable or not vulnerable
to acute air pollution.
        As one might expect, we find that vulnerability is positively and significantly associated
with a range of health indicators. Individuals in the top quartile of vulnerability are older, more
likely to be male, and more likely to exhibit chronic conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease or
related dementia, chronic kidney disease, COPD, congestive heart failure, or lung cancer. Highly
vulnerable individuals are also likely to spend more on health care and to consume more health
care services.
        We aggregate across individuals within a particular geographic area to investigate
geographic heterogeneity. At the county level, we find a large degree of variation in the share of
individuals in the top quartile of vulnerability, ranging from below 5 percent to above 50 percent.
The areas with the highest proportion of individuals in the vulnerable category lie in an L-shaped
band that ranges from the Dakotas south to Texas and then eastward through the Gulf Coast states
toward Georgia and Northern Florida. An additional group of areas with large shares of vulnerable
elderly fall in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia. In contrast, many of the counties in New
England and Pacific Coast states have lower-than-expected shares of vulnerable residents.
        Given the large amount of county-level heterogeneity, we next turn toward investigating
the geographic and socioeconomic correlates. As might be expected from the individual-level
analysis, we find that vulnerability and health tend to be positively correlated at the county level
as well. Counties with high shares of individuals who report exercising have low shares of
vulnerable individuals, while counties with high levels of smoking, obesity, and elderly mortality
rates have high shares of vulnerable individuals. The relationship between health care
infrastructure and vulnerability tends to be more mixed, with high numbers of physicians per capita
and high hospital quality correlating with low vulnerability, while having a high amount of hospital
beds per capita and high Medicare spending per beneficiary are both correlated with higher
vulnerability. The reasons for this discrepancy are not obvious, although reverse causation likely
plays a role: areas with more vulnerable people will tend to have higher Medicare spending and
higher mortality.



                                                 17
       Turning to socioeconomic indicators, counties with high average income and home values
have lower shares of vulnerable individuals, while counties with high poverty levels have higher
shares. Having a large population and a high proportion of individuals living in urban areas are
associated with lower vulnerability. Interestingly, areas with high levels of government services,
as measured by local government spending per capita and local taxation per capita, tend to have
lower shares of vulnerable elderly.
       Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the share of vulnerable individuals within a county is
negatively related to baseline pollution, although it is positively related to various measures of
poor health. Although the exact mechanism underlying this pattern is beyond the scope of this
paper, it suggests that using high pollution as a basis for targeting air pollution efforts, as is done
under the Clean Air Acts and other environmental regulations, may lead to misallocation of
resources.
       Although our study sheds substantial light on the geographic and socioeconomic
heterogeneity in vulnerability to air pollution, some caveats are in order. First, as we have stated
throughout the paper, our analysis is not causal. Nevertheless, the correlational patterns we identify
in the paper may provide inspiration for future causal investigations. Second, our study is limited
to the elderly. Although there is substantial evidence that the elderly are particularly vulnerable to
pollution shocks, pollution has also been shown to increase infant mortality. To the extent that
patterns of infant mortality differ from those of the elderly, these differences should also be taken
into account by policymakers seeking to direct resources toward pollution reduction. Finally,
although our analysis is based on a large sample of elderly Medicare beneficiaries from across the
United States, our vulnerability computations are based only on a single year (2013). If
vulnerability changes over time, then our 2013 analysis may not generalize to current (or future)
vulnerability.

Figure A.1. The figure shows correlations between the share of beneficiaries who were extremely
vulnerable to acute PM2.5 exposure (i.e., in the top 1 percent of the acute PM2.5 vulnerability index)
in 2013 and county-level characteristics. Each estimate is from a separate county-level regression
of the share extremely vulnerable on the given characteristic.
