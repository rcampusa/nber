An Analysis of the Labor Market for Uber’s Driver-Partners in the United States
Jonathan V. Hall and Alan B. Krueger
NBER Working Paper No. 22843
November 2016
JEL No. J01

                                          ABSTRACT

Uber, the ride-sharing company launched in 2010, has grown at an exponential rate. This paper
provides the first comprehensive analysis of the labor market for Uber’s driver-partners, based on
both survey and administrative data. Drivers who partner with Uber appear to be attracted to the
platform largely because of the flexibility it offers, the level of compensation, and the fact that
earnings per hour do not vary much with the number of hours worked. Uber’s driver-partners are
more similar in terms of their age and education to the general workforce than to taxi drivers and
chauffeurs. Most of Uber’s driver-partners had full- or part-time employment prior to joining
Uber, and many continued in those positions after starting to drive with the Uber platform, which
makes the flexibility to set their own hours all the more valuable. Uber’s driver-partners also
often cited the desire to smooth fluctuations in their income as a reason for partnering with Uber.

Introduction
Over the last few years, there has been much speculation as to whether the so-called "on-
demand economy" will positively or negatively impact the future of work, but little
evidence exists to support either position. In this paper, we study the characteristics, labor
supply and earnings of workers who provide car rides using the Uber platform. Drivers
who partner with Uber (Uber refers to them as “driver-partners”) provide transportation
services to customers requesting rides via Uber’s app on their smartphones or other
devices. Uber is a quintessential on-demand economy company, responsible for perhaps
two-thirds of all activity in the platform-based labor market according to Harris and
Krueger (2015). This study provides the first detailed analysis of a representative,
national sample of Uber driver-partners. We draw on anonymized administrative data
from Uber on the driving histories, schedules, and earnings of drivers using the Uber
platform from 2012-14, a survey of 601 driver-partners conducted in December 2014 and
a survey of 632 driver-partners conducted in November 2015. In addition, as a point of
comparison, we report data on the characteristics of a representative sample of taxi
drivers and chauffeurs, and of all workers, based on several government surveys.

Uber has grown exponentially since it was first launched in the U.S. Once applicants
qualify to partner with Uber, they are free to choose to spend as much or as little time as
they like offering their services to passengers in any given month.1 Whether to access the
app on any given day, and when, are entirely up to the drivers’ discretion. This flexibility
is appealing to driver-partners, but it creates a complication for counting the number of
active driver-partners since, at any time, drivers can choose to pursue other work
opportunities or spend time taking care of non-work obligations, not utilize the Uber
platform for a period of time, and then possibly return to using the Uber platform in later
months. To address this issue, the figure reports the number of driver-partners who
provided at least four trips to passengers in the month indicated (which we refer to as
“active partners”). From a base of near zero in mid-2012, more than 460,000 driver-
partners actively partnered with Uber at the end of 2015 in the United States. The number
of active Uber driver-partners approximately doubled every six months from the middle
of 2012 to the end of 2015. At this growth rate, every American would be an Uber driver
within five years – which implies that the growth rate will inevitably slow down.

  Although requirements vary by city, before they can utilize the Uber platform, a potential driver typically
must: (1) pass a background check and a review of his/her driving record; (2) submit documentation of
insurance, registration, and a valid driver’s license; (3) successfully complete a city-knowledge test; and (4)
drive a car that meets a quality inspection and is less than a certain number of years old.

One theme that emerges from the following analysis is that a tremendous amount of
sorting takes place in the on-demand economy, and, by dint of their backgrounds, family
circumstances, and other pursuits, Uber’s driver-partners are well matched to the type of
work they are doing. Notably, Uber's driver-partners are attracted to the flexible
schedules that driving on the Uber platform affords. The hours that driver-partners spend
using the Uber platform can, and do, vary considerably from day to day and week to
week, depending on workers’ desires in light of market conditions. In addition, most
driver-partners do not appear to turn to Uber out of desperation or because they face an
absence of other opportunities in the job market—only eight percent were unemployed
just before they started working on the Uber platform—but rather because the nature of
the work, the flexibility, and the compensation appeals to them compared with other
available options. Even as the national unemployment rate fell to 5 percent, the number
of active Uber drivers continued to rise.

These findings likely relate to a broader, more generalized demand by many individuals
for workplace policies that favor flexible work schedules, family-oriented leave policies,
and telecommuting arrangements, over the standard nine-to-five work schedule, in order
to support a more family-friendly lifestyle. Historically, independent contractors have
reported in surveys that they prefer their working arrangements to traditional employment
relationships, and this tendency appears to be continuing in the on-demand economy.
Demand for work opportunities that offer flexible schedules is partly driven by the aging
of the workforce and the increase in secondary earners, and it will likely increase as a
result of ongoing demographic trends. Flexible work opportunities like Uber can also
help workers smooth fluctuations in other sources of income (Farrell and Greig, 2016a).
In addition, if changes to the health care system help reduce job lock—by making health
insurance more readily available and accessible to individuals—more people are likely to
become entrepreneurs and take advantage of the flexibility and income-generating
potential made possible by the on-demand economy. For these reasons as well, it is
critical to understand how the on-demand economy is affecting work opportunities.

This paper provides a step toward understanding the nature of work in the on-demand
economy by reporting new evidence on hours of work, income, and the motivations and
backgrounds of participants in one of its important segments, driver-partners using the
Uber platform. The next section provides a brief overview of the literature on contingent
and alternative work arrangements as context for the growth of Uber. The second section
draws on the BSG data to describe the backgrounds and motivations of Uber driver-
partners. The third section utilizes anonymized, aggregated administrative data to
describe the driving histories, schedules, cross-city growth rates, and earnings of Uber
driver-partners. The final section concludes and suggests directions for further research.

Literature Review
The size, growth, and nature of the contingent workforce in the United States has long
been debated. This debate continues with the advent of the on-demand economy.2 One of
the problems with this debate, however, is that analysts have employed multiple
definitions of contingent work, ranging from the self-employed to temporary workers to
part-time workers to on-call workers. Contingent workers can be defined broadly or
narrowly, and magnitudes and trends vary depending on the particular definition.3

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) included a supplemental module to collect
information on various forms of contingent and alternative work arrangements in the
Current Population Survey (CPS) in 1995, 2001, and 2005 that provides the most
informative data available, although it is now somewhat out of date. 4 The BLS
Contingent Worker Survey (CWS) found that the contingent workforce, defined as
workers “who do not expect their jobs to last or who reported that their jobs are
temporary,” is relatively small, and did not grow between 1995 and 2005. In 1995, from
2.2 percent to 4.9 percent of the workforce was employed in a contingent position,
depending on the definition, and in 2005 these figures ranged from 1.8 percent to 4.1
percent.5 These figures are clearly small, with no indication of an upward trend.

Claims that contingent workers represent a much larger share of the workforce generally
count part-time workers as contingent workers, even though part-time workers typically
are employed in traditional employment relationships. As the BLS reported, “the vast
majority of part-time workers (91 percent) were not employed in contingent
arrangements.”6 Nevertheless, data on part-time work do not point to an upward trend. As
Bernhard (2014) notes, “After increasing during the 1970s, both the overall percent part-
time and the percent involuntary part-time have been largely flat, with the exception of
cyclical increases during recessions.” The share of workers in part-time positions (which
BLS defines as usually working less than 35 hours a week) has shown little secular trend
over the past three decades. In 1995, 17.8 percent of all workers reported that they
usually worked part-time hours according to data from the CPS. That figure fell to 16.8
percent in 2005 and 16.5 percent in 2007, and then rose to 19.8 percent in 2009 during

  For example, in his critique of the “task rabbit” economy, Kuttner (2013) claims, “The move to insecure,
irregular jobs represents the most profound economic change of the past four decades.”

arrangements.

the Great Recession but has since declined. In 2014, some 18.3 percent of workers were
in part-time positions, hardly different from 20 years earlier.

Katz and Krueger (2016) extended the BLS’s CWS by including a subset of the questions
on alternative work arrangements on the Rand American Life Panel in fall 2015. They
found that the share of workers in alternative work arrangements – defined to include
freelancers, workers who were contracted out by one firm to work for another firm,
temporary help agency workers, and on-call workers – increased from about 11 percent in
2005 to nearly 16 percent in 2015. It is important to note that the CWS and Rand data are
limited to individuals’ main job. Many workers who participate in the on-demand
economy may do so as a secondary job.

Counting both main and secondary jobs, Katz and Krueger further found that only 0.5
percent of the workforce was involved in providing services directly to customers
through an online intermediary. About twice as many workers said they provided services
to customers through an offline intermediary, such as Avon, as through an online
intermediary, such as Uber or Taskrabbit.

Other estimates also suggest that less than 1 percent of the U.S. workforce participated in
the on-demand economy in 2015, although the on-demand workforce was growing very
rapidly. For example, Farrell and Greig (2016a) estimate of 0.6 percent of the working-
age population (or approximately 0.4 percent of the workforce) based on the frequency of
bank deposits from 30 online work platforms. Farrell and Greig (2016b) further found
that, though decelerating, the annual growth rate in the number of workers receiving
income from these platforms each month exceeded 100 percent in the fall of 2015. Based
on data from Google Trends, Harris and Krueger (2015) infer that Uber is by far the
largest on-demand labor platform, which makes an understanding of the characteristics,
labor supply behavior, and motivation of Uber’s driver-partners all the more important.

BSG Survey of Uber's Driver-Partners
Uber contracted with the Benenson Survey Group (BSG) to conduct a web survey of
Uber’s driver-partners in December 2014 in 20 market areas that represented 85 percent
of all of Uber’s U.S. driver-partners. The survey was conducted again in November 2015
in 25 market areas that currently represent 68 percent of Uber’s U.S. driver-partners. A
total of 601 drivers completed the 2014 survey and 833 drivers completed the 2015
survey. Although the response rate to the surveys was only around 10 percent, based on a
comparison of aggregated administrative data, the (weighted) respondents do not appear
to be very different from the full set of driver-partners in terms of their average work

                                                5
hours or hourly earnings.7 In this section we highlight findings from the surveys that are
relevant for understanding the labor market for Uber’s driver-partners and their
motivations for partnering with Uber, and contrast the demographic characteristics of
Uber driver-partners with those of taxi drivers and chauffeurs (Census occupation code
9140) based on data collected in the American Community Survey (ACS), as well as all
workers. We emphasize findings from the 2014 survey, and note any significant changes
between the 2014 and 2015 surveys.

Driver Demographics
Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of Uber’s driver-partners based on
the 2014 BSG survey and reports the corresponding characteristics of taxi drivers and
chauffeurs and the entire workforce in the same 20 markets surveyed by BSG, drawing
from 2012-2013 ACS data.8

Uber's driver-partners are spread throughout the age distribution, mirroring the workforce
as a whole rather than taxi drivers or chauffeurs. Nineteen percent of Uber's driver-
partners are under age 30, and 24.5 percent are age 50 or older. By contrast, taxi drivers
and chauffeurs are substantially older, with nine percent under age 30, and 44 percent age
50 or above. The greater representation of younger people among Uber’s driver-partners
is probably a reflection of the fact that Uber provides a new opportunity, and older
workers are less likely to change jobs, but it may also reflect entry barriers into the taxi
driver and chauffeur professions that make it more difficult for younger people to obtain
such jobs.

  The BSG survey utilized a stratified design, and weights were derived to make the sample representative
of all drivers in terms of the services they offered (uberX, UberBLACK or both); other strata were drawn in
proportion to the population and self weighting. All statistics reported here from the BSG survey are
weighted to reflect the survey design. Where cited, question numbers refer to the BSG survey.

  The 20 markets in 2014 were: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los
Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New Jersey, New York City, Orange County, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San
Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The 24 markets in 2015 were: Atlanta, Baton Rouge,

Women make up 14 percent of Uber's driver-partners, which exceeds the percentage of
taxi drivers and chauffeurs who are women in those markets (eight percent), but is less
than the share of women in the workforce overall.

Half of Uber’s driver-partners are married, which is slightly below the corresponding
figure for taxi drivers and chauffeurs, but close to the figure for all workers, probably, at
least in part, a reflection of the varying age distributions. On the other hand, Uber’s
driver-partners are slightly more likely to have children under the age of 18 living with
them at home (Q17) than are taxi drivers and chauffeurs.9 Additionally, 71 percent of
Uber’s driver-partners reported that they support financial dependents (Q19).

Among those reporting an ethnic/racial background, Uber's driver-partners are more
likely to identify their ethnicity/race as White Non-Hispanic than are taxi drivers and
chauffeurs in the same areas, although they are less likely to identify as White Non-
Hispanic than the workforce as a whole in those areas.10 Uber’s driver-partners are less
likely to identify as Black/African American Non-Hispanic than are taxi drivers and
chauffeurs while the percentages who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander and
Hispanic/Latino are similar for the two groups. Looking beyond the 20 areas, the
ethnic/racial composition of taxi drivers and chauffeurs in the United States as a whole
closely matches that of Uber’s driver-partners who responded to the BSG survey.11

Uber's driver-partners are highly educated. Nearly half of Uber's driver-partners (48
percent) have a college degree or higher, considerably greater than the corresponding
percentage for taxi drivers and chauffeurs (18 percent), and above that for the workforce
as a whole as well (41 percent). Only 12 percent of Uber's driver-partners have a high
school degree or less, whereas over half (52 percent) of taxi drivers and chauffeurs have a
high school degree or less. Seven percent of Uber's driver-partners are currently enrolled
in school, mostly taking classes toward a four-year college degree or higher. Higher
educated individuals may be more likely to avail themselves of new technological options


9
  One caveat here, however, is that the BSG question directed respondents to “include children living with
you part time.”
10
    The BSG and ACS race and Hispanic ethnicity questions are different because Hispanic ethnicity is
listed with the other racial identities in the BSG race/ethnicity question (Q56), and then Hispanic ethnicity
is also asked about specifically for all those who did not select Hispanic in Q56 in the following question
(Q57). We have attempted to align the two surveys by reporting anyone who identified as Hispanic in
either question as Hispanic, and then reporting the other groups exclusive of those indicating Hispanic
origin, and excluding the eleven percent of respondents who did not provide an answer to Q56 or Q57.
11
   The nationwide figures for taxi drivers and chauffeurs are: 42.3 percent non-Hispanic white; 24.5 percent
non-Hispanic black; 12.0 percent non-Hispanic Asian; 3.1 percent non-Hispanic other; and 18.0 percent
Hispanic.

in the labor market when they become available, which may partly account for the high
level of education of Uber’s driver-partners.

Seven percent of Uber's driver-partners are veterans of the armed services, and one
percent are members of the reserves. In addition, six percent of driver-partners have
household members who are military veterans, three percent have household members
who are active duty members of the armed services, and two percent have household
members in the reserves. Based on the ACS data, five percent of taxi drivers and
chauffeurs—and the same percentage of all workers—in the 20 areas BSG surveyed are
veterans.

Only two of the demographic characteristics that we examined registered statistically
significant changes between the 2014 and 2015 surveys.12 First, the driver-partners were
somewhat younger in 2015 than in 2014: 23 percent were in the 18-29 age bracket in
2015 compared with 19 percent in 2014. Second, the driver-partners were more likely to
hold a post-graduate degree in 2015 (13.6 percent versus 10.6 percent in 2014). Given the
large number of demographic characteristics examined, and these relatively modest
differences, we interpret this as evidence that the basic demographic distribution of
Ubers’ driver-partners was essentially unchanged from 2014 to 2015, despite the roughly
four-fold increase in the number of driver-partners over this period.

Driver Employment History
The BSG survey provides retrospective information on driver-partners’ work experience
that offers a picture of what they were doing prior to partnering with Uber.

Around 80 percent of driver-partners reported that they were working full- or part-time
hours just before they started driving on the Uber platform. Only eight percent of driver-
partners in 2014 (and 10 percent in 2015) said they were unemployed just prior to
partnering with Uber. This low percentage is notable given that, for the economy overall,
about 25 percent of new hires came from unemployment and 70 percent came from
nonemployment in 2014 and 2015.13 The large share of drivers who partnered with Uber
while they had another job suggests the role that Uber plays in supplementing
individuals’ income from other sources.

   For comparability, the samples were restricted to overlapping cities in 2014 and 2015 in these
comparisons.

Prior to partnering with Uber, six percent of drivers were students, four percent were
retired, and three percent were stay-at-home parents. Among those working prior to
partnering with Uber, 81 percent reported that they had a permanent job that would be
there until they left, were laid off, or were fired, and many appear to have continued in
those jobs after partnering with Uber.14

Uber's driver-partners worked in a wide range of jobs prior to partnering with Uber.
Nearly 20 percent of drivers had worked in Transportation Services in their previous job,
and 28 percent had worked as a driver at some point in their career, but no other industry
accounted for more than 10 percent of drivers in their previous job.

Just over one-third (36 percent) of driver-partners in 2014 were not actively looking for a
new job prior to driving on the Uber platform. Only 25 percent were actively looking for
a full-time job, another 25 percent were looking for a part-time job, and 10 percent were
looking for either a part- or full-time job (Q8). Of those driver-partners actively looking
for a job prior to partnering with Uber, 24 percent had been doing so for less than a
month, 52 percent for one to six months, and 24 percent for more than six months (Q9).
The fact that over one-third of driver-partners joined the Uber platform without actively
searching for a job suggests that Uber provided a new alternative that enticed many
people to engage in a work activity who might not have otherwise.


Driving on the Uber Platform
In 2014, drivers were split almost evenly among those who reported having no other job
in addition to partnering with Uber (38 percent), those who had a part-time job in
addition to partnering with Uber (30 percent), and those who had a full-time job in
addition to partnering with Uber (31 percent). The 2015 survey found that a much larger
share of those who had a job in addition to driving with the Uber platform had a full-time
job as opposed to a part-time job. In 2015, 52 percent of driver-partners worked full-time
on another job, 14 percent of driver-partners had a part-time job apart from partnering
with Uber, and 33 percent of driver-partners had no other job. Not surprisingly, the
administrative data indicate that, on average, those who do not have another job work the
most hours per week with the Uber platform, while those who have another full-time job
worked the least hours per week with the Uber platform. For example, one-third of
driver-partners who reported having no other job in 2014 worked more than 35 hours per
week on the Uber app since starting to work with Uber, compared with 13 percent of


14
  Among those who were working at a full-time job prior to partnering with Uber, 93 percent said their job
was permanent.
                                                       10
those who reported having another part-time job, and just three percent of those who
reported having another full-time job.

The 2014 survey asked driver-partners whether a variety of possible motivations were a
major reason, minor reason, or not a relevant reason for why they partnered with Uber
(Q22). The most common reasons (combining major and minor reasons) were: “to earn
more income to better support myself or my family” (91 percent); “to be my own boss
and set my own schedule” (87 percent); “to have more flexibility in my schedule and
balance my work with my life and family” (85 percent); “to help maintain a steady
income because other sources of income are unstable/unpredictable” (74 percent).15

Driving on the Uber platform provides an important source of income for driver-partners.
For one-fifth of driver-partners (20 percent), Uber is their only source of personal
income, and for another 12 percent Uber is their largest but not only source of income.
Nearly half of driver-partners view income earned on the Uber platform as a supplement
to their income but not a significant source (48 percent) (Q61).

Perhaps not surprisingly—given that most driver-partners had jobs that they could have
kept, and often did, when they started partnering with Uber—71 percent of driver-
partners in 2014 replied that partnering with Uber has increased their overall income,
while only 11 percent replied that partnering with Uber has decreased their overall
income (Q28R1).

A variety of questions suggest that Uber's driver-partners value the flexibility that the
Uber platform permits, and many are drawn to Uber in large part because of this
flexibility. Fifteen times as many drivers said Uber had made their lives better, rather
than worse, by giving them more control over their schedule (74 percent versus five
percent). In addition, when asked directly (Q52), “Which of the following would you
most prefer regarding your driving with Uber?” with responses describing an
employment relationship and an independent contractor relationship, 79 percent chose the
latter. Furthermore, when the driver-partners were asked what they would do if Uber
were no longer available in their area, 35 percent (the largest group) said they would use
another ride-sharing app platform, while only 21 percent said they would look for a full-
time job in an unrelated industry (Q32).16 These findings suggest that there is



15
   The order was unchanged considering those reasons designated as a major reason, and the corresponding
percentages were 76 percent, 64 percent, 63 percent, and 51 percent, respectively.
16
   Other responses were: drive a taxi (eight percent); look for a part-time job (19 percent); not look for a
new job (12 percent); and other (five percent).
                                                         11
considerable sorting in the on-demand economy, and those who value flexibility most are
the most likely to seek opportunities there.

Female driver-partners were more likely than men to highlight the need for flexibility as a
reason for becoming a partner with Uber, but both men and women appear to value the
opportunity to set their own schedule. For example, 42 percent of women and 29 percent
of men said that a major reason for driving with Uber was that they “can only work part-
time or flexible schedules” because of “family, education, or health reason[s].” Further,
female driver-partners were nearly 30 percentage points more likely than men to work an
average of 15 or fewer hours per week (67 percent versus 38 percent). 17 Men, however,
are slightly more likely than women to indicate that they would prefer a job where they
choose their own schedule and can be their own boss to a nine-to-five job with some
benefits (73 percent versus 68 percent).

Another aspect of Uber’s flexibility is that spending time on the platform can help
smooth the transition to another job, as driver-partners can take off time to prepare for
and search for another job at their discretion. Nearly one-third (32 percent) of driver-
partners indicated that “to earn money while looking for a steady, full-time job” (2014:
Q22R11) was a major reason for partnering with Uber, and this is particularly the case for
students, and for those who do not have another job or are working part-time on another
job. Likewise, those who have no other job or another part-time job are about twice as
likely as those with full-time jobs to say that they will continue with Uber until
something better comes along (2014: Q50). These results suggest that Uber provides a
helpful “bridge” for some driver-partners until they can find new jobs that are better
matches for their skills and interests.

The BLS contingent worker survey found that independent contractors were less likely to
have health insurance coverage than were traditional employees. In 2015, 38 percent of
Uber's driver-partners received employer-provided health insurance, either from their
own employer at another job or from a spouse or other family member’s employer, down
from 49 percent in 2014.

Overall, 81 percent of driver-partners said they are very satisfied or somewhat satisfied
with Uber in 2015, essentially unchanged from 78 percent in 2014.




17
  Hours are measured by hours with the Uber app on. Since it is possible that drivers could have another
app on simultaneously, or could be conducting personal tasks with the Uber app on, our hours measure is
an imperfect measure of hours working on the Uber platform.

Completing the Picture with Uber Administrative Data
Uber collects extensive data on driver-partners’ trips, fares, and time via the Uber app.
Below, we summarize findings based on Uber’s administrative data using aggregated,
anonymized tabulations from Uber’s databases to round out the analysis of the labor
market for Uber’s driver-partners.

Figure 1 documents the exponential growth in the number of active Uber driver-partners
in the United States from mid-2012, when uberX was launched, to the end of 2015. The
spectacular growth of the number of active driver-partners over the last few years is
evidence that Uber provides many workers a choice that they prefer to other available
options or to not working at all. During the latest month for which we have data,
December 2015, a total of 464,681 driver-partners completed four or more trips using the
Uber platform.

Note: Figure based on U.S. UberBLACK and uberX driver-partners providing at least four rides in any
month (1,085,765 individuals). Source: Uber administrative data. An active driver-partner is defined as a
driver-partner who completed at least four trips in the month.
                                                       13
Geographically, Uber’s driver-partners are distributed across the country, and most
common in the larger population centers. Figure 2 shows that Uber driver-partners are
particularly prevalent in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and upper and lower West
coast.

Note: The map indicates the number of Uber driver-partners who took at least four trips in October 2015,

Figure 3 displays growth in the number of Uber’s driver-partners in each of the BSG
metropolitan areas, indexed to the number of months since Uber started operating in the
city through January 2016.18 The growth for the Austin market reflects the period prior to
the suspension of operations in May 2016.The fastest growth in the number of driver-
partners has been in Miami and Las Vegas, markets in which Uber only recently became
fully operational. Cramer (2016) finds that cities in which Uber grew more quickly
experienced a (less-than-proportionate) decline in the number of taxi drivers but little

  The way in which Uber classified New Jersey trips in its database has changed over time, so, for the sake
of consistency, New Jersey is omitted from this chart. Also, Orange County is reported as part of Los
Angeles.

change in the average wages of taxi drivers, consistent with the idea that taxi drivers were
receiving few economic rents prior to the entry of Uber. Future research can link these
city-specific patterns to other city-level data to study the effect that Uber has had on the
taxi industry and other outcomes.19

Note: Figure reports the number of U.S. UberBLACK and uberX driver-partners making at least one trip in
the specified month, indexed to the number of months since Uber began in the city or June 2012, whichever
came later.


Predictors of the growth in the number of Uber drivers across cities provides some
insights into the forces underlying Uber’s success. The outcome variable that we focus on
is the log of the number of active driver-partners per month in 2015Q4 divided by the
number of months that Uber has operated in the city. Because Uber started from a base
of zero in 2009, the dependent variable reflects Uber’s growth rate per month that it
launched in each city. We compiled a set of city characteristics for 97 cities in which

19
  One paper in this vein is Greenwald and Wattal (2015), who examine the relationship between ride
sharing and alcohol-related motor vehicle homicides across cities in California.
                                                       15
Uber operates and regressed the growth measure on these characteristics. Results are
summarized in Table 2. Column 1 provides estimates for the full sample of 97 cities, and
columns 2-4 restrict the sample to 80 cities for which we have information on the number
of taxi licneses,

In all of the estimated models, the number of Uber drivers per month in operation rises
with city population, and we cannot reject a unit elasticity. Cities with more taxi licenses
per capita have added relatively more Uber drivers, suggesting that there is excess
demand for ride-sharing services in cities with relatively more taxis, all else equal.
Interestingly, the cost of a five-mile Uber ride has a statistically insignificant and small
coefficient. The unemployment rate in a city is also unrelated to the growth in the number
of Uber drivers, consistent with the observation made in light of Figure 1 that the
exponential growth of Uber drivers held in periods of high- and low-unemployment. Real
GDP and population density in a metropolitan area are both found to be unrelated to the
number of Uber drivers. Lastly, cities where Uber started earlier have added significantly
more drivers per month than cities where Uber started later, suggesting that Uber was
strategic in launching earlier in cities with greater latent demand for ride-sharing services.

Dynamics. Because Uber offers a flexible work option with low barriers to entry, a large
number of workers try the service, and some discontinue using it after a period of time
while others continue for an extended period. As described in the previous section, there
are many reasons driver-partners vary their length of time using the platform. Those
spending fewer hours may find that Uber is not a good match for their lifestyle or they
may use Uber only when they are between jobs; others may find that it provides them
with a flexible work schedule and source of income that they have been looking for and
continue using the platform for much longer. Figure 4 reports the weekly continuation
rate (i.e., the survivor curve) for all driver-partners who started on the platform in the first
half of 2013.

             Figure 4: Continuation Rate for U.S. Driver-Partners Over Two Years




Note: Figure based on U.S. UberBLACK and uberX driver-partners who made their first trip between
January and June of 2013 and had subsequently made at least four trips (11,267 individuals). A driver-
partner is classified as becoming inactive at the start of any period in which he or she does not record a trip
for the next six (or more) months.

Within a month of becoming an active Uber driver-partner, 11 percent of driver-partners
became inactive, defined as not using the service over the next 6 months. After half a
year, 70 percent of those who started using Uber in the first half of 2013 were still
actively using the system, and more than half of those who started in the first half of 2013
remained active a year after starting. A third were still active two years after starting on
the platform. These figures suggest that Uber provides a bridge for many who are seeking
another position in the labor market, and it provides a longer-term option for others.

Uber’s driver-partners can select into providing different types of car service. The Uber
platform offers several tiered service levels to potential riders. Roughly speaking,
throughout the United States, UberBLACK is the premium option. Driver-partners on
UberBLACK are commercially licensed drivers with “black cars” that adhere to specific
vehicle standards. Many driver-partners on UberBLACK are employees or contract

                                                          18
workers for limousine companies that use Uber’s technology. In most markets (New
York City being a notable exception), driver-partners on uberX, the lower cost product
offered on the platform, may drive their personal automobiles, utilizing commercial
insurance (with $1 million in liability and uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury
coverage provided through the Uber platform) when conducting commercial activity. As
previously stated, uberX driver-partners must pass a background check prior to driving
on the platform.

Figure 5 indicates that Uber’s exponential growth is fueled by the spectacular growth of
uberX driver-partners. UberX has grown rapidly likely because it is available in more
U.S. markets than UberBLACK, because of greater customer demand for a lower-cost
service, because of the lower entry barriers (e.g., absence of need for a commercial
license and luxury car), and because of Uber’s promotional efforts.

As previously noted, about two thirds of Uber driver-partners work either full-time or
part-time on another job. Therefore, it is not surprising that most drive with Uber part-
time. The platform is conducive to a wide range of work schedules, and this is supported
by the fact that there is little discernible relationship between hourly earnings and hours
spent on the platform. Table 3 illustrates this pattern for October 2015 for uberX drivers,
which we selected as a month after Uber’s summer fare cuts and before the holiday
season to represent more normal market conditions. The table reports earnings per hour
with the app on, broken down by amount of time spent driving per week in the six largest
markets where Uber operates, and for the 2014 BSG markets combined. Reported
earnings here are net of Uber’s fees but do not adjust for driver-partners’ expenses, which
we try to estimate below.20 We also emphasize that the hours measure is an imperfect and
probably overstated measure of hours worked, as drivers can have an app for another
ride-sharing platform on while their Uber app is on, and they can conduct personal tasks
while the Uber app is turned on.

   Note also that the tables do not include earnings from promotional offers and incentives (most often
hourly and monthly price guarantees conditional on driving a certain number or set of hours) that Uber
offers drivers from time to time, most often at the beginning of a driver-partner’s time on the network or
around the launch of a new Uber market. This omission causes us to slightly understate drivers’ earnings.

   Trimmed one-percent means were selected instead of medians because the results were similar and
because it is more appropriate to average trimmed means across cities than medians to derive an aggregate
measure.

In the combined set of 20 areas, more than half of uberX driver-partners chose to drive
for 15 hours or less a week, and fully 83 percent chose to drive less than 35 hours a
week.22 Yet the largest difference in hourly earnings across workers in the various hours
categories was $0.66 (about four percent) between those driver-partners driving 16 to 34
hours a week and those driving one to 15 hours a week. Across all uberX drivers,
earnings per hour each week are negatively correlated with hours logged with the app on
that week, although this negative correlation may partly be a statistical artifact of the
imprecision in measuring hours, as noise in hours will tend to induce a negative
correlation due to division bias. A regression that instruments for hours worked in week t
using hours worked during week t-1 found no evidence of an effect of hours worked on
hourly earnings. In any event, there is little evidence that uberX drivers who work longer
hours per week earn more per hour than those who work shorter hours, which may make
the platform particularly attractive to those interested in working short hours.

Figure 7 shows the distribution of weekly hours with the app turn on over time for all
Uber drivers combined. As Uber has expanded over time, more and more driver-partners
are utilizing the platform for 15 hours or less per week, while the percentage of those on
the platform for more than 35 hours a week has declined. This is partly a result of the fact
that uberX grew more rapidly than UberBLACK drivers, and uberX drivers tend to drive
less per week.




22
  Driver-partners who provided service on both UberX and UberBLACK during the course of October
2015 are excluded from Table 3. Drivers who utilized the UberBlack platform tended to log longer hours
per week than UberX drivers: 52 percent of UberBlack drivers used the platform for 35 hours or more a
week.

Note: Sample consists of all U.S. uberX and UberBlack driver-partners spending at least an hour online in a
given week in 20 BSG US cities surveyed in 2014.

Figure 8 likewise provides an analysis of driver earnings over time. Specifically, for
each city we calculated the 1-percent trimmed mean, and then computed a fix-weighted
average across cities to hold constant shifts across cities. Driver-partner earnings
fluctuate from week to week, but in the 20 markets in the 2014 BSG survey, the average
was $20.19 from June 2014 through October 2015. A regression of hourly earnings on
time found no evidence of a time trend. The fact that fares have trended down while
hourly earnings display no time trend suggests that hourly earnings are anchored to the
drivers’ alternative wages, with the entry and exit of workers causing utilization rates to
adjust to clear the market at a more or less fixed wage.23



23
  Hsieh and Moretti (2003) reach a related conclusion concerning the earnings of real estate agents, namely
that entry and exit of real estate agents leads their real earnings to be invariant to fluctuations in housing
prices.

earnings across drivers was calculated for each city, and cities were weighted by the total number of trips
provided in the city in October 2014 to hold constant changes in the distribution of drivers across cities.

Uber vs. Taxi. Table 4 illustrates the breakdown of Uber driver-partners (combining both
UberBLACK and uberX driver-partners) by hours worked per week in October 2014,
compared to taxi and limo drivers based on the ACS. Taxi drivers and chauffeurs work
longer hours per week than Uber’s driver-partners, with more than one-third of taxi
drivers usually working 50 or more hours per week. Slightly more than half of Uber
drivers use the platform for 15 hours or less a week, compared with just 4 percent of taxi
and limo drivers. This drastically different allocation of work time probably reflects the
fact that the medallions required to operate a taxi are typically leased on a daily or weekly
basis, which gives taxi drivers an incentive to work long hours over the duration of the
lease. Uber driver-partners do not face this incentive, which enables them to flexibly
select their hours, and to better align their work schedules to customer demand.

week when they worked at least one hour in October 2014. ACS hours based on “usual hours worked per
week past 12 months.” All data are for BSG surveyed market areas.

Figure 9 shows that driver-partners vary the number of hours in which they use the Uber
platform by a considerable amount from week to week. In any given week, well more
than half (65 percent) of driver-partners drive 25 percent more, or 25 percent less, than
the amount they drove in the previous week. Only 17 percent of driver-partners tend to
drive within 10 percent of the amount of time that they drove in the previous week. The
within-driver, across-week coefficient of variation of hours with the app turned on for
drivers who were active throughout the same period is 0.35 for the 25th percentile driver,
0.54 at the median, and 0.81 for the 75th percentile driver. These figures indicate
considerable variation in the amount of time drivers spend driving on the platform from
week to week, and are consistent with responses to the BSG survey, which indicated that
drivers valued the flexibility that driving with the Uber app provides.

Since the Uber platform applies a new model to an existing industry, it is instructive to
compare driver-partner earnings to those in similar occupations. Although we cannot look
at earnings specifically for taxi drivers, taxi drivers, limo drivers, and chauffeurs are
classified together in the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, which
reports earnings for drivers who are employees (in contrast to Uber’s drivers, who are
independent contractors). Taxi drivers, limo drivers and chauffeurs who are on payroll
probably do not bear expenses for gasoline, vehicle maintenance, depreciation, etc.,
which are incurred by Uber driver-partners (although deductible from income taxes in
many cases). As a consequence, we subsequently present estimates of drivers’ expenses
to facilitate a comparison of net earnings.

The data in Table 5 indicate that Uber’s driver-partners generally receive higher earnings
per hour (before vehicle expenses) than employed taxi drivers and chauffeurs. As long as
drivers’ costs are less than $6.79 per hour, the net earnings of Uber driver-partners would
exceed those of taxi drivers and chauffeurs, on average.

Notice also that Uber’s driver-partners tend to earn more in markets where taxi drivers
and chauffeurs tend to earn more. The Pearson correlation across the 19 areas with
available data is 0.52. At least in the long run, the process of labor market equilibration in
the presence of varying local labor market conditions should generate a positive
correlation in the wages of those doing similar work in the same market.

Expenses. Uber’s driver-partners are not reimbursed for their driving expenses, such as
gasoline, maintenance, depreciation, or insurance, while employed driver-partners
covered by the OES data may not have to cover these costs. Costs vary for each driver-
partner depending on their model of car, driving style, traffic, and other factors. Note also
that drivers may partially offset their costs by deducting work-related expenses from their
income for tax purposes, including depreciation or leasing fees, gasoline, maintenance,
insurance, mobile device and data fees, and license and registration fees. We disregard
possible tax deductions in our calculation below, however, leading to a somewhat
overstated estimate of driver costs.

To derive estimates of Uber driver-partner costs tailored to each category of vehicle that
drivers use, we use cost data from the AAAs “Your Driving Costs” reports.24 Each year
the AAA produces a report containing estimates of the five-year cost to own for the top
five selling vehicles in each of five categories: small, medium, and large sedan, truck, and
minivan. We combine this data with estimates of average miles driven per hour while the
Uber app is on derived from driver GPS data for a random sample of 2,000 driver days
per city in each of the 20 BSG cities surveyed.

Costs in the AAA report are broken down on a per mile basis for variable costs (e.g. gas)
and a per year basis for fixed costs (e.g., insurance and taxes). Only one variable cost of
interest is not explicitly provided, marginal depreciation. Instead, the AAA provides
annual depreciation estimates for vehicles driven 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 miles per
year. We derive per mile depreciation estimates from these data as follows: we assume
that average per mile depreciation over the first 10,000 miles is the same as it is between
mile 10,000 and mile 15,000. Additionally, we assume that the average per mile

                                                       26
depreciation between mile 15,000 and mile 20,000 applies to miles driven in excess of
20,000.

We apply the AAA cost figures to two scenarios: driving full time and driving part time
on the Uber platform. In the case of full-time driver-partners we include the fixed costs of
the vehicle under the assumption that they specifically purchased a new car to earn
money as a professional driver and otherwise would have had recourse to another car for
personal use. For full-time drivers, we further assume that the car is used mostly for
providing ride-sharing services, but partly for personal use. Specifically, fixed costs are
spread across 35,000 business miles (approximately the distance one would travel in
2,000 hours of professional driving) and 15,000 personal miles. We compute costs for
full-time drivers under two assumptions: 1) excluding insurance and registration fees, as
these costs would be required if the car were to be used for personal driving absent Uber;
and 2) including insurance and registration fees, as these costs would be additional if the
car is used exclusively for professional driving or if the driver would not have used the
car absent Uber. In the part-time case we disregard fixed costs, assuming that drivers are
using a car they already owned which would have depreciated regardless of driving on
the platform and that they would have been responsible for insurance and registration
fees regardless of occasionally driving on the Uber platform. Under these assumptions,
Table 6 reports estimates of hourly costs for five vehicle types for part-time (column 1)
and full-time drivers (columns 2 and 3).

Drivers’ hourly expenses vary depending on their model of car and full- or part-time
status. For part-time drivers, costs range from $2.94 to $4.38 per hour, and for full-time
drivers they vary from $3.76 to $6.46 per hour. Thus, the AAA expense data suggest
that, taking expenses into account, the average Uber driver-partner is likely to earn at
least as much per hour, and probably more, than the average taxi driver and chauffeur.


Earnings Regressions

We next consider how earnings vary across Uber driver partners. Table 7 presents
earnings regressions using the BSG 2014 survey data, where the dependent variable is the
log of the earnings per hour net of Uber fees.25 The column labeled (1) presents a model
with explanatory variables that relate to driving with the Uber platform, such as whether
the driver provides rides under the UberBlack service and the driver’s average weekly
hours since partnering with Uber, as well as city dummy variables. The second column
adds variables reflecting the drivers’ personal characteristics, such as race, experience
and education. Tenure at Uber is defined as the number of months that the driver has used
the platform.

The city dummies are jointly highly significant, which is not surprising in light of the
results in Tables 3 and 5. Drivers who provide the UberBlack service earn more per
hours than those who exclusive provide uberX rides, which is not surprising given that
UberBlack requires a luxury car and drivers who are typically commercially licenses.
There is a quadratic relationship between earnings and accumulated seniority using the
Uber platform, with earnings peaking after about 14 months. Drivers with more potential
experience (defined as age minus education minus 6) also have slightly higher hourly
earnings. Drivers’ education, race, and sex are not statistically significant predictors of
earnings.

  It is not possible for us to link the BSG survey data back to Uber administrative data. Consequently, we
are limited to the survey data collected by BSG and the administrative information that Uber provided to
BSG. Thus, we cannot estimate driver expenses because we do not know the type of car or mileage that
each driver drove. Moreover, the earnings per hour data provided to BSG indicated the decile interval of
the drives hourly earnings in 2014, not the exact hourly earnings. We use the log of the midpoint of the
interval as the dependent variable.

Conclusion

This paper has attempted to provide the first comprehensive description Uber’s driver-
partners, based on both survey data and administrative data. Several findings are worthy
of emphasis and exploration in further research.

First, the Uber platform provides a great deal of flexibility for driver-partners, and this
characteristic of work in the on-demand economy may attract workers who supply labor
to the sector more generally. Responses to the BSG survey indicated that many driver-
partners valued the flexibility to choose their hours and days of work. Furthermore, the
administrative data indicate that a large share of driver-partners avail themselves of this
flexibility and vary their hours from week to week. Compared with traditional taxi
drivers, Uber driver-partners tend to work substantially fewer hours per week. For
example, taxi drivers and chauffeurs were five times more likely to work 50 or more
hours per week. The high fixed costs of obtaining a medallion to drive a taxi in many
areas could explain the longer hours of taxi drivers. The finding that hourly earnings for
Uber’s driver-partners are essentially invariant to hours worked during the week also
makes Uber an attractive option to those who want to work part-time or intermittently, as
other part-time or intermittent jobs in the labor market may entail a wage penalty.

Second, Uber’s driver-partners are more similar in terms of age and education to the
general workforce than to taxi drivers and chauffeurs. There are many possible
explanations that could have contributed to this result. First, the U.S. economy was
operating at less than full employment during the period studied, and more highly
educated and younger workers may have had fewer alternatives available than is
normally the case in this time period. Uber may have represented a particularly attractive
bridge option for these workers. Second, entry barriers in traditional taxi and limo
services may prevent a broader segment of the workforce from gaining such jobs. And
third, a segment of the general public may be drawn to Uber over traditional taxi and
chauffeur jobs because Uber permits greater flexibility in terms of scheduling. The fact
that new drivers continued to partner with Uber at an accelerating rate in late 2014 and
2015, when the economy strengthened and the unemployment rate fell below six percent,
suggests that weakness in the economy was not the major reason why driver-partners
partnered with Uber. In addition, most driver-partners were employed prior to joining
Uber. These considerations suggest that Uber has attracted driver-partners with a wide
range of backgrounds because they value the type of opportunity for flexible work that
Uber provides.


                                               31
Third, although it is difficult to compare the after-tax net hourly earnings of Uber’s
driver-partners with that of taxi drivers, it appears that Uber driver-partners earn at least
as much as taxi drivers and chauffeurs, and in many cases more than taxi drivers and
chauffeurs. The prospect of higher compensation is likely part of the explanation for why
the number of Uber driver-partners has grown at an exponential rate (along with lower
entry barriers and flexibility). Another aspect of Uber that can influence the pay of
driver-partners vis-à-vis taxi drivers is that customers rate their driver-partner when they
take a trip with Uber, and driver-partners’ ratings are made available to potential
customers. This leads Uber’s driver-partners to develop reputations, and to have an
incentive to perform well to develop and maintain a good reputation. By contrast, taxi
drivers typically are anonymous and customers are not aware of their reputations.
Reputations matter in markets.26 Driver-partners are rewarded for having a good
reputation, which could lead Uber’s driver-partners to earn more than taxi drivers.
Furthermore, driver-partners who expect to do a good job and develop a strong reputation
are more likely to be attracted to Uber than to traditional taxi service.27 Estimating the
impact of driver-partners’ reputations on their earnings is an important topic for further
research. The wage regressions that we present find little evidence of earnings differences
by driver education, gender or race, but we do find a return to early experience using the
Uber platform.

Lastly, Uber’s growth rate has varied considerably across cities. Understanding why Uber
grew more rapidly in some cities than others could provide insights into the likely future
path of the on-demand sector. For example, if inefficient taxi regulations and restricted
supply of taxi licenses contributed importantly to Uber’s rapid expansion, then demand
for on-demand services may be slower outside of for-hire transportation services.

  See, for example, Cabral and Hortaçsu (2010) for research on the relationship between sellers' ratings and
sales on eBay, which, like Uber, is an online marketplace that uses a ratings system to build reputations for
both sellers and buyers.
27
  This sorting effect could partly explain why Uber’s driver-partners are more highly educated than
traditional taxi drivers and chauffeurs.
