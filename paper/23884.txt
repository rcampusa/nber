This essay surveys the literature on directed/competitive search, covering theory and applications
in, e.g., labor, housing and monetary economics. These models share features with traditional
search theory, yet differ in important ways. They share features with general equilibrium theory,
but with explicit frictions. Equilibria are typically efficient, in part because markets price goods
plus the time required to get them. The approach is tractable and arguably realistic. Results are
presented for finite and large economies. Private information and sorting with heterogeneity are
analyzed. Some evidence is discussed. While emphasizing issues and applications, we also
provide several hard-to-find technical results.

1         Introduction
Search theory contributes significantly to fundamental and applied research in
economics, and is relevant for understanding many phenomena that are trouble-
some for classical theory. Examples include the coexistence of unemployment
and vacancies; price or wage dispersion and stickiness; bid-ask spreads; the diﬃ-
culties of bilateral trade that generate a role for money and related institutions;
partnership formation; and long and variable durations in the time to execute
trades in labor, housing and other markets. This essay surveys, consolidates and
extends a relatively recent and, we think, a particularly interesting branch of the
field called directed, or competitive, search.1
        Consider any two-sided market with, e.g., buyers and sellers, firms and work-
ers, borrowers and lenders, or men and women. They are trying to get together,
usually in pairs, but sometimes multilaterally. Traditional search theory typically
assumes the agents meet bilaterally and at random, although whether a meeting
results in matching (trading or forming a relationship) can be endogenous, es-
pecially when there is heterogeneity. Directed search is diﬀerent because agents
have information to target their search towards particular types, or sometimes
particular individuals, in the market. Moreover, traditional search models usually
assume the terms of trade are determined by bargaining, or some related mecha-
nism, after agents meet. Competitive search is again diﬀerent because the terms
of trade — prices, or more generally, contracts or mechanisms — are announced or
posted in advance to attract agents on the other side of the market.
        The label competitive search here means models with two characteristics: (a)
the terms of trade are posted by agents in advance of meetings; and (b) these
    1
    Here is a more or less random sample of the older literature on random search: On goods
markets, see Burdett and Judd (1983), Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1987), Shi (1995) or Trejos
and Wright (1995). On labor, see Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), Burdett and Mortensen
(1998) or Pissarides (2000). On marriage, see Mortensen (1988), Burdett and Coles (1997) or
Shimer and Smith (2000). These models can have either bargaining or price/wage posting, but
posted terms do not attract counterparties as they do with directed search. The rest of this
essay goes into considerable detail on how this matters.



                                             2
terms direct search and hence help determine who meets whom.2 As well as being
a diﬀerent philosophical approach to the study of markets, the combination of
posting and directed search makes a substantial diﬀerence for substantive issues.
In particular, posted prices have an allocative role, giving agents incentives to
seek out particular counterparties, and this often leads to eﬃciency (it is some-
times said the models internalize search externalities). In addition, posting entails
commitment, and this circumvents holdup problems with bargaining — which is
not to say that bargaining is uninteresting, but it is good to consider alternatives.
From another perspective, models with the characteristics (a) and (b) can dis-
pense with some exogenous features from traditional search: they typically avoid
having to specify a bargaining solution; and some of the models, but not all,
avoid the need for a matching function. Moreover, the theory is tractable, often
delivers cleaner results than alternatives, and bridges gaps between traditional
search, general equilibrium and game theory.
       The approach is also arguably realistic. As Howitt (2005) says, “In contrast to
what happens in [random] search models, exchanges in actual market economies
are organized by specialist traders, who mitigate search costs by providing facil-
ities that are easy to locate. Thus when people wish to buy shoes they go to a
shoe store; when hungry they go to a grocer; when desiring to sell their labor
services they go to firms known to oﬀer employment. Few people would think of
planning their economic lives on the basis of random encounters.” While realism
is not a unique desideratum, one could say he has a point. Even more color-
fully, Hahn (1987) says, “someone wishing to exchange his house goes to estate
agents or advertises — he does not, like some crazed particle, wait to bump into
a buyer.” And Prescott (2005) says “I think the bilateral monopoly problem has
   2
     While not the first models in this class, as evidenced by Peters (1984,1991), Montgomery
(1991) and other work discussed below, Moen (1997) and Shimer (1996) started a take-oﬀ
phase in especially applied research, and they use the language in this way. The working
papers were both 1995, as was the original version of Mortensen and Wright (2002), who
according to Shimer (1996) “coined the phrase competitive search equilibrium.” While we like
this terminology, another meaning of the competitive search label is discussed below.



                                             3
been solved. There are stores that compete. I know where the drug store and the
supermarket are, and I take their posted prices as given. If some supermarket
oﬀers the same quality of services and charges lower prices, I shop at that lower
price supermarket.” Whether or not they realize it, these commentators are all
more or less describing directed/competitive search.
       There is another use for the competitive search label.3 Research in the area
often makes a concerted eﬀort to analyze strategic aspects of markets with finite
numbers of agents. One can show in several settings that, as these numbers
get large, strategic considerations vanish. Sometimes a competitive search model
means a limiting large economy, in the same sense a competitive Walrasian model
means the set of traders is big enough to reasonably posit price taking. We
present large markets, finite markets and limiting results. The limiting results
are nice because we often have intuition about markets becoming competitive
when the set of agents is large, but formalizing this can be diﬃcult (see Gale 2000
and references therein). Directed search cleanly demonstrates the idea despite
being far from Walrasian in the following sense: frictions take center stage, even
when the set of agents is large. In particular, some sellers can have few or no
customers, while others have more than they can handle, leading to rationing,
unsold inventories, the coexistence of vacancies and unemployment, etc.
       The theory captures a simple yet powerful idea: if you post more favorable
terms customers come to you with higher probability, but not necessarily prob-
ability 1, due to capacity issues. If a restaurant only has a certain number of
tables, or a firm only wants to hire a certain number of workers, it may not be
smart to go where everyone else goes. Agents on both sides of the market face
thus a trade oﬀ between prices and probabilities. While the theory, like general
equilibrium theory, is concerned with the operation and eﬃciency of markets, it
goes further by pricing not only quantities but also the time required to trade.
This often delivers unique outcomes with remarkable eﬃciency properties, in con-
   3
     We think this usage goes back to Peters (1994), in spirit, although to be precise he called
it “competitive matching equilibrium.”


                                               4
trast to traditional search theory, which is typically rife with ineﬃciencies. Yet
competitive search can also accommodate complications, like private information
or liquidity frictions, that may lead to multiplicity or ineﬃciency.
       Section 2 begins with one-period models to convey the basic insights. Two
versions are presented, one framed in terms of labor and the other in terms of
goods markets, because, even though they are basically re-labelings, the economic
interpretations and applications are diﬀerent. Here we also introduce tools like
matching technologies, and analyze eﬃciency as well as comparative statics. Sec-
tion 3 embeds the market in dynamic general equilibrium to discuss phenomena
such as price dispersion and stickiness, as well as on-the-job search. Section 4
presents applications in monetary economics in environments with indivisible as-
sets, which are crude yet allow one to make important points relatively easily,
and in more modern versions with divisible assets. Here the framework is natural,
tractable, and complements nicely random search models of money and credit.
       While Sections 2-4 start with large numbers of agents, Section 5 goes deeper
into microfoundations by starting with finite markets, which imparts addition
insights, then considers limits when the numbers become large. Among other
reasons, this is useful because it makes clear how the relevant equilibrium con-
cept relates subgame perfection. Section 6 goes into detail on heterogeneity and
sorting by asking, who matches/trades with whom? Section 7 takes up private
information, where directed search has recently proved rather useful. Section 8
expands on how agents meet and the implications for mechanism design. Sec-
tion 9 covers miscellaneous other topics, including empirical evidence. Section
10 concludes. Appendices provide useful technical material that is hard to find
elsewhere. In terms of style, we provide details for a few benchmark models, then
discuss more or less formally extensions and applications in the literature, plus
unsolved problems and directions for future research.4
   4
    While there is no previous survey on directed search, surveys on other topics — including
labor, money and housing — touch on it; see King (2003), Rogerson et al. (2005), Shi (2008),
Han and Strange (2015) and Lagos et al. (2016).



                                             5
2     Benchmark Models
We begin with a canonical competitive search model, with only one period, ap-
plied first to goods markets then to labor markets.

2.1     Goods Markets

There are large numbers of two types of agents called buyers and sellers, with
measures  and  , and  =   denotes the population buyer-seller ratio.
One can think of buyers as households, or consumers, and sellers as retailers, but
other interpretations are possible (e.g., producers buying inputs from suppliers).
There are two tradable objects. There is an indivisible good , and sellers can
produce exactly one unit at cost  ≥ 0, while buyers want to consume exactly
one unit for utility   ; and there is a divisible good  that anyone can produce
at cost () =  and consume for utility  () = . This means there are gains
from trade in , while  serves as a payment instrument buyers use to compensate
sellers for their output. This can be interpreted as direct barter; more typically
in the literature it is called transferable utility.5
    For now each seller posts a price , the amount of  buyers must pay to get ;
later sellers may post something more complicated. Each buyer directs his search
after observing all posted prices (all we really need is that each buyer observes
at least two; see Acemoglu and Autor 2016, Theorem 13.4). For now, traders
meet pairwise. In particular, suppose a set of buyers with measure  direct their
search toward a set of sellers with measure  . Then the probability a seller meets
a buyer is  =  (), where  =   is the buyer/seller ratio, also called the
queue length or market tightness. Similarly, the probability a buyer meets a seller
   5
     Sometimes  is called money or numeraire, but these are abuses of language we cannot
condone. It is obviously not money in a serious sense. It is also not a numeraire, which is
a good with price normalized to 1 in the Walrasian budget equation. There is no numeraire
in standard search models, which do not actually have budget equations. Below we present
models that explicitly incorporate numeraire goods and money. The interpretation here, where
buyers produce and sellers consume a good, with linear cost and utility, respectively, describes
an internally consistent environment; it does not justify calling  numeraire or money.



                                               6
is  =  () . As is standard, assume  =  () is increasing and concave.
Some people also assume  =  ()  is decreasing, although that is automatic
when  () is increasing and concave, given the natural restriction  (0) = 0. In
static models or discrete-time dynamics  and  are probabilities, so we impose
0 ≤  ≤ 1; in continuous-time they are arrival rates, so we only impose  ≥ 0.
We also usually assume diﬀerentiability, and sometimes lim→0 0 () = ∞.
      To understand this formulation, consider any two-sided market with 1 and
2 agents on each side, where the number of bilateral meetings between types 1
and 2 is  =  (1  2 ). Analogous to a production function mapping inputs into
output,  is increasing, concave and CRS (constant returns to scale). Then 1 =
 (1  2 ) 1 =  ( 1) , where  = 1 2 , and 2 =  (1  2 ) 2 =  ( 1).
This generalizes models of one-sided markets (e.g., Diamond 1982), and is more
interesting because the ’s depend on tightness even with CRS. In addition, with
a two-sided specification it is natural to endogenize tightness by allowing entry
on one side, a vital component in many applications. In any case, for now, a
buyer seeks a seller with a particular , but whether he finds one is random.6
      A set of sellers posting the same  and buyers searching for them constitutes
a submarket with tightness  =   . Thus, a submarket is characterized by
( ). Buyers and sellers payoﬀs are denoted  and  . Sellers maximize  by
posting ( ), although it is not crucial that they post  — sellers can equivalently
post only  and let buyers work out the equilibrium  for themselves. In any case,
for a seller to be in business, ( ) must deliver to buyers at least their market
payoﬀ  , and clearly he does not deliver more. While  is an equilibrium object,
is taken as given by individuals. This is called the market utility approach, used
by Montgomery (1991), McAfee (1993), Shimer (1996), Moen (1997) and many
others; Peters (2000), based on Peters (1991), derives it from microfoundations,
as do Julien et al. (2000) and Burdett et al. (2001), as discussed in Section 5.
  6
    In Section 5 an agent finds a counterparty for sure, but may or may not trade, due to
capacity constraints; those models do not need an exogenous meeting function.




                                           7
       The market utility approach allows us to write the sellers problem as

                                                      ()
                      = max  () ( − ) st             ( − ) =                       (1)
                                                    

Sellers’ payoﬀ in a submarket is their trading probability times their surplus
 =  − , while buyers’ payoﬀ is their trading probability times their surplus
 =  − . In problem (1),  is taken as given, but it is determined below
by equilibrium. We defer a more rigorous definition of equilibrium to a more
general model below but the idea is basically optimization and market clearing:
sellers maximize  subject to buyers getting  ; and the  emerging from (1)
is consistent with the set of buyers and sellers in the market. Notice sellers can
get the same  from lower  if  is higher, and buyers can get the same  from
higher  if  is lower. These trade-oﬀs are a quintessential element of the theory.
       One way to solve (1) is to rearrange the constraint as  =  −   (), and
substitute this into the objective function to get

                              = max { () ( − ) −  }                                 (2)
                                     


This problem has a unique solution.7 If the solution is interior it satisfies the
FOC 0 () ( − ) =  . Then, given , the constraint yields  uniquely, so any
active submarkets must have the same ( ). Given CRS, therefore, without loss
of generality we can collapse all submarkets into one.
       There are two standard ways to proceed. The first is to assume  and  are
fixed. Then the equilibrium buyer-seller ratio must be the same as the population
ratio,  =  (market clearing). The FOC then implies  = 0 () ( − ), and
the constraint implies  =  −   (), or

                                      =  + (1 − )                                       (3)
   7
    Appendix A considers a generalization without perfectly transferable utility: if a buyer
makes a payment  to a seller, the latter gets  () while former gets − (); of course, (1) is
the special case  () =  () = . Using Lagrangians, we show the SOC’s hold at any solution
to the FOC’s, so if there is an interior solution it must be unique. However, in general, one has
to check for a corner solution, where  () or  ()  hit 0 or 1, or at least assume the meeting
technology is such that  ()   ()  ∈ (0 1) ∀ to avoid corners.


                                                8
      Figure 1: Equilibrium with (right) and without (left) entry by sellers

where  =  () ≡ 0 ()  () is the elasticity of  () wrt tightness. Hence,
price is a weighted average of cost and utility that splits the ex post (after meet-
ing) surplus  =  −  according to  =  ( − ) and  = (1 − ) ( − ).
The ex ante (before meeting) payoﬀs can now be written  =   ( − ) and
 =  (1 − ) ( − ). This uniquely pins down the equilibrium h     i.
   The second way to proceed is to assume one side has a cost to participate, and
therefore, in general, only some of them enter the market. Suppose it is sellers
that have a participation cost  . Then in equilibrium, as long as  is neither
too big nor too small relative to  , some but not all sellers enter, and we have
the free entry condition  =  . As above, the FOC implies  = 0 () ( − )
and the constraint implies  =  + (1 − ) . Now  =  =  () ( − ), from
which we get . Once again these conditions uniquely pin down h     i.
   Fig. 1, a version of which appears in Peters (1991), shows the “Edgeworth
box” in ( ) space. Indiﬀerence curves for buyers slope down, because they are
willing to pay higher  if  is lower, so they can trade faster. Similarly, sellers are
willing to accept lower  if  is higher. As in elementary microeconomics, eﬃcient
outcomes are points of tangency, tracing out the contract curve C. The left panel
depicts the case without entry, where C crosses  = ; the right depicts the case
with entry by sellers, where C crosses the indiﬀerence curve  = .

         Figure 2: Equilibrium with (right) and without (left) entry by sellers

       By way of comparison, consider the dual to (1),

                                   ()
                      = max           ( − ) st  () ( − ) =                      (4)
                                 

which looks as if buyers post and sellers search.8 One can check (4) leads to
the same conditions for h     i as (1), with  fixed or with entry. Hence, it
does not matter if buyers post and sellers search or vice versa (this is not always
true, but a suﬃcient condition satisfied here is that the number of meetings given
 buyers and  sellers does not depend on who searches; see fn. 32 below).
There is a third interpretation, with third parties called market makers designing
submarkets by posting ( ) to attract buyers and sellers. In Moen (1997),
there is a single market maker, somewhat like an auctioneer, perhaps, while
in Mortensen and Wright (2002) there are competing market makers trying to
extract entrance fees from participants, but competition drives the fees to 0. The
outcome is the same. Hence it does not matter here who posts, buyers, sellers or
market makers (again, this is not always true, as discussed below).
       Fig. 2, used to describe competitive search equilibrium in Rocheteau and
Wright (2005), depicts the solution to (4) as a “demand” for sellers  as a
   8
   The methods in Appendix A can be used to show the SOC’s hold at any solution to the
FOC’s, so the solution to (4) is unique, even in the generalization with payoﬀs  () and  ()
mentioned in fn. 7. Note that this only assumes  () is concave, not  () .

check “demand” is decreasing and, as shown, hits 0 at finite  . Without entry,
in the left panel “supply” is vertical and equilibrium determines  . With entry
by sellers, in the right panel “supply” is horizontal at  and equilibrium deter-
mines  . Indeed, one could nest these with a general upward-sloping “supply”
curve by letting  vary with the number of homogeneous entrants, or across het-
erogeneous potential entrants. The point of Fig. 2, like Fig. 1, is that the theory
can be described using tools from elementary microeconomics.9
       Now consider a planner’s problem with endogenous participation by sellers,
                                  ½                   ¾
                                     ()           
                             max          ( − ) −                           (5)
                                                  
The first term is the expected surplus per buyer; the second is the total entry
cost of sellers per buyer, since   = 1. Notice something interesting: if
we eliminate  from the objective function in (4) using the constraint, we get
exactly the same problem as (5). Hence, the solution is the same, and this means
equilibrium equilibrium is eﬃcient.
       For yet another comparison, consider bargaining instead of posting. One
interpretation is that there in no communication outside of meetings, so agents
cannot post terms to attract counterparties. Another is that it agents cannot
commit, so that even if they can communicate talk is cheap, although this is
subtle (Menzio 2007; Doyle and Wong 2013; Dutu 2013; Kim and Kircher 2015;
Stacey 2016a,b). In any case, when a buyer and seller meet they now determine
 by generalized Nash bargaining,

                                  max ( − ) ( − )1−                                   (6)
                                    


where  is buyer bargaining power. The solution is  =  + (1 − ) , which is
   9
    Rocheteau and Wright (2005) study a generalization where “demand” in Fig. 2 may not be
single valued or continuous, and  might jump downward as  increases. With a horizontal
“supply,” as in the right panel of Fig. 2, if  jumps existence is not a problem, and uniqueness
holds at least generically. Existence may seem to be a problem with a vertial “supply,” because
it might hit a gap between two values of  when it jumps; in that case, there is an equilibrium
with two submarkets posting diﬀerent ( ) but yielding the same payoﬀ.

                                               11
the same as  under posting, and hence eﬃcient, iﬀ  = . This is the well-known
Hosios (1990) condition: eﬃciency obtains iﬀ agents’ bargaining powers are equal
to the elasticity of the meeting technology with respect to their participation.10
Hence, sellers should get a share of  −  commensurate with their contribution
to matching. Since this is exactly what competitive search delivers, it is often
said that it induces the Hosios condition endogenously.
       If  =  is fixed, one can check    0 and    0, naturally,
while  ≈ −0 where “ ≈ ” means “ and  have the same sign.” Now
0  0, and hence   0, for many common meeting technologies but not
all. Appendix E shows 0 () ≷ 0 ⇔  () ≷ 1, where  () is the elasticity of
substitution. Consider a CES technology,  (1  2 ) = (1 + 2 )1 ,  ∈ (−∞ 1),
where  = 1 (1 − ). Then   0 ⇒ 0  0,   0 ⇒ 0  0, and, in the
Cobb-Douglas case,  = 0 ⇒ 0 = 0. Does   0 make sense? Yes. To see
why, first note that higher  unambiguously increases  and decreases  . These
payoﬀs can change due to either changes in  or in the trading probabilities. By
construction,  () goes up and  ()  down with , but if they move a lot,
 must go down so the changes in  and  are not too big. Hence an increase
in demand along the extensive margin (higher ) can lower price, even if one
can show an increase in demand along the intensive margin (higher ) implies
  0 unambiguously. Similarly, with seller entry, higher  reduces  and
raises , also implying  ≈ −0 and   0.
       The finding that price might fall when the buyer-seller ratio goes up, either
exogenously, or in response to changes in other factors, reflects the big idea that
resource allocation is guided by both prices and probabilities. This encompasses
standard general equilibrium theory, which relies exclusively on prices, and stan-
dard search theory, which relies mainly if not exclusively on probabilities, will be
recurring theme in what follows.
  10
    Earlier versions of this idea are in Mortensen (1982 ) and Pissarides (1986). Hosios
(1990) also shows a simple directed search model yields eﬃciency endogenously. Mangin and
Julien (2016) provide a recent generalization and more references.



                                            12
2.2       Labor Markets

Now let households be sellers, of their time, and firms buyers. Each firm wants
to hire exactly one worker, while each household wants to land one job. Thus,
 is the vacancy-unemployment ratio. Again, it does not matter here who posts
and who searches. Consider a version of (1) that maximizes workers’ payoﬀs,

                                                      ()
                      = max  () ( − ) st             ( − ) =                       (7)
                                                    

where  is output per worker and  is the value of unemployment benefits, leisure
and home production sacrificed by taking a job. Here ,  and  play the roles
of ,  and  in the goods market.
       Emulating Section 2.1, with  =  fixed, we get  =  + (1 − ) ,  =
 (1 − ) ( − ) and  =   ( − ). And with entry by buyers (the firms in
this application), we get a similar outcome except  is endogenous and  =  .
With  =  fixed we have  ≈ −0 , and with entry we have   0
and  ≈ 0 . If 0  0 then  goes up when with tightness, as one might
expect, but that is not true in general, as explained above for goods markets. As
other features of goods markets also carry over, we proceed to applications.
       Albrecht et al. (2006), Galenianos and Kircher (2009) and Kircher (2009) let
workers apply for more than one job.11 If workers can apply to  ∈ {1 2 } va-
cancies, then it turns out there will be  distinct wages posted, and the optimal
search strategy is to apply to one of each — i.e., to look for work simultaneously
in  distinct submarkets. Hence, the model exhibits wage dispersion with homo-
geneous agents, as is relevant because a large part of empirical wage variation
cannot be explained by observables (Abowd et al. 1999; Mortensen 2003). Also,
consistent with the evidence, the density of posted wages can be shown to be
decreasing, while by way of contrast, in models based on Burdett and Mortensen
  11
    A diﬀerence in approach is this: in Albrecht et al. (2006), if two or more firms make oﬀers to
the same worker they compete à la Bertrand (see also Albrecht et al. 2003,2004); in Galenianos
and Kircher (2009) or Kircher (2009), and in our presentation, firms commit to posted wages.
This does not aﬀect the eﬃciency results discussed below.



                                               13
(1998), with homogeneous agents the density is increasing. Also, again consistent
with conventional wisdom, firms oﬀering higher wages receive more applications.
   Allowing multiple applications introduces an element of portfolio choice for
workers, with low-wage applications serving to reduce the downside risk. This
embeds in an equilibrium setting a version of Chade and Smith’s (2006) marginal
improvement algorithm. For a simplified exposition, consider  = 2, so there are
two wages posted, 1 and 2 ≥ 1 , with workers sending applications to two
distinct submarkets. If both pan out, they accept the highest wage; if only one
pans out, they take it. Their expected payoﬀ is therefore

                 = max {(2 )(2 − ) + [1 − (2 )]  (1 ) (1 − )}            (8)
                     1 2

where  is the tightness in a submarket posting  .
   Generalizing the above methods, in the low-wage submarket, we solve
                                           [1 −  (1 )] (1 )
            1 = max (1 )(1 − ) st                         ( − 1 ) =         (9)
                    1 1                         1
where () is the probability a worker rejects 1 if oﬀered. This looks like
the problem with  = 1, except for  (1 ), since  = 1 implies workers always
accept 1 while here they might get a better oﬀer. Given the solution to (9), we
substitute 1 into (8) to obtain the problem for the high-wage submarket
                                                 [1 − (2 )] (2 )
  = max {(2 )(2 −  − 1 ) + 1 } st                          ( − 2 ) =   (10)
       2 2                                           2
This again looks like a problem with  = 1, but now the outside option is  + 1 ,
not just . Since a higher outside option raises the posted wage, this is indeed
consistent with 2  1 . Thus we support 2 posted wages.
   As regards eﬃciency, in Galenianos and Kircher (2009), a worker who gets a
job at a high wage still enters the queue at lower wages. In the  = 2 example, if
a fraction  of firms post 1 then 1 =   , 2 = (1 − )  , (1 ) = (2 )
and  (2 ) = 0. To characterize equilibrium, one solves (9) and (10) with 
set so that  is the same in the two submarkets. The outcome is not eﬃcient.
Heuristically, since workers obtaining jobs at 2 still enter the queue at 1 , they

                                            14
might prevent other workers from getting low-wage jobs (a congestion eﬀect).
Neither the firms posting high wages nor the workers who obtain them take this
into account, implying an unpriced externality.
   However, in Kircher (2009), workers who obtain a job at a high wage no
longer enter the queue for low wages, to capture the idea that firms oﬀering jobs
to workers who reject should be able to continue making oﬀers. This implies
 (1 ) = 0 because any worker in the low-wage queue by construction does not
have a high-wage oﬀer. Again the equilibrium is found by solving the two sub-
market problems and adjusting  to ensure firms get the same payoﬀ in each.
It is no surprise that this arrangement is better than the one in Galenianos and
Kircher (2009); it may be more surprising that it achieves full eﬃciency, but it
does, because the unpriced externality disappears.
   Multiple-application models have a structure similar to our benchmark, and
the eﬃciency properties carry over if there are no unpriced externalities. In
related work, Wolthoﬀ (2014) constructs a model encompassing Kircher (2009)
and Galenianos and Kircher (2009), and endogenizes firms’ recruitment eﬀort.
Assessing the models’ empirical performance, he concludes multiple submarkets
are crucial for matching the data. Gautier and Holzner (2016) introduce a more
sophisticated process to bid for workers after matching, so no vacancies remains
idle because workers reject them to join firms with more applicants than they
need. This leads to eﬃciency. It is also intuitively appealing that firms can break
ties among identical workers.

2.3    Summary of the Baseline Models

Table 1 provides comparative statics for goods and labor markets in the bench-
mark model where agents can only search in one submarket. Reported are the
eﬀects on tightness, prices or wages, ex ante payoﬀs and ex post surpluses, for
three cases: (a) fixed populations; (b) entry by sellers; and (c) entry by buyers.
Most of these are unambiguous, but as explained above some of the eﬀects on 


                                        15
or  can go either way. A few cases report +∗ or −∗ to indicate that the signs are
ambiguous, in general, but + or − in the somewhat common case 0 ≤ 0. While
the results are the same for goods and labor markets after re-labeling, both are
provided to facilitate interpretation and avoid having to translate between, e.g.,
 and .
   An analogous table for bargaining would be similar, except eﬀects reported as
0 or −0 would be 0, and those reported as +∗ and −∗ would be + and −. We can
get that with a Cobb-Douglas meeting technology, which implies 0 = 0. In gen-
eral, however, parameter changes aﬀect  and the trading probabilities by enough
to move prices in ways that might be counterintuitive without understanding the
theory. Under bargaining the terms of trade do not change with , because while
arrival rates aﬀect expected payoﬀs, they do not aﬀect the surpluses after traders
meet, and hence are irrelevant in the negotiations. There is a caveat: in some
dynamic models, as discussed below,  aﬀects continuation values and hence the
bargaining outcome. That is diﬀerent from competitive search, where  aﬀects
the terms of trade even in a static environment.

                                       16
       This concludes the presentation of the basic static models. At the risk of
appearing pedantic, to highlight the main economic results, let us formalize them
as follows:

Proposition 1 In the benchmark model, when agents can search in at most one
submarket, with or without entry, there is a unique equilibrium and it has a single
price or wage. This is eﬃcient. When agents can simultaneously search in   1
submarkets, there is a unique equilibrium and it has  prices or wages. This is
eﬃcient if there are no congestion externalities.


3        Extensions and Applications
We want to move beyond static theory for many reasons, but an important one is
that equilibrium meeting probabilities translate into random durations between
trades, central to the study of employment/unemployment spells in labor eco-
nomics, and also of interest in markets for housing, assets, etc. For goods mar-
kets, we can simply repeat the static version, assuming households trade with
diﬀerent sellers all the time. As this is easy, we introduce additional features,
including heterogeneity, and embed the market in general equilibrium. Simply
repeating the static model is less compelling for labor, which typically involves
long-term relationships, so the dynamic labor extension is more intricate.12

3.1       Goods Markets

We now embed the Section 2.1 model in dynamic general equilibrium. To do
this easily, we follow Lagos and Wright (2005) and many subsequent papers by
adopting the following structure: Each period in discrete time, infinitely-lived
agents interact in two ways: first there is a decentralized market, or DM, just like
the one analyzed above; then there is a frictionless centralized market, or CM, as
  12
    As it is impossible to cover everything, we neglect the more complicated analysis of nonsta-
tionarity markets, where buyer/seller ratios change over time as agents drop out after trading;
see Peters (1991,1994) and McAfee (1993).



                                              17
in general equilibrium theory. One reason for this is that, rather than finalizing
trades for  by paying  in spot transactions, now buyers (sellers) incur (accept)
obligations for payment in the next CM. This deferred settlement arrangement
— i.e., credit — is more interesting than barter or transferable utility in many
applications. Indeed, an alternating-market structure is used heavily in monetary
economics, as discussed in Section 4, so it makes sense to introduce it now.
       To this end, continue to let  and  be the DM value functions, and now
let  and  be the CM value functions. In the CM, buyers solve

                     () = max { () −  +  } st  =  −                            (11)
                                 


where  is the discount factor,  is the CM numeraire,  is labor,  is the wage
and  is debt brought over from the previous DM.13 Also let us assume  is
produced one-for-one with , so that in equilibrium  = 1. Then the solution
to (11) has  = ∗ , where  0 (∗ ) = 1, and  = ∗ − . The envelope condition
is 0 () = −1. The CM problem for sellers is omitted, but similar, and also
implies 0 () = −1 (although one should expect   0 for them).
       For buyers, the DM payoﬀ is

               =  [ +  ()] + (1 −  )  (0) =  ( − ) +  (0)                  (12)

because  () −  (0) = −, by the envelope condition. Similarly, for sellers

                                   =  ( − ) +  (0)                                  (13)

Except for the constants  (0) and  (0),  and  are identical to the static
model. Hence, extending the benchmark to dynamic general equilibrium is easy,
but is still nice, because, e.g., higher  () now means sellers trade faster, or more
  13
    Having one-period debt means we can avoid tracking the distribution of  across agents as
a state variable, but this is without loss of generality given quasi-linear CM utility and interior
solutions for . In fact, as in Wong (2016), we could use any CM utility function satisfying
                                                                   1
11 22 = 122
               , including  =  (1 − ) or  = [ + (1 − ) ] ; we use quasi-linearity only
to ease notation. Also, it can be any CM good that enters linearly; we use  because it is
common in applications, and realistic since most people do pay oﬀ debt by working. Also, we
can replace  by x in utility and by px in the budget equation, where p x ∈ R+ .

                                                18
often, and not just with higher probability. This fits the theory neatly into the
realm of duration analysis, which has proved useful in much empirical work (e.g.,
Devine and Kiefer 1991). In particular, the expected times for sellers and buyers
to transact are 1 () and  (), respectively.
       The next step is to consider two types of buyers, with utilities 1 and 2  1 ,
and free entry of homogeneous sellers, in which case the market segments into
two distinct submarkets,  = 1 2.14 Then (   ) in submarket  is determined
as above by

                = [ ( ) −  0 ( )] ( − ) and  =  +   ( )               (14)

Note that (14) holds for  = 1 2 independently, a feature called block recursivity.
It lets us first solve for  in each submarket  (block 1) regardless of what is
happening in other submarkets; then the number of agents in each submarket is
determined (block 2) so the total number of buyers sums to the number in the
economy, and free entry of sellers ensures market tightness is correct. This comes
up again, and is especially convenient in environments with shocks.
       Given 2  1 , one can check 2  1 and 2  1 . Thus, high-valuation
buyers go to submarket 2, where they pay more but trade faster. Sellers trade
slower in submarket 2 and, in equilibrium, they are indiﬀerent between it and
submarket 1. This is shown in the left panel of Fig. 3, with buyers in submarkets
1 and 2 on indiﬀerence curves denoted 1∗ and 2∗ , both of which are tangent to
the sellers’ common indiﬀerence curve ∗ =  .
       Now consider homogeneous buyers and two seller types, now in fixed numbers
1 and 2 , with 1 and 2  1 but the same .15 Suppose  is not too big, so
all sellers participate. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 3, the market segments
  14
     This is discussed further in Section 6, where we go into heterogeneity and sorting in detail;
here we simply provide illustrative examples. A general result is that there will not be two
diﬀerent types of buyers, or two diﬀerent types of sellers, in the same submarket, but one type
of buyer, or one type of seller, can go to multiple submarkets.
  15
     Allowing sellers’  to diﬀer (e.g., see Julien et al. 2006a), but otherwise keeping them
homogeneous, has little eﬀect: there will still be only one submarket open, as in the baseline
model, but now we can say which sellers enter — those with  below a threshold ∗ .


                                               19
              Figure 3: Heterogeneous buyers (left) or sellers (right)

into two submarkets where now buyers are indiﬀerent between them. As usual,
(   ) is determined by

              0 ( ) ( −  ) =  and  =  ( )  + [1 −  ( )] 

Let us normalize  = 1 and let  be the fraction of buyers in submarket 1. Then
the following buyer-indiﬀerence condition uniquely determines :
                       µ ¶                  µ     ¶
                     0                   0   1−
                            ( − 1 ) =           ( − 2 ) 
                        1                     2
where we recall that  is fixed here. One can check 2  1 and 2  1 ,
so sellers in submarket 2 trade slower, while buyers trade faster but pay higher
prices.
   As these examples show, the theory easily accommodates deviations from the
“law” of one price. With heterogeneous buyers, sellers in submarket 1 settle for
1 even though other sellers are getting 2  1 in submarket 2. Why? Obviously
because it takes longer to sell in submarket 2. With heterogeneous sellers, buyers
in submarket 2 pay 2 even though others are getting the good at 1  2 in
submarket 1, for a similar reason. This is related to, yet diﬀerent from, other
theories of price dispersion. In Burdett and Judd (1983), e.g., buyers see a random
number of prices simultaneously — they call this noisy search — and when they see

                                           20
more than one they pick the lowest. In equilibrium, ex ante identical sellers post
diﬀerent prices yet earn equal profits: those that post lower  earn less per unit,
but make it up on the volume. That much is like our sellers, but Burdett-Judd
buyers do not make a directed choice between paying less or trading faster, as
they do here, so the economics is somewhat diﬀerent.
       Returning to heterogeneous buyers and homogeneous sellers, here is an appli-
cation to housing based on Wright and Zhu (2017). There are a fixed number of
homogeneous houses in the market, but buyers are heterogeneous, with the value
to becoming a home owner distributed continuously across buyers with CDF
 () and support [1  2 ]. Now equilibrium involves a continuum of submarkets,
one for each buyer type, indexed by (   ) (this is treated more formally below).
In the left panel of Fig. 3, there is now a submarket for every point on sellers’
common indiﬀerence curve between (∗1  ∗1 ) and (∗2  ∗2 ), with higher  associ-
ated with higher  and lower  . Higher-valuation buyers search where their
trading probabilities and prices are higher, while sellers are indiﬀerent because
of the common-sense notion that listing a house at a higher price means a longer
average time on the market.16
       Consider an expansion in demand in terms of a shift in  () in the sense of
first-order stochastic dominance. One can show this shifts the support of the price
distribution to the right at least if 0 () ≤ 0. It also increases ∗1 and decreases ∗2 ,
tightness in the highest- and lowest-price submarkets. Next consider an increase
in the cost  of selling (e.g., taxes, realtor fees or apartment rents), interpretable
as a contraction in supply. Again the price distribution shifts right, but now ∗1
decreases and ∗2 increases. With the total housing stock fixed, if  contracts
the price distribution also shifts right, but ∗1 and ∗2 both rise. With entry by
sellers, if  goes up the stock on the market contracts endogenously, with a
similar impact.
  16
    While it is no surprise that a big home in a nice neighborhood costs more than a small
one in a bad neighborhood, the interest here is in residual price dispersion, the same way labor
economists are interested in residual wage dispersion. Wright and Zhu (2016) cite empirical
work finding non-negligible dispersion in listed prices for similar homes.


                                              21
   Disperse prices easily generate sticky prices. If market conditions change,
as in the previous paragraph, the distribution reacts, but if the change is not
too big the old and new supports overlap, and sellers with  in the overlapping
range have no incentive to reprice. If demand falls, e.g., the distribution shifts
left but many sellers can keep the same  — lowering it attenuates the fall in
 but reduces profit in the long run, and equilibrium makes that a matter of
indiﬀerence. This is relevant because people claim house prices look sticky in the
data and find this puzzling. As Merlo et al. (2015) say, “conventional wisdom is
that traditional, rational, forward-looking economic theories are unable to explain
extreme price stickiness of this sort, unless there are large menu costs associated
with price revisions.” Others champion behavioral explanations. Here stickiness
emerges without resorting to menu costs or behavioral economics. While Head
et al. (2011) show similar stickiness emerges with noisy (Burdett-Judd) search, as
argued above the economics of directed search is somewhat diﬀerent.
   Whether or not directed search explains every nuance of housing markets,
it is useful for understanding various aspects. This is illustrated by Albrecht
et al. (2016) in a setting where first sellers list prices, then a random number of
buyers show up, as we discuss in Section 5. Each buyer can accept the listed price
or make a counteroﬀer. If no buyers accept, the seller can accept or reject the
best counteroﬀer. If exactly 1 buyer accepts, he gets the house at the listed price.
If 2 or more accept, the seller runs an auction among them. This is consistent
with empirical work (see Albrecht et al. 2016 for citations) showing that houses
can sell at, above or below listed prices. More generally, it shows how directed
search captures interesting features of housing markets.
   In quantitative work, Diaz and Jerez (2013) build a directed search model
that is consistent with cyclical properties of housing data — e.g., positive (nega-
tive) comovement of prices and sales (time on the market). They also show that
search frictions amplify price volatility and propagate aggregate shocks. Head et
al. (2015) use a directed search model with heterogenous sellers to think about


                                        22
mortgages. They show that highly-indebted home owners tend to list high prices
and take longer to sell. Hedlund (2015) develops a directed search model with
heterogenous buyers and sellers, where computation is facilitated by block re-
cursivity, and shows it can quantitatively account for cyclical dynamics in key
macroeconomic housing and mortgage market variables (see also Hedlund 2016
and Garriga and Hedlund 2016). All this shows how the approach provides a
fruitful avenue for future work on housing.17
    Moving from houses back to generic goods, let us now make them divisible:
DM buyers get a quantity or quality  in exchange for payment  in the next
CM. Buyers’ utility and sellers’ cost, () and  (), satisfy the usual properties,
plus  (0) =  (0) = 0 and  (̄) =  (̄) for some ̄  0. The eﬃcient  solves
0 (∗ ) = 0 (∗ ). One can call ̂ =  the unit price, unless  is unobserved
quality, in which case one might still call  the price. We assume both  and  are
posted, although there are alternatives — e.g., perhaps due to limited commitment,
there may be a posted unit price ̂, and then in a meeting  is chosen unilaterally
by the buyer (Peters 1984) or the seller (Gomis-Porqueras et al. 2016).
    We also introduce a limit on how much one can promise to pay,  ≤ . This
debt (or liquidity) constraint is exogenous here, but endogenized in Section 4.
Suppose it is slack. Then, ignoring the constants  (0) and  (0), we have

                                 ()
                  = max             [() − ] st  () [ −  ()] =               (15)
                             

Indeed, when  ≤  is slack, the solution has  =  ∗ , so the problem is basically
the same as the one with a fixed , and the usual procedure yields (∗  ∗ ). In
particular, the generalization of (3) is ∗ =  (∗ )  ( ∗ ) + [1 −  (∗ )]  ( ∗ ), and
the constraint is indeed slack iﬀ  ≥ ∗ . Clearly,  = 0 when  ≤  is slack.
Without entry, we have ∗  ≈ −, similar to in Table 1.1(a). With entry,
the results are similar to Table 1.1(b) and (c).
  17
     An interesting idea is to interpret the market makers discussed above as realtors, as in
Stacey (2015a). Also, Moen et al. (2016) study the decision to buy-then-sell or sell-then-buy.
A housing model with directed search and two-sided hetreogeneity is Head at al. (2017).


                                               23
   When   ∗ , so the constraint binds, the results are quite diﬀerent. In
Appendix A we solve (15) and show the SOC’s hold at any solution to the FOC’s.
So there is a unique equilibrium and it implies  =  ( ), where

                              () 0 ()  () + [1 −  ()] 0 ()  ()
                 ( ) ≡                                                    (16)
                                    () 0 () + [1 −  ()] 0 ()

This condition appears in many models with liquidity considerations and Nash
bargaining (see Section 4), except  () replaces buyers’ share . One can check
that, without entry,  =   0 and  ≈ 0 , the latter taking over for
 ≈ −0 from the case where the constraint is slack, since now  cannot
change while  can and does.
   With entry by sellers, the equilibrium conditions  =  ( ) and  =
 () [ −  ()] imply

                                           
                         0,     0,      0 and     ≈ 0                     (17)
                                          

Again  is ambiguous, similar to  in Table 1.1(b). More complicated
versions of this setup are studied by Rocheteau and Wright (2005), Menzio et
al. (2013) and Choi (2015), sometimes using the methods of monotone compara-
tive statics. Again, to highlight the main results, we formalize them as follows:

Proposition 2 The dynamic equilibrium model with credit yields results simi-
lar to the static model, whether  is endogenous and  is fixed, or vice versa.
Heterogeneity implies submarkets segmented by probabilities, with prices that are
disperse and can look sticky.

3.2    Labor Markets

While enduring relationships may also be relevant in goods markets — e.g., people
have favorite shops or bars — in labor markets they are ubiquitous. We now work
through Moen (1997), a directed search version of the standard bargaining model
(e.g., Pissarides 2000). Market tightness is now  =  (1 − ), the measure of



                                            24
vacancies over unemployment, where  is the employment rate with a population
of households normalized to 1. Also, here we use continuous time.18
       Let 1 and 0 be firms’ payoﬀs to having a worker and an open vacancy. In
steady state these satisfy
                                             ()
                             0 = − +          (1 − 0 )                               (18)
                                              
                             1   =  −  +  (0 − 1 )                                (19)

where  is the cost of a vacancy,  the discount rate, and  the job destruction
rate.19 In words, (18) says the flow payoﬀ to a vacancy is − plus the arrival rate
of workers,  () , times the gain to filling the position, 1 − 0 . Similarly,
(19) says the flow payoﬀ to having a worker is  −  plus  times the capital loss,
0 − 1 . Similarly, for households

                              0 =  +  () (1 − 0 )                                 (20)

                              1 =  +  (0 − 1 )                                     (21)

       Again it does not matter for results if firms or workers post, but the latter is
easier, since 0 = 0 (free entry) combined with (18)-(19) yield what is sometimes
called the job creation curve,

                                 =  −  ( + )  ()                                   (22)

Solving (18)-(19) for 0 and inserting  from (22), the relevant problem is
                                           () ( − ) −  ( + ) 
                       0 =  + max                                 
                                                 +  +  ()
The FOC implies  () = 0, where

                    () ≡ 0 () ( − ) − [ +  +  () − 0 ()]                      (23)
  18
      There is no CM in this environment, but it is interesting to add one (Berentsen et al. 2011;
Gomis-Porqueras et al. 2013; Zhang and Huangfu 2016; Dong and Xiao 2016). Among other
things, this allows firms to pay wages in CM numeraire rather than transferable utility or a
fraction of output, and to finance entry by issuing CM debt or equity.
   19
      In static models, free entry means  =  , while here it means 0 = 0 since  is already
in condition (18); not much hinges on this. We do of course need  not too big, so the market
does not shut down. Also,  is exogenous, but can be endogenized using productivity shocks
(see Mortensen and Pissarides 1994), or on-the-job search (see below).

                                               25
and one can check  (0)  0   (∞) and  0 ()  0. So there is a unique
solution to  () = 0, and hence a unique equilibrium .
   It is straightforward to derive
                                            
                     0,     0,     0,     0 and     0                    (24)
                                            
The eﬀects of ,  and  are consistent with Table 1.2(c), plus there are new eﬀects
of  and , and all accord well with intuition. One can easily show   0,
  0 and   0. Appendix F shows   0 and   0
if 0 ≤ 0, but this is not true in general, something one would miss by focusing
exclusively on bargaining models. This is again similar to Table 1.2(c), and the
economics intuition is basically the same, although in that discussion 0  0 iﬀ
  0, while now it is suﬃcient but not necessary, indicating there is more
going on in the dynamic than the static models.
   Appendix B shows the equilibrium outcome is the same as the solution to a
planner’s problem posed without restricting attention to steady state — i.e., the
eﬃcient  solves  () = 0 at every date, as in the textbook Pissarides model.
This is again block recursivity: at any point in time the measure of vacancies 
depends on , but tightness  =  (1 − ) does not. To continue the comparison,
rearrange  () = 0 as
                               ()      () ( − )
                         =                                                   (25)
                                  +  +  () [1 −  ()]
which equates firms’ vacancy cost to their arrival rate times their share,  (), of
the appropriately-discounted surplus of a match,  − . This is the same as the
condition in the Pissarides model, except the elasticity  replaces firms’ share .
It matters: if we change labor-market policy, as long as 0 () 6= 0 the eﬀects here
are diﬀerent than predicted by bargaining models where  is fixed.
   An important extension involves on-the-job search, e.g., Delacroix and Shi
(2006), Garibaldi and Moen (2010), Schaal (2015), Tsuyuhara (2016) and Garibaldi
et al. (2016). This makes workers react diﬀerently to wage oﬀers, and generates
direct job-to-job transitions, consistent with the data (Fallick and Fleischman

                                         26
2001; Christiansen et al. 2005). Following Delacroix and Shi (2006), let   0 be
workers’ cost of search while employed. If  is large we are back in the baseline
model; for smaller  at least some workers search while employed. As should be
expected, e.g., based on models like Burdett and Mortensen (1998), on-the-job
search generates wage dispersion.
       Let  () be the ratio of vacancies to job seekers in a submarket with wage
. The problem of a worker employed at  is

 1 () =  +  [0 − 1 ()] + max
                                     0
                                        Σ{ [(0 )] [1 (0 ) − 1 ()] − } (26)
                                          Σ


where Σ = 1 (Σ = 0) indicates he engages in (abstains from) search, and if Σ = 1,
0 is the next wage to which he directs his search. An unemployed worker’s value
function is similar to a worker employed at  = , except it is assumed that the
former has no search cost, so 0 = 1 () + . Also, a standard result in this
context (see Appendix C) is that workers are more selective in terms of the next
targeted wage 0 when their current wage  is higher.20
       Solving for equilibrium requires finding  (). To begin, write

                                      [()]
                        0 = − +           [1 () − 0 ]
                                      ()
                    1 () =  −  + [ + ()] [0 − 1 ()] 

where the only change from the baseline model is that jobs now end with an
exogenous probability  plus the endogenous probability () that a worker gets
a better oﬀer. Now free entry implies 0 = 0, or

                                      [()] −
                               =                                                        (27)
                                      ()  +  + ()

Then   0 implies there is a  such that workers employed at  ≥  naturally
stop searching. For firms paying  ≥ , () = 0, and (27) identifies the ()
that coincides with what one gets without on-the-job search.
  20
    The logic is similar to the model with multiple applications in Section 2.2, where a worker
takes more risk applying for a high wage because if he fails he may still get a low wage.



                                                27
       Next, note that under the hypothetical situation that () is computed this
way everywhere, we can find the lowest wage at which the solution to (26) involves
no search, and that identifies . Then, by way of induction, notice there is a
minimum wage increment 4 that workers require to justify search (again see
Appendix C). Hence, those employed at  ∈ [ − 4 ) only seek jobs with
0 ≥ , for which we have already determined (0 ). Given , 0 is the unique
solution to (26), denoted 0 = (). Then () =  ◦  ◦ (), where for
any functions  and ,  ◦ () denotes the composite  [ ()]. Knowing ()
∀ ∈ [ − 4 ), entry condition (27) yields () at these wages. Repeating the
procedure for  ∈ [ − 24  − 4) yields () and () at those wages, and so
on, until  () and  () are determined for all .
       This establishes  () and  () ∀ without reference to the distribution of
employment across , in and out of steady-state, again due to block recursivity.
Starting with higher unemployment, e.g., lots of job seekers search for  = (),
but also lots of firms post  = (), keeping  () as determined above. Thus,
we can first solve for the value functions and decision rules (block 1), then study
the evolution of  from any initial condition (block 2), and only in the second step
does the distribution of employment come into play. Extensions of this insight
allow tractable analysis of business cycle models where aggregate productivity 
is stochastic. In these models, current  is enough to compute tightness in each
submarket, say ( ), which is much easier than it would be if  depended on
the distribution of  across workers. While ( ) is diﬀerent from the above
construction, because  can change, the basic methods apply.21
       To recap, there are  wages, 1  2   . The unemployed apply to
1 = (); workers employed at 1 apply to 2 = (1 ); and so on, until they
stop searching at . It can be shown that  decreases with search and entry
costs. It can also be shown that simple wage contracts do not induce eﬃciency.
The situation is similar to the model in Section 2.2 with multiple applications.

and Weng (2017) for an extension to incorporate learning.

With on-the-job search, firms care about both recruitment and retention, and
a single wage is not suﬃcient to balance the two. This is especially clear when
all matches produce the same , which means on-the-job search is rent seeking
that has a social cost but does not increase output. However, more complicated
contracts that directly specify search activity, or specify that workers compensate
firms when they quit, restore to eﬃciency. See Menzio and Shi (2011).
       Research on labor markets is a vibrant area with many possible extensions.
Parallel to divisible goods in Section 3.1, one idea is to have divisible hours
, with  () output and  () the disutility of work, to study regulations like
 ≤ ̄ or  ≥ ̄, similar to the restriction  ≤ . The eﬀects of unemployment
insurance are also interesting (see below). Another important extension concerns
directed search over the life cycle, where trade-oﬀs between wages and job-finding
rates produce transitions that depend on age (Menzio et al. 2016). But since it
is impossible to cover everything, we end with a summary of the labor models.22

Proposition 3 The dynamic labor model without on-the-job search has a unique
equilibrium and it is eﬃcient. At each point in time,  solves  () = 0 and 
solves (22). The outcome with on-the-job search is similar, except there is wage
dispersion, and eﬃciency requires more complicated contracts.


4        Monetary Economics
Monetary theory has used random matching at least since Kiyotaki and Wright
(1989), and that model has been recast using directed search by Corbae et
al. (2003). However, since those environments are complicated, we instead start
with Julien et al. (2008), which is simpler. These models have indivisible assets.
We then introduce divisible assets, which involves dealing with an endogenous
  22
    While we earlier downplayed enduring relationships in goods markets, the labor models
show how to handle such phenomena. This is arguably relevant for several reasons discussed
in Gourio and Rudanko (2014), although they do not have directed search. Shi (2016) presents
a directed search model where such relationships arise endogenously when buyers make repeat
purchases, and this improves welfare. It also induces micro price dynamics, including sales,
even when conditions are constant. Pursuing this is another fruitful area for future research.

                                             29
distribution. While there are diﬀerent ways to handle this (see surveys by Nosal
and Rocheteau 2011 and Lagos et al. 2016), we focus on the approach in Lagos
and Wright (2005), but also discuss Menzio et al. (2013), which interesting in this
context because it relies heavily on directed search and block recursivity.

4.1       Indivisible Assets
          £     ¤
There is a 0 ̄ continuum of ex ante identical agents that live forever in dis-
crete time (it would be interesting to add entry, but we do not do so here). This
environment has no centralized markets, and agents can only meet/trade bilat-
erally, and that is hindered by specialization: there are many diﬀerent types of
goods, and it is never the case in a pairwise meeting that agent  consumes what
 produces and vice versa, to rule out direct barter. Assumptions on limited
commitment and private information then rule out credit, so that assets have an
essential role as media of exchange (Kocherlakota 2008; Wallace 2010).
       Equal measures of agents consume and produce each good, and everyone
has the same utility  () for goods they consume and cost  () for goods they
produce. Goods are nonstorable. There is a storable asset that generates utility 
each period for anyone holding it. If   0 this can be interpreted as a dividend,
as in standard asset-pricing theory going back to Lucas (1978); if   0 it can
be a storage cost, as in Kiyotaki and Wright (1989); and if  = 0 the asset is fiat
money as defined by Wallace (1980). Individual asset holdings are restricted to
                                       ¡     ¢
 ∈ {0 1}, so given a fixed supply  ∈ 0 ̄ ,  agents have  = 1 and act
as buyers while ̄ −  have  = 0 and act as sellers.23
       A novelty compared to the above models is that after trade the buyer becomes
a seller and vice versa. Letting ∆ =  −  be the value to getting an asset and
  23
     This environment is from of Shi (1995) and Trejos and Wright (1995), but those papers
use random search and symmetric bargaining. This is extended to generalized Nash and Kalai
bargaining by Rupert et al. (2001) and Trejos and Wright (2016). There are also versions with
posting and random search by Curtis and Wright (2004), or posting and noisy search by Burdett
et al. (2016). Wallace (2010) and many reference therein use abstract mechanism design. The
first paper to use posting and directed search is Julien et al. (2008), with recent extensions by
Julien et al. (2016) and He and Wright (2016).


                                               30
switching from seller to buyer, in steady state we have

                           =  +  [ () − ∆] +                              (28)

                           =  [∆ −  ()] +                                 (29)

As usual,  =  () and  =  ()  with  = (̄ − ) and  ()
comes from a general meeting technology, although following Kiyotaki and Wright
                                                      ¡       ¢
(1991,1993) many papers in this literature use  =  ̄ −  ̄. In any case,
these are similar to Section 3.1, except the benefit of producing is having the
asset next period, rather than selling for credit due in the CM.
   Directed search plays two roles. First, the economy segments into markets
trading diﬀerent goods — as opposed to random search, where someone needing
a haircut has the same chance of meeting a plumber or a barber. Second, each
market segments into submarkets based on posted terms of trade. In Appendix
A we take FOC’s for the submarket problem and rearrange to get
                         () 0 ()  () + [1 −  ()] 0 ()  ()
                   ∆ =                                                             (30)
                               () 0 () + [1 −  ()] 0 ()
The RHS, denoted  ( ) in (16) is again the same as Nash bargaining except
 () replaces ; diﬀerent from Section 3.1, instead of an exogenous limit , the
value of assets and hence the ability to pay are now endogenous.
   To proceed, subtract (28)-(29) and solve for
                                      +  () +   ()
                             ∆ =                                                   (31)
                                          +  + 
In equilibrium  = (̄ − ) determines ,  and  . A stationary monetary
equilibrium, or SME, is then a  equating the RHS’s of (30) and (31), with
 ∈ (0 ̄), where  (̄) =  (̄), as required for voluntary trade. Julien et al. (2008),
Julien et al. (2016) and He and Wright (2016) prove versions of these results:

Proposition 4 For  = 0 there is a unique SME; for   0 there is a unique
SME if  is small, possibly multiple SME if  is intermediate, and no SME if 
is big; for   0 there are multiple SME if || is small and no SME if || is big.

                                           31
   In addition to monetary equilibria, for  ≤ 0 there is a nonmonetary equilib-
rium where assets stop circulating and agents throw them away, because  ≤ 0
makes them poor stores of value, and if no one is posting   0 assets are useless
as a medium of exchange. They can also stop circulating when   0 is very
big, but now no one throws assets away, because they are always worth at least
their fundamental value, . Instead, buyers hoard them, although that is not
especially robust (as in Berentsen et al. 2002, assets can circulate for any   0,
with buyers getting  in exchange for a probability of handing over assets).
   Whenever assets circulate they are worth more than their fundamental value,
as is especially clear for   0 and  ≤ 0, where a poor savings vehicle is valued for
its liquidity — i.e., for its facilitation of transactions. Importantly, monetary and
nonmonetary equilibria can coexist and there can be multiple monetary equilibria:
if other sellers post higher , the asset is more valuable, so in the spirit of directed
search a given seller posts higher  to try to trade faster. Fundamentals still play
a role — e.g.,   0 if SME is unique — but this shows succinctly how liquidity
is at least partly a self-fulfilling prophecy. Moreover, there are equilibria where 
varies over time. Using standard methods He and Wright (2016) show the model
has a continuum of perfect-foresight equilibria starting at diﬀerent 0  0, where
lim  = 0 or lim   0 depending on parameters, as well as sunspot equilibria
where  fluctuates stochastically.
   To emphasize the interplay between directed search and monetary economics,
consider the unique SME with  = 0, and the meeting technology commonly
used in this literature, with ̄ = 1 and  =  (1 − ). Then  = 12 is
good for trade on the extensive margin, since it maximizes the number of buyer-
seller meetings, but it does less well on the intensive margin, since one can check
 = 12 implies    ∗ . Trejos and Wright (1995) show    ∗ at  = 12, and
argue that this is a salient feature of monetary exchange, using Nash bargaining
under the assumption  = 12. In competitive search equilibrium, the result
  ∗ at  = 12 follows with no need for any such assumption, because for


                                          32
this specification  () = 12 holds automatically at  = 12. Thus, we can
derive similar results with fewer restrictions.
       As another example of the connection between directed search and money
economics, one can check   0 in this model if 0  0 but not in general.
The intuition is similar to the discussion of  in Section 2.1 or  in
Section 3.1, on the way resources are allocated by the probabilities plus the terms
of trade, which is again missing in models with bargaining. As a final example,
concerning dynamics, bargaining models also have equilibria where  varies over
time, but one can argue that their microfoundations are shaky compared to ver-
sions with posting.24 Hence, for several reasons, it is useful to study monetary
economics using competitive search. For more discussion and results, see Julien
et al. (2008,2016) and He and Wright (2016).
       This is not to suggest that the microfoundations of monetary economics re-
quires competitive search. Indeed, search itself is not critical, even if it may
be natural for capturing the relevant frictions and generating new implications
(Wallace 2016). Search is not critical in the sense that many results hold with the
                              ©             ª
meeting technology  = min  ̄ −  , which lets agents on the short side
of the market always trade, which with  = ̄2 implies all agents trade. Still,
monetary models with competitive search are important in the development of
the literature, as early work in the area was criticized sharply by those who find
random matching and bargaining unpalatable (recall the comments by Howitt
and Prescott in the Introduction). That critique is misguided, given most in-
sights carry over, and many become sharper, with directed search and posting.25
  24
     In brief, there is a problem in nonstationary equilibrium with the usual demonstration
(Binmore et al. 1986; Binmore 1987) that Nash bargaining is the limit of strategic bargaining.
Indeed, Coles and Wright (1998) argue that using Nash out of steady state with nonlinear
utility is tantamount to having agents bargain myopically. Posting avoids this critique entirely.
  25
     A few results change in interesting ways. With random matching, e.g., in Kiyotaki and
Wright (1989) there can be equilibria where inferior assets are used as money, which they call
“speculative” behavior. Corbae et al. (2003) replace random with directed search and show the
unique equilibrium in a certain class uses only the best assets as money. That is interesting
because it shows “speculation” requires some randomness in the meeting process, but that
hardly invalidates the basic insights and methods.

4.2       Divisible Assets

We now let agents hold any  ∈ R+ and bring back the frictionless CM that
convenes after each round of DM trade. One reason to have the CM is that
it harnesses the distribution of , which is otherwise complicated. Another is
that the CM allows one to incorporate many elements of mainstream macro in
search-based models, including standard capital and labor markets. Yet another
is that we do not have to say whether agents are buyers or sellers depending on
their current , as in Section 4.1; instead we can have some called buyers that
always want to consume but cannot produce in the DM, while others called sellers
produce but do not consume. This is not a nonstarter with only DM trade — why
would sellers work to get money if they never get to spend it? Here they work
for money in the DM to spend in the CM, exactly as in Section 3.1. See Nosal
and Rocheteau (2011), Lagos et al. (2016) and references therein for more on this
and additional motivation for adopting the alternating CM-DM structure.
       Focusing on  = 0 (fiat currency), we write buyers’ CM problem as

        () = max { () −  + +1 (̂)} st  =  +  ( − ̂) −                  (32)
                 ̂


where  is cash brought in, ̂ is cash taken out,  is its price in terms of numeraire
, and  is a lump sum tax. Other than keeping track of time with the subscript
on +1 (̂), (32) is like (11) with one exception: there buyers get DM goods on
credit due in the next CM; here this is infeasible because of standard issues with
commitment and information, so buyers must use assets as payment instruments.
Still, as in Section 3.1, 0 () =  and similarly for sellers, making CM payoﬀs
linear. Sellers do not bring cash to the DM, but buyers might, and their FOC
                     0
for ̂  0 is  = +1 (̂). Since  does not appear in this FOC, the ̂ they
take out does not depend on what they bring in to the CM.26
  26
     This history independence, which makes the DM distribution of ̂ across buyers degenerate,
follows from quasilinear utility and the interiority of , but both can be relaxed as discussed
in fn. 13. The distribution is not degenerate in the closely related models of Galenianos and
Kircher (2008) and Dutu et al. (2012), but is still tractable due to history independence.



                                              34
   In the current CM, (+1  +1  +1 ) is posted for the next DM, where +1 is
the real value of the monetary payment. Since cash is a poor savings vehicle,
buyers hold just enough so that +1 ̂ = +1 . Once again, it may seem natural to
have sellers post and buyers search, but it is equivalent to assume the opposite.
Ignoring the constants  (0) and  (0), as we did in (15), as well as the time
subscripts, because now they are all the same, after some algebra we have
                       ½                       ¾
                          ()
             = max           [ () − ] −  st  () [ −  ()] =  (33)
                      
where  is a nominal interest rate. This nominal rate is defined by the Fisher
equation, 1 +  = +1 , describing the return you would need in the next
CM to give up a dollar in this CM. As is standard, in stationary equilibrium
 is constant, so the growth rate of the aggregate money supply pins down
inflation, +1 = +1 . This plus the Fisher equation imply it is equivalent
for monetary policy to peg the money growth, inflation or nominal interest rate.
   Problem (33) is the same as (15) but for this important detail: buyers now
must make an ex ante investment in liquidity, at cost +1 , before going to the
DM. Taking the FOC for , we get

                                   () =  ()                              (34)

where  () ≡ [0 () − 0 ()] 0 (). Often  () is called the liquidity premium;
it is also the Lagrange multiplier on the constraint  ≤ ̂. Whatever we call it,
(34) equates  () to the marginal cost of liquidity , multiplied by the expected
time until it is used, the inverse of the arrival rate  =  () . The FOC for
 yields
                                               
                       () [1 −  ()] =    +        +  ()                 (35)
                                               ()
and the constraint yields  =  ( ), where  is as before. With no entry,  = ,
(34) determines  and (35) determines  . With entry by sellers,  =  , and
(34)-(35) determine ( ) jointly.
   By way of comparison, consider the planner’s problem with entry by sellers,
                          ½                            ¾
                             ()                   
                     max          [ () −  ()] −      .
                                                

                                            35
The FOC’s are

                               0 () = 0 ()                                           (36)

                                   =  () [1 −  ()]                                (37)

Clearly, (36) implies  =  ∗ . From (34) this is the same as equilibrium iﬀ  = 0, the
Friedman rule for eliminating the cost of liquidity and making money equivalent
to perfect credit. Then (37) determines  = ∗ , and from (35) this is the same
as equilibrium at  = 0. Competitive search delivers the first-best at  = 0.
       Next, consider generalized Nash bargaining. This implies  =  ( ) with 
instead of , plus
                               0 () −  ( )
                               =                                                         (38)
                          ()         ( )
                                  () (1 − ) [ () −  ()]
                             =                                                        (39)
                                    0 () + (1 − ) 0 ()
Now (38) is the same as (34) when  = 1, and then it the same as (36) iﬀ  = 0.
Intuitively, for buyers to make the eﬃcient ex ante investment in liquidity, they
need all the bargaining power in the DM; otherwise,    ∗ with Nash bargaining
even at  = 0. But for sellers to make the eﬃcient ex ante entry decision they
need  =  (), since that makes (39) the same as (37). This situation, described
as “Friedman Meets Hosios” in Berentsen et al. (2007), presents a dilemma: it is
not generally possible to have  =  () and  = 1. So even at  = 0 we cannot
get ( ∗  ∗ ) with Nash bargaining due to this double holdup problem.27
       In contrast, in competitive search equilibrium  = 0 does achieve  =  ∗ and
 = ∗ , so we get eﬃciency on both the intensive and extensive margin. As
in Section 4.1, this suggests that money is intimately related to directed search,
since that allows us to achieve eﬃciency with the two-sided investments that
  27
    Other solution concepts can do better than Nash bargaining. Aruoba et al. (2007) show
 =  ∗ at  = 0 ∀  0 under Kalai bargaining. Hu et al. (2009) and Gu and Wright (2016) can
get  =  ∗ when  is not too small even at   0 under more complicated mechanisms, but here
we are taking bargaining as a primitive and not doing mechanism design. Also, since    ∗ at
 = 0 with Nash bargaining and   1, it might seem   0 is desirable — but unfortunately
monetary equilibrium does not exist for   0. This is a New Monetarist version of the “zero
lower bound problem” currently in vogue among New Keynesians.

are natural in this application. With or without entry, the model makes a host
of interesting predictions. If  =  is fixed, one can show   0 and
  0, while the eﬀects on  are complicated but at least with 0 not too
big (e.g., with Cobb-Douglas) one can show   0 and   0. Things
are more complicated when sellers enter endogenously, but let us suppose that
the SOC’s hold, which is necessarily true when  is not too big. Then one can
show   0,   0. And at least with 0 not too big,   0,
  0,   0 but  is ambiguous.28
       This is the canonical model of a monetary economy with competitive search.
An early application is Lagos and Rocheteau (2005). They fix  = , but
introduce endogenous search eﬀort by buyers to try to capture the “hot potato”
eﬀect of inflation, which says buyers spend money faster when  is higher. As
they show, this eﬀect does not emerge with bargaining. The reason is that  is
eﬀectively a tax on DM activity, making buyers bring less money in real terms,
which lowers the gains from trade and leads to less search eﬀort; hence they end
up spending their money slower rather than faster. With competitive search,
however, even though higher  lowers the total DM surplus, it can shift the terms
of trade in favor of buyers at least for low , which leads to more search eﬀort and
thus recovers the “hot potato” eﬀect. See Liu et al. (2011) and references therein
for more discussion and alternative ways to generate this eﬀect.
       In another early application, Rocheteau and Wright (2005) compare the eﬀects
of inflation in three models: competitive search, Nash bargaining, and Walrasian
pricing. We saw above how competitive search delivers ( ∗  ∗ ) at  = 0, while
generalized Nash does not, unless  = 1; one can also show Walrasian pricing may
not deliver eﬃciency in economies with search. Rocheteau and Wright (2009)
calibrate all three models to measure the welfare cost of inflation. With random
search and bargaining, this cost can be large compared to findings in an earlier
literature using money-in-utility or cash-in-advance models: in Lagos and Wright
  28
    See Rocheteau et al. (2016, Appendix C) for formulae for these eﬀects, and for a more
detailed analyze of the case where  = min {   }, which of course delivers cleaner results.


                                              37
(2005), going from 10% inflation to the optimal policy is worth around 50%
of consumption, compared to around 05% in Lucas (2000). With competitive
search, the number is around 1%, as can be understood from the result that it
delivers (∗  ∗ ) at  = 0, so a small inflation has only a second-order impact, by
the envelope theorem. Nash bargaining with   1 calibrated to match markup
data does not deliver ( ∗  ∗ ) at  = 0, which is a key to the 50% result.
       Bethune et al. (2016) pursue the issue using semi-directed search as developed
by Lester (2011). By this we mean posting and directed search apply to informed
buyers, called locals, while random search and bargaining apply to uninformed
buyers, called tourists. In equilibrium some sellers, called local shops, cater to the
informed by posting favorable terms, while others, called tourist shops, serve only
the uninformed at less favorable terms. With the fraction of informed buyers,
and other parameters, disciplined by data, including markup and price dispersion
data, the authors find a low cost of inflation, close to pure competitive search,
despite having only about 14 of buyers informed. However, they also find that
the information distortion is inoperative when this fraction is just over 12, since
then all tourist shops are driven out of business, making 14 not so low. Moreover,
they show that a little inflation can be desirable, as it relatively heavily taxes the
more expensive and less eﬃcient tourist shops.
       In other work, Dong (2010) allows inflation to aﬀect the variety of goods sellers
have for sale. Buyers direct their search to sellers posting attractive terms, but
do not know if a seller will have a variety that suits their tastes until they show
up. Inflation reduces variety in equilibrum. Quantitatively, with this eﬀect,
the cost of inflation close to 1% using competitive search, and 5% to 8% using
bargaining. This research, and several related papers, underscore the importance
for quantitative work of carefully modeling the microfoundations of information,
specialization and price formation.29
  29
    In a directed search model with private information about buyers’ types, Ennis (2008) finds
large eﬀects of inflation on welfare (6% to 7%). Faig and Jerez (2006), in a version of Faig and
Jerez (2007) with private information, show competitive search is eﬃcient at  = 0, but at   0
buyers buy too little of a good they like a lot and too much of a good they like less. See also


                                              38
    Faig and Huangfu (2007) analyze an environment where it matters who posts
the terms of trade, and not for the reasons discussed below in Section 5. Suppose
market makers post terms for their submarkets, to attract buyers and sellers, as
in Section 3.1. Recognizing that carrying currency is costly, given   0, a shrewd
market maker proposes the following scheme: All buyers pay  when they enter
his submarket; if a buyer meets a seller he gets the goods for free; then all sellers
collect  when they exit at the close of the DM. This allows agents to share in
the cost of liquidity by eliminating cash in the hands of buyers who do not meet
sellers, with market makers acting somewhat like the bankers in Berentsen et
al. (2007). As usual, one can concoct assumptions to rule out such arrangements
— perhaps market makers cannot tell who is a buyer and who is a seller — but this
is a nice example of how microstructure matters.
    Dong (2011) revisits Rocheteau et al. (2008), which is like the above model
except quasilinearity is replaced by indivisible labor,  ∈ {0 1}. Following Roger-
son (1998), agents in the CM trade  using lotteries, getting wages in exchange
for probabilities of working. As should be well known, with lotteries, given any
utility function agents act as if they are quasilinear, so ̂ is still degenerate.
Lotteries also entail unemployment, and Rocheteau et al. (2007) derive a long-
run Phillips curve fully exploitable by policy. Intuitively, inflation lowers  in the
DM, that raises (lowers)  in the CM if the goods are substitutes (complements),
and employment comoves with . But they can only prove it for  = 1, which
preclude any ex ante investment by sellers. Dong (2011) replaces bargaining with
competitive search, and proves the result with no such restriction. As in Section
4.1, competitive search allows one to get more with less.
    In terms of substance, however, these models predicts  = 0 is optimal even
when   0 leads to lower unemployment. In related work on Phillips curve
correlations, Huangfu (2009) has private information about monetary shocks.
Dong and Jiang (2014). In a model that is similar, but with indivisible goods, Carbonari et
al. (2017) get the optimal   0. We do not go into more detail here because private information
entails complications (discussed in Section 7).



                                              39
When there is a positive shock observed only by buyers, they have an incentive
to misrepresent the information to get better terms. To induce truth telling,
sellers oﬀer more output when money growth is high, and so output increases
with monetary shocks. This contrasts with a Walrasian version of her model,
where nominal shocks have no real eﬀects. However, again, just because output
goes up with money growth, that does not mean it is a desirable.
   Also pertaining to policy, this time open market operations and quantita-
tive easing, Rocheteau et al. (2016) use directed search to study economies with
currency and liquid bonds. Equilibrium features some submarkets where sellers
accept only cash, and others where they accept both assets. Acceptability is
endogenized using information theory as in Lester et al. (2012): when bonds are
counterfeitable and costly to authenticate, only some sellers make the requisite
investment. In contrast with much of the literature on segmented asset markets
based on cash-in-advance and related constraints (see Chiu 2014 for a recent ex-
ample and primary references), buyers voluntarily visit venders that only take
cash, even if using cash is expensive relative to bonds. The reason is that market
tightness endogenously lets them trade faster with cash. This leads to heteroge-
neous portfolios as choices, not restrictions, and generates novel insights into the
eﬀects of monetary policy. Competitive search is ideal for this application.
   Han et al. (2016) consider divisible assets and indivisible DM goods, as op-
posed to Section 4.1, with indivisible assets and divisible goods. This is worth
studying with posting because bargaining in this environment entails extreme
results: buyers bring just enough cash to the DM to compensate sellers for their
cost, and hence capture the entire surplus, irrespective of bargaining power— ef-
fectively, buyers commit to not paying more than sellers’ reservation price by
only bringing that much. Again this precludes any ex ante investment by sell-
ers, including entry. Directed search gets around the problem, because posting
by sellers gives buyers the incentive to bring the right amount of money, with
competition across sellers leading to an eﬃcient split of the surplus.


                                        40
    Menzio et al. (2013) provide an alternative approach that does not have a
CM and hence has a nondegenerate distribution, yet is still tractable due to
block recursivity. Buyers select into submarkets as follows: those with more ̂
prefer to higher  and  so they can trade sooner rather than later; those with
less ̂ prefer lower  and  even if it takes a little longer. Submarkets cater to
their desires by having diﬀerent tightness, with sellers indiﬀerent between them.
Since equilibrium separates buyers with diﬀerent ̂, their choices are independent
of the distribution across individuals, as is tightness in the various submarkets,
due to free entry by sellers. They prove that a unique monetary steady state
exists, and characterize the ̂ distribution. While this has not yet achieved the
popularity of the alternating CM-DM framework, it has some advantages, and
Sun and Zhou (2016) integrate elements of both approaches. In any case, this
further speaks to the usefulness of competitive search in monetary economics.


5     Finite Markets
Directed search theory with finite numbers of agents playing a well-defined game is
developed in a series of papers by Peters (1984,1991,1997,2000). The presentation
here follows Julien et al. (2000) and Burdett et al. (2001). We begin with a market
with  = 2 buyers and  = 2 sellers, then generalize this and describe what
happens in the limit as  and  grow.

5.1    The 2 × 2 Market

Consider a market with 2 buyers and 2 sellers. Each seller can produce and each
buyer wants to consume 1 unit of indivisible good , with the latter paying the
former  using a divisible good  that enters payoﬀs linearly (again this amounts
transferable utility, which, we hope, no one will confuse with money after having
read Section 4). The game proceeds as follows: first sellers post prices; then given
p = (1  2 ), buyers decide where to go. If both buyers visit the same seller, one
is chosen at random to get the good. Payoﬀs for buyers and sellers that trade are

                                        41
 −  and  − , and we impose  ∈ [ ] without loss of generality. The strategy
of buyer 1 is  1 , the probability he goes to seller , and similarly for buyer 2.
   Given buyer 2’s strategy, payoﬀs for buyer 1 from visiting sellers 1 and 2 are
                                 ³             ´
                        11 =    1 −  21 + 21 ( − 1 )                              (40)
                                 µ             2 ¶
                                          1 −  21
                        12   =    21 +          ( − 2 )                          (41)
                                             2

In words, (40) says that at seller 1 buyer 1 gets served for sure if buyer 2 goes to
seller 2, which happens with probability 1 −  21 , and gets served with probability
12 if buyer 2 goes to seller 1, which happens with probability  21 . Given p, it
is easy to check the best response of buyer 1 is
                                 ⎧
                                 ⎨ 0      if  21  Γ(p)
                           11 =   [0 1] if  21 = Γ(p)                               (42)
                                 ⎩
                                     1    if  21  Γ(p)

where Γ(p) ≡ ( + 2 − 21 )  (2 − 1 − 2 ).
   For any p, equilibrium in the stage 2 game between buyers is:

   1. If 1 ≥ ( + 2 )2 then ( 11   21 ) = (0 0) (both buyers go to seller 2).

   2. If 1 ≤ 22 −  then ( 11   21 ) = (1 1) (both buyers go to seller 1).

   3. If ( + 2 )2    22 −  there are three possible equilibria:

         • ( 11   21 ) = (0 1) (buyer 1 goes to seller 2, buyer 2 goes to seller 1);

         • ( 11   21 ) = (1 0) (buyer 1 goes to seller 1, buyer 2 goes to seller 2);

         •  11 =  21 = Γ(1  2 ) (buyers play symmetric mixed strategies).

Using this, and taking 2 as given, we can write the payoﬀ for seller 1 at stage 1
as a function of 1 as follows:

   1. If 1 ≥ ( + 2 )2 then 1 = 0 (seller 1 gets no buyers).

   2. If 1 ≤ 22 −  then 1 = 1 −  (seller 1 gets both buyers).

                                           42
   3. If ( + 2 )2    22 −  then two things can happen:

            • a pure-strategy equilibria with 1 = 1 − ;

            • a mixed-strategy equilibrium with 1 = [1 − (1 − )2 ] (1 − ), where
               = Γ(1  2 ), or, after simplification,

                                       3( − 2 )( − 21 + 2 )(1 − )
                               1 =                                                       (43)
                                               (2 − 1 − 2 )2

       Now the set of equilibria in pricing can be described as follows: One possibility
is 1 = 2 = ,  11 = 1 and  21 = 0 (for sure buyer 1 goes to seller 1 and buyer
2 goes to seller 2), which is an equilibrium since buyers can do no better at this
p, and sellers can never do better than this. Symmetrically, 1 = 2 = ,  11 = 0
and  21 = 1 is an equilibrium. Burdett et al. (2001) show there are also many
asymmetric equilibria supported by triggers.30 Rather than dwelling on these,
we focus on symmetric mixed-strategy equilibria, as in much of the literature, .
This can be motivated by arguing pure strategies rely on a lot of coordination,
which may be reasonable in a 2 × 2 market, but is less so in large markets (see
Bland and Loertscher 2012 or Norman 2016 for more discussion).
       Therefore, consider non-coordinated equilibria where buyers mix at stage 2.
From the above discussion, this requires ( + 2 )2  1  22 − , shown as the
unshaded region in Fig. 4. In this region, choosing 1 to maximize 1 leads to

                               2(2 − 2 ) + ( − 2 )(2 + 2)
                          1 =                                                             (44)
                                    5( − 2 ) + 2( − )
  30
    Here is the idea: Pick any p such that it is an equilibirum for buyer 1 to go to seller 1 and
buyer 2 to go to seller 2 for sure. If any seller deviates, buyers play the following equilibrium
at stage 2: if 1 ≥ ( + 2 )2 both go to seller 2; if 1 ≤ 22 −  both go to seller 1; and if
( + 2 )2    22 −  they play the mixed equilibrium. Burdett et al. (2001) characterize
the set P such that p ∈ P allows no profitable deviation. Intuitively, there is no profitable
deviation that makes both buyers go to the same seller at stage 2, and it is not easy to find a
profitable deviation that leads to a mixed equilibrium at stage 2, because sellers do poorly in
mixed equilibria, due to the chance that no one shows up. For any p such that profits are not
too low, no seller wants to deviate and trigger mixing at stage 2. Relatedly, Camera and Kim
(2016) consider an infinitely-repeated version of the model, and get multiplicity using trigger
strategies as in standard repeated game theory.




                                               43
             Figure 4: Best-response in price posting in the 2 × 2 Market

(this looks diﬀerent from Burdett et al. 2001 because we do not normalize  = 1
and  = 0). Now (44) defines seller 1’s best response 1 = (2 ), and symmetri-
cally 2 = (1 ) for seller 2. As Fig. 4 shows, there is a unique stage 1 equilibrium
in the class under consideration, 1 = 2 = ( + )2. Then the unique stage 2
equilibrium has  11 =  12 = 12, which means buyers pick sellers at random.31
       In this equilibrium, half the time 2 buyers visit the same seller, meaning
1 buyer and 1 seller do not trade. This is friction as defined by Lagos (2000):
simultaneously some buyers do not get served and some sellers have no customers.
In fact,  = 32 is the expected number of trades, which is ineﬃcient in the sense
that  = 2 is physically feasible. Yet in another sense it is fairly good. Suppose
both buyers go to seller 1 with arbitrary probability . Then the chance they
both go to the same seller is  2 + (1 − )2 , which is minimized at  = 12. Also,
while the total expected surplus is not maximized, buyers like this equilibrium
because  =  = 3( + )8, while they get  = 0 in pure-strategy equilibrium
with 1 = 2 = . We summarize these results as follows:
  31
     Although buyers pick sellers randomly in equilibrium, the fact that search can be directed
oﬀ the equilibrium path of course disciplines prices on the equilibrium path. This is similar to,
e.g., the threat of rejection disciplining oﬀers, or the threat of default disciplining lending, on
the equilibrium path, in bargaining and in credit arrangements, respectively.


                                                44
Proposition 5 In the 2 × 2 market there exists a unique non-coordinated equi-
librium, which is  = ( + )2 and   = 12. The expected number of trades is
 = 32 and the individual trading probabilities are  =  = 34.

   In addition to posting, Julien et al. (2000) consider auctions: if 1 buyer shows
up he pays the posted price; and if 2 show up they bid, resulting in the Bertrand
price ̄ = . One can think of sellers posting a reserve price, denoted  below.
Given this, the analogs of (40) and (41) are

                             11 = (1 −  21 ) ( − 1 )

                             12 =  21 ( − 2 ) 

because a buyer gets 0 surplus unless he is the only one visiting a seller. A mixed-
strategy equilibrium at stage 2 entails  11 =  21 = ( − 1 ) (2 − 1 − 2 ). Then
one can check sellers have a dominant strategy,  = ( + )2. So in equilibrium,
the reserve price is same as the posted price in the benchmark model. However,
profit is higher:  = ( + )2 with auctions and  = 3( + )8 with posting.
   Coles and Eeckhout (2003) integrate the approaches by letting sellers post 
contingent on the number of buyers that show up, say  ( for queue length).
This nests pure posting with 1 = 2 , and auctions with 2 = ̄ =  and 1 = .
One can make assumptions to preclude this — e.g., buyers do not observe  — but
suppose we allow it. Then there is an equilibrium with 1 = 2 = ( + )2, as in
the baseline model, but there are many others, all with 1 = ( + )2 and any
2 ∈ [ ]. They are not payoﬀ equivalent, and profit is highest with auctions. To
see why, note first that a seller is indiﬀerent to posting any pair (1  2 ) delivering
 to buyers, but not indiﬀerent to his rival’s posting. Suppose, e.g., he lowers
his  to increase the probability customers come to him. That decreases the
probability they go to his rival, so if they go to his rival they are more likely to
get 1 and less likely to get 2 . Ergo, stealing business is harder and as a result
profit is higher when sellers post 1  2 rather than 1 = 2 .
   An exceptional case is the Coles-Eeckhout equilibrium where 2 =  is at

                                           45
its minimum value. In this equilibrium a buyer gets the same expected payoﬀ,
( − ) 2, whether or not the other one shows up, with the expectation taken
before it is determined who gets the good if both show up. Hence, a seller’s
deviation does not aﬀect buyers’ expected payoﬀs when they visit his rival, and
the strategic eﬀect in the previous paragraph is inoperative — so one might say
the market utility approach is valid. We say more on this in Section 5.3, after
generalizing the environment to allow any numbers of buyers and sellers.
   But first we mention a way around the Coles-Eeckhout indeterminacy, due to
Dutu et al. (2011), in monetary economies. They show there is an equilibrium
with 1 = ( + )2 and any 2 ∈ [ ] at  = 0. By continuity, for   0
there is an equilibrium with 1 close to ( + )2, but more care is needed to
determine 2 , as buyers must decide in the CM how much ̂ to bring to the DM.
Consider equilibrium where some bring ̂ = 1 and others ̂ = 2 , and they
are indiﬀerent, taking into account the cost ̂. This provides an additional
equilibrium condition to pin down 2 . Hence, the indeterminacy in Coles and
Eeckhout vanishes in a monetary economy — although, as usual, the introduction
of monetary considerations can engender other types of multiplicity, for diﬀerent
reasons. Again, directed search and monetary economics are intimately related.

5.2     The  ×  Market

Consider any integer numbers of buyers and sellers,  and  . A pure price
posting strategy for seller  is  ∈ [ ], and we let p = (1   ). A search
                             ¡               ¢
strategy for buyer  is γ  =  1    , with   the probability he visits seller ,
and we let γ = (γ 1  γ  ). An equilibrium is a (p γ) such that no one wants to
deviate, and a symmetric equilibrium is one with  =  and   = 1 . To check
for equilibrium we need to know what happens after a seller deviates. Starting at
a symmetric p = ( ), suppose some seller, say  = 1, deviates to 1 so that
p = (1  p−1 ). We now check if this is profitable, given buyers play a symmetric
equilibrium after the deviation.


                                             46
    Let the probability any buyer visits seller 1 after his deviation be  1 =
 1 (1  p−1 ). A symmetric subgame-perfect equilibrium is described by  and
 1 (1  p−1 ) satisfying the following conditions: (a) 1 =  maximizes 1 (1  p−1 );
(b)  ∗1 (1  p−1 ) constitutes an equilibrium in the subgame for any 1 and p−1 =
( ); and (c) on the equilibrium path   = 1 , while after a deviation buy-
ers go to seller 1 with probability  1 =  1 (1  p−1 ) and all other sellers with

Proposition 6 In an  ×  market, let  =   and  = 1 − 1 . Then
there exists a unique non-coordinated equilibrium, and in this equilibrium every
seller sets

while every buyer visits each seller with probability 1 . The expected number of
trades is
                                = (   ) =  (1 −   )                     (46)

Proof: Start at p = (  ), let seller 1 deviate, and consider symmetric
equilibria where  1 =  1 (1  p−1 ). Let the probability that at least one buyer
visits seller 1 be 1 = 1 (1  p−1 ). Since he gets no customers with probability
(1 −  1 ) , clearly,
                                   1 = 1 − (1 −  1 )                           (47)

Let the probability a buyer trades if he visits seller 1 be 1 = 1 (1  p−1 ).
Notice   1 1 = 1 , as the LHS is the expected number of buyers who get
served by seller 1 and the RHS is his expected number of sales. This and (47)
imply
                                         1 − (1 −  1 )
                                   1 =                                            (48)
                                                1
    Now the profit of the deviant seller is

Also, the payoﬀ to a buyer visiting seller  6= 1 is

   In a symmetric mixed equilibrium in the subgame, buyers are indiﬀerent be-
tween visiting any seller, which means  1 satisfies

Over the range  1 ∈ (0 1), we can derive  1 1 and insert it into (52), then
simplify using 1 =  and  1 = 1 to verify that a deviation is not profitable iﬀ
 solves (45). Hence there is a unique symmetric equilibrium where buyers mix.
Galenianos and Kircher (2012) prove there are no asymmetric equilibrium where
buyers mix and sellers use pure strategies. All that remains is to show  satisfies
(46), but that follows directly from (47) and (48) with  1 = 1 . ¥
   Several remarks are in order. First, (45) endogenously gives  as a weighted
average of  and , which might not be apparent from Burdett et al. (2001)
because they normalize  = 1 and  = 0. In fact, the weight on  is the probability
a seller gets at least 2 buyers, and the weight on  is probability he gets just 1.
Second, as in the 2 × 2 game, in equilibrium buyers visit sellers at random, but
the fact that search can be directed still disciplines prices. Third, notice that 
is a smooth function of  and  , which we think is nice. To say why, let 
be large, and note that as  goes from  − 1 to  + 1 frictionless equilibrium
theory predicts  jumps from  to . As shown in Fig. 5, with competitive search
the discrete jump gets smoothed out by the frictions, which is one reason Peters
(1984,1991) and others advocate the approach in the first place.

                                            48
                          Figure 5: Price and market tightness

       Fourth, (46) endogenously gives (   ) as an urn-ball meeting technology,
used in economics at least since Butters (1977) and Hall (1979). The name reflects
the fact that the number of buyers up at a seller is binomially distributed, like
putting  balls in  urns in elementary probability theory, which converges to a
Poisson distribution as    → ∞ for fixed  =   , with − the probability
a seller gets no buyers.32 Also note that (   ) displays DRS for finite  and
 , but quickly converges to CRS as  and  grow. Finally, while we appeal
to Galenianos and Kircher (2012) to claim uniqueness with homogeneous sellers,
Kim and Camera (2014) extend this to heterogeneity. These papers also consider
more general meeting technologies, risk aversion and private information.
       Versions of the above results can be found in Peters (2000), Julien et al. (2000)
or Burdett et al. (2001). Using standard formulae, they also imply:

  32
    From this it should be evident that it can matter who posts and who searches in finite
markets, since throwing  balls into  urns is not the same as throwing  balls into 
urns (Kultti 2000; Halko et al. 2008). Indeed, it matters even when    → ∞, where (based
                                                                                         

   , and hence we generate more meetings when the short side posts and the long side
searches. They also show it does not matter when the matching function is symmetric in the
sense that the number of meetings  (   ) does not depend on who posts and who searches,
which is a maintained assumption in the baseline models. Delacroix and Shi (2016) also consider
asymmetric technologies and other generalizations.

   As they did for the 2 × 2 market, Julien et al. (2000) also consider auctions
in  ×  markets. They show that as    → ∞ the reserve price goes to
 = , and payoﬀs are the same as under posting (see Appendix D for details).
They also consider a dynamic labor market version, which generates steady state
unemployment and wage dispersion. Also, we mention that Julien et al. (2000)
and Burdett et al. (2001), with entry, equilibrium is not eﬃcient in the  × case,
because the reserve price is positive, and because the matching functioni exhibits
decreasing returns to scale for finite numbers. See Julien et al. (2005,2006b,2011)
for a discussion how this relates to eﬃciency in Mortensen (1982b).

5.3    Issues, Applications and Extensions

The above methods allows us to determine  without an exogenous bargaining
solution, and to determine  and  without an exogenous meeting technology.
While this is attractive, we keep an open mind. For the terms of trade, bargaining
better captures situations without commitment and hence with holdup problems.
For the trading probabilities, (55) is a special case of models where  and 
come from a general meeting technology, which is relevant empirically to the
extent that urn-ball functions can perform poorly when confronted with data
(Petrongolo and Pissarides 2001). There are trade-oﬀs, and diﬀerent approaches
may be appropriate in diﬀerent applications.
   Having said that, one clear advantage to finite numbers concerns oﬀ-equilibrium
beliefs: all we need is subgame perfection. With a continuum, however, things
gets tricky. Given a candidate equilibrium p, if one seller from a continuum de-
viates, what is the best response of buyers? If the deviator is measure 0 there is

                                         50
no response. The market utility approach skirts this issue in a way that is not
entirely satisfactory. As an alternative, Galenianos and Kircher (2009) posit a set
of artificial sellers with measure  that exogenously post every  in the relevant
range. They then properly evaluate deviation payoﬀs for   0, and focus on
equilibria that obtain when  → 0. This works, but is slightly cumbersome.
      An alternative going back to Montgomery (1991) is to use the market utility
approach in  ×  markets by solving

                           = max  ( − ) st  ( − ) =                          (56)
                                  


In (56),  is the probability a seller gets at least 1 buyer,  is the probability a
buyer visiting the seller gets served, and both depend on the probability buyers
visit the seller , as derived in Section 5.2. Eliminating  using the constraint
and taking the FOC with respect to , we get (1 − ) −1  =  . In symmetric
equilibrium, all sellers post the same  and  = 1 . Hence  =  −1 , where
as above  = 1 − 1 , and the constraint yields

                                 (1 −   −  −1 )  +   −1 
                           =                                                            (57)
                                              1 − 
      This is nice, but not quite right — in a 2×2 market, e.g., (45) gives  = (+)2
while (57) gives  = ( + 2) 3. To be fair, Montgomery solves the 2 × 2 model
correctly, and acknowledges it is a “short cut” in the general case to take  as
given after a seller deviates. The diﬀerence between (45) and (57) is the presence
of − −1 +  in the denominator of the former, so the Burdett et al. price is
higher than the Montgomery price, because it is less attractive for a seller to lower
his  when he recognizes this increases buyers’ utility. However, as    → ∞
holding  fixed, this consideration vanishes, so Montgomery’s approach gives the
right answer in large markets. In small markets, his approach can be misleading —
e.g., it yields eﬃciency in versions with entry or where sellers are heterogeneous,
but only because it neglects relevant strategic eﬀects.33
 33
      Galenianos et al. (2011) show the correct approach with heterogeneous sellers implies too


                                               51
    Galenianos et al. (2011) and Galenianos and Kircher (2012) propose a hybrid
approach, solving (56) with  =  (). This means sellers must oﬀer buyers
their market utility, but recognizes that it should be computed after a deviation.
Given a symmetric mixed equilibrium after the deviation, and using (51) and
̄ = (1 − )( − 1), we have
                                       ³           ´
                                              1−
                                    1 − 1 −  −1
                            () =      ³       ´     ( − ∗ )                            (58)
                                        1−
                                             −1


Solving (56) with this  , then imposing equilibrium, we get the  in (45), which
is correct for any (   ). Hence we get the right result for small markets, but
the method and notation are similar to the earlier analysis of large markets.
    Norman (2016) oﬀers another approach, based on population uncertainty (My-
erson 1998,2000). Suppose  and  are independently drawn from Poisson dis-
tributions, where sellers do not see the realization, while buyers see  and prices
when they choose search strategies. This justifies the usual focus on symmetric
equilibrium, where buyers use mixed strategies, since he shows any equilibrium
is payoﬀ equivalent to that (thus eliminating the other equilibria mentioned in
fn. 30). The Poisson assumption makes the model tractable. Also, this model be-
longs to a general class in which prices are strategic complements, which implies
there is a unique equilibrium if there is a unique symmetric equilibrium. As well,
as usual, as    → ∞ his outcome approaches our benchmark results. More
generally, Norman’s ostensibly minor change in the environment generates many
results in a tractable way, as should be useful in future applications.34
    On a less technical note, Burdett et al. (2001) consider two types of sellers
with diﬀerent capacity: 1 of them have 1 unit for sale; 2 have 2 units; and
much trade at high-cost sellers because the strategic eﬀects increase prices more at low-cost
sellers. Price ceilings (or minimum wages in a labor market) can restore eﬃciency.
  34
     He also generalizes Galenianos and Kircher (2012) and Kim and Camera (2014). First, he
shows sellers’ profit is strictly concave in the relevant range. Then he shows his reduced-form
game is supermodular under more general conditions than previous authors. This is useful
because supermodular games have a smallest and largest equilibrium, and the existence of pure
strategy equilibrium is simple. Because profit is strictly concave, mixed strategies by sellers are
ruled out. He also provides a simple test for uniqueness with symmetric sellers.

                                                52
 = 1 + 22 is the total quantity on the market. This implies a matching
function  (  1  2 ), which in general does not reduce to a function of only
(   ). Intuitively, the coordination friction is worse when there are more sellers
with 1 unit and fewer with 2, holding  constant. In a labor application, this
helps account for a changing Beveridge curve in the data, as the relationship
between unemployment and total vacancies depends shifts with the mix of big
and small employers. .Lester (2010) lets firms choose how many positions to
create, making the distribution of vacancies endogenous. He derives the matching
function and studies the implications of various shocks, depending on whether
job creation occurs via entry by new firms or expansion by existing firms.35
       In another application, Lester (2011) introduces semi-directed search: some
buyers, called locals, are informed and direct their search to sellers posting fa-
vorable terms; others, called tourists, are uninformed and search randomly. He
has free entry of sellers. In a large market, equilibrium features two types of
sellers: local shops post low prices to attract the informed; tourist shops exploit
the uninformed. In fact, there are at most two types of sellers, since if the frac-
tion of informed buyers is above a threshold, which is strictly below 1, no tourist
shops opens. Lester also analyzes markets with small numbers, but only under a
parameter restriction that guarantees no tourist shops open, so there is only one
price posted. Recently, Huang (2016) makes progress on relaxing this restriction,
at least for  = 2. He shows there is a unique equilibrium, and it involves sellers
randomizing over  in discrete infinite set {1  2  } ⊂ [ ].
       The setup is useful for studying changes in information. Lester (2011) shows
that increasing the fraction of informed buyers can increase or decrease prices,
depending on parameters. This is contrary to conventional wisdom, and to sev-
eral papers where prices fall when consumers are better informed (Salop and
Stiglitz; Varian 1980; Burdett and Judd 1983; Stahl 1989). However, Lester’s
result requires finite numbers: the fraction of informed buyers actually does not
  35
    See .Tan (2012), Li and Tain (2013), Kultti and Mauring (2014) and Godenhielm and Kultti
(2015) for more on this topic.


                                            53
aﬀect prices with a continuum. Gomis-Porqueras et al. (2015) pursue this when
the number of informed buyers is endogenized by costly advertising. They show
more information can raise prices even in large markets. Bethune et al. (2016)
also show more information can raise or lower prices in large markets in monetary
economies (see also Dong et al. 2016). Intuitively, if buyers’ bargaining power is
low at tourist shops, they get more from a marginal dollar at local shops. With
better information, the fraction of local shops rises, and in response buyers bring
more money, which allows sellers to raise prices.
       This is relevant because, as Ellison and Ellison (2005) say, “evidence from
the Internet... challenged the existing search models, because we did not see the
tremendous decrease in prices and price dispersion that many had predicted.”
Similarly, according to Baye et al. (2006), “Reductions in information costs over
the past century have neither reduced nor eliminated the levels of price dispersion
observed.” As the previous paragraph indicates, not all search models predict
prices fall with information. And it is even more obvious that price dispersion
need not fall with information: when the fraction of informed buyers is 0 or 1,
we are in a pure random or a pure directed search world, and both have no
dispersion; when the fraction is between 0 and 1 there is price dispersion; and so
it is obviously nonmonotone in information.
       Let us now return to Coles and Eeckhout (2003), by allowing sellers to post
 where  is the number of buyers that show up. As in the 2 × 2 market,
indeterminacy obtains.36 However, Selcuk (2012) perturbs the environment by
                                     ³ ´               ¡      ¢
having risk-averse buyers, so  = E  , where  =  −   is buyers’
surplus when  buyers show up. He shows that  00  0 eliminates the indeter-
minacy: there is a unique equilibrium, and it features  =  ∀. In particular,
  36
    Related to the discussion at the end of Section 5, there is one exceptional equilibrium where
buyers’ expected payoﬀ is independent of . Thus, a seller’s deviation does not aﬀect buyers’
expected payoﬀ at his rivals, so one might say the market utility approach is valid. Moreover,
if we add entry, e.g., it will be eﬃcient, even with finite numbers, because the strategic impact
of pricing is inoperative in this equilibrium.




                                               54
if  () =   with  ∈ (0 1), in a market with  =   all sellers post

Notice   0, and  →  as  → 0. Also notice that  = 1 implies  is the
same as (54). Risk aversion seems an important extension to many applications
of directed search, some of which are discussed further below.
   In fact, posting a contingent  is still restrictive — why can’t buyers make
or receive transfers even if they do not get served? Again, one might make
assumptions to preclude this, but suppose we allow it. As in Jacquet and Tan
(2012), for any mechanism in a general class, the outcome can be implemented by
having a buyer who gets the good pay  and having others that show up pay ,
which can be positive or negative. If  = − then buyers are fully insured: their
payoﬀ is the same whether or not they get served. Jacquet and Tan (2012) show
that when buyers are risk averse there is a unique equilibrium and it features full
insurance,  =  − . Thus one might say the market utility assumption holds,
and that this provides strategic foundation for the results in Montgomery (1991),
including his eﬃciency results (recall fn. 33).
   Returning to risk neutrality, Geromichalos (2012) explores several additional
extensions in  ×  markets. First, he gives sellers the capacity to each serve
up to  customers, and post mechanisms announcing the number they will serve,
which cannot exceed  but could be less. He also allows  to be contingent
on the queue of buyers that show up, and allows payments from those who get
served and those who do not. As in the previous paragraph, it suﬃces to consider
mechanisms where buyers that get served pay  while buyers that show up but
do not get served pay . He then shows that in a particular sense this does not
matter in large markets — it is payoﬀ equivalent to have sellers simply post one
price, as in the baseline model.
   To illustrate his methods, let us set capacity to  = 1. Then, as shown in

This pins down  = ( − ) (1 − − − − ), which is the same as the outcome
described in Proposition 6. Intuitively, any combination ( ) satisfying (59) is
payoﬀ equivalent to the outcome when each seller simply posts . However, this
needs to be reconciled with Virag (2011), who shows that for any market size, and
the same type of mechanism ( ), there is always an equilibrium where sellers
extract the entire surplus and market utility is 0. Hence, it is not true that all
equilibria converge to the limit in (59). The diﬀerence stems from the fact that
Geromichalos (2012) excludes the possibility of infinite : as Virag (2011) makes
clear, the convergence does apply if there is a bound on , in which case the limit
in (59) is valid.
   Geromichalos (2014) is a sequel on the Bertrand paradox — the idea that
duopoly models often have an equilibrium where price equals marginal cost (this
is a paradox because one might expect that to require many sellers). A poten-
tial resolution discussed in the literature involves capacity constraints: if a firm
cannot meet market demand, a rival charging more can still get customers. He
argues this is a special case of the idea that buyers’ payoﬀs might fall with realized
demand at a given location, and considers three examples: capacity constraints;
congestion eﬀects; and prices that depend on  as in Coles and Eeckhout (2003).
These all resolve the paradox by making buyers’ payoﬀs at a seller’s location fall
with the number that show up, so buyers may not all go to a seller just because
his  is lower. As Geromichalos says, while the related literature on industrial
organization typically specifies demand exogenously, directed search theory gen-
erates it endogenously as a function of strategic behavior, and is therefore ideal
for studying these issues.

6        Heterogeneity and Sorting
We now discuss in more depth heterogeneity on one or both sides of the market.
The presentation starts with an abstract formulation and definition of equilib-
rium, then covers specific applications from the literature.37

6.1       General Framework

Consider any two-sided market with heterogeneous agents: there are types 1 and
2 on each side of the market, with distributions 1 (1 ) and 2 (2 ) on supports
T1 and T2 . This encompasses buyers and sellers with heterogeneous valuations or
costs, workers and firms with heterogeneous productivity, and a general theory
of partnership formation when agents have heterogeneous attributes. The type
distributions are fixed for now, but can be determined by entry. Also, we focus
mainly on the case where types are drawn ex ante, before decisions are made,
but mention how to have types drawn after meeting counterparties.
       Each agent from side 1 posts a mechanism  ∈ S, which includes all informa-
tion side 2 sees. Thus, e.g., with pure price posting  =  and S = R+ , while
if side 1 also states his type then  = ( 1 ) and S = R+ × T1 , where for nota-
tional convenience he can state any 1 ∈ T1 , but when types are observable we
assign payoﬀ −∞ to lying. Richer mechanisms include auctions, where agents in
meetings have actions like bidding. In such cases, an action for side  is denoted
 ∈ A . We assume mechanisms can be ordered, and for side 1 let 1 ( 1  1 ) be
the mass of types weakly below 1 posting  or lower, and who play action 1 or
lower if matched. With a slight abuse of notation, let 1 () be the marginal, i.e.,
the mass posting  or lower. Similarly, distributions for side 2 indicate where they
direct their search and what they do if matched. Then the equilibrium concept is
based on the theory of large games (e.g., Mas-Collel 1984), where an individual’s
  37
     While some of this material is quite technical, at least relative to Sections 2-4, we think
it is important to be precise at this point. Also, we think it is best to see this framework
after the finite models in Section 5, which can be somewhat messy, but at lest they avoid some
measure-theoretic complications dealt with here.


                                              57
payoﬀ is determined by his behavior, and the distribution of others’ behavior
described here by 1 and 2 , but not on the behavior of any other particular
individual.
    As applied to competitive search by Eeckhout and Kircher (2010) and Peters
(2010), a key variable is tightness in the submarket with mechanism , determined
on the equilibrium path by the ratio of side 2 to side 1 agents in this submarket.
If a submarket attracts a mass of agents on both sides, this ratio is determined
in the obvious way. If one lets these masses shrink to have 0 measure, as is
often natural in applications, the limit is the Radon-Nikodym derivative, () =
2 ()1 ().38 Other keys variables are the set of types on side 1 posting any ,
and the set on side 2 searching for . Let  (   ; ) be the distribution of types
from side  playing action  in submarket . For the mechanisms that are posted
in equilibrium, this has to be consistent with the conditional of  (    ) on ,
and is almost everywhere uniquely determined by 1 and 2 , as is .39 However,
this does not determine  and  oﬀ the equilibrium path, as discussed below.
    In sum, in addition to his own type, an agent cares about these objects in
a submarket: the probability of trade; the distribution of types on the other
side; and payoﬀs within matches. These depend on: his choice of  and  ; the
expected number of other traders determined by ; and the distribution of types
and actions of other traders determined by . Consider type  from side  in a
submarket with mechanism , expecting tightness  and distribution . Denote
his probability of trade by ̃ (    ;  ), his payoﬀ in a pair  = (1  2 ) given
 = (1  2 ) by  (  ), and his payoﬀ from not trading by   (  ). His
   38                                                                                    0
R Technically the Radon-Nikodym derivative ensures that for any subset S ⊆ S the integral
         ()   1 () is the same as the associated     number    of side 2 agents searching for  ∈ S 0 ,
R∈S 0
 ∈S 0
         2 (). Whenever we have masses of agents on both sides, the Radon-Nikodym derivative
represents the ratio correctly. As it is never optimal for side 1 to post an  that attracts no one
from side 2, we can assume sup 1 () is a subset of sup 2 (), where sup  () is the support of
 , which is necessary for the Radon-Nikodym derivative to be well-defined.
   39
      Note that  (    ) can have a mass larger than 1 if there are more than a unit measure
of agents on side i. Let ̄ be the total mass of agents attempting to trade on side  Then
 (   ; ) has to be a distribution of  (    )̄ conditional on  While 2 might not be
almost everywhere determined if there is a positive measure of mechanisms that are not visited
by anyone, in this case the matching probability is zero and beliefs do not matter.


                                                    58
expected payoﬀ is then

  (    ;  ) = ̃ (    ;  )E (  ) + [1 − ̃ (    ;  )] E (  )
                                                                                                       (60)
where expectations are with respect to  on the other side of the market.
       As elsewhere in this survey, oﬀ-equilibrium is tied to the notion of subgame
perfection. Let the market utility (2 ) be the supremum of 2 ( 2  2 ;  ) over
 posted in equilibrium and actions 2 ∈  . We capture this notion by:

         Condition P: If ()  0 then the support of 2 (2  2 ; ) is non-empty
         and includes only (2  2 ) ∈ T2 × A2 st 2 ( 2  2 ;  ) = (2 ).

Thus, a positive number of side 2 agents can only be expected if those agents get
their market utility, and beliefs include only such agents. It is also convenient to
impose that beliefs exclude strictly-dominated combinations:40

         Condition B: The support of beliefs 1 does not allow combinations
         (1  1 ; ) such that (1  ) is strictly dominated for 1 whenever there
         is (01 ; ) that is not dominated for some 01 .

       Equilibrium is defined as a distribution of strategies — what to post and where
to search — plus tightness and type distributions in every submarket satisfying
the natural conditions. To make this precise, let sup  be the support of  , let
0 be a fictitious mechanism that yields zero utility, the outside option, and let
S0 = S∪{0 } be the set of mechanisms plus this option. Then we have:

Definition 1 Equilibrium is a list of functions h1  2   1  2  i such that:

   1. (maximization)  (    ;  ) ≥  (0  0   ;  ) ∀(    ) ∈ sup  and
         (0  0 )∈S0 × A ;
  40
     Even when there are large costs to lying, some restriction is necessary to ensure that agents
believe announcements oﬀ the equilibrium path, and excluding strictly dominated combinations
does the trick. Other standard refinements from signalling theory can also be used, although
we note in passing that signalling has not received that much attention in the directed search
literature.

                                                    59
   2. (consistency)  is consistent with the conditional distributions of 1 and 2 ,
      while  is consistent with their Radon-Nikodym derivative;

   3. (perfection) Conditions P and B hold;

   4. (feasibility) ∀T0 ⊆ T
                           Z                                    Z
                                           (    ) ≤          ( ),
                              S×A ×T0                         T0

      with = if max( )∈S×A  (    ;  )  0 for almost all  ∈ T0 

   To be clear, the first condition says that agents participate in submarkets that
maximize their payoﬀs given their beliefs. The second says beliefs are consistent
with these strategies. The third captures oﬀ-equilibrium behavior. The inequality
in the fourth says that the measure of agents in submarkets can never exceed their
measure in the population, but could be less if some agents abstain from trade
and take their outside options; if there are strictly positive returns, they do not
abstain, and this holds with equality.
   While the above definition does not incorporate entry, that can easily be
amended — e.g., with entry by side 1 at cost  (1 ), we replace their maximization
condition by 1 ( 1  1 ;  ) ≤ (1 ), with = if ( 1  1 ) ∈ sup 1 . Also, this
setup assumes types are drawn ex ante, but we can alternatively have side 2
draw their types after making search decisions. Consider 2 ( 2  2 ). If type
is realized after entering a submarket, its conditional 2 (2  2 |) must have a
marginal equal to the distribution of types 2 (2 )2 , where 2 is the total
mass of type 2. Among possible conditional distributions, consider the one that
maximizes the expectation of 2 ( 2  2 ;  ) over 2 and 2 , and let  be the
highest such expectation across . Then the analog to Condition P is this: for
 oﬀ the equilibrium path, 2 has to coincide with one of these maximizers, and
the maximal value equals market utility  if tightness is strictly positive. Also,
the maximization condition for side 2 is adjusted as follows: if  is in the support
of 2 () then E2 (2 2 |) 2 ( 2  2 ;  ) = , which says that on the equilibrium
path market utility is achievable.

                                                60
6.2       Sorting

Consider the case of a bilateral meeting technology and price posting, as in Sec-
tions 2-4, where types are known ex ante and observable, and a mechanism lists
a price, the type of agent 1 and the type of agent 2 he aims to attract.41 In our
general notation,  = ( 1  2 ) from set S = R+ × T1 × T2 . There are no actions
because in a meeting agents simply trade at the posted price. This is relatively
tractable since trading probabilities only depend on  and types are observed,
implying ̃1 [( ) 1  2 ;  ] = 1 () and ̃2 [( ) 1  2 ;  ] = 2 (), where
1 () =  () and 2 () =  () , as in the baseline model.
       Here trade yields a surplus (1  2 ) that depends on the types, while no
trade yields 0 utility. Let  (1  2 ) be the surplus of side , which allows private
valuations,  (1  2 ) =  . In this case, and, more generally, whenever one side’s
payoﬀs do not directly depend on the other side’s type, it is not actually necessary
for the mechanism to specify this type. Another interesting case is pure public
goods, 1 (1  2 ) = 2 (1  2 ) = (1 + 2 ) 2, where the absence of contractual type
specification can lead to adverse selection, as discussed below. Unless otherwise
noted, payoﬀs are increasing in type. Since side 2 ends up paying  to side 1,
and assuming transferable utility, the actual payoﬀ from trade for each side is
1 [( )  ] = 1 (1  2 ) +  and 2 [( )  ] = 2 (1  2 ) − .
       Again, assume for now that agents get utility −∞ from lying, to capture
observable types with our formalization. Then side 1 agents reveal their types
and are approached only by the desired types from side 2. Hence, we can treat
beliefs 1 and 2 as degenerate, and the expected transfer is simply the trading
  41
     Shi (2001) studies this for a specific matching function; our exposition follows the gen-
eralization in Eeckhout and Kircher (2010). Davoodalhosseini (2015) modifies Eckhout and
Kircher by introducing free entry and private information about side 2’s type, which aﬀects side
1’s payoﬀ. See also Jerez (2014) and Mortensen and Wright (2003), where the latter actually
studies a dynamic model, with endogenous flows into the market, but only considers additively
separable payoﬀs. The treatment mainly focuses on bilateral meetings and heterogeneity with
observable types. Less is known about the case of multilateral meetings, with a few exceptions,
like Shimer (2005), Julien et al. (2005) or Albrecht et al. (2014).

An announcement by type 1 maximizes (61) given that type 2 gets (2 ), his
market utility, where the endogenous variables are the type 2 of the counterparty,
the price , and tightness :
                                                   ()
                max () [1 (1  2 ) + ] st         [2 (1  2 ) − ] = (2 )

       Introducing a change of variable,  = 2 (1  2 ) − , we rewrite this as
                                                           ()

                         2                             
As in Shi (2001), side 1 gets the total surplus and compensates side 2 through a
transfer , further reducing the problem to

                                  max ()(1  2 ) −  (2 )                               (64)
                                   2

A diﬀerence from earlier applications is that 2 is now an argument of  (2 ).
Nevertheless, one can show  (2 ) is increasing, and hence diﬀerentiable almost
everywhere, so the solution is still described by the FOC’s.
       As a special case, consider first one-sided heterogeneity, where only agents on
side 2 diﬀer. Then 1 () = () = 2 and 2 () = 0, so that side 1 reaps all the
gains from trade, and compensation  in the transformed problem coincides with
the true transfer price.42 The FOC’s are then

                                     0 () − (2 ) = 0                                       (65)

                                     () −  0 (2 ) = 0                                     (66)

Each type 2 is associated with a (2 ) and  (2 ) solving these conditions, similar
to Section 3.1.
  42
    Since only the joint surplus () matters in (64) the analysis is unchanged under private
valuation, 1 (1  2 ) = 0 and 2 (1  2 ) = 2 , except  in this case does not correspond to the
actual price.

                                                  62
   To proceed, notice that (65) and (66) hold ∀2 , so we can diﬀerentiate the
former and use the result to eliminate  0 (2 ) from the latter, resulting in

                                             [(2 )](2 )
                              0 (2 ) = −                                      (67)
                                                ()2

with () and  () are the elasticity and the elasticity of substitution of the
matching function, respectively, as in the baseline model. This diﬀerential equa-
tion determines (2 ) up to a constant. Clearly 0 (2 )  0, so higher 2 select
into submarkets with lower tightness, and hence trade faster, as in Section 3.1,
but still the compensation  is higher under mild conditions on the matching
function, because side 1 collects all the surplus in the transformed problem but
rewards better partners with higher compensation and matching prospects.
   For a example with () =  , we can explicitly solve (2 ) = −
                                                                     2 up to the

constant   0. Adding entry, 1 = , we pin down  = 1 ,  (2 ), and the rest
of the variables in each submarket. Without entry,  comes from market clearing,
                             Z
                               (2 )−1 2 (2 ) = 1                     (68)

where the RHS is the number of agents on side 1, and the LHS integrates tightness
over side 2. Along with (67), this fully characterizes equilibrium. Given  = 2 −,
in this example, substitution of (65) into the constraint in (63) yields  = 2 .
Thus, each submarket satisfies the relevant version of the Hosios condition, and
this entails eﬃciency.
   With heterogeneity only on side 1 rather than side 2, as mentioned in Section
3.1, identical agents from side 2 have to be compensated for matching with diﬀer-
ent agents on side 1. Since again better types (now on side 1) are matched faster,
the agents they match with trade slower. So for side 2 higher compensation is
negatively related to the trading probability, the opposite of the previous case.
Intuitively, prices have two roles, managing heterogeneity and trading probabili-
ties. Hence, the relationship between the terms of trade and probability of trade
generally depends on the type of heterogeneity.


                                             63
      Two-sided heterogeneity makes this even more clear. When there are non-zero
continuous densities on both sides, the analysis remains tractable when it can be
compressed into a diﬀerential equation, as above, but the issue of who trades
with whom is more complicated. One concern in the literature is assortative
matching (see Chade et al. 2016 for a survey). In particular, when do we get
positive (negative) assortative matching, which means higher types on one side
match with higher (lower) types on the other?
      With two-sided heterogeneity, the FOC’s from problem (64) for type 1 are

                               0 ()(1  2 ) −  (2 ) = 0                    (69)

                            ()2 (1  2 ) −  0 (2 ) = 0                   (70)

where 2 is the partial derivative. Let ∗1 (2 ) indicate the type on side 1 that
matches with type 2 on side 2, and ∗ (2 ) the associated tightness, solving (69)-
(70). Positive sorting means ∗0 1 (2 )  0. The SOC’s reduce to
                                 ½                       ¾
                         ∗0         1 2       ∗

                                    1 2
Hence positive sorting obtains if the expression in braces is positive; one can also
show the converse is true (Eeckhout and Kircher 2010). If the total surplus dis-
plays CRS, (71) is especially tractable, and nicely illustrates a trade-oﬀ between
the elasticity of substitution in the surplus and the elasticity of substitution in
the matching function.
      Many standard market models (again Chade et al. 2016) imply positive sorting
under a condition known as supermodularity, 1 2 ≥ 0. In the present formu-
lation, (71) is stronger, because standard assumptions implies   0, as well as
 1  2  0. Indeed, if (1  2 ) = 1 + 2 , which is weakly supermodular, we
get negative sorting. Intuitively, this is because it does not matter for the surplus
who matches with whom, but higher types should match with a higher probabil-
ity, which requires a lower probability for the other side. The losses from reduced
matching prospects are minimized if the agents on the other side are low types.43
 43
      How much supermodularity is needed to overturn this eﬀect depends on the matching

                                            64
This holds if more potential partners increases one’s matching prospects, but
ceases to apply if the matching function approaches the inelastic limit,  → 0, in
which case the sorting condition (71) becomes standard.
    As Eeckhout and Kircher (2010) discuss, this characterization also holds
for finite numbers 1 and 2 of types on each side. Since each combination of
types trades in a diﬀerent submarket, in principle there could be up to 1 × 2
submarkets. Sorting reduces this complexity substantially, however, since only
adjacent types trade — i.e., if there is sorting, and 1 trades with both 2 and 02 ,
then all types 002 in between also trade only with 1 . This implies that there are
no more than 1 + 2 submarkets.
    With a continuum of types the system again reduces to a diﬀerential equation:
totally diﬀerentiating (69) and using (70), we get
                     ∙                                                      ¸

where ∗ and ∗1 are functions of 2 , generalizing (67) from the case of one-sided
heterogeneity. As in Shi (2001), feasibility implies

                               20 (2 ) = 10 [∗1 (2 )] ∗0      ∗
                                                            1 (2 ) (2 )                     (73)

where 10 and 20 are the type densities. The system (72)-(73) with positive
sorting has the end-point requirements that the highest agents are matched, and
either all the agents are matched or the last unmatched type obtains 0 payoﬀ.
Shi (2001) proves the planner’s problem yields the same results.
    The above sorting conditions can be discussed independent of prices. To see
how the transfer  varies by type, notice from (69) that the increase in side 2 payoﬀ
is the marginal contribution of another such agent to those on side 1, which is
the increase in matching probability times the payoﬀ. Jerez (2014) exploits this
to extend existence results from standard sorting theory. Also notice that the
constraint in (63) yields  ∗ (2 ). Thus,  ∗ (2 ) =  [∗ (2 )]  [∗1 (2 ) 2 ], similar to the
one-sided case, but depending on both types. Since  ∗ (2 ) = 2 [∗1 (2 ) 2 ]−∗ (2 ),
function — e.g., it requires root-supermodularity with urnball, and more with Cobb-Douglas.

                                                    65
this yields the price paid by 2 . It is elegant (or at least comforting) to see that
this reduces to the homogeneous-agent baseline with 1 = − and 2 = , in
which case ∗ (2 ) = ∗ = [1 − (∗ )]  + (∗ ).
    If the type distributions and matching function are symmetric and sorting is
positive, types pair up perfectly, and every submarket has ∗ (2 ) = 1. In this case
all agents trade with equal probability despite diﬀerent prices. While it may seem
desirable to match higher side 1 types at a higher rate, they are being paired with
higher side 2 types, and we do not want to lower their matching probabilities.
In general, the relationship between prices and probabilities can be complex.
Starting from symmetric type distributions, where all agents are matched at the
same rate, if we spread out types on one side it becomes more important to match
them with higher probability, and hence to match their potential partners with
lower probability. A interesting research agenda concerns links between outcomes
(prices, payoﬀs, etc.) and dispersion, or other properties of the distributions, on
both sides. See Chang (2014) and Mangin (2017) for applications, to asset and
labor markets, respectively.


7     Private Information
The next step is to consider private information about types, including workers
with better knowledge than their employers about their skills (or vice versa),
and sellers with better knowledge than buyers about their wares (or vice versa).
Directed search is a natural way to study these markets. We present this in two
parts, corresponding to match-specific and individual-specific (i.e., ex post and ex
ante) heterogeneity. Also, for now the focus is on bilateral meetings; multilateral
meetings are deferred to Section 8.

7.1    Match-Specific Models

There are several competitive search models in this first category: Faig and Jerez
(2005) study static goods markets where buyers have private information about

                                           66
their valuation of match-specific goods; Moen and Rosen (2011) study steady
state in labor markets where workers have private information about match qual-
ity and eﬀort; and Guerrieri (2008) analyzes dynamics in labor markets where
workers have private information about the match-specific disutility from work.
Among other issues, these studies ask if equilibrium is eﬃcient. In the baseline
models analyzed above, competitive search equilibria are typically constrained
eﬃcient, but it is less clear what happens under private information. Faig and
Jerez (2005) show in some settings that equilibrium is ineﬃcient. Guerrieri (2008)
shows it is eﬃcient in steady state but (generically) not in equilibrium when the
economy is not in steady state.44
       Consider match-specific private information in the simple goods market of
Section 2.1, where side 1 agents are sellers and side 2 buyers. Sellers are homoge-
nous, and can produce one unit at zero cost; buyers get utility 2 from the good,
randomly drawn and privately observed after matching. There is a continuous
distribution of buyer types 2 with density  (2 ), CDF  (2 ) and support T2 ,
and total mass normalized to 1. The mass 1 of sellers is endogenized by entry
at cost . Since all heterogeneity is on the seller side, we drop the subscript for
side 2 when there is no risk of confusion.
       Each seller decides on whether to enter the market and, if so, what contract
to post. Thanks to the revelation principle, without loss of generality, a contract
can be restricted to the set of incentive compatible, individually rational, direct
revelation mechanisms S. The action  required from the buyer is to report his
type. A contract  : T 7→ [0 1] × R+ specifies a menu of trading probabilities
() and transfers () for each matched buyer who reports utility type  ∈ T .
The probabilities () must be specified since in general lotteries may be used
— even after matching, trade may occur with probability  ()  1. Buyers ob-
serve posted contracts () = [() ()]∈T ∈ S and decide where to direct their
  44
    In related work, Guerrieri (2007) shows that introducing match-specific heterogeneity in the
labor market, with or without private information, does not help to amplify volatility relative
to a representative-agent benchmark.



                                              67
search; the set of sellers posting the same  and buyers searching for it consti-
tutes a submarket with tightness (). Given heterogeneity is match-specific, the
matching probabilities in each submarket are simply () and ().
       In a match, the buyer’s utility realization leads to a decision to trade or not.
Entry implies that equilibrium seller profits equal , while  is a buyers’ ex ante
market utility and (  ) his ad interim utility if he matches at , draws  and
reports ,
                                  (  ) = ()[ − ()]

A mechanism  ∈ S is incentive compatible and individually rational if45

                              (  ) ≥ (  ) ∀  ∈ T                               (74)

                              (  ) ≥ 0 ∀ ∈ T                                           (75)

       In this environment the equilibrium can be characterized by a value for buy-
ers’ market utility  , a set of posted mechanisms S  = S, and a tightness
function () defined on S, such that the following conditions are satisfied:
∀() = [() ()]∈T ∈ S we have:

   a) seller maximization and entry,
                                   Z
                           [()]   ()() () −  ≤ 0                                  (76)
                                              ∈T

         with equality if  ∈ S  ;

   b) buyer maximization,
                                          Z
                                [()]
                                                    ()[ − ()] () ≤                  (77)
                                ()      ∈T

         and () ≥ 0 with complementarity slackness, where
                                          Z
                                  [()]
                          = max              ()[ − ()] ()
                                 () ∈T
  45
     To link this to the definition of equilibrium in Section 6.1, observe that incentive compati-
bility ensures that sellers’ beliefs about the action of buyers place all mass on truthtelling. With
slight abuse of notation we therefore drop beliefs about actions, and the only relevant beliefs
concern type. But since types are drawn ex post, () =  () independent of the posted .

                                                     68
These are immediate implications of the maximization condition in the general
definition. Note also that feasibility is not stated explicitly, since free entry
ensures that sellers enter to satisfy the desired market tightness. Perfection would
additionally fix (77) at equality even oﬀ equilibrium (whenever possible), but here
this does not provide additional bite. And consistency is ensured by () =  ()
   Generalizing the results in the baseline model, one can show that the equilib-
rium can be characterized by maximizing buyer’s payoﬀ subject to (74), (75) and
the entry condition. Appendix 10 reduces the dimensionality of the constraints
following methods in mechanism design (e.g., Myerson 1981). Then one can show
there is a unique equilibrium, and only one type of contract () = [() ()] is
posted, where the nondecreasing trading probability () and associated market
tightness solve
                                            Z
                                       ()
                           = max                 () ()
                                ()      ∈T
                            Z          ∙               ¸
                                            1 −  ()
                    st ()      ()  −                 () ≥ 
                             ∈T                ()

Entry by sellers implies buyers get the entire surplus. Equilibrium maximizes the
surplus, given we cover sellers’ entry cost, subject to buyers getting the informa-
tion rents required for them to truthfully reveal their types. In equilibrium only
buyers that draw  ≤ ̂ trade, with ̂ endogenous. In this static environment,
equilibrium is constrained eﬃcient; in a dynamic extension of the model, when
the economy is not in steady state, equilibrium is generically not constrained
eﬃcient (Guerrieri 2008).

7.2    Individual-Specific Models

The literature on competitive search with private information about ex ante char-
acteristics focuses on adverse selection, and either signalling or screening, depend-
ing on whether the informed or uninformed side posts. Guerrieri et al. (2010),
Shao (2014), Chang (2014), Guerrieri and Shimer (2014,2015), Chen et al. (2016),
Williams (2016) and Davoodalhosseini (2017) all consider screening problems à

                                          69
la Akerlof (1970). Consider Guerrieri et al. (2010), which involves a static envi-
ronment with, in a language they adopt, homogenous principals on side 1 and
heterogeneous agents on side 2. Type is private information and has common
value for principals and agents. Principals post contracts, and agents decide
where to search, given beliefs about submarkets’ tightness and composition of
types. Guerrieri et al. (2010) show that there exists a fully separating equilib-
rium, and it is unique.46
       Consider a simple extension of the basic model in Section 2.1, where side 1
agents are buyers and side 2 sellers. Buyers are ex ante homogenous and can
enter at cost . A mass 1 of heterogenous sellers can provide an indivisible good
at 0 cost, where a fraction   produce high quality and   = 1 −   produce
low quality, with respective values ̃1 and ̃1  ̃1 to buyers. Quality is private
information to sellers before trade. If a seller does not trade he gets ̃2 or ̃2 ,
depending on quality, where ̃2  ̃1 ,  ∈ { }, so there are always gains from
trade. Each buyer in the market posts  ∈ S = [0 1] × + , and sellers choose
where to search. A contract  = ( ) specifies a trading probability  and a
transfer  without loss of generality — the same outcome obtains if buyers post
                    £                     ¤
menus of contracts, (   ) (   ) .
       Any  is associated with a submarket with tightness  () and a fraction
(; ) of type  sellers, with (; ) + (; ) = 1, so the probability a seller
matches is  [()], and the probability a buyer matches with a seller of type  is
 [()] (; )(). For  = ( ) define

                    1 () = (̃1 − ) and 2 () =  + (1 − ) ̃2 

where 2 () and 1 () are the payoﬀs of type  sellers in submarket  conditional
on meeting a buyer, and the payoﬀs of buyers in submarket  conditional meeting
a type  seller.
  46
     This constitutes an alternative solution to the non-existence problem in Rothschild and
Stiglitz (1976), based on the combination of a capacity constraint and an endogenous rationing
rule emerging from the competitive search setting. Papers exploring related competitive equi-
librium notions are Gale (1992), Dubey and Geanakoplos (2002), Inderst and Wambach (2002),
Inderst (2005).

                                              70
       In this relatively simple setting, equilibrium can be defined by a pair of sellers’
market utilities [() ()], a market tightness function () and a market com-
position function (; ), both defined over S, a CDF 1 (), and a set of posted
contracts S  ∈ S, satisfying the following conditions:47

   a) buyer maximization and entry,

                                  [()] X
                                            (; )1 () −  ≤ 0

         ∀ ∈ S, with equality if  ∈ S  ;

  b) seller maximization,

                               [()] 2 () + {1 −  [()]} ̃2 ≤ ()

         ∀ ∈ S and  ∈ { }, with equality if ()  ∞ and (; )  0, where

                            () = max  [()] 2 () + {1 −  [()]} ̃2 ;
                                    ∈S


   c) and feasibility,               Z
                                            (; ) () 1 () ≤  

         ∀, with equality if ()  0.

       Guerrieri et al. (2010) prove that equilibrium is fully separating and charac-
terized by two simple problems: Any seller  ∈ { } chooses a contract  and
faces tightness , where ( ) solves

                            () = max  () 2 () + [1 −  ()] ̃2                      (78)
                                    ∈S
               ()                       0                      0
         st        1 () ≥  and  () 2 () + [1 −  ()] ̃2 ≤  (0 ) for 0  
                
  47
    The first two conditions are direct consequences of maximization in the general definition of
equilibrium in Section 6.1 coupled with perfection. Notice the second one requires maximization
on and oﬀ equilibrium — if a buyer expects a seller of a given type to search for a given contract,
even oﬀ equilibrium, it must be weakly optimal for that seller to do so. This delivers uniqueness.
In contrast to Section 7.1, we must specify feasibility here because free entry of buyers alone is
not suﬃcient to ensure the right market tightness per type. It also ensures consistency.

                                                  71
As might be expected with adverse selection (going back to Mirelees 1971), in-
dividually rational is binding for low quality sellers, incentive compatibility is
binding for high quality sellers, and equilibrium features less trade in the sub-
market with high quality. Equilibrium is not generally eﬃcient, although taxes
can be used to correct the ineﬃciencies along both the extensive and intensive
margins (Davoodalhosseini 2017).
       Guerrieri and Shimer (2014) build on this general tucture to study dynamic
markets with heterogenous assets. Intuitively, by selling in a “less liquid” market,
sellers convey that their assets have higher value. They then analyze financial
crises resulting from increases in information frictions, and show how this can gen-
erate a fire sale and flight to quality. Also, asset prices in these models depend
on the dynamics, since investors expect to resell assets in the future and hence
value liquidity, and buyers can shift demand to classes of assets less susceptible
to informational problems. Guerrieri and Shimer (2015) introduce another di-
mension of private information, albeit in a static setting. Namely, investors may
not know the quality of assets nor the impatience of sellers. This more complex
problem generates multiple equilibria with interesting eﬃciency implications.
       Chang (2014) analyzes similar issues in dynamic financial markets, where
again private information reduces liquidity and can generate fire sales. She has a
second type of private information, as in Guerrieri and Shimer (2015), but she col-
lapses the two dimensions of private information into one, which avoids multiple
equilibria. In general, we think this is a very promising approach to information
issues in labor, asset and other markets, and encourage more research along these
lines. Especially for asset markets, future work could profit from connecting these
kinds of models more closely to the theories of liquidity summarized in Section 4
above.48
  48
    Davoodalhosseini (2012) studies directed search when sellers have private information about
the quality of their wares, and some buyers are uninformed while others are informed, similar
to the random search model of Williamson and Wright (1994). See also Kurlat (2015). Other
related work with random search includes Inderst (2005), Chiu and Koeppl (2011) and Camargo
and Lester (2012).

       These papers focus on screening: the uninformed party posts the contracts.
Delacroix and Shi (2014) study a signalling model where price-posting sellers
have private information about their quality , chosen prior to meetings. In this
environment, the price a seller posts can signal quality and direct buyers’ search.
They find a unique equilibrium and it is separating. When the quality diﬀerential
is large, it is also eﬃcient; otherwise, the quality of goods or the amount of trade
can be ineﬃcient, interestingly, due to a conflict between the roles of prices in
directing search and signaling quality. Clearly, these are interesting issues, and
even with some impressive progress, there is more work to be done on signalling
and directed search.


8        Meetings and Mechanisms
Here we consider private information with multilateral meetings, first with a focus
on competing auctions, and then on more general mechanisms.

8.1       Private Information and Multilateral Meetings

For this discussion we merge individual- and match-specific private information,
and focus mostly on one-sided heterogeneity. Consider a distribution 2 (2 ) with
support [0 ̄2 ] on side 2, and a mass 1 of homogeneous agents on side 1, again
with side 1 called sellers and side 2 buyers. We also stick with private valuations,
2 () =   0 and 1 () = 0, assume a buyer’s type  is private information,
and focus on sellers using mechanisms that do not specify types, like auctions. In
this relatively simple environment the literature is mainly concerned with the case
where payoﬀs can be replicated using direct revelation mechanisms: in a meeting,
the buyer reports , and payoﬀs are delivered as a function of the report.49
       Here is the issue: with bilateral meetings, it is standard that sellers do not
need to post anything more complicated than a price (e.g., Riley and Zeckhauser
  49
    It is possible to have buyers with more information than their own type, e.g., which mech-
anisms are posted, and in principle a seller could try to elicit this, but that requires a broader
notion of type; see McAfee (1993), Epstein and Peters (1999) and Peters (1999).


                                               73
1983); but with multilateral meetings, under mild assumptions a seller should run
an auction with reserve price  that generally can depend on the type distribution.
Now, a priori one might think it is ineﬃcient if sellers extract rents via reserve
prices, since it is possible that all the buyers that show up have   0 but
  . Are their gains from trade left on the table? Extracting rents via standard
price posting, as in previous sections, does not resolve this, because that would
not generally deliver the good to the buyer with highest valuation. In fact, the
results depend on the way that buyers and sellers meet.50
       In the approach used by McAfee (1993), Peters (1997) and Peters and
Severinov (1997), each buyer directs his search toward mechanisms they most
prefer, with multilateral meetings and coordination frictions as in Section 5.
Given , with probability 0 () = − a seller gets no buyers, with probabil-
ity 1 () = − he gets one, and with probability  () =  − ! he gets 
buyers. These authors show that restricting attention to standard auctions with
reserve prices is without loss of generality for an individual seller, independent
of the mechanisms posted by other sellers. Hence we proceed by having sellers
use auctions with reserve prices, and refer to the mechanism simply by , with
no further actions for sellers.
       For each buyer, let 2 be his bid. In a first price auction, his payoﬀ conditional
on trading is 2 ( 2  ) =  − 2 , and the seller’s payoﬀ is 1 ( 2  ) = 2 if
2 ≥  as specified in , and the payoﬀ from no trade is 0. Now 2 ( 2 ; ) is the
probability a buyer who directs his search to  has a type weakly below  and bids
weakly less than 2 . Let 2 (2 ;  T2 ) be the corresponding marginal probability
that any type who approaching mechanism  bids weakly below 2  Equivalently,
let the probability any buyer bids weakly above 2 be Φ2 (2 ;  T2 ). The queue of
buyers who pay at least  is Φ2 (;  T1 ), and since a seller trades as long as he
  50
    With random matching   0 would be the seller’s revenue-maximizing choice. The analysis
reduces to the well-studied problem of a monopolist seller.

meets at least one such buyer,
                                          £               ¤
               ̃1 ( ;  Φ2 ) = 1 − 0 Φ2 (;  T1 ) = 1 − −Φ2 (;T1 )           (79)

For buyers the probability of trade is 0 if 2  ; otherwise it is ̃2 ( 2  ;  ) =
  £               ¤
0 Φ2 (;  T1 ) = −Φ2 (2 ;T1 ) , assuming here that  does not have a mass point
at 2 (see Kim and Kircher 2015 for the general case).
       Peters and Severinov (1997) start with finite numbers, then take the limit,
as in Section 5. As discussed above, there are two cases: (i) buyers draw value
 before deciding where to search; (ii) they draw  after meeting a seller. In
equilibrium, in the limit as the market gets large, case (i) implies sellers post a
reserve price equal to their outside option,  = 0. This validates the finding in
McAfee (1993), who considers a finite economy but ignores market power, as we
discussed in Section 5. Peters and Severinov (1997) conjecture that in case (ii)
sellers post   0, but Albrecht et al. (2012) prove  = 0 in that case as well.51
They also show this with second price auctions, for both cases (i) and (ii), in large
markets, and they show that entry by sellers is eﬃcient. Second price auctions
where bids trivially coincide with types can be captured here if the payoﬀ  is
allowed to depend on  and . The actions of the other buyers not only aﬀect
the meeting probability but also the transfer price conditional on meeting. In
this context Mangin and Julien (2016) generalize the Hosios condition to explain
eﬃciency results in Albrecht et al. (2014).
       The result  = 0 is striking, as it implies auctions are in fact eﬃcient: it is
never the case that all buyers at a given seller have   0 but   . Even though
buyers are locked in at the time of bidding, the fact that they choose where to
search based on the posted  dissipates sellers’ monopoly power — they still earn
rents due to the frictions, but the usual monopoly considerations vanish.
  51
     The eﬃciency of the reserve price is shown by Julien et al. (2000) in large markets with
homogeneous agents. With heterogeneous sellers Julien et al. (2005) show that a market where
all sellers use eﬃcient reserve price induces buyers to make eﬃcient choices across sellers, even
with finite numbers. Taking all strategic considerations into account, this carries over to 2 × 2
markets (Julien et al. 2002), but not  ×  markets (Kim and Kircher 2015).


                                               75
       The main driving force behind Peters and Severinov’s argument for case (i) can
be illustrated as follows: Suppose all sellers oﬀer the same   0. Then any seller
trades with probability less than 1 due to the frictions. Now a deviating seller
posting − attracts additional buyers, those with type above − for whom the
original  is too high. In a large market the deviant seller’s trading probability
jumps, since there are many of such buyers, making the deviation profitable.
Hence, the only possibility in a large market is  = 0. This coincides with the
planner’s outcome, since the most trade occurs if buyers visit sellers at random,
if the goes good to the highest type, without precluding anyone outright from the
market. Interestingly, even though in case (ii) there is ex ante information that
can be used when selecting where to search, the eﬃcient equilibrium outcome
(random search and where the good goes to the highest bidder) does not use
that information. Thus, even in the less informative case (ii), the same outcome
occurs. Competitive search is eﬃcient, independent of when types are drawn,
which is especially nice here because the eﬃcient mechanism is so simple:  does
not depend on the distribution of .52
       In case (i) where types are known ex ante, it is useful to expand on the ben-
efit of random visits, which contrasts with the finding that it is beneficial to
separate types into diﬀerent submarkets with bilateral meetings. With multi-
lateral meetings, it is beneficial to have multiple types in the same submarket.
With urn-ball meetings, e.g., a seller can first consider all the buyers, then trade
with the one having the highest valuation. Separation would place many high 
buyers in the same submarket, leading to congestion. As Eeckhout and Kircher
(2010) emphasize, with two types, high valuation buyers trade even if low val-
uation buyers are present because they outbid them. If there are ̄2 high types
and they trade with a subset ̄1 ≤ 1 of sellers, their matching probability is
¡              ¢ ¡        ¢
 1 − −̄2 ̄1  ̄2 ̄1 , which is maximized at ̄1 = 1 , when all sellers trade
  52
     While many insights from the homogeneous seller model carry over to heterogeneous sellers,
the equivalence between ex ante and ex post type revelation does not. In this case, buyers sort
if they know their type ex ante, as discussed below.



                                              76
with high types. Also, the total number of trades is maximized when buyers
are allocated randomly due to the concavity of the matching function. Hence, if
buyers search randomly, the number of trades by high types and the total number
of trades are both maximized.53
       Random assignment is only sensible when sellers are identical, however. If
they diﬀer in cost 1 with support [1  0] and payoﬀ 1 (  ) = 2 + 1 , trades
between types with negative total surplus (1  2 ) = 2 +1  0 are not beneficial.
Yet the main insights discussed above still apply, and in particular, in equilibrium
sellers use a reserve price equal to their cost. One can prove a notion of sorting:
each buyer type 2 has a cutoﬀ seller type ∗1 (2 ) and trades randomly with all types
1 ≥ ∗1 (2 ). Higher 2 buyers are willing to pay more, so ∗0
                                                              1 (2 )  0 (Peters 1997).

This is similar to Section 6.2, but now sorting is imperfect because a buyer not
only trades with seller ∗1 (2 ), but with all higher types. This corresponds to the
planner’s outcome where the chance of trading is increased by spreading these
buyers across sellers.
       The result obtains whether buyers only observe the reserve price, or also the
type of seller, since given  they do not care about the latter. It also obtains if they
can only see , given a penalty for lying, and not also . Clearly sellers accept the
highest bid, unless they are all below cost, and buyers do not submit bids with 2 +
1  0, which would be rejected. Eﬀectively this is like a first price auction with
∗ (1 ) = 1 (Julien et al. 2005). Finally, even if there is no penalty for lying, and
messages are cheap talk, there is an still equilibrium where sellers truthfully reveal
type.54 This highlights the eﬃciency role of cheap talk without commitment,
as in housing and labor markets where advertised prices and wages might send
  53
     Note that pooling multiple types into one submarket in this way is eﬃcient even though
separation satisfies a Hosios condition, because that condition does not allow for pooling. Man-
gin and Julien (2016) show that pooling types in one market, using a selection process among
buyers like a second price auction, satisfies their generalized Hosios condition.
  54
     It is important that buyers know the correct type 1 to know where to attempt to trade and
what to bid. In a cheap talk environment sellers post only a message  ∈ T1 about their type,
but there is no penalty from lying. The question is whether there is an equilibrium in which
sellers send truthful messages in the first stage. Indeed this exists and it attains the eﬃcient
sorting of the fully competitive model (Kim and Kircher 2015).


                                              77
messages but are typically not binding (Albrecht et al. 2016). Attaining full using
eﬃciency only cheap talk depends on details, but some room for directing search
seems to be a common feature (Menzio 2005).
   These results concern private information about buyer types, but the trading
patterns are unchanged if buyer types are observable and sellers post menus
of prices, one for each buyer type, plus a priority rule determining who gets
served when many show up. This is studied by Shi (2002) and Shimer (2005),
who find that mixing types in a submarket is a robust outcome. With strict
supermodularity, 1 2  0, Shimer (2005) shows the following: if sellers of type
1 attract a strictly positive ratio of buyers of type 2 , then sellers of type 01  1
attract a lower ratio of such buyers. In the limiting case (1  2 ) = 1 + 2 ,
however, the ratios stay constant, as in the private valuation case discussed above.
In either case, output is maximized, because auctions ensure the highest valuation
buyers get the goods. General conditions for higher type sellers being more likely
to match with higher type buyers are not yet established for a general  (1  2 )
and multilateral meetings.
   The relation between observable types and private information requires pri-
vate values. Auster and Gottardi (2017) consider adverse selection with urn-ball
meetings. Given low- and high-quality traders on side 2, they show all agents
from side 1 post the trading mechanism. The good is always given to those on
side 2 who report low quality, unless no such agents show up. Even in that case,
high-quality agents may not trade with probability 1, for incentive reasons. Most
interesting is the question whether one should allow for arbitrary mechanisms or
restrict attention to price posting, which then is the same as the bilateral setting
studied earlier. They show that adverse selection can make the bilateral setup —
i.e., requiring price posting and the random selection of the agent that trades —
better than general mechanisms that distinguish between traders based on their
announcements, even if the underlying matching is multilateral.
   Julien and Roger (2016) combine adverse selection and moral hazard, assum-


                                           78
ing a stochastic relationship between output and unobserved eﬀort. Homogeneous
principals post menus of contracts to attract heterogeneous agents, with bilateral
or multilateral meetings. This can be captured in our framework with actions
for side 2, with 1 (1  2  ) = E (|) − E() and 2 (1  2  ) = E() − (; 2 ).
Contracts depend on realized output, and on the number of agents if meetings
are multilateral. These contracts also select one of the agents at random when
multiple agents show up, but, unlike Moen and Rosen (2011), here agents are risk
averse and do not have limited liability. The unique equilibrium contract actually
does not depend on the number of agents who show up, and all principals oﬀer
the same menu. Equilibrium is constrained eﬃcient on the intensive (eﬀort) and
extensive (entry) margins, assuming we can make transfers to agents who show
up but are not selected (similar to Jacquet and Tan 2012).
   Relatedly, Tsuyuhara (2016) considers a dynamic version with moral hazard
and on-the-job search. He shows the existence of block recursive equilibrium,
where wages and worker eﬀort increase with tenure, while (voluntary and in-
voluntary) job separation decrease with tenure. Other interesting work includes
Lester et al. (2016), where sellers compete on posted asking prices where agents
can trade immediately or wait for an auction (as is an option on Ebay). This com-
bines elements of optimal stopping models and competitive search. By expanding
the set of mechanisms that sellers can use, they generate multiple equilibria, but
they are payoﬀ equivalent and eﬃcient. Kennes and Schiﬀ (2008) assume sell-
ers have private information about the quality of their goods, and multilateral
meetings. A intermediary verifying quality sells information to buyers and sells
accreditation to sellers. This can be welfare improving or reducing. Again, this
is interesting work but there is more to be done in this important area.

8.2     Mechanism Design

There is a large literature on mechanism design and auctions, where competi-
tion for buyers is a nontrivial element, but less work on how the meeting process


                                             79
matters. In the private valuation case, with multilateral meetings, we saw com-
petition for buyers results in a standard auction with reserve price equal to cost,
 = 0. This is nice and simple, but raises concerns: why don’t sellers use two
margins, one to attract buyers and one to guarantee buyers who show up reveal
their types? Why does competition stop at  = 0 price, rather than   0, which
attracts even more buyers? Should there be an entry payment to attract buyers
and a reserve price to select the best type? When does it suﬃce to have only an
entry payment or simply post a price?
       The general issue is to know how mechanism design is aﬀected by the way
agents meet. While this has not attracted much attention, we can review some
advances in settings with ex ante private values for buyers, 2 () = 2 , and
homogeneous sellers, 1 () = 0, again dropping the type subscript. Following
Eeckhout and Kircher (2010), Lester et al. (2015) and Cai et al. (2015,2016),
consider a general meeting function  (), instead of urn-ball. This is natural
e.g., if each buyer approaches one seller but the latter seller only has time to deal
with a random subset of  buyers. If  = 1 this is a bilateral meeting technology;
if  = ∞ it is urn-ball; and other intermediate case may be equally plausible.
       To see how this aﬀects the optimal mechanism choice, two observations are
key: First, posting an optimal entry payment and a standard auction with a
reserve price is as least as profitable as any direct revelation mechanism, so we
can focus on a second price auction, where buyers pay an entry fee and then bid.
Second, equilibrium is constrained eﬃcient, which means the reserve price equals
cost, and the surplus added across sellers is maximized. Consider seller  facing
tightness  and a distribution of buyers 2 (; ), where we sometimes suppress .
His expected surplus is55

  55
    The first expression says that if there are  bidders the one with the highest valuation gets
the good, which has distribution 2 (), and this is added over all possible number  of bidders.
The second interchanges integration and summation.


                                                      80
Letting (̂ ) = 1 − Σ  ()(1 − ̂) , we have
                                 Z
                          1 =        ( [1 − 2 ()]  )                    (80)
                                    ∈T2

   In a submarket with tightness , and ̂ high types, (̂ ) is the chance a
seller meets at least one high buyer type. Simple restrictions on the meeting
function imply  is concave in each variable, if not jointly. Knowing  () ∀( )
implies knowing , and vice versa. Given this, consider two buyers, a lower type
 and a higher type . Suppose there is a measure 12 of sellers in a submarket
with ̂1 high types and 1 buyers in total, and another measure 12 of sellers
in a submarket with ̂2 high type and 2 . By (80), the surplus per seller is
              ¡     ¢
(   ) +  −  (̂   ), where the first term says that as long as the seller
meets someone he creates at least value , while the second says that if he meets
a high type he creates additional  − . The expected surplus in this market is

                             X
                             2

                         12    (   ) +  −  (̂   ) 
                             =1

   If instead we sent buyers randomly to sellers the expected surplus would be

                      1 + 2 1 + 2    ¡     ¢ ̂1 + ̂2 1 + 2
                (                  ) +  −  (                )
                         2       2                   2        2

If (̂ ) is concave then pooling everyone in one submarket is better. This
is a good insight: concavity of  implies buyers should be assigned randomly.
Moreover, the result holds for arbitrary distributions of types. If  is not globally
concave, there are always type distributions for which segregation rather than
random matching is desirable under mild conditions.
   This can be illustrated in the example where sellers can deal with up to 
buyers, where the resulting  is never globally concave except when  = ∞. Here
the lack of concavity is more severe with small . Markets in which sellers are
more constrained in their meetings are naturally more inclined to separation, in
which case they can opt for simple price posting. Eeckhout and Kircher (2010)
highlight a natural role for simple price posting: if sellers are more constrained

                                            81
in their meetings, they want to segregate buyer types into diﬀerent submarkets,
and since they can then infer buyer type they have no need for complicated
mechanisms at the time of meeting (see also Auster and Gottardi 2017). However,
to ensure price posting is optimal for any distribution of buyer types, we need
bilateral meetings (Cai et al. 2015).
    Another question concerns the importance of entry fees. Cai et al. (2016) show
it is optimal for a seller that attracts  to post auctions with no reserve price
but an entry payment  . One can show  = 0 if  2 = 0 everywhere, a feature
Lester et al. (2015) call invariance. When this applies, it is optimal to pool types,
intuitively, because it means meetings between high type buyers and sellers are
not reduced by having more low type buyers in the submarket. Pooling is then
optimal because competition between high and low types is dealt with by the
mechanism rather than the meeting process — meeting externalities are absent.
In sum, the meeting process has substantial implications for mechanism choice,
and we need more work on these issues.


9     Other Topics
We now touch on a few important topics not covered above.

9.1    The Nash Program

The quest for strategic foundations for axiomatic bargaining is dubbed “the Nash
program” by Binmore (1987). As Serrano (2005) nicely puts it, “Similar to the
microfoundations of macroeconomics, which aim to bring closer the two branches
of economic theory, the Nash program is an attempt to bridge the gap between
the two counterparts of game theory (cooperative and non-cooperative). This is
accomplished by investigating non-cooperative procedures that yield cooperative
solutions as their equilibrium outcomes.” See also Osborne and Rubinstein (1990).
Directed search and posting can be viewed from this perspective: it provides an
explicit description of a market, with finite numbers of participants, or in limiting

                                         82
cases with large numbers, where traders end up sharing the gains from trade in a
way that can be interpreted in terms of generalized Nash, with bargaining powers
and threat points determined by market conditions. In an  ×  market, (45)
gives  as a weighted average of  and , where the weight on  is the probability
a seller gets at least 2 buyers; in particular, in a 2 × 2 market,  = ( + ) 2,
consistent with the original Nash solution.
   This provides an alternative to demonstrating that generalized Nash is the
limit of a non-cooperative game, with bargaining power and threat points deter-
mined by details like the probability a player gets to make the next oﬀer or how
much he loses from delay (Binmore et al. 1986). Competitive search is therefore
a contribution to the Nash program. Note that with bargaining the share para-
meter  is typically assumed to be structural. Competitive search demonstrates
that the division of the surplus is not generally constant, but changes with eco-
nomic conditions, including changes in policy. Ignoring that can be problematic,
although it can also be justified in some cases — e.g., with a Cobb-Douglas match-
ing technology the shares of the surplus are indeed invariant. Still, one ought to
acknowledge that this is a special case.
   Similarly, in competitive search equilibrium the shares of the surplus will
vary in the cross section, not only with respect to time or policy, with a diﬀerent
split in diﬀerent submarkets into which traders select. This is interesting and
important. Typically, in markets with two-sided ex ante investments, there is
no single value of  that delivers eﬃciency independent of other parameters —
i.e., there is not way to satisfy more than one Hosios condition with a single
choice of . Competitive search delivers eﬃciency endogenously in many of these
situations. Hence it not only provides a microfoundation for sharing the surplus,
as assumed in bargaining models, it dominates bargaining as a mechanism. Of
course, competitive search (usually) assumes commitment, but at least it is good
to know what we are buying into.

9.2    Large Firms

Most of the literature on labor search, directed or otherwise, concentrates on jobs
rather than firms: they treat each job as an entity unto itself without specifying
how collections of jobs aggregate into firms. This is fine for many purposes but
not, e.g., to discuss observations on firm size or growth. Davis et al. (2013)
show that matching eﬃciency varies substantially, and linearly, with a firm’s
growth rate. To speak to such facts, a promising avenue is to postulate that if
a firm has  workers it produces  (), and can post  vacancies at cost (),
generalizing the baseline formulation where  = (1) is the cost of posting a
single vacancy. At the level of an individual vacancy the model is unchanged,
but aggregation diﬀers, and if  is strictly concave or  strictly convex then firms
grow to a finite endogenous size. Hawkins (2013) presents such a model with
finite numbers, which complicates the analysis. Most subsequent work assumes
the law of large number applies, so that a firm posting any number of vacancies
gets a deterministic number of new workers.
   In Kaas and Kircher (2015), a strictly concave () leads to a slow growth
path for firms, and those that want to grow faster post both higher wages and
more vacancies. The former induces more hires per vacancy, consistent with the
above-mentioned facts in Davis et al. (2013). Also, they decentralize the appro-
priate planner’s problem, in contrast to models with multi-worker bargaining
(Stole and Zwiebel 1996; Smith 1999; Brugemann et al. 2015). Menzio and Moen
(2010) show how incomplete contracts that specify the wage but do not guar-
antee employment imply wage floors that insure workers with respect to modest
shocks but not large shocks. As in Kaas and Kircher (2015), they use an extended
version of block recursivity to achieve tractability. Garibaldi and Moen (2010),
Schaal (2015) and Garibaldi et al. (2016) incorporate on-the-job search, but only
if  or  are linear; the general case is still outstanding.
   In other work along these lines, Eeckhout and Kircher (2016) introduce two-
sided heterogeneity into a large-firm model with linear  but convex  to study the


                                         84
sorting and wage implications. Julien et al. (2016) study large firms as production
teams in a competitive search setting, related to the “island matching” model in
Mortensen (2009). In each period, a firm can post one or more vacancies and
may loose one or more workers, and may temporarily shut down if a minimum
number of workers is necessary to operate profitably. The optimal size of a firm
(team) depends on the extent of frictions, and the complementarity between
workers within a team leads to wage dispersion, suggesting that the proliferation
of human resource management emphasizing team production can contribute to
increasing wage inequality. While there is not that much work with large firms in
this literature, what there is suggests it is an interesting area for future research.

9.3    Evidence

There are several ways in which directed and random search can diﬀer empiri-
cally. Obviously, both are stark, and neither captures every detail of the under-
lying market, but there are diﬀerences that can serve as hypotheses for testing.
One commonly noted diﬀerence is that the number of applications firms receive
should not vary with their wages under random search, and should increase with
their wages under directed search, holding other things equal (it is important to
consider applications rather than hires, since higher wage firms might be more
successful in hiring even under random search). The main challenge in testing
this is to find a situations where two otherwise similar vacancies oﬀer diﬀerent
wages, since if the vacancies are not otherwise similar, they may require diﬀerent
qualifications, hours, etc.
   We first mention that many workers do not seem in a position to bargain over
wages, but take oﬀers as given. This is the case reported by more than two thirds
of workers both in the US and Germany, according to Hall and Kruger (2012)
and Brenzel et al. (2014). Hall and Kruger also highlight that nearly half of the
workers in their sample report that even before their applications they were highly
certain about wages. This is particularly pronounced for lower-qualification jobs,


                                         85
and bodes well for directed search. Obviously, whether or not a firm posts a wage
is an observable component and will diﬀerentially attract applicants. Michelacci
and Suarez (2006) study a setting where firms can post either wages or commit
to bargain, and predict that posting is used for jobs where qualifications matter
less while bargaining is used when qualifications are matter more, as then firms
need wage flexibility to deal with quality diﬀerentials in the applicant pool.
       Regarding the relation between wages and the number of applications, non-
experimental evidence is mixed and depends importantly on the ability to control
for variations in wages that are unrelated to job requirements. Using survey ev-
idence on a limited number of US firms in the 1980s, Holzner et al. (1991) and
Faberman and Menzio (2015) do not find support for the number of applications
increasing with the wage, controlling for occupational code and other observables.
Faberman and Menzio even find higher wages are associated with fewer applica-
tions, but the eﬀect shrinks with the inclusion of more observables. This raises
the possibility that diﬀerent jobs are targeted to diﬀerent groups of applicants
and higher wages mainly compensate for higher skills.56
       This raises the question whether one can obtain better controls to make job
requirements more comparable. Marinescu and Wolthoﬀ (2015) use a much larger
data set of online job postings at the US website careerbuilder.com and control
for job titles, which are orders of magnitude finer than the two-digit occupational
codes used in the above-mentioned work. They find that applications increases
with wages. They also highlight that other features of the job description, es-
pecially qualifiers such as “senior” or “experienced” seem to convey substantial
information about the attractiveness of the job and explain a large part of wage
variation. This is related to work on cheap talk, where messages like “senior” or
“experienced” can signal the eventual wage that can be obtained (Menzio 2005;
Kim and Kircher 2015). In any case, search among similar jobs seems to be pos-
itively geared to higher posted wages, and to other identifiers that are correlated
  56
    In a directed search model with homogeneous firms and workers diﬀering in productivity,
higher wages can attract fewer but better applicants.


                                            86
with the attractiveness of the job.
       Banfi and Villena-Roldan (2016) have information on posted wages on a
Chilean job-search website, plus intended wages, even if these are not shown
to job seekers. They show that higher intended wages substantially increase the
number of applicants after controlling for job title. This highlights the idea that
employers are able to communicate eﬀectively throughout job descriptions, even
if they do not include it outright. Eﬀects are larger for publicly posted wages,
though, suggesting a significant direct channel.
       To make sure wages are not capturing other elements of the job, e.g., skill
requirements, one approach is to randomize wages. This ensures orthogonality at
least to the observed dimensions of the job advertisement. Dal Bo et al. (2013)
exploit truly randomized wage oﬀers for civil servant positions in Mexico, and
find higher wages attract more and better applicants. Belot et al. (2016) use
randomized wages in a small online job market and also find higher wages attract
substantially more interest from job seekers. These observations can be taken
as further support for directed search. However, while this evidence is hard to
reconcile with the simplest random search models, minor extensions of that model
could help.57
       The reservation wage property is pervasive in random search, but not directed
search, where workers typically cannot apply to all the jobs they like. Because
they cannot, they are selective, and may apply to low wages even if they are
aware of higher wage options, because they understand that it is harder to get
latter. A test between theories can therefore directly focus on the reservation
wage property. Belot et al. (2016) conduct a field experiment where otherwise
identical jobs oﬀer diﬀerent wages. They find more workers apply to high wage
  57
    Suppose workers encounter vacancies at random and observe the wage, as in random search
with posting (e.g., Burdett and Mortensen 1998), with a slight twist: workers only bother to
apply for jobs if they would actually accept them. This has no eﬀect on actual hires, but now
applications are only recorded by the firm if the job exceeded their reservation wage, which can
explain the findings mentioned in the text because firms with higher wage oﬀers are more likely
to meet workers’ reservation wages.



                                              87
jobs, but a significant share apply only to the low wage job, even though they
see the high wages on their search engine. This lends support to the idea that
workers are selective in where they apply.
   Directed search has also been studied in laboratory experiments. Cason and
Noussair (2007) ask if the strategic considerations in the finite market models
discussed in Section 5 are important. The answer is yes — their experiments with
small numbers of traders are broadly consistent with on Burdett et al. (2001),
although there are some discrepancies, e.g., prices can exceed the equilibrium
prediction when there are two sellers. In Anbarci and Feltovich (2013), in one
treatment sellers post as in Burdett et al., and in another they post as in Coles
and Eeckhout (2003), with prices contingent on the number of buyers that show
up. They consider 2 × 2, 2 × 3 and 3 × 2 market versions, and find that allowing
contingent pricing does not aﬀect seller payoﬀs. See also Anbarci and Feltovich
(2017). Moen et al. (2015) vary both the capacity constraints and information,
and find that observed play corresponds closely to equilibrium. Kloosterman
(2016) finds that firms oﬀer wages close to, if a little lower than, the theory’s
predictions, but are highly variable. Also, workers apply more often to high
wages although not quite to the extent predicted.
   Godoy and Moen (2011) study another diﬀerence between directed and ran-
dom search in the context of on-the-job search. In random search, a worker who
is currently employed at 1 will take any   1 that he encounters. A similar
worker employed at 2 will do the same with and   2 . If we see both move
to a new job with wages above 1 and 2 , the wage distribution upon moving for
both should be identical. As discussed above, that is not the case with directed
on-the-job search, since workers who are employed at a higher  tend to target
new jobs at still higher wages. Their evidence supports this prediction. In a
similar vein, Braun et al. (2016) study whether unemployment insurance aﬀects
subsequent wages beyond the reservation wage, and also find evidence of directed
search.


                                       88
       Li et al. (2015) show how a directed search model can be used to understand
worker transitions. The theory is a dynamic extension of Peters (2010) in which
workers have privately known types that are observable to firms once they apply.
It shows how the wage oﬀer distribution can be derived from the accepted wage
distribution and the employment distribution by solving a diﬀerential equation.
This relationship is used to derive an outcome distribution that can be used to
study transitions and test the theory. Li et al. (2015) use a similar approach
to show that for any smooth wage distribution there is an equilibrium where
unemployed workers choose reservation wages as a strictly increasing function
of their type, then apply with equal probability to all positions that oﬀer more
than that wage. They show two results. First, workers’ wages throughout their
lives are correlated, but very imperfectly because equilibrium involves a lot of
mismatch. Second, the variance of future income is a decreasing function of the
current wage, i.e., high wage workers have more stable lifetime income.
       Herkenhoﬀ (2013) develops a quantitative model with directed search and risk
aversion to study how raising credit access among the unemployed aﬀects business
cycles. He has directed search in labor and credit markets, and models easier
access to credit as an increase in matching eﬃciency. As credit expanded over
the last 40 years, better access to credit this slows business cycle recoveries, but is
still welfare improving. Since the model is block recursive, he can estimate it and
solve for transitions. Relatedly, Herkenhoﬀ et al. (2016) develop a sorting model
of risk aversion and credit, which is again tractable due to directed search. In
particular, workers with low assets search for easy-to-find jobs, but these may be
poor matches. Estimating the model, they find that credit constraints tightening
as they did in 2007-2009 generates enough mismatch to depress productivity by
0.25%, which persists over time, and is equivalent to a 425 million dollar reduction
in output per annum.58
  58
    As regards related work, we already mentioned Menzio et al. (2016), who combine life cycle
considerations with directed search in the labor market. They study how the trade-oﬀs between
wages and job-finding rates, and hence transitions, depend on age. See also Carillo-Tudela and
Visschers (2014).


                                             89
   All of this suggests directed search can help rationalize several features of the
data. Whether it can fully account for the observations, or whether perhaps a
hybrid solution with both random and directed search is more suitable, awaits
empirical scrutiny. The estimation in Engelhard and Rupert (2016) may suggest
the need for a hybrid approach, since they largely reject the implications of a
simple competitive search model, although they fail to reject directed search
with heterogeneous workers. terms of submarket search and eﬃcient surplus
sharing. Alternatively, as they acknowledge, this might simply reflect the need to
incorporate elements like on-the-job search and diﬀerences in productivity, which
are crucial in rationalizing wage dispersion in other models (e.g., Hornstein et
al. 2011). There is ample unexplored territory for empirical work on directed
search, in general, and on comparing it to random search, in particular.

9.4    Miscellany

Lester et al. (2014) study over-the-counter financial markets in a generalized ver-
sion of Duﬃe et al. (2005) using directed search. Watanabe (2010,2015) considers
directed search in a model of intermediaries (middlemen). His middlemen have
large inventories, so they are less likely to stock out, similar to the situation when
some sellers has multiple units for sale in Burdett et al. (2001). In particular, if
two firms could merge, then if one gets 2 customers and the other 0, and if they
can share them, it would a profitable venture. Another related paper is Gautier et
al. (2016), who use directed search to analyze two types of middleman, those who
hold inventories they get from sellers to retrade to buyers, and those who oﬀer
platforms for buyers and sellers to trade with each other. This is very interesting,
but it seems there is much more to do on directed search and middlemen.
   Gonzalez and Shi (2009) study diﬀerences in worker arrival rates that are not
known — they have to learn over time. This pioneers new ways to analyze dy-
namic markets, and rationalizing a discouraged worker eﬀect. Chade et al. (2014)
and Nagypal (2004) develop equilibrium models of directed college choice where


                                         90
applicants can simultaneously send out many applications. All these interesting
applications can serve as guides for future research.
   Some papers study markets with two-sided investment, including Acemoglu
and Shimer (1999), Masters (2011) and Jerez (2016). In the latter, competitive
search entails both commitment to and advertising of payoﬀ relevant character-
istics. An example from labor is when workers and firms invest in human and
physical capital prior to entering the market. When the characteristics of jobs and
workers are posted, eﬃciency obtains. However, commitment without advertising
leads to unravelling and ineﬃciency.
   Some papers study in detail the impact of unemployment insurance using
direted search, including Acemoglu and Shimer (1999), Geromichalos (2015)
and Golosov et al. (2013). In Geromichalos (2015) workers that do not match
receive  from the government, financed by a lump sum tax on firms. This makes
it cheap for firms to be aggressive in posting, because they know their competitors
all contribute to the unemployment caused by attracting more workers than they
want to hire In equilibrium wages are too high and entry is too low. This can
be corrected by experience rating (making taxes depend the unemployment a
firm causes). It is also corrected without taxes if firms post contracts as in
Jacquet and Tan (2012), with one payment to those hired and another to those not
hired. Golosov et al. (2013) study optimal unemployment insurance (Acemoglu
and Shimer 1999 only maximize output). They find it is optimal to insure
workers against the risk of not getting hired, but not to redistribute across workers
applying to diﬀerent types of jobs. Clearly directed search raises new issues in
this important application, and hence merits even more research.


10      Conclusion
This completes our directed tour through the theories and applications of di-
rected search. Like search theory in general, the models contribute substantially
to our understanding of phenomena like the coexistence of unemployment and

                                         91
vacancies, the fact that some shops have unsold inventories while others stock
out, price dispersion and price stickiness, and random durations in the time to
execute trades in many markets. Diﬀerent from traditional search, in competitive
search equilibrium the terms of trade are posted and agents use this to target
counterparties. In particular, posted prices have an allocative role, and this typ-
ically leads to eﬃciency, at least without additional complications like private
information or liquidity considerations.
   To quote from the survey on labor markets by Rogerson et al. (2005): “Al-
though there are several important modeling decisions in equilibrium search the-
ory... two questions are paramount. First, how do agents meet? In particular, is
search random, so that unemployed workers are equally likely to locate any job
opening, or directed, so that for example firms can attract more applicants by
oﬀering higher wages? Second, exactly how are wages determined? Do matched
workers and firms bargain, or are wages posted unilaterally before they meet?”
As that survey says, competitive search oﬀers particular answers to both ques-
tions that can avoid the “black box” of bargaining and (sometimes) of matching
functions. And, obviously, this applies not just to labor, but too many if not
most markets.
   Competitive search can be more tractable and can yield cleaner results than
alternatives. It is also arguably more realistic, depending on the application. It
also lets us study both finite markets and limiting large markets, where we reiter-
ate that the frictions do not go away in the latter case. Again, the theory captures
the idea that if you post more favorable terms then potential customers come to
you with a higher probability, but not generally with probability 1. Agents on
both sides of the market trade oﬀ prices and trading probabilities, which nicely
generalizes general equilibrium theory. In particular, with homogeneous buyers
and sellers the price and probability of trade are the same everywhere, but the
out-of-equilibrium options to post diﬀerent terms and to search diﬀerently dis-
ciplines in-equilibrium behavior. For these reasons and more, it seems easy to


                                        92
predict a bright future for the directed search approach. We hope this essay
inspires readers to learn more about the field, and to contribute to its ongoing
development.

Appendix A
We consider two scenarios. The first has indivisible , like our baseline model,
but does not necessarily have perfectly transferable utility: if a buyer makes
a payment  to a seller, the latter gets  () while former gets − (), where
 (0) =  (0) = 0,  0 ()  0,  0 ()  0,  00 () ≤ 0 and  00 () ≥ 0 ∀  0.
Transferable utility, as in Section 2.1 is the special case,  () =  () = . The
generalization of problem (1) is

With  is fixed, the FOC’s are:

Appendix B
Recall the continuous-time planner problem in Section 3.2. Normalizing the mea-
sure of households to  = 1, we let the state variable be employment , and
let the control be the measure of vacancies posted . The law of motion is
̇ = (1 − )  () − , where  =  (1 − ). Denote the value function by  ()
and write the problem as
                  ½                            ∙        µ      ¶      ¸¾
                                          0                 
     () = max  + (1 − )  −  +  () (1 − )             −   (81)
                                                         1−

                                             95
In case it is not obvious, we derive this, following Shimer (2004). Consider the
integral form of the problem
                           Z ∞
                [ ()] =     −(−) { ()  − [1 −  ()]  − } 
                             

The objective function is household utility net of vacancy posting costs. Diﬀer-
entiating with respect to time, we get

                  0 [ ()] ̇ () = − ()  − [1 −  ()]  +  [ ()] 

Using this to replace ̇ () in the objective function, we arrive at (81).
    One can show the value function is linear,  () = 0 + 1 . This is easiest in
discrete time, as in Rogerson et al. (2005), where it is easy to check the mapping
analogous to (81) is a contraction, with  () its unique fixed point. It is also easy
to check that this mapping takes linear functions into linear functions. Since the
set of linear functions is closed, the fixed point  () is linear. To get the result in
continuous time one can taking the limit of the discrete time model as the period
length shrinks to 0, a standard technique in search theory (e.g., Mortensen 1986).
See Wright (2001) for more details.
    Therefore the FOC is                     µ     ¶
                                           0    
                                  = 1                                          (82)
                                               1−
which implies  =  (1 − ) is independent of . Diﬀerentiating (81), we get
                              ∙ µ       ¶       µ     ¶           ¸
                                             0          
           1 =  −  − 1              −                   +          (83)
                                   1−            1− 1−

Using (83) to eliminate 1 from (82), we arrive at  () = 0, the steady state
equilibrium condition in the text. Hence, at every point in time, the planner’s 
is the same as the steady state equilibrium . ¥

Appendix C
Recall on-the-job search from Section 3.2. We claim there is a  such that
workers employed at  ≥  stop searching. To begin, for a worker employed at
1 searching for 10 and another employed at 2  1 searching for 20 , the fact
that both are behaving optimally implies

          [(20 )] [1 (20 ) − 1 (2 )] ≥  [(10 )] [1 (10 ) − 1 (2 )]
          [(20 )] [1 (20 ) − 1 (1 )] ≤  [(10 )] [1 (10 ) − 1 (1 )] 

                                              96
Now subtraction implies

            [(20 )] [1 (1 ) − 1 (2 )] ≥  [(10 )] [1 (1 ) − 1 (2 )] 

Since 1 () is strictly increasing, 1 (1 )  1 (2 ) and hence  [(20 )] 
 [(10 )]. So the worked employed at 2 searches in a submarket with a higher
wage and lower success rate than the worker employed at 1 .
    We now show there is a minimum wage increment 4 workers require to justify
search cost . The gain 1 (0 ) − 1 () is bounded by (0 − )  ( + ), the
diﬀerence in wages over the maximum time on a job until exogenously destroyed.
A employed worker that searches needs a gain that at least makes up for the
cost, 1 (0 ) − 1 () ≥ . Hence,  ≤ (0 − )  ( + ), or ∆ ≥  (0 − ). In
particular, if  is high enough, a worker stops searching. ¥

Appendix D
   Consider auctions instead of posting in the  ×  market. For seller  the
payoﬀ is  −  unless only 1 buyer shows up, in which case it is  − , or no
buyers show up, in which case it is 0. Therefore,
                                        £                                         ¤

For a buyer the payoﬀ from visiting seller  is − if he is alone, and 0 otherwise.
In equilibrium where buyers mix, therefore,

Implicit diﬀerentiation and simplification implies

maximizing  with respect to  and simplifying, we get

As    → ∞ holding  fixed,  →  and  → (1 − − − − )( − ). This is
the same as the payoﬀ under posting. ¥

Appendix E
    Consider any CRS technology (1  2 ) and let  = 1 2 . We claim () ≷

                                     (2 1 ) 
As in standard production theory,  measures the degree of complementarity be-
tween inputs. Clearly, (1  2 ) = 2 () = 1 (), which implies 1 = 0 ()
and 2 = () − 0 (). Therefore, 2 1 = ()0 () −  and  (2 1 )  =
−()00 ()0 ()2 . Given this, (87) implies

                 0 () =

This proves 0 () ≷ 0 ⇔ () ≷ 1.
   For the specification (1  2 ) = 2 (1−−1 2 ) discussed in Section 5, () =
1 − − and () = −  (1 − − ). Moreover,

because 1 − −  . As discussed in Section 4, another common specification
is the Kiyotaki-Wright matching function, (1  2 ) = 1 2  (1 + 2 ). This
implies () =  (1 + ), () = 12, () = 1 (1 + ) and 0 () = −1(1 +
)2  0. The CES function is (1  2 ) = (1 + 1 )1 , where  ∈ (−∞ 1). This
implies () = (1 +  )1 , () = 1 (1 − ) and () =   (1 +  ). Clearly,
 T 1 ⇔  T 0 ⇔ 0 () = −1 (1 +  )2 T 0, providing a simple example with
0  0. A special case is the Cobb-Douglas function, (1  2 ) = 1 1−

implies () =  ,  () = 1 and 0 () = 0. ¥

where the last line follows from eliminating 00 using 0 = (0 + 00 − 02 ) 2
and simplifying. Hence, 0 ≤ 0 ⇒   0. The proof for  is similar. ¥

          Z                                         Z
                                                         1 − 2 (2 )
               (2  2 )2 (2 ) = (2  2 ) +                   (2 )2 (2 )

Using this and the definition of (2  2 ), we rewrite (2  2 ) ≥ 0 as
                 Z         ∙                           ¸
                                          1 − 2 (2 )
                      ()  − () −                    2 (2 ) ≥ 0
                  ∈T                        2 (2 )

Hence, the relevant problem is:

                                                  1 − 2 (2 )
              st         (2 ) 2 − (2 ) −                     2 (2 ) ≥ 0
                  2 ∈T                               2 (2 )
                                   Z

                                  2 ∈T

Using the second constraint to eliminate (2 ), we reduce this to the problem
discussed in the text. ¥
