                                              ABSTRACT

  Background: Family structure is known to influence children's behavioral, educational, and cognitive
outcomes, and recent studies suggest that family structure affects children's access to health care as
well. However, no study has addressed whether family structure is associated with the care children
receive for particular conditions or with their physical health outcomes.
  Objective: To assess the effects of family structure on the treatment and outcomes of children with
asthma.
  Methods: Our data sources were the 1996-2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the
2003 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). The study samples consisted of children 2-17
years of age with asthma who lived in single-mother or two-parent families. We assessed the effect
of number of parents and number of other children in the household on office visits for asthma and
use of asthma medications using negative binomial regression, and we assessed the effect of family
structure on the severity of asthma symptoms using binary and ordinal logistic regression. Our
regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, parental experience in child-rearing
and in caring for an asthmatic child and, when appropriate, measures of children's health status.
  Results: Asthmatic children in single-mother families had fewer office visits for asthma and filled fewer
prescriptions for controller medications than children with two parents. In addition, children living
in families with three or more other children had fewer office visits and filled fewer prescriptions for
reliever and controller medications than children living with no other children. Children from single-mother
families had more health difficulties from asthma than children with two parents, and children living
with two or more other children were more likely to have an asthma attack in the past 12 months than
children living with no other children.
  Conclusions: For children with asthma, living with a single mother and the presence of additional
children in the household are associated with less treatment for asthma and worse asthma outcomes.

       Numerous studies have linked children’s well-being to family structure, including the

number of parents and children in the household.1-5 Children in single-parent households are

more likely than children with two parents to be poor, experience food insecurity, and have

limited social and economic resources.1,6 Children growing up in single-parent households

also have worse educational outcomes compared with children from two-parent households.1

Additionally, social scientists have consistently documented an inverse relationship between

the number of children in the household and children’s intellectual development and

educational achievement.2, 4-5, 7-9 Blake3 has posited that parental resources are finite and that

each additional child in the family represents time and energy drawn away from parents, in

effect “diluting” parental resources and resulting in worse outcomes for each child.3-5, 7-10

       To date, only a few studies have examined the effect of family structure on children’s

health care.11 Cafferata and Kasper12 found that healthy children in single-mother families

had more physician visits during the year than children in two-parent families. Heck and

Parker13 found that children in single-mother and in two-parent families were equally likely to

have a physician visit at high levels of maternal education, whereas at low levels of maternal

education children of single mothers were more likely to have a visit. By contrast,

Cunningham and Hahn14 reported lower health care use for children from single-mother

households, and two other studies found slight or no differences between single-mother

families and two-parent families in physician visits.15-16 In the only study to examine the

effect of number of children, Chen and Escarce16 found that children living with several other

children had fewer visits and were less likely to use prescription drugs than children living

with no other children. Whether these utilization differences have consequences for




                                                                                                 6
children’s health is unknown, however, because no study has assessed the effect of family

structure on children’s health outcomes.

       To bridge this gap, we assess the effect of family structure on the treatment and

outcomes of children with asthma. Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in

children.17-19 It is estimated that 5 million children suffer from asthma and that asthma

accounts for more than 200,000 pediatric hospitalizations per year.17, 19 Previous studies have

shown that control of asthma symptoms and asthma outcomes are related to

sociodemographic factors.17, 20 We bring this literature and the literature on family structure

and children’s well-being together by examining the effect of number of parents and number

of other children in the household on asthmatic children’s visits, their use of asthma

medications, and measures of the severity of their asthma symptoms using nationally

representative samples of children.



                                           METHODS

Conceptual Framework

       Our conceptual framework posits that children are dependent on their parents to seek

and obtain adequate treatment for their medical conditions, and that attributes of the children,

parents, and family influence the health care children receive. Consistent with the literature

on access to and demand for care, the care children receive for asthma is expected to be

affected by children’s age, sex, race and ethnicity, and health status; insurance coverage;

family income; location of residence (e.g., urban versus rural); parental education; and child-

rearing experience. Family structure is expected to influence children’s care as well. Single

mothers may have less social support and experience greater stress and time demands than




                                                                                                  7
two-parent couples, impairing their ability to meet their children’s health care needs.1, 11, 13

More children in the family may dilute the time and energy that parents can devote to any

particular child.3-5

        We also posit that the care children receive for their medical conditions influences

their health outcomes. In particular, if family structure affects the adequacy of children’s

treatment for asthma, then those dimensions of family structure associated with less adequate

treatment are expected to be associated with more severe asthma symptoms.



Data Sources

        The sources of data for the study were the 1996-2003 Medical Expenditure Panel

Survey Household Component (MEPS-HC) and the 2003 National Survey of Children’s

Health (NSCH). The MEPS-HC is a nationally representative survey on the use of health care

conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.21 We used the MEPS-HC to

study the effect of family structure on the use of asthma care by linking the MEPS-HC Full

Year Consolidated Data Files, Medical Conditions Files, and Event Files for the study years.

The Full Year Consolidated Data Files provided information on each subject’s

sociodemographic characteristics, insurance coverage, and health status.22-28 The Medical

Conditions Files contained self- or parent-reported diagnoses. The Event Files contained

detailed event-level information, including diagnoses, for each office-based medical provider

visit and prescribed medication.

        The NSCH is a cross-sectional, nationally representative telephone survey sponsored

by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and conducted by the National Center for Health

Statistics.29-30 The NSCH interviewed 102,353 households with children younger than 18




                                                                                                   8
years of age between January 2003 and July 2004. The NSCH was designed to produce

national and state-level prevalence data for a number of physical and behavioral health

indicators for children. For our purpose, it identified children who had been diagnosed with

asthma and elicited information on the frequency of asthma attacks and the severity of health

difficulties related to asthma (see below). We used the NSCH to study the effect of family

structure on children’s asthma outcomes.



Study Samples

       Due to the clinical ambiguity in diagnosing asthma in very young children, we

restricted our study sample to children 2-17 years of age in both the MEPS and the NSCH

who had been told by a health professional that they had asthma. As described below, we

only included children living in two-parent families or in single-mother families. The 1996-

2003 MEPS included 2,657 such children, and the 2003 NSCH included 11,177 such

children.



Family Structure Variables

       MEPS’s reporting unit is a family-based entity defined as a person or group of persons

living in the same dwelling who are related by blood, marriage, adoption, foster care, or other

family associations.22-28 For this study, we defined a child’s family as the people, including

other children, in the same reporting unit. We defined two-parent families as families where

both the father and the mother (biological, adopted, or step) of the subject child were living

with the child. Correspondingly, we defined single-mother families as families where the




                                                                                                 9
child’s mother was living with the child but the father was absent. Due to their small

numbers, we excluded children living in single-father families.

       The NSCH collapsed family structure types into four categories in order to protect the

confidentiality of children whose families had unique characteristics.30 The categories are: (1)

two-parent households that include a biological or adoptive mother and a biological or

adoptive father; (2) two-parent households but with at least one step-parent; (3) one-parent

households with a biological, adoptive, or step mother but no father of any type present; and

(4) all other family types. To match the MEPS definitions, we designated children in the first

two categories as having two-parent families and children in the third category as living in

single-mother families. We excluded other family types.


Classification of Asthma Medications

       The control of asthma symptoms and the long-term course of the disease are largely

determined by the adequacy of treatment with prescription medications. Based on Guidelines

for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (NHLBI/NAEPP), 31 we counted and

categorized prescribed medications for asthma in MEPS as “Reliever Medications,”

“Controller Medications,” and “Oral Steroids.” Reliever medications offer immediate relief

of asthma symptoms but do not alter the fundamental course of the disease. This category

consists mainly of inhaled short-acting β2-agonists. Controller medications do not provide

immediate relief of symptoms, but rather prevent symptoms from developing and, more

important, modify the long-term course of the disease. This category includes inhaled

steroids, long-acting β2-agonists, leukotriene modifiers, and cromolyn derivatives. Current

guidelines indicate that all but patients with mild intermittent asthma should receive controller




                                                                                               10
medications routinely.31 Oral steroids are usually given in short courses of a few days to

control severe asthma attacks.



Statistical Analysis

        Using the MEPS sample, we estimated multivariate regression models with four

measures of asthma care as dependent variables: (1) number of office-based provider visits for

asthma; (2) number of prescriptions filled for reliever medications; (3) number of

prescriptions filled for controller medications; and (4) number of prescriptions filled for oral

steroids. Since these variables assume small, non-negative integer values, we used negative

binomial regression to model them.32 Because a child’s first diagnosis of asthma can occur

during the MEPS data collection period, we calculated the relevant number of days of

observation with asthma for each asthmatic child and used this number as an offset term in the

negative binomial models.*

        Using the NSCH sample, we estimated multivariate regression models with two

measures of the severity of each child’s asthma symptoms as dependent variables: (1) the

severity of health difficulties caused by asthma, derived from the survey question “would you

(the parent) describe the health difficulties caused by [his/her] asthma as mild, moderate, or

severe?”, and (2) whether the child had an asthma attack during the past 12 months, derived

from the question “during the past 12 months, has [he/she] had an episode of asthma or an

asthma attack?” We used ordinal logistic regression to model health difficulties caused by



*
  We assessed whether a zero-inflated negative binomial model was more appropriate for our data than the non-
flated version using the Vuong statistic41, which has as its null hypothesis the equivalence of the two models.
Only for controller medications was there any suggestion that the zero-inflated model might be superior (two-
sided p=0.14; one-sided p=0.07). However, adjusted predictions of the number of prescriptions for controller
medications by family structure were nearly identical using both models. Therefore, in the paper we report
results for the non-inflated models.


                                                                                                             11
asthma and binary logistic regression to model whether the child had an asthma attack.33 We

conducted analyses on the full sample of 11,177 children in the NSCH who had been told by a

health professional they had asthma and, separately, on the subsample of 7,956 children who

reported their asthma was active.

        The key explanatory variables in both the MEPS and NSCH analyses were the family

structure variables: (1) an indicator variable for living in a single-mother family (versus a

two-parent family); and (2) indicator variables for the number of other children in the

household, categorized as zero, one, two, or three or more.

        Other explanatory variables in the MEPS models included indicator variables for the

child’s age; sex; race or ethnicity, categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,

Hispanic, or other; family income, categorized as poor (<1.00 times the federal poverty line),

low-income (1.00-1.99 times poverty), middle-income (2.0-3.99 times poverty), or high-

income (4.00+ times poverty); insurance coverage, categorized as uninsured, private

insurance, or public insurance; and residence in a metropolitan area. We also included

indicator variables for the child’s birth order, categorized as first, second, or third or higher;

whether the child had an older sibling with asthma; the mother’s education, categorized as no

high school, some high school, high school graduate, or some college or higher; the mother’s

age, categorized as 25 years or younger, 26-35 years, 36 years or older; and the year of the

data. We included birth order and whether an older sibling had asthma to capture differences

in parents’ experience with child-rearing and taking care of children with asthma. We

included maternal education and age to capture differences in mothers’ knowledge about

health and health care as well as additional dimensions of their judgment and life experience.




                                                                                                     12
       Since MEPS did not contain direct measures of asthma severity, and since the intrinsic

severity of asthma affects the need for and use of care, we also included as explanatory

variables in the MEPS models several health status variables that are likely to be correlated

with asthma severity. These variables included the child’s self-rated (or parent-rated) general

health, categorized as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor; the parent’s report that the

child was “not being as healthy as other children;” the parent’s report of any health limitation

for the child; and the child having sinusitis, otitis media, or upper respiratory infections during

the data collection period.

       Other explanatory variables in the NSCH models mirrored those in the MEPS models,

with a few exceptions. Thus the explanatory variables in the NSCH models included

indicators for the child’s age, sex, race or ethnicity, family income, insurance coverage,

residence in a metropolitan area, and birth order. However, NSCH did not report maternal

education, but rather the highest level of education obtained by anyone in the household,

which we categorized as no high school degree, high school graduate, and some college or

higher. Additionally, NSCH did not include information on maternal age or whether the child

had an older sibling with asthma. Finally, because the dependent variables in the NSCH

models were asthma outcomes, we did not include measures of health status as explanatory

variables in the NSCH models.

       To facilitate interpretation of the regression results, we used the coefficient estimates

from the negative binomial and logistic regression models to obtain the predicted mean

number of visits and prescriptions and the predicted distribution of severity of asthma

symptoms for each value of each family structure variable (e.g., each value of number of

parents), adjusted for all the other explanatory variables. Thus, for the MEPS sample, we




                                                                                                 13
used the estimated coefficients from the negative binomial models to predict the number of

visits and prescriptions for each child, alternately assigning the child to each category of the

family structure variable of interest (e.g., single-mother vs. two-parent family), but leaving all

other explanatory variables at their original values including the offset term. Next, we

annualized the individual predictions by multiplying by 365 and dividing by the number of

days used as the offset. Last, we averaged the annualized predictions across all the children in

the MEPS sample. This procedure yields what the mean annual number of visits and

prescriptions would be if all children in the sample lived in each particular type of family

(e.g., single-mother or two-parent family), but otherwise retained the original values of all

their other characteristics. Similarly, for the NSCH sample, we predicted the probabilities of

no, mild, moderate, and severe health difficulties from asthma and of having an asthma attack

during the past 12 months for each child, alternately assigning the child to each category of

the family structure variable of interest, but leaving all other explanatory variables at their

original values. We then averaged the individual predicted probabilities across all the

children in the NSCH sample.

       We weighted all analyses using weights that reflect the sample design of the MEPS

and the NSCH as well as survey non-response, and we adjusted all standard errors for

clustering using the Huber-White sandwich estimator.34-36

                                           RESULTS

Descriptive Data

       Table 1 shows that the characteristics of the MEPS and NSCH samples were similar in

most respects, reflecting the fact that both surveys are nationally representative. About 30 %

of asthmatic children lived with a single mother and just under one-fourth lived with no other




                                                                                                   14
children, nearly two-fifths lived with one other child, and about one-fourth lived with two

other children. One-fifth of asthmatic children were black, about 15% were Hispanic, and

one-fifth were poor. Only 6 % of asthmatic children were uninsured, and most had private

health insurance. The major difference between the MEPS and NSCH samples was in

residential location: More than four-fifths of asthmatic children in the MEPS sample lived in

metropolitan areas, compared with less than three-fourths in the NSCH sample.

Approximately 56 % of asthmatic children were first born and 30 % were second born; 12%

of the children in the MEPS sample had an older sibling with asthma.

       The children in the MEPS sample averaged two office-based visits for asthma during

their period of observation with asthma (mean, 528 days), and 56% had at least one such visit

(Table 2). Three-fifths of the children filled at least one prescription for a reliever medication,

compared with about 30% who filled at least one controller-medication prescription.

However, the children who filled at least one controller-medication prescription averaged

more than five such prescriptions, suggesting that many of them used these medications

continuously. Nearly 30% of the children in the NSCH sample reported that their asthma was

inactive, and just under half reported mild health difficulties from asthma. About 46% of the

sample had an asthma attack during the preceding 12 months.



Multivariate Analyses

       We found a significant effect of family structure on the care children received for

asthma, adjusting for all the other explanatory variables in the regression models (Table 3).

Thus, compared with children living in two-parent families, asthmatic children with a single

mother had fewer office-based visits annually for asthma (1.38 vs. 1.74, P<.10), filled fewer




                                                                                                15
prescriptions for reliever medications (1.45 vs. 1.71, P<.10), and filled substantially fewer

prescriptions for controller medications (0.86 vs. 1.39, P<.01). Additionally, compared with

children who lived with no other children, asthmatic children who lived with two or more

other children had fewer visits for asthma and filled fewer prescriptions each year for asthma

medications. Specifically, children living with no other children had 1.91 visits annually,

whereas children living with two other children had 1.32 visits (P<.05) and children living

with three or more other children had 1.06 visits (P<.01). Children living with no other

children filled 1.90 prescriptions annually for reliever medications, whereas children living

with two other children filled 1.45 prescriptions (P<.05) and children living with three or

more other children filled 1.20 prescriptions (P<.01). Children living with no other children

filled 1.55 prescriptions annually for controller medications, whereas children living with

three or more other children only filled 0.92 prescriptions (P<.05). Finally, children living

with no other children filled 0.31 prescriptions each year for oral steroids, whereas children

living with three or more other children filled 0.16 prescriptions (P<.10). (Of note, the

adjusted means shown in Table 3 are not comparable to the unadjusted means in Table 2

because the former are annualized and the latter are not.)

       We also found that family structure was associated with asthma outcomes, although

these results were weaker and less consistent than those for asthma care. In analyses using the

full NSCH sample, children in single-mother families were more likely than children with two

parents to have moderate or severe health difficulties caused by their asthma (P<.10) (Fig. 1,

Panel A). However, the number of other children in the household was unassociated with the

severity of health difficulties from asthma. Further, family structure was unassociated with




                                                                                                 16
health difficulties from asthma in analyses using the sub-sample of children with active

asthma (Fig. 1, Panel B).

       In analyses using the sub-sample of children with active asthma, those who lived with

two other children were more likely than those living with no other children to have an

asthma attack during the preceding 12 months (P<.05) (Fig. 2, Panel B). Based on a similar

point estimate for children living with three or more other children, we conducted a post hoc

analysis in which we created a combined category for children with active asthma who lived

with two or more other children. We found that these children were more likely than children

living with no other children to have an asthma attack in the past 12 months (P<.05). We

found no other significant associations between family structure and the probability of having

an asthma attack.

       Findings for other explanatory variables in the MEPS models were generally

consistent with expectations based on prior studies (see Appendix I).18-21 For example, race

and ethnicity had independent effects on asthma care, with black and Hispanic children filling

more prescriptions for reliever medications than white children. Children of more highly

educated mothers had more office-based visits and filled more prescriptions for controller

medications than children of mothers with less education. Insured children had more office-

based visits than their uninsured counterparts, and publicly insured children filled more

prescriptions of all types than uninsured children.

       Several findings for other explanatory variables in the NSCH models were also

noteworthy (see Appendix II). Black and Hispanic children reported more severe health

difficulties from asthma than white children; however, Hispanic children had a lower

probability than white children of having an attack during the past 12 months. Non-poor




                                                                                               17
children had less severe health difficulties from asthma than poor children, and children with

private insurance had less severe health difficulties than uninsured children.



                                         DISCUSSION

       This study is the first to link family structure to the care children with asthma receive

and to their asthma outcomes. We found that children who lived with a single mother and

children who lived with two or more other children had fewer office-based visits for asthma

and used less asthma medication than children in two-parent families and children who lived

with no other children, respectively. We also found weaker evidence that children who lived

with a single mother and children who lived with two or more other children experienced

more severe asthma symptoms than their peers. The most straightforward interpretation of

these findings is that asthmatic children who live with a single mother or with two or more

other children receive less adequate asthma care than their peers, and that the less adequate

care results in worse control of their disease.

       In support of this interpretation, the effects of family structure on asthma visits and

prescription medications are likely to be large enough to have clinical consequences. For

instance, children in single-mother families filled 38% fewer prescriptions for controller

medications than children in two-parent families, and children living with three or more other

children filled 41% fewer prescriptions that children living with no other children (Table 3).

These represent sizable reductions in the use of medications that are vital for the control of

asthma symptoms and prevention of exacerbations. Similarly, the differences in asthma visits

across families of different types represent very different intensities of monitoring and follow-

up. For example, the predicted mean numbers of asthma visits correspond to a visit every 6.3




                                                                                                 18
months for an average child living with no other children and a visit every 11.3 months for an

average child living with three or more other children.

        The mechanisms through which family structure affects the asthma care children

receive are likely to be rooted in differences across types of families in the time and attention

parents can devote to monitoring and managing their children’s health. Numerous studies

have found that family structure influences children’s cognitive, educational, and behavioral

outcomes.1-10 As noted earlier, children in single-parent households have worse educational

outcomes than children from two-parent households.1 Similarly, Blake has argued that the

higher the number of children, the more parental resources are divided, even taking into

account economies of scale.2-3 Studies demonstrating an inverse relationship between number

of siblings and children’s intellectual development and educational achievement are

consistent with this framework.4-5, 7-10, 37

        Our findings suggest that the asthma care children receive may be susceptible to the

dilution of parental resources as well. In single-mother families and in families with many

children, parents may not have the time, energy, or financial resources to monitor each child’s

symptoms and/or take the child for care as needed. This view is consistent with earlier studies

on family structure and children’s office visits and immunization status.13-15, 16, 38-39

        The most salient threat to the validity of our inferences regarding the effects of family

structure on the adequacy of asthma care is an unrecognized association between family

structure and the intrinsic severity of childhood asthma. Thus, if children who live with a

single mother or with several other children intrinsically have less severe asthma than their

counterparts who live with two parents or with no other children, our findings regarding

family structure and asthma care could reflect appropriate patterns of care. We could not




                                                                                                19
definitively rule out such an unrecognized association because the MEPS data did not include

direct measures of asthma severity. Nonetheless, an unrecognized association is unlikely to

be a factor in our study for three reasons. First, our multivariate analyses of MEPS data

controlled for a wide array of variables that are correlated with asthma severity including

sociodemographic characteristics and several measures of health status. These indirect

measures of asthma severity likely provide considerable protection against bias from an

unrecognized association. Second, the unrecognized association of concern would be

expected to be reflected in the NSCH analyses, and specifically, in finding that children in

single-mother families and children living with several other children had less severe asthma

symptoms than their peers. In fact, we found evidence for the opposite pattern. Third, we

know of no clinical reason why family structure should be associated with the intrinsic

severity of asthma after controlling for sociodemographic factors.

       Our study has several additional limitations. First, as in any observational study, our

findings may be subject to omitted variable bias from unobserved parental or family

characteristics. In particular, studies suggest that single mothers may differ from married

mothers in their attitudes about family, work, and parenting, and that these differences in

attitudes may influence a child’s home and family environment as well as parent-child

relationships1, 40. Possibly these differences in attitudes also influence the health care parents

seek for their children. We know of no evidence to suggest that parents’ choices regarding

number of children are related to their attitudes about family or parenting.

       Second, we did not study single-father families; thus our findings cannot be

generalized to these families. Third, we used two complimentary data sources to assess the

effect of family structure on asthma care and asthma symptoms, but our analyses did not




                                                                                                20
establish a direct link between decreased use of visits and medications and worse symptom

control. Fourth, we were unable to account for differences across Hispanic subgroups in

asthma severity. Last, we analyzed filled prescriptions because we had no information on

medication adherence. In a related vein, we had no information on whether children received

free medications from their providers or whether they shared medications, especially inhalers,

with asthmatic siblings.

       Despite these limitations, our study sheds important new light on the role of families

in children’s asthma care and outcomes. Our findings suggest that children can be vulnerable

to inadequate asthma care as a result of the makeup of their families, and that health care

providers who treat children must plan and monitor their care in the context of their family

circumstances.11 In particular, providers should monitor especially closely the care received

by and clinical status of as asthmatic children who live with single mothers or with several

siblings. Our findings also imply that policies that provide support for working single mothers

or parents with many children, such as family leave days, may enable parents to take their

children for health care while alleviating stress and other demands on their time.

† Panel A is for the sample of children ever told to have asthma, and Panel B is for

children who report active asthma during the survey year. Each stacked column

displays the predicted distribution of severity of health difficulties from asthma for a

particular value of the family structure variable of interest. For example, the column

farthest to the left in Panel A shows that, if all children ever told to have asthma lived

with no other children, 29 percent would have no health difficulties from asthma, 46

percent would have mild difficulties, 21 percent would have moderate difficulties, and 4

percent would have severe difficulties. Predicted percents are adjusted for all the other

explanatory variables in the model (see text). Predicted percents for each family structure

variable (e.g., number of parents) are also adjusted for the other family structure variable.

§Comparison category for the variable.

* P < 0.10 for test of difference with the comparison category.

† Panel A is for the sample of children ever told to have asthma, and Panel B is for

children who report active asthma during the survey year. Each stacked column

                                                                                                       35
past year for a particular value of the family structure variable of interest. For example,

the column farthest to the left in Panel A shows that, if all children ever told to have

asthma lived with no other children, 55 percent would have an asthma attack during the

past 12 months. Predicted values are adjusted for all the other explanatory variables in the

model (see text). Predicted values for each family structure variable (e.g., number of parents)

are also adjusted for the other family structure variable.

§Comparison category for the variable.

* P < 0.10 for test of difference with the comparison category.

** P < 0.05 for test of difference with the comparison category.
