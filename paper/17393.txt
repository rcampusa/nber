                                             ABSTRACT

Large shareholders may play an important role for firm performance and policies, but identifying this
empirically presents a challenge due to the endogeneity of ownership structures. We develop and test
an empirical framework which allows us to separate selection from treatment effects of large shareholders.
Individual blockholders tend to hold blocks in public firms located close to where they reside. Using
this empirical observation, we develop an instrument – the density of wealthy individuals near a firm’s
headquarters – for the presence of a large, non-managerial individual shareholder in a firm. These
shareholders have a large impact on firms, controlling for selection effects.

1. Introduction
        A public firm’s shareholders have extensive legal control rights in the corporation, but in practice

much of this control is delegated to managers. In companies with small, dispersed shareholders, owners

may find it costly to coordinate and exercise monitoring and control, leaving management with

considerable discretion. The resulting agency problems between owners and managers may be severe

(e.g., Berle and Means (1932) and Jensen and Meckling (1976)).1 By concentrating a block of shares in

the hands of a single decision maker, large shareholders may play a beneficial role in remedying these

agency problems and facilitating effective owner control (e.g., Grossman and Hart (1980) and Shleifer

and Vishny (1986)). A large shareholder may restrain managers from extracting rents and thereby

improve firm performance, benefitting all shareholders. Other theories predict that a block in a firm may

be costly. Large shareholders may, e.g., reduce the liquidity of a firm’s shares (because they make

asymmetric information problems more severe), or influence firm policies in some way that is not in the

interest of small shareholders (e.g. favoring tax-inefficient forms of cash distribution).

        Testing these theories about the effects of large owners is challenging. Researchers in corporate

finance have recognized for more than 20 years (at least since Demsetz and Lehn (1985)) the difficulty of

causal inference in studies of ownership and performance. Suppose for example that blockholders

systematically target firms with poor performance because of the potential performance increases due to

improved monitoring, or that they select more liquid stocks because of the relatively lower cost of

creating a block. Suppose also, as predicted by theory, that conditional on such selection, blockholder

monitoring improves operating profitability and reduces the liquidity of the firm’s shares. If this is the

case, then OLS regressions of performance or stock liquidity on block presence in a firm confound

selection effects and treatment effects of block ownership. In this paper, we develop and test a new

instrumental variable framework which allows us to separate these effects for a large group of

 There is a large literature on manager-shareholder conflicts. Demsetz (1983) argues that a manager may extract
non-pecuniary benefits to the detriment of shareholders. Jensen (1986) and Jensen (1989) argue that managers
expropriate small, dispersed shareholders by diverting corporate resources for empire building or perk consumption.

blockholders. This allows us to quantify the impact of large owners on several key aspects of firm

behavior.

         Our analysis focuses on individual non-managerial blockholders and excludes, e.g., blocks held

by mutual funds and other institutions. This is motivated by the limitations of our identification strategy

(i.e. what our instrument predicts), but is also appealing when testing predictions from theories of large

shareholders. Non-management individuals who hold a large block of shares in a firm seem to naturally

fit with the notion of having a principal present in the firm because they are generally less constrained

than institutional investors from being active monitors of management. They do not face the regulatory

constraints of many mutual funds and pension funds (e.g., Black (1990) and Roe (1990)), they are not

afraid of losing money management business (e.g., Brickley, Lease and Smith (1988) and Davis and Kim

(2007)), and they come with fewer agency problems of their own (e.g., Diamond (1984)).2                Managers

who are also blockholders have interests that may differ dramatically from that of other owners (see e.g.

Barclay and Holderness (1989)). Thus, non-management individual blocks appear to fit well to theories of

outside monitors.

         Our instrument for the presence of a large shareholder in a firm is the number of high net worth

individuals in the state where a firm is headquartered divided by the number of public firms

headquartered in the state, which we refer to as wealth density.3 This variable is a valid instrument for the

presence of blocks in local firms if it is correlated with the frequency of such blocks (relevancy condition)

but impacts the dependent variables only through its effect on block ownership (exclusion restriction).

Our instrument reflects economic forces important for the presence of a block in a firm. The relevancy

condition is easiest to evaluate. First, blockholders exhibit a preference for firms headquartered near

  While institutions are not generally active owners, some institutions are more active than others. There is evidence
from the 1980s and early 1990s that some public pension funds, e.g., CalPERS, were active in corporate governance
(e.g., Smith (1996) and Del Guercio and Hawkins (1999)). Also, Brav, Jiang, Partnoy and Thomas (2008) compare
firms before and after an activist hedge fund accumulates a stake and find significant changes in performance and
firm policies.

  To the best of our knowledge, there is no database available that reliably captures U.S. wealth distribution on a
finer scale than state level (such as Metropolitan Statistical Areas).

                                                          2
where they live, presumably because of lower monitoring costs or asymmetric information.4 The median

distance between a non-managerial individual blockholder and the firm in which they have a block is 42.5

miles. Second, personal wealth is likely a determinant of an individual’s ability to invest a large stake in

a public firm. Finally, there is significant cross-state variation in the wealth density instrument, possibly

reflecting exogenously attractive areas or the fact that wealthy people prefer to live near other wealthy

individuals because of social reasons or similar tastes (e.g., Glaeser (1998)). We find that our instrument

predicts the presence of a block in a firm with considerable power. The economic magnitude of the

estimated effect is large: moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile wealth density increases the predicted

probability of a block in a local firm from 8.7 percent to 12.8 percent, i.e., it increases the probability by

about 50 percent.

        While there is no statistical test of the validity of the exclusion restriction in the presence of a

single instrument, we provide several empirical observations and arguments to support its validity. First,

our instrument comes from inheritance data, i.e., deceased wealthy individuals, so it reflects “old money”,

limiting the impact of local wealth-creating events such as initial public offerings of local firms, which

may directly affect current firm performance and policies. Second, if wealth density was correlated with

firm-specific variables measuring the demand for a block in a firm, we would expect it to also predict the

presence of blocks other than non-managerial individual blocks. We find that wealth density does not

predict the presence of blocks by managers or institutional investors. We return to a more detailed

discussion of the validity of our instrument in Section 4.4.

        Our empirical evidence is consistent with theories of large shareholders as monitors of

management. We find that blocks are not randomly allocated to firms, but large shareholders

systematically target firms based on where the benefits from additional monitoring are expected to be

more significant, e.g., smaller and relatively poorly performing firms. Controlling for such block

selection, we find that the presence of a large shareholder significantly reduces a firm’s investments,

mutual funds, and Bailey, Kumar and Ng (2008) for retail investors.

reduces corporate cash holdings, increases payouts to shareholders, reduces total top-executive pay, and

increases firm performance. Firms with blockholders also have significantly more outside directors on

their boards. In addition to monitoring benefits we also find that block presence comes with some costs.

One such cost is less liquid publicly traded shares. This may reflect a smaller float as well as the presence

of privately informed traders (i.e., the blockholders).

        The paper contributes to existing research on large shareholders’ impact on firms by explicitly

addressing the endogeneity of the ownership structure.     In his survey, Holderness (2003) emphasizes

endogeneity problems in analyzing block ownership and concludes that “[s]urprisingly few major

corporate decisions have been shown to be different in the presence of a blockholder” (p. 60).

Controlling for selection effects dramatically changes our inference about block impact on firm behavior.

We show that large shareholders indeed play a large role for corporate governance in large public U.S.

firms, and can have large effects on several firm policies. For example, large shareholders target firms

with poor performance, but conditional on doing so, they improve performance, consistent with

monitoring theories of blockholders. In addition to effects on performance, we test for a large

shareholder’s impact on corporate policies, many of which have not been previously analyzed, and we

find evidence consistent with blockholder monitoring causing changes in these policies. On the other

hand, capital structure does not appear much affected by large shareholders. In general, our findings are

consistent with the interpretation that firms in areas with a relatively low supply of potential block holders

display the characteristics of firms with more severe agency problems between owners and managers.

        For three reasons, there are no clear policy implications of our findings. First, because large

shareholders and small shareholders do not necessarily have coinciding preferences about firm policy,

behavioral changes that benefit one may not benefit the other. Encouraging block formation may not be

beneficial on net. Second, our results are limited to non-institutional outsiders, which are scarce, and

difficult to produce. Blocks held by mutual funds and other institutions (which can more easily be grown)

may have very different impact on firms. Finally, the potential impact of blockholder is likely different




                                                      4
across different individuals and firms. The firms where we observe blockholders are likely to be the ones

where the potential benefits are the largest.

        The second contribution of our paper is to show that the local supply of potential blockholders

(i.e., the local supply of one potentially important governance mechanism) in the area where a firm is

headquartered may have significant effects on firm behavior, i.e. that geography matters for the

ownership structure of firms (see Coval and Moskowitz (1999) for related patterns for institutional stock

ownership). We use these patterns to empirically model the supply side of large shareholders. This allows

us to examine whether ownership structure impacts firms’ behavior, controlling for selection effects. The

economics of the supply of blocks is largely unexplored in the governance literature, perhaps because the

focus has mainly been on partial equilibrium analysis and results (see, however, Gorton and Kahl (2008)

for a recent exception).

        Our paper also relates to work in corporate governance which attempts to address endogeneity

problems. Coles, Lemmon, and Wang (2008) and Coles, Lemmon, and Meschke (2005) develop

structural models of finance and governance, which on theory can allow econometricians to estimate

underlying parameters. Several papers in this area use natural experiments generated by legal changes,

including Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) (changes in antitakeover laws) and Pérez-González (2005)

(the abolishment of foreign majority ownership regulations in Mexico). Several papers use the passage of

the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as an exogenous change (e.g., Chhaochharia and Grinstein (2007) and Hochberg,

Sapienza and Vissing-Jorgensen (2007)). See also Hochberg and Lindsey (2009) who use a labor-based

instrument in a corporate finance context, and Kedia and Rajgopal (2009), who find that option grants

vary geographically. In contrast to these papers, we develop an instrumental variable for the incidence of

large, private shareholders in a firm.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the role of large shareholders in the

governance of public corporations. Section 3 describes our data. Section 4 defines the instrument,

describes the econometric model that we use to identify and quantify the impact of blocks on firms, and




                                                     5
examines the validity of the instrument. Section 5 analyzes the impact of large shareholders on firm

performance and corporate policies using our two-stage selection model. Section 6 concludes.


2. Large Shareholders and Corporate Governance

    2.1. Monitoring and the effects of large shareholders

        Theory suggests that large shareholder monitoring may have a significant impact on several

aspects of firm behavior, including a firm’s operating profitability, corporate investment policy, and

choice of financial and executive compensation policies. In this section, we review theories of large

shareholders and discuss the empirical predictions which we test in the remainder of the paper.

        Theories with a beneficial view of large shareholders typically start by positing agency problems

between owners and managers, and by assuming that large owners are able to reduce these. Due to the

size of their stake, they either have better incentives to monitor or more power to influence decisions than

small, dispersed owners.5

        Large shareholders use their influence over firm behavior in several ways. They may affect

operating decisions by monitoring management. This can result in improved project selection and

investment levels, and possibly reduced waste. Demsetz and Lehn (1985) argue that blockholder

monitoring restrains managers from consuming firm resources, thereby improving performance. Also,

the presence of a block may mitigate overinvestment by management and improve the investment

efficiency of the targeted firm (Jensen (1986)). To test these predictions empirically, we examine the

impact of large shareholders on measures of operating performance (e.g., ROA), costs (such as SG&A

expenses), and investment behavior.

        Blockholders may also affect firms’ financial policies. Again, the starting point of the argument

is that managers may want to deviate from optimal capital structures (i.e. optimal in the view of owners).



5
 Some recent theories argue that large shareholders can exert governance even if they do not intervene in a firm’s
operations (e.g., Admati and Pfleiderer (2009) and Edmans (2009)).

                                                         6
Managers may prefer lower leverage to reduce firm risk and protect their underdiversified human capital

(e.g., Fama (1980)). Alternatively, managers may prefer to increase leverage in order to inflate the voting

power of their equity stakes (see Harris and Raviv (1988) and Stulz (1988)). In either case, there is a role

for large shareholder monitoring related to capital structure decisions. In terms of payout policy and cash

holdings, managers may prefer lower payouts as they reduce the amount of resources under

management’s control and subject managers to capital markets discipline when the firm requires external

financing (e.g., Easterbrook (1984) and Jensen (1986)). Monitoring by a large shareholder may restrict

managers from reducing payouts or holding too much cash.

        CEO pay is perhaps the most obvious potential source of conflicts between management and

owners. Whether CEOs are paid excessively and set their own pay is a question which has been subject to

considerable debate and academic research (see, e.g., Bebchuk and Fried (2004) for a review of this

work). Because large shareholders may restrain rent extraction by a firm’s CEO, we examine whether the

presence of a block reduces CEO pay.


    2.2. The costs of large shareholders

        There are several potential costs of having a large owner. For example, monitoring may reduce

managerial initiative (e.g., Burkart, Gromb and Panunzi (1997)). Even when the presence of a block is ex

post efficient, in the sense that the owner will improve investment decisions, the possibility of future

intervention may reduce a manager’s ex ante incentive to exert effort and to search for value-increasing

investment opportunities (in the Burkart et al. model, this happens because the manager will sometimes

be overruled by active owners, reducing his utility). The net effect of concentrated ownership, i.e. the

benefits of monitoring versus the cost of reduced managerial incentives, is indeterminate. In the model,

the net effect depends on the size of the monitoring shareholder’s stake. This theory thus predicts that the

impact of blockholders on firm financial performance is ambiguous.

        Another potential cost of large shareholders is reduced liquidity in a firm’s publicly traded shares.

Glosten and Milgrom (1985) suggest that one cause of stock market illiquidity is the presence of privately


                                                      7
informed traders.      One such group of potentially informed traders is blockholders (especially in our

sample, which precedes Regulation FD). Holmstrom and Tirole (1993) model how concentrated

ownership reduces incentives for information production in the stock market by reducing liquidity. Bhide

(1993) argues that large shareholders who reduce agency problems by monitoring management may also

reduce stock liquidity by increasing informational asymmetries. Based on these theoretical predictions,

we test whether blocks impact the liquidity of a firm’s shares using measures of stock liquidity (e.g.,

Amihud’s illiquidity measure).

        Other theories argue that blockholder-liquidity causality might go in the opposite direction of the

above arguments. For example, Kahn and Winton (1998) model the choice to exit or monitor/intervene to

improve firm performance, and predict that intervention is less likely when the firm’s stock is more liquid

because of the lower cost of exit. Maug (1998) argues that liquidity may reduce the cost of creating a

block because it makes it less costly to purchase more shares, so we would expect more blocks in firms

with more liquid stocks. Our instrumental variables approach will allow us to test and isolate the causal

effect of blocks on liquidity without selection effects confounding the estimates. Several theories

explicitly consider the trade-offs that result from the simultaneous benefits and costs of large

shareholders. For example, Bolton and von Thadden (1998) argue that large shareholders reduce the

threat of takeovers.


3. Data

    3.1. Data on large shareholders

        We analyze an unbalanced panel of large publicly traded U.S. corporations from 1996-2001. The

sample consists of non-dual class S&P 1500 firms and was originally compiled by Dlugosz, Fahlenbrach,

Gompers and Metrick (2006) (DFGM) who identify a firm’s 5% blockholders, if any.6 The raw database



6
 Available from Wharton Research Data Services, http://wrds.wharton.upenn.edu. The use of annual data may
underestimate the true number of large shareholders because some blockholders can enter and exit our panel within

                                                        8
contains 1,919 different firms, 18,818 blockholder-firm-year observations, and approximately 7,600 firm-

year observations.7 We exclude financial firms and utilities, which reduces the sample to approximately

6,000 firm-year observations. Firms are included in our sample whether or not they have any large

shareholder.

        We define a large shareholder as a non-managerial individual blockholder if it meets both of the

following criteria. First, an individual has the sole voting power of the block. Second, this individual is

neither a current nor a former officer of the firm (e.g., we exclude Bill Gates’ block in Microsoft). We

identify current and former officers through proxy statements and a Dow Jones Interactive news search.

We exclude holdings by current and former officers’ spouses or trusts (e.g., the Bill and Melinda Gates

Trust). We exclude blocks held by second generation family members only if a family member is an

officer (e.g., the block by the Hewlett and Packard families is included as the family has non-executive

directorships but none of the family members are officers of HP). Our dataset contains 715 firm-year

observations with at least one non-managerial individual blockholder.


    3.2. The location of large shareholders

        We obtain data on the geographic location (zip code) of each block in our sample from firms’

proxy statements. We exclude blocks located abroad. For some individuals who are officers or directors,

the proxy statements do not give an address, but state “Same address as company”. We thus

underestimate the actual distance between the location of some individuals and firm headquarters. Also,

when individuals have multiple residences, we use the one reported in the proxy. We obtain zip codes of

firm headquarters from the Execucomp database, the Compact Disclosure discs, or hand-collect them

from proxy statements. Finally, we identify the latitude and longitude of each blockholder and firm by

matching the zip codes to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Gazetteer Place and Zip Code Database.

a year, thus not showing up in firms’ proxy statements. If some large shareholders choose to own a stake below the
5% reporting threshold, they also do not show up in the proxy statements and in the DFGM database.
7
  The database has 20,975 blockholder entries. However, not all of these entries are 5% blockholders. For example,
“Karen Smith” and “Peter Smith” are recorded in the raw data, but they jointly hold shares through the “Smith
Family Trust.” Conditioning on the final blockholder flag in the DFGM database will eliminate Karen Smith and
Peter Smith, and retain only the Smith Family Trust.

                                                        9
           We compute the distance (in miles) from a blockholder to each of its firms’ headquarters using

the methodology of Coval and Moskowitz (1999). Table 1 reports a mean distance of 385.4 miles and a

small median distance of 28.5 miles for non-managerial individual blockholders. More than half (61%)

are located in the same state as the firm in which they hold a block. Not surprisingly, the median distance

between blockholder residence and firm headquarters for managerial blocks is zero and more than 90% of

all managerial large shareholders are located in the same state as the corporate headquarters. The results

are significantly different for institutional investors. The median distance between mutual fund (money

manager) headquarters and the headquarters of the firms in which they own large stakes is 1,158 miles

(871 miles). Less than 10% of all mutual fund and money manager headquarters are located in the same

state as the corporate headquarters of their block investments.


       3.3. Geographic data

           Our data for the geographic distribution of high net worth individuals are from the Statistics of

Income (SOI) program at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).8 It reports the number of high net worth

individuals in each state, estimated from estate tax return filings. The SOI reports estimates of the

number of high net-worth individuals by state in 1995, 1998 and 2001 as well as their estimated average

wealth. The definition of high net worth varies somewhat from year to year. In 1995, it is net wealth of

$0.6 to $10 million (in terms of counting the total number of high net worth individuals, the upper cutoff

makes a minor difference). In 1998 and 2001, the lower limit is $1 million and there is no upper limit.

However, the three cross-sections are very similar. We use 1995 data because they predate the block

observations in our sample, but we have also used 1995 data for 1996-1998 and 1998 data for 1999-2001,

as well as 1998 data for all years, with very small differences in results.

           We also collect several control variables that vary at the state level. We obtain education,

population and income data from the Census Bureau. We collect corporate income tax rates for 2000 (we

have used other years as well) from various sources. When there are multiple brackets we use the rates

applying for highest income levels.


    3.4. Firm variables

        The theories of large shareholders discussed in Section 2 predict that large shareholders can

impact a broad set of corporate decisions:

        (i) Operating performance. We analyze return on assets (ROA) and return on sales (ROS). We

          also analyze cost cutting policy (scaled SG&A expenses) and investments (scaled capital

          expenditures).

        (ii) Capital structure. We analyze measures of book and market leverage.

        (iii) Resources and payout policy. We analyze total payout as a fraction of EBITDA and cash

            holdings.

        (iv) Managerial compensation and board structure. We analyze the log of total CEO pay and the

            fraction of pay in equity. We also analyze the number of outside directors on the board.

        (v) Liquidity. We analyze trading volume and the illiquidity measure of Amihud (2002).

        Our data source for annual accounting variables is Compustat. We exclude observations with

explanatory variables in the top and bottom 1%, but we have also used winsorizing at the 1% level with

very small differences in results. Our data sources for CEO compensation and board structure are the

Execucomp database and the IRRC director database, respectively. The data used to calculate the

liquidity measures come from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). All variables are

defined in Appendix A.

        Table 2 reports summary statistics. Panel A shows that there exists at least one non-managerial

individual block in 11.8% of all firm-year observations. A manager (either current or former) holds a

variables we use in Section 5.9


4. Instrument and empirical methodology

    4.1. The instrumental variable
        We define our instrument, the density of high net worth individuals, as the number of high net

worth individuals in 1995 divided by the total number of firms headquartered in a state, using the 1995

SOI data and information on firm headquarters from the Compustat database. Throughout the analysis,

we normalize the measure so that it is measured in units of thousands of individuals per firm headquarter.

        The significant geographic variation in the density of high net worth individuals is illustrated in

Figure 1. States with a large number of high net worth individuals, e.g., California, will not necessarily

have the highest density measure when a large number of firms are also headquartered in that state.

Across states, the median wealth density is 565 (Oklahoma), and he mean is 664. Of the top five states in

terms of number of headquarters, California has a density of 442, Texas 299, New York 473, Florida 603

and Massachusetts 270. Across sample firms, the mean density is 460 individuals per firm and the

standard deviation is 151.


    4.2. Estimated wealth distributions
        Substantial personal wealth is required to buy a 5% or larger stake in one of the firms in our

sample. Our data on high net worth individuals counts many wealthy people who do not in fact have the

resources to buy a 5% stake in most (or any) listed firms. Is our variable informative about the very top of

the wealth distribution? Also, are there enough wealthy individuals to explain the observed frequency and

size of the stakes we classify as individually held? To assess whether the number and wealth of high net

worth individuals are large enough to be consistent with the value of blocks in our sample, we have to



9
 The number of blockholders in Table B1 does not correspond to those in Table 1, because Table 1 is the raw
database and allows for more than one large shareholder per firm-year.

                                                       12
extrapolate from wealthy to very wealthy individuals. The extrapolation, using the power law distribution

of individual wealth, suggests that high net-worth individuals have resources that would allow them as a

group, to hold a 5% of public equity, in most states. We provide more details in Appendix B.


    4.3. Two-stage selection model

        Most of the existing empirical literature in corporate finance on the economic effects of large

shareholders has estimated an equation of the following form:

                                  yit  d it   j (i )  t  X it   it                         (1)

where i, and t index firms, and years, respectively and j(i) indicates the industry to which firm i belongs.

yit is a firm performance or corporate policy variable,  j (i ) are industry fixed effects, t are year fixed

effects, and X it is a vector of time-varying firm-level controls, e.g., the size or age of the firm. dit is an

indicator variable that is equal to 1 if a large shareholder is present in firm i in year t, and 0 otherwise.

        It is not possible to draw causal inferences about impact of blockholders on firm behavior from

estimates of  in equation (1), because there are economic reasons to expect that blocks are not randomly

allocated to firms. For example, firm size or growth options are potential determinants of corporate

policy choices and firm performance, but the same variables may also be correlated with the presence of a

large shareholder. If X it does not include all relevant variables, the large shareholder indicator variable

dit will be correlated with the error term in equation (1), and OLS estimates of  will be biased. For

example, if the selection and treatment effects go in opposite directions,  will be biased towards zero.

        To explicitly address this endogeneity problem, we use a two-stage selection model, following

Heckman and Robb (1985). The model we estimate differs from standard two-stage least squares (TSLS)

models because of the binary nature of the endogenous variable of interest (the presence of a block). As

in standard TSLS, the estimation involves two equations. The first stage equation is:




                                                          13
                                    d it *  gwit  a j ( i )  ct  bX it  eit
                                           0 d it *  0                                                    (2)
                                    d it  
                                           1 d it *  0

where dit * is a latent variable and wit is our instrument, i.e., the number of high net worth individuals

per firm headquarter in a state. a j (i ) are industry fixed effects, ct are year fixed effects, and X it is a

vector of firm-level control variables. We report estimates of the first stage using both linear probability

models and probit models.10

         In the second stage, firm performance or corporate policies are modeled and it is assessed how

they are affected by the predicted probability of block presence in a firm. The second stage equation is:

                                   yit   Block dˆit   j  t   X it   it                            (3)

Since the only endogenous variable in equation (3) is an indicator variable, this model is sometimes

referred to as a “dummy endogenous variable model” (Heckman (1978)). The vector of control variables,

X it , is identical to the one included in the first stage. We assume that eit and  it follow a joint normal

distribution with a correlation coefficient of . The model is estimated by maximizing the joint likelihood

function (see also Maddala (1983)).11 The estimated coefficient  Block captures the treatment effect of a

large shareholder on yit.

         If the error terms eit and  it are uncorrelated ( = 0), then the effect of large shareholders on

firm performance or corporate policies can be consistently estimated with ordinary least squares (OLS).

If is positive, then the coefficient  estimated through OLS is overstated; if  is negative, then it will be

understated. We test whether is zero with a Chi-square test which is reported in all tables.


10
   Similar model specifications have recently been estimated in the corporate finance literature (see, e.g., Li and
Prabhala (2007). Our specification with a first stage probit (and a variable in the first stage which is not included in
the second stage), is similar to the treatment effects model estimated in Villalonga and Amit (2006).
11
   The MLE model requires the assumption of joint normality of the error terms. An alternative approach would be
to model the first stage as a probit model and then use traditional instrumental variable techniques where the IV is
created from the probit fitted first stage values. We have also estimated these regressions, and the overall results
from the probit-IV regressions are similar in significance and magnitude to our reported MLE results.

     4.4. Validity of the instrument


         4.4.1.   Relevancy condition

         The first condition for wealth density to be a valid instrument is that it significantly predicts the

presence of large non-managerial individual shareholders in local firms. There are economic reasons to

expect such a relation. First, we found above that blockholders exhibit a preference for firms

headquartered near where they live. Second, we also found that there is significant geographic variation

in the density of wealthy individuals. This is important because personal wealth is likely a key

determinant of an individual’s ability to accumulate a large equity stake in a public firm.

         It is important to run regressions of block presence on wealth density with firm- and state-level

controls to rule out the possibility that our instrument is correlated with some firm-level determinant of

blocks such as firm size or state level variables such as corporate tax rates. But the simplest way to assess

the validity of the relevancy condition is to collapse data by state. Figure 3 plots the frequency with

which firms in a state have a large individual non-management shareholder against our instrument. Each

state is represented by a circle whose area is determined by the number of firms used to calculate the state

block frequency.12 States that are large in terms of firms, such as California and Texas, appear large (918

and 649 observations, respectively). On the other hand, South Dakota (the low outlier just below 1.5 on

the x-axis) or Iowa (the high outlier with block frequency around 55%) are small (six and 40

observations, respectively). The graph shows an estimated regression line where observations have been

weighted by the number of firms used in calculating the frequency (i.e. the circle sizes). The estimated

slope is 0.190 (heteroskedasticity-robust standard error of 0.05; t-statistic of 3.77).




12
  The block frequency is an average across our sample years to maximize the number of observations used to
calculate the average. Using only the 1996 cross-section of blocks and firms increases the significance and estimated
slope.

                                                         15
        4.4.2.   Exclusion restriction

        The second condition for our instrument’s validity is that it impacts the dependent variables only

through its effect on the endogenous block variable, i.e., wealth density must not affect the dependent

variables directly, and not through any other mechanism. That is, the correlation between the instrument

and the second stage error term must be zero. The validity of this condition cannot be tested

econometrically with only a single instrument, but we provide several empirical observations and

arguments to support its validity.

        One concern may be that areas with wealthy individuals experienced recent wealth creation (e.g.,

Microsoft executives in the State of Washington) so that there is a direct effect of firm performance on

wealth density, or potentially reverse causality. Three arguments alleviate this concern. Our instrument

reflects “old money” because it is based on inheritance data, and is not related to contemporaneous firm

performance and recent IPOs, which reduces concerns of reverse causality with firm performance. Also,

our block variable does not include executives (current or former officers), i.e., those most likely to have

wealth created in IPOs and through superior firm performance. In addition, we measure our wealth

density instrument with a lag, i.e., prior to our sample period, and while our instrument is measured at the

state-level, we examine performance and policies at the firm-level.

        Second, while the density of high net worth individuals predicts individual non-managerial

blocks, it does not predict the presence of large shareholdings by either managers or institutional

investors. It therefore seems unlikely that our instrument measures the “demand for blocks”. If it did, we

would expect wealth density to predict the presence of several different types of blocks, and not only non-

managerial individual blocks.

        Third, it appears unlikely that location choices of firms and individuals are motivated by the

market for blocks in listed firms. Firm headquarter relocations are extremely rare events. Pirinsky and

Wang (2006) identify only 115 relocations among more than 5,000 firms between 1992 and 1997.




                                                     16
Therefore, firm locations must typically be determined by early decisions that long pre-date the

ownership structure in the very large firms in our sample.

        Wealthy individuals are presumably more mobile. Various agglomeration economies affect

location choices (see e.g., Puga and Duranton (2004) or Glaeser (2008) and the references therein).

Wealthy people likely want to live near other wealthy individuals for social reasons and because they

have correlated tastes. Such agglomeration seems consistent with the apparent concentration of wealthy

people (New York’s Upper East Side, Aspen, Beverly Hills, East Hampton), and is not primarily about

the production side of the economy, but about the consumption side, because that is where the major

externalities are (this is unlike location choices of the middle class, where productivity externalities may

dominate). In particular, expectations about future policies (e.g., leverage or payout policy) in local firms

are probably less likely to figure much in location decisions of wealthy individuals. Thus, we do not

believe endogenous firm or individual/block location choices affect our results to a significant extent.

        Finally, because we study a very broad set of corporate policies, any theory of a direct relation

between wealth density and a particular policy also has to explain a large number of relationships, i.e.,

both the relation between wealth density and block presence and the one with all the dependent variables.

We are aware of no economic theory which predicts a direct relation between wealth density and the

multitude of dependent variables we study.


    4.5. Other econometric issues

        If instrumental variables are insufficiently correlated with endogenous variables, identification

with IV suffers from “weak instrument problem” (e.g., Bound, Jaeger and Baker (1995), Nelson and

Startz (1990), and Staiger and Stock (1997)). Weak instruments may lead to IV coefficient estimates that

are biased toward OLS coefficients, and to confidence intervals that are understated. The problem of

weak instruments is serious in settings with a large number of instruments, which are individually weakly

correlated with the endogenous variable(s), but which as a group are able to explain some of its variation

(see, e.g., Angrist, Imbens and Krueger (1999)). When the number of instruments is low, however, IV


                                                     17
results are neither particularly biased nor generate excess precision. Given this and the fact that we use a

single instrument, weak instrument bias should not be a concern in our regressions.13


         The impact of large shareholders is likely to vary across firms and owners. Our results should be

interpreted with this in mind. With homogenous effects (conditional on the control variables),

performance and corporate policies will be similarly affected by a large shareholder across all firms. In

that case, the second stage large shareholder coefficients we estimate can be interpreted as the effect for

any firm with a large shareholder, including the majority of firms who do not actually have such a

shareholder. If the homogeneity assumption does not hold, however, our regressions estimate the average

impact of blocks across a subset of firms that actually have such blocks. Specifically, our estimates

reflect the mean effect for those firms that have a large shareholder because they are located in states with

a high wealth density measure.14 It seems highly likely that the homogeneity assumption is unwarranted,

and that our estimated effects are local, i.e., they would not generally represent the average effect of

blocks across the universe of firms. Two forms of heterogeneity may be important. First, the potential

impact of a blockholder likely varies across firms, for example because other governance mechanisms are

in place in some firms but not others, or simply because some firms are well run and some less so. Our

estimated effects therefore have to be thought of as average effects for those firms which are marginal

targets, i.e., neither the most obvious targets (because those firms have blocks in all states), nor the firms

with the lowest potential impact of a block (because those firms do not have blockholders even in states

with very high wealth density). We estimate average effects across many policies, so there may be larger

effects in a subset of firms with blocks.15 Second, different blocks are probably formed for different




13
   Following Staiger and Stock (1997), it is common practice to examine the strength of the instrument in the first
stage using F-statistics. Based on cut-off values of Stock, Wright and Yogo (2002) and Stock and Yogo (2005) and
using the Kleibergen and Paap (2006) test statistic that allows for clustered standard errors, we can reject the null
hypothesis of weak instruments in all our reported first-stage regressions.
14
   For further discussion, see Imbens and Angrist (1994) and Imbens, Angrist and Rubin (1996).
15
   We may miss potential effects of blockholders if heterogeneity leads to effects of opposite signs (see, e.g.,
Cronqvist and Fahlenbrach (2008)). If blockholders increase leverage in some firms but reduce it in others, the
estimated net effect might be indistinguishable from zero. While perhaps possible for leverage, this possibility seems

                                                         18
reasons, e.g., to force management to raise leverage, to solidify a commercial relationship, to contain

some agency problem, or to force a change in strategy. We only estimate averages, so effects of blocks

that are infrequent may not be visible with our methodology. If the effects are in the tails (e.g., blocks

reduce excessive leverage but do not affect non-excessive leverage), then our specifications may also

report small effects (or none).


5. Results

    5.1. Wealth density and the presence of a large shareholder in a firm

         We start by reporting results from the first stage regression, in which we predict the presence of a

non-managerial individual blockholder in a firm. Table 3 reports several model specifications. We find

that the density of wealthy individuals in a state significantly predicts the presence of a large shareholder

in firms headquartered in that state. In all regressions predicting the presence of a non-managerial block,

our instrumental variable’s t-statistics are significant at the 1%-level. The heteroscedasticity-consistent

standard errors are clustered by state. In unreported regressions, we have clustered standard errors by

firm and estimate consistently smaller standard errors for the instrument.

         A linear probability model of having a non-managerial individual block estimated by ordinary

least squares (OLS) is reported in column (1). The estimated coefficient on the density of high net worth

individuals, 0.190, implies that a one standard deviation increase in the instrument (0.420) is predicted to

increase the probability of having a block by 7.6 percentage points. 16 This effect is large compared to the

unconditional mean probability of 11.8%. Because block probabilities are close to zero for most firms, the

linear probability model is possibly a poor modeling choice and we therefore turn to other model

specifications.


less likely for, e.g., profits or liquidity. In any case, this suggests that there may be more effects of large
shareholders than we identify, but does not suggest ever finding any effects spuriously.
16
   This standard deviation of the instrument is calculated across 50 states. Calculating the standard deviation across
firms yields a lower number (0.151) because few firms are located in the states with extreme wealth densities. An
increase in the density of 0.151 increases the predicted probability of a block by 1.5 percentage points according to
column one.

                                                          19
        In column (2), we estimate probit regressions. Our previous finding that block presence in a firm

is significantly predicted by the density of local wealth is robust and does not change across

specifications. Around the sample mean probability of having a block, the effect of increasing the density

by one standard deviation is to increase the block probability by about 4.5 percentage points, a 38%

increase. That is, the magnitude of the effect remains large in this model. In column (3), time-varying

firm controls, as well as year and industry-fixed effects are included.17 The estimated effect of the

instrument is slightly lower, but remains significant at the 1%-level. This regression corresponds closely

to the first stage estimation used to identify the effect of blockholders on a range of dependent variables

below. Size has a negative correlation with block probabilities, and age and sales growth have positive

correlations.

        In the remaining columns of Table 3, we report robustness checks and placebo tests. First, we

consider alternative ways of defining the instrument and dependent variable. In column (4), we replace

the numerator of the wealth density measure (the number of wealthy individuals) with the total wealth

held by these individuals, thus incorporating information on the high net worth individuals’ average

wealth (based on data from the 1995 SOI). At the sample mean, a one standard deviation increase in the

wealth per listed firm variable increases the predicted probability of having a block by ten percent. In

column (5), the dependent variable is the percent of common stock owned by individual shareholders with

large blocks, adding up across blocks if there is more than one such block (18% of the firms with

individually held blocks have more than one such block, most often two). Since this is a continuous

variable, the regression is estimated with OLS. The coefficient on the density variable is highly

significant and predicts that a one standard deviation increase in the instrument results in a 0.96%

increase in the average fraction of shares held by large individuals shareholders (the unconditional

average is 1.79% of shares). We conclude from the tests reported so far that there is a robust effect of

 Industries are based on Fama and French (1997). We have checked that our results are similar when using 2-digit
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industries.

local wealth on individually held blocks in local firms, across various ways of measuring both wealth and

ownership, and controlling for important firm level variables. 18

         It is important for our identification not just that the instrument predicts individual blocks, but

also that it does not predict the presence of other types of blocks (some small negative effect is to be

expected, since the ownerships shares of all owner categories add up to one). If it did, we might be

concerned that any effects we identify might reflect those other owners. In column (6), we report a probit

specification with a dummy for the presence of a managerial blockholder as the dependent variable. The

coefficient on the instrument is positive, but insignificant. Age does not seem to be related to having a

mutual fund-owned block, but profitability has a large positive coefficient. Column (7) shows a negative,

but statistically insignificant, effect of the instrument on the propensity to have a block owned by a

mutual fund or money manager.

         There are two important conclusions from Table 3. First, non-managerial individual blocks are

not randomly allocated to firms, but economic mechanisms systematically affect block allocations. For

example, large shareholders select smaller and older firms with poor past performance, but which have

significant growth in their sales. Conditional on firm size, firm age is positively correlated with the

presence of a blockholder in a firm, suggesting that non-managerial individuals do not invest in the

youngest firms. These are characteristics of firms where the agency problems between owners and

managers may be particularly severe. One interpretation is that the evidence so far is consistent with

economic theories of large shareholders as monitors, and that blocks are systematically allocated to firms

based on where the demand for monitoring is more significant. In particular, our instrument strongly

predicts the presence of a large individual shareholder. Meanwhile, the placebo tests suggest that our

instrument is not identifying a set of firms with more blockholders in general, but very specifically




18
  As a further robustness check, in unreported regressions, we have used the log of the number of high net worth
individuals and the log of the number of firms as separate independent variables, or the number of high net worth
individuals per capita and the number of firms per capita. Both variables are always significant of opposite sign and
similar magnitudes.

                                                         21
predicts the presence of individually held blocks. Other block types are, if anything, less common when

there are many local high net worth individuals.

        Second, causal inference regarding the impact of blocks of shares on firms is not possible from

standard econometric models such as equation (1) and OLS. Because several of the variables which

explain the presence of a blockholder in a firm (e.g., past performance, firm size) can also be expected to

play a role in explaining firm performance and policy choices in the second stage regressions, standard

models will confound selection and treatment effects of blocks. For example, we find that large

shareholders select firms with relatively poor recent past performance, but conditional on such selection,

we expect blockholders to improve performance through monitoring of management. This is precisely

why it is important to use an instrument when quantifying the impact of block presence on firms.


    5.2. State-level control variables

        Because the variation in our instrument comes from state-level differences, a concern is that we

so far have captured differences across states that are correlated with blockholder presence but have

nothing to do with the economic explanation we provide. If a variable is both a determinant of block

presence and correlated with our wealth density measure, our identification is not valid. Therefore, we re-

estimate the first stage with controls which may be correlated with blocks: population density, the state-

level corporate tax rate, per capita income, and educational attainment.

        Table 4 shows that none of these state-level control variables significantly predict the presence of

a non-managerial individual blockholder in a firm. Also, the inclusion of state-level control variables

does not affect the estimated effect of our instrument much. Columns (1) – (4) include the state-level

controls one by one. In column (5), which includes all the state-level controls, we find that the estimated

coefficient on wealth density is 0.626 and statistically significant at the 5%-level. That is, measures of

economic performance or the quality of the labor force in a state do not seem to explain our evidence.




                                                     22
     5.3. Empirical analysis of the effects of large shareholders


         5.3.1.   Firm performance

         Table 5 reports evidence on the effect of large shareholders on performance. Column (1)

estimates effects for ROA. Age, sales growth and dividend yield have positive coefficients, while age

squared has a negative coefficient.19 The coefficient on the instrumented block indicator variable is 0.037,

significant at the 10%-level. This implies a predicted 3.7 percentage points higher profitability, all else

equal, with the presence of a large shareholder in a firm. The magnitude of this effect is large given that

the mean ROA is 4.7%. However, the second-stage regression estimates a coefficient for the predicted

probability of having a large non-managerial individual shareholder as opposed to the existence of a large

shareholder. Therefore, the magnitude of the second-stage coefficient measures the difference between a

firm that is predicted to have a large shareholder with certainty and one that is predicted with certainty to

not have a large shareholder.20 It is important to note that the relatively large profit effect estimated here

is identified from the marginal firm having a block when our instrument is high, but not if it were low,

and that these firms may see larger improvements from having a block than the general population of

firms. We cannot use the 0.037 coefficient to predict that if we added an individual non-managerial block

to the 88% of sample firms which do not have one, they would experience an average ROA improvement

of 3.7%. This effect is effectively estimated for firms where there is a marginal block which would have

been absent if the firm was in a state with fewer wealthy individuals.

         The estimated correlation coefficient of the error terms in the first and second stage equations is

negative (-0.193) and statistically significant at the 5%-level. That is, there is a systematic inverse

relation between the unexplained (based on our model in the first stage) probability of having a block in a


19
   We include the dividend yield and dividend payer dummy in the reported specification for profitability, following
Fama and French (2000). Payout policy is potentially endogenous and affected by large shareholders. We find that
the statistical significance of the block indicator variable is somewhat stronger if we exclude the dividend variables
from the ROA and ROS specifications.
20
   For a less extreme effect, one may multiply the estimated coefficient with, e.g., the interquartile range of the
distribution of predicted probabilities (0.16). For expositional clarity, we discuss our results in Section 5.3 as
moving from a probability of a large block of 0 to a probability of a large block of 1.

                                                          23
firm and the unexplained part from our operating performance regression model. An economic

interpretation of this result is that large shareholders tend to target firms with relatively poor operating

performance, holding other firm-level variables constant.

         In column (2) of Table 5, we replace ROA with ROS (profits scaled by sales). The impact of

large shareholders is robust and remains positive and significant (this time at the 1%-level). Again, the

effect appears economically large.

         There are several potential explanations for a positive block impact on profitability and firm cash

flows.21 We study two of the most straightforward ones: cost reduction and investment policy. In column

(3), we find that SG&A expenditures, a measure of cost cutting, do not seem to be significantly impacted

by blocks. In column (4), we find that investments (scaled capex) of firms are lower by around 7% of

assets in the presence of a block, with a coefficient significant at the 5%-level. This can be compared to

mean investment of 28% of assets. The estimated error term correlation between the first and second

stage equations is positive, suggesting that large shareholders select firms that invest more.

         The evidence in Table 5 is consistent with theories of large shareholders as monitors. First,

theory predicts that blockholders may monitor and restrain management from consuming firm resources

(e.g., Demsetz and Lehn (1985) and Shleifer and Vishny (1986)), thereby improving return on assets and

other operating performance measures. Blockholders target poorly performing firms, but conditional on

such selection, they have a positive impact on profitability.22 We also infer that the positive effect of


21
   It is important to note that we do not develop a unified theory or model from which we can derive testable
implications for all of our empirical tests at once. Hence, while our instrumental variable specification will enable us
to determine a causal effect of blockholders on different corporate policies, we will not be able with certainty to say
whether such an effect moves the firm towards a global optimum (across leverage, payout, etc.). See e.g. Coles,
Lemmon, and Meschke (2005) and Coles, Lemmon, and Wang (2008) who specify a structural model and use it to
look at whether governance characteristics bring firms closer to the first-best solution, at the cost of having to settle
on a narrower set of policies.
22
   Our evidence complements existing evidence on blocks from event studies. For example, Holderness and
Sheehan (1985) report that the stock market reacts positively to the announcement of block presence in a firm by six
controversial so-called “raiders.” Holthausen, Leftwich and Mayers (1987) study block trades more generally and
find that price effects are permanent for buyer-initiated transactions, but temporary for seller-initiated transactions.
Barclay and Holderness (1991) study negotiated block trades (mainly corporate blocks) and find that stock price
increases are larger when the new blockholder achieves control. Slovin and Sushka (1993) find that the sale of a
large inside block to an outside blockholder triggered by the death of an insider leads to positive announcement
returns..

                                                           24
blockholder presence in a firm empirically must dominate the reduction in managerial incentives effect

identified by Burkart, Gromb and Panunzi (1997). One economic source through which large

shareholders seem to systematically affect firm performance is improved investment efficiency.

Blockholders target firms which invest more than otherwise similar firms, but then the large shareholders

work to reduce the overall capital expenditure of these firms by restricting management from

overinvesting, i.e., selecting and investing in projects with lower returns than their respective cost of

capital.


           5.3.2.   Capital structure

           There is a role for large shareholders to monitor leverage choices because theory predicts that

managers may deviate from optimal capital structures because of underdiversified human capital (e.g.,

Fama (1980)) or to inflate their control (e.g., Harris and Raviv (1988) and Stulz (1988)). Some existing

evidence is consistent with Stulz’s (1988) theory that managers take on excessive leverage to increase the

voting power of their equity (e.g., Berger, Ofek and Yermack (1997)). The findings by Jung, Kim and

Stulz (1996) support the view that agency problems make some firms issue equity when a debt issuance

would have been better for firm value.

           Table 6 reports our evidence on blockholder impact for three different leverage measures: book

leverage, long term book leverage, and market leverage. Across all measures, we find that the coefficient

on the instrumented block indicator variable is negative, although only the one for long-term book

leverage is significant (at the 10%-level). This coefficient implies 3.7 percentage points lower long-term

book leverage for firms with a large blockholder, which may be compared to a mean leverage ratio of

21% in our sample. Overall, there is little evidence that blockholder presence impacts firms’ capital

structures. This is an average effect, and if some blockholders reduce leverage while others increase it,

the average result might be zero. From a theoretical point of view, this might be plausible because

owners’ risk aversion and lack of diversification might point to lower leverage, while control motives




                                                       25
might favor debt financing over equity issues. The results are also consistent with the absence of any

effect of large shareholders on capital structure.


         5.3.3.   Resources and payout policy

         Table 7 reports evidence on the effect of large shareholders on payout policy and cash holdings.

In column (1), we study the total payout ratio (dividends and repurchases scaled by EBITDA).23 The

estimated coefficient on the instrumented block indicator is positive and significant. Hence, large

shareholders appear to cause firms to substantially increase their total payout. The effect is large. A block

in a firm is estimated to approximately double the payout ratio compared to the sample mean. Moreover,

the estimated error term correlation between the first and second stage equations is negative and

significant, which suggests that the blockholders we analyze tend to select firms with low payout ratios

compared to other similar firms. But conditional on selecting these low payout firms, blockholders seem

to cause a significant increase in the amount paid out to shareholders.24

         We next consider block impact on corporate cash holdings. In column (2), we find that the

coefficient on the block indicator is -0.049 (significant at the 10%-level). Thus, cash holdings of a firm

with a block are smaller by 4.9 percent of total assets (sample mean cash holdings are 18%). There is

thus some evidence that the presence of a large shareholder in a firm reduces cash holdings by about a

third of average holdings.

         Theory suggests that managers may prefer larger cash holdings and lower payout ratios because

payouts reduce the amount of resources and assets under management’s control and potentially subject

managers to more capital markets discipline (e.g., Easterbrook (1984) and Jensen (1986)). In analyzing

the determinants of corporate cash holdings, Opler, Pinkowitz, Stulz and Williamson (1999), conclude

that “management accumulates excess cash if it has the opportunity to do so” (p. 44). A possible problem



23
   Scaling the total dollar payout by book value of assets or market value of assets does not change our conclusions.
24
   In unreported regressions, we separate payouts through dividends from payouts through repurchases and find that
the increase in payouts is mostly driven by increases in dividends. One possible explanation is that dividends are a
firmer commitment for management (e.g., Jagannathan, Stephens, and Weisbach (2000)).

                                                         26
with excess cash, as found by Harford (1999), is that it may allow management to pursue acquisitions

which do not increase shareholder value. Our evidence suggests that blockholder monitoring restrains

managers from such resource grabbing.


        5.3.4.   Managerial compensation and governance

        Table 8 reports evidence on the impact of large shareholders on managerial compensation

contracts and governance structures related to a firm’s board. In column (1), where the dependent

variable is the log of total CEO pay, the coefficient on the instrumented block indicator variable is -0.96,

significant at the 1%-level, implying that CEO pay is reduced by 0.8 of one standard deviation in the

presence of a blockholder, which for the typical CEO corresponds to about $1.5 million annually in lower

pay. The estimated error term correlation between the first and second stage equations is positive (0.540)

and significant at the 1%-level, suggesting that large shareholders seem to target firms with more

generous executive pay packages compared to those of otherwise similar firms.25

        This large effect of blockholders seems consistent with the joint hypotheses that CEOs extract

rents through compensation (e.g., Holderness and Sheehan (1988), Bertrand and Mullainathan (2000,

2001) and Bebchuk and Fried (2003, 2004)), and that blockholder monitoring can mitigate or eliminate

such agency problems. Note that firm heterogeneity may be important, for example if shareholders target

poorly managed firms. We cannot infer that firms without blockholders would respond with drastic pay

reductions if a blockholder appeared.

        We next analyze the composition of pay. In column (2), we find that incentive pay is a

significantly smaller fraction of total compensation by 0.446 with a blockholder present in the firm. The

reduction in total CEO pay because of large shareholder presence is almost all in terms of the incentive

pay component. Many CEOs of large U.S. public firms receive $1M in cash pay for tax reasons, which



25
  Whatever selection bias affects OLS results would seem unlikely to cloud these large estimated effects of blocks
on CEO pay. Indeed, CEO pay is one of the few variables where OLS results are significant in the same direction as
our instrumental variables (this is consistent with findings in Bertrand and Mullainthan (2003) that blockholders
reduce CEO pay). See Table 10 below for a systematic comparison of OLS and instrumental estimates.

                                                        27
may induce a mechanical relation between incentive pay and pay levels (incentive compensation is a

lower fraction of the total pay package for CEOs with lower total compensation). This could explain our

finding. Alternatively, the evidence of less incentive pay in a firm with a blockholder is consistent with

substitution of different governance mechanisms. Firms with a large shareholder as a monitor do not

require as much pay-for-performance sensitivity to align the interests of owners and management as do

firms with no block.

         We also analyze the impact of large shareholders on a firm’s board composition. A seat on the

board may provide a blockholder with non-public information about the firm as well as opportunities to

influence firm decisions. . In column (3), where the dependent variable is the number of outside directors

of the firm, the coefficient on the block indicator variable is 2.1, significant at the 1%-level. A block

increases the number of outside directors by two, which may be compared to the mean number of

outsiders of 7.44 among the firms in our sample.26 This evidence suggests that large shareholders monitor

firms by either serving on the board of directors themselves, or by supporting other outside directors.27


         5.3.5.   Liquidity and risk

         Theory suggests that a potential cost of a large shareholder in a firm is reduced liquidity in the

firm’s publicly traded shares (e.g., Holmstrom and Tirole (1993), Bolton and von Thadden (1998)). Table

9 reports our evidence for three variables: trading volume, Amihud’s (2002) illiquidity measure, and share

price volatility. We find that a large shareholder in a firm causes the firm’s shares to see lower trading

volume, have lower volatility, and be less liquid. These effects are significant at the 1%-level and the

magnitudes are large. For example, for the trading volume regression in column (1), the estimated

regression coefficient on the instrumented block indicator is -0.004, implying that the presence of a


26
   Outside directors are often thought of as positive from a governance perspective (see e.g. Rosenstein and Wyatt
(1990) who report significantly positive share-price reactions surrounding outside director appointments). But
researchers have not found much significant evidence of an effect of outside directors on longer-term firm
performance measures (e.g., Hermalin and Weisbach (1991) and Bhagat and Black (2002)), possibly because of the
endogeneity of board composition (e.g., Hermalin and Weisbach (1998)).
27
   Overall board size increases as well (not reported). As a consequence, when using the fraction of outside directors
as the dependent variable, the individual non-managerial large shareholder variable is statistically insignificant.

                                                         28
blockholder causes a fall in trading volume by 0.6 standard deviations. The evidence of lower trading

volume may suggest that large shareholders mechanically reduce liquidity by keeping shares off the stock

market, by shrinking the float and lowering noise trading. However, the likely drop in float is much

smaller than the estimated drop in trading volume. A possible additional source of lower volume (and

higher illiquidity) is the presence of privately informed traders. This result supports theoretical

predictions by, e.g., Glosten and Milgrom (1985) and also Bhide (1993). They argue that large

shareholders who reduce agency problems by monitoring management may also reduce stock liquidity by

increasing informational asymmetries. In the context of liquidity, our empirical evidence suggests that

the cost of the presence of a large shareholder significantly outweighs any potential benefits for small

shareholders.

         The evidence also indirectly supports theories arguing that stock market liquidity may reduce the

cost of creating a block (e.g., Maug (1998)). The estimated error term correlation between the first and

second stage equations in the first and second columns are significant at the 1%-level, suggesting that

large shareholders target firms whose stocks are more liquid compared to those of other firms. Because

these selection effects are strong, it is important to take them into account when empirically analyzing

block impact on liquidity.28 The block effects on stock liquidity highlight that there are costs of large

shareholders which accompany the benefits of improved monitoring of management and reduction of

agency problems.

         Column (3) suggests that stock price volatility falls when a firm has an individual non-managerial

block, although the effect is less dramatic than the volume and liquidity effects. A block is predicted to

reduce annual volatility by 7.5%, which is a little less than a fifth of average and median values. This is

consistent with large shareholders influencing corporate policies in a conservative direction.




28
  Below, we discuss comparisons of OLS and instrumental coefficient estimates (see Table 10 below). Only for one
of these dependent variables (trading volume) is the OLS coefficient significant and of the same sign as the
instrumental variables estimate, and in that case it is much smaller. This is an indication of the selection effects.

                                                         29
    5.4. Robustness checks

        We have performed several robustness checks. One concern is that the significance of our

instrument is driven by a few states with the most extreme wealth densities. This is not the case because

we find that dropping the 10 states with the highest or lowest wealth density has little effect on the

economic and statistical significance of our results. The same is true if we drop the 10 states with the

lowest number of firm headquarters. A related concern is that New York City is driving all our results.

Many wealthy individuals may consider New York City an attractive city to live in, and at the same time,

hold blocks in one of the many firms in New York. When we exclude New York City, we find that the

economic and statistical significance of the estimated first stage coefficient of the instrument increases.

        We have also included additional state-level control variables: a measure of state-level income

inequality, a state of Delaware incorporation indicator variable, and the G-index of Gompers, Ishii and

Metrick (2003) as a measure of anti-takeover provisions. We have also included fixed effects for the nine

Census divisions (regions). None of the variables significantly predict block presence in a firm, and none

of them affect the estimated effect of wealth density.

        The block indicator may be proxying for non-linear firm size effects. But when we add [Log

(assets)]2 and [Log (assets)]3 in the regressions, as well as alternative measure of size such as the log of

market value and the log of sales, our results do not change (for predicting blockholders, higher powers of

size tend not to be significant). Also, individual and institutional blocks may be substitutes. We have

added an indicator variable for the presence of a large mutual fund, money manager, or other institutional

owner as a control, but it does not affect any of our results.

        The denominator of our instrument uses the number of firm headquarters in a state, which may be

correlated with factors unrelated to the supply of wealthy individuals who are potential blockholders. We

therefore include the two components of our instrument separately in the first stage, i.e., the number of

individuals with high net worth and one divided by the number of firm headquarters in a state. Both




                                                      30
measures are statistically significant. The effect of wealth is large and highly significant, showing that

our results are not driven by the number of local firms.

        Finally, we check the robustness of our results for different classifications of large non-

managerial, individuals shareholders. Second-generation family members who are not current or former

officers are included in our measure, but we find that excluding these blocks does not materially affect

our results. Also, some blockholders who are directors do not provide their private address in firms’

proxy statements, but report “Same address as company.” Excluding these does not change any of our

results although significance is sometimes slightly reduced.


6. Discussion and Conclusion

        We develop and test a new instrumental variable framework which allows us to separate selection

effects from treatment effects for a large group of blockholders and to quantify their impact on several

aspects of firm behavior. We start by documenting that non-managerial individual shareholders hold

blocks in firms that are headquartered close to where they live. We then use this empirical fact to create

an instrumental variable (the geographic variation in the density of wealthy individuals) for the presence

of a large shareholder in a publicly traded U.S. firm. This instrument predicts the presence of a block in a

firm with surprising power, and it is robust to the inclusion of variables that vary geographically, reducing

concerns about its validity.

        Our evidence contributes in three ways to existing research on blockholders and more generally

to corporate governance research. First, we find that blocks are not randomly allocated to firms, but are

systematically allocated based on where the benefits to additional monitoring are more significant. This

result confirms a suspicion about block ownership endogeneity that researchers have had at least since

Demsetz and Lehn (1985). Importantly, the non-randomness of blocks matters. The inferences about the

impact of large shareholders change significantly once we control for selection effects. Table 10

summarizes this result by showing that OLS estimates of blockholder effects combine selection and

treatment effects. For example, while ROS is positively affected by a block according to our instrumental

                                                     31
variables estimates, the LS effect is negative and insignificant. We infer that blocks are more likely in

firms with otherwise low profitability, but that the presence of a blockholder tends to raise profits (back

toward the mean).

        After controlling for block selection effects, we find that large shareholders impact a broad set of

firm policies in addition to performance. The presence of a large shareholder reduces the firm’s

investments, reduces corporate cash holdings, increases payouts to shareholders, and reduces total top-

executive pay. These results are economically and statistically significant. Firms with blockholders are

also found to have more outside directors on their boards. Many theories predict that large shareholders

mitigate agency problems between managers and owners by monitoring of management, but our paper is

first to show that blocks cause changes in firm behavior which are consistent with theories of

blockholders as monitors.

        Finally, we find that large shareholders come with costs as well as benefits. While large

shareholders are improving firm performance through monitoring, we also find costs of their presence to

other shareholders. One cost is a less liquid publicly traded stock because of a smaller float, and because

the presence of privately informed blockholders who might sell, increases informational asymmetries and

as a result increases illiquidity, consistent with theoretical predictions (e.g., Bhide (1993)).

        We want to recognize some limitations of our analysis. We have sidestepped the issue of how

large shareholders other than individuals, e.g., institutions, impact corporate performance and policies,

because our instrument is not expected to (and does not) predict the presence of such owners. It is

perhaps even more challenging to identify a valid instrument for the presence of institutional investors

than for individual non-management blocks. Also, we have not analyzed interactions of individual blocks

with other governance mechanisms because testable predictions have not been worked out theoretically

(see Zwiebel (1995) for an exception) and we are concerned about reintroducing endogeneity issues in the

analysis. In addition, our empirical framework does not separate the effect of the presence of a large

shareholder from the threat of future block presence in a firm. As suggested by Manne (1965), the threat

of actions by blockholders can influence managerial behavior, and if firms in high wealth density areas

                                                       32
face a higher threat of block creation, this may partly explain our results. Finally, in the absence of a

unified structural model from which theoretical predictions can be derived and tested, we cannot say with

certainty whether the levels of, e.g., payout and investment in firms with blockholders are closer to the

optimal levels that would prevail in a friction-less financial system.

                           Appendix B: Wealth levels relative to block holdings
         In this appendix, we consider the resources of high net worth individuals, relative to the size of

the equity blockholdings we study (see section 4.2). We use the fact that empirical wealth distributions

closely follow a power law, at least for the top 5-10% of individuals by wealth (e.g., Levy and Solomon

(1997) and Klass, Biham, Levy, Malcai and Solomon (2006)). Such a power law implies a particular

relationship between the wealth rank of an individual and her wealth. Using this empirical fact, we may

estimate the number of people of any particular wealth level (as long as it is in the top 5-10% of

individuals) using the number of people above the cut-off for the SOI wealth data.

         We use the power law parameter of 1.36, as estimated by Levy and Solomon (1997), to estimate

the top of the wealth distribution.29 We infer the number and wealth of the very wealthiest individuals in

each state in 1998. Table B 1 shows our estimates of the wealth distributions for Oregon (with the

median number of millionaires: 27,000), Georgia (75th percentile: 64,000), New York (2nd highest:

243,000), and California (highest: 412,000). In these four states, the estimated wealth of the hundred

richest individuals was $17.4 billion, $32.8 billion, $87.4 billion, and $128.8 billion, respectively. The

estimated number of ultra-wealthy individuals – with more than $100 million in personal wealth – is 51 in

Oregon, 122 in Georgia, 463 in New York and 785 in California. The table also reports the number of

sample firms in each state, the total market value of equity of these firms, and the median, average, and

largest firm market values in 1999. Five percent of the median firm’s market value across the four states

is $43 million, $70 million, $171 million, and $58 million, respectively, and there are an estimated 162,

198, 223, and 1,659 individuals with enough estimated wealth to buy such a stake if they invested all their

wealth. These estimates suggest that there is enough money in the hands of the wealthiest individuals for

them to potentially play a significant role as owners of large blocks of shares.




29
  Levy and Solomon (1997) use data from the 1996 Forbes 400 list of the richest people in the U.S. to back out the
parameter of 1.36. Klass et al. (2006) calculate an average parameter of 1.49 using the Forbes 400 lists during 1988-
2003. We use the 1996 parameter as it predates our sample.

                                                         39
        The estimates in Table B 1 depend on the accuracy of the power law distribution. The following

exercise shows that an extrapolation using the power law distribution works remarkably well and that the

variable we use tracks the whole top of the wealth distribution, including its far tail. Forbes publishes an

annual list of the wealthiest Americans and their principal residences. The minimum wealth required to

make the 1998 list was $430 million. We count the number of high net worth individuals in each state.

We then use the power law and the SOI data to predict, for each state, the number of individuals with

wealth greater than $430 million. Finally, we compare our estimates to the actual number of ultra-

wealthy individuals. Figure 2 plots the actual against the predicted number of individuals with more than

$430 million in each state. The correlation coefficient is 0.89 and highly statistically significant. Thus,

the power law distribution can be used to accurately predict the geographic distribution of ultra-wealthy

individuals using the distribution of moderately wealthy individuals.

The table shows estimates of the number and wealth of high net worth individuals for four U.S. states
(Oregon, Georgia, New York, California). The wealth estimates are based on data from the Internal
Revenue Service’s Statistics of Income (SOI) data which reports the estimated number of individuals with
a high net worth ($1M and up) in 1998. The wealth of subsamples of these individuals (100 richest,
number with $100 million or more in net wealth) is estimated assuming individual net wealth follows a

power law distribution with Wn  A  n           for wealth W, and individual rank n. A is a constant. The

parameter of 1.36 is estimated by Levy and Solomon (1997) (LS (1997) below). The 1999 end-of-year
market value and number of listed firms are constructed from Compustat data. The sample is non-dual

The figure plots state by state, the actual number of individuals on the Forbes list of the wealthiest
Americans (in 1998) against the predicted number of individuals. We use the wealth data from the
Internal Revenue Service’s Statistics of Income (SOI) database (1998) and the power law distribution
with a parameter of 1.36 estimated by Levy and Solomon (1997) to predict the number of individuals on
the list (minimum wealth required to be on the Forbes 1998 list was $430 million). The correlation
coefficient between actual and predicted number of ultra-wealthy individuals is 0.89.

The figure plots the frequency of large, individually held, non-managerial blocks in each state (across all
sample years) against the density of high net worth individuals in 1995. Each circle represents one state.
The area of a circle is proportional to the number of firms in the state. The dashed line represents the
regression line from a weighted least squares regression (weights are the number of firms). This

               Table 1: Distance between large shareholders and firms’ headquarters
The table shows summary statistics for the distance in miles between the location of a blockholder and the
headquarters of the firm in which the block is held for four different types of large shareholders. The four
types of blockholders are non-managerial individuals, managers (both current and former), mutual funds,
and money managers. The summary statistics are based on firm-year observations. If a firm has multiple
blockholders of the same category in a given year, the distance in miles is calculated as the average
distance between firm headquarters and the locations of the blockholders. Firm-years are only included in
the summary statistics below if there is at least one blockholder of the respective category. The sample is
approximately 6,000 firm-year observations of non-dual class S&P 1500 firms during the period 1996-
2001, excluding financial firms and utilities. Blockholders are entities that own at least 5% of the
outstanding shares. The blockholder zip codes are hand-collected from proxy statements. The firms’ zip
codes come from the Execucomp database, the Compact Disclosure discs, or are hand-collected from
proxy statements. The distances are calculated for U.S. based blockholders (excluding Alaska and
Hawaii) only, using latitude and longitude data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Gazetteer Place and Zip
Code Database.     The indicator variable “Same State” is equal to one if the blockholder and firm
headquarters are located in the same state, and zero otherwise.

The table shows sample summary statistics. Panel A shows the number of observations and frequency for
four types of blockholders: Non-managerial individuals, managers (both current and former), mutual
funds, and money managers. Panel B shows mean, median and standard deviation for all other variables.
The sample size (N) varies across variables because of data availability and because outliers are excluded
from regressions. All variables are defined in the Data Appendix. The sample is non-dual class S&P

The table shows results from linear probability models and probit regressions of three large shareholder
variables on measures of the density of high net worth individuals in a state in 1995 and controls. The
dependent variables are defined as follows. The large shareholder dummy variable is equal to one if an
individual non-managerial large shareholder is present in the firm, and zero otherwise (columns 1 through
4). Block ownership is the percentage ownership by individual non-managerial blockholders (column 5).
The managerial block dummy variable is equal to one if a large individual managerial shareholder is
present in the firm, and zero otherwise (column 6). The Fund / MM block dummy variable is equal to one
if a mutual fund or money manager is present in a firm, and zero otherwise (column 7). The sample is
non-dual class S&P 1500 firms during the period 1996-2001. Blockholders are entities that own at least
5% of outstanding shares. All other variables are defined in the Data Appendix. Robust standard errors
(shown in parentheses) are clustered by state. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level is
indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.

the large shareholder dummy variable for the different dependent variables. We use the same control
variables in each regression as those in Tables 6-10. The IV column shows the estimated second stage
coefficients on the instrumented large non-managerial individual shareholder dummy variable. It is
instrumented with the density of high net worth individuals in 1995. The OLS column shows the
corresponding OLS estimate of the large non-managerial individual shareholder dummy variable. All
variables are defined in the Data Appendix. Robust standard errors (shown in parentheses) are clustered
by state. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level is indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.
