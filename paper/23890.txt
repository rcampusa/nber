                                         ABSTRACT

We leverage the 1916 polio pandemic in the United States as a natural experiment to test whether
short-term school closures result in reduced educational attainment as an adult. With over 23,000
cases of polio diagnosed in 1916, officials implemented quarantines and closed schools. Since the
pandemic occurred during the start of the 1916 school year, children of working age may have
elected not to return to school. Using state-level polio morbidity as a proxy for schooling
disruptions, we find that children ages 14-17 during the pandemic had less educational attainment
in 1940 compared to their slightly older peers.

1     Introduction

    People have enjoyed longer and healthier lives due to medical advances over the course of

the 20th century. Diseases such as smallpox and polio appear to be relics of the past. Nev-

ertheless, issues of microbial resistance to antibiotics, the resurgence of vaccine preventable

diseases, and the emergence of highly drug resistant tuberculosis and malaria remind us

of modern medicine’s limitations. Pandemics and untreatable diseases may become more

common as the world grows more integrated and connected. The outbreaks of SARS in

2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, Ebola between 2013 and 2016, and the outbreak of Zika

beginning in 2015 provide broad evidence of the costs of communicable disease.


    In addition to the direct effects that communicable diseases have upon health outcomes,

uncontrolled outbreaks of disease may also act as exogenous shocks to the economy as

people attempt to mitigate their risk of exposure. Consumers stay home, tourists cancel

trips, schools close, and governments halt trade, impose quarantines, or order the culling

of livestock. Studies examining the impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak on the Chinese

economy show that it resulted in temporary negative shocks to tourism, retail sales, and

personal consumption, as well as a 0.5 percent reduction in GDP (Siu and Wong, 2004;

Hanna and Huang, 2004). More recent studies of the impact of Ebola on the countries of

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone suggests that “aversion behavior” — the actions taken by

people to avoid illness, and the actions taken by investors as they anticipate these behaviors

— led to a loss of $1.6 billion in 2015, or about 12 percent of their combined GDP (Thomas

et al., 2015).


    In addition to impacting current health and economic activity, epidemics may have

lifelong consequences for those infected who ultimately survive, and even for those who are



                                              2
not infected. Almond (2006) demonstrates that people who were in utero during the 1918

influenza pandemic had lower rates of educational attainment and income, and higher rates

of disability compared to other cohorts.1 It may also be the case that the disruption caused

by epidemics affects individuals who do not get sick. For example, Parman (2013) examines

the impact of the 1918 influenza pandemic on the siblings of those children born during

the outbreak and finds that older siblings received an additional three months of education

while younger siblings received slightly less education relative to children who did not have

a sibling born during the pandemic. Educational attainment may also be disrupted during

an epidemic as people seek to limit their risk of infection by going to public places, including

schools. Public health officials may even close schools during epidemics. During the Ebola

outbreak, five million children in Africa faced school closures (Sifferlin, 2014). Schools in

Sierra Leone were closed for nine months, and schools in Guinea and Liberia were closed

for six (Sifferlin, 2014; Paye-Layleh, 2015). In Nigeria, schools that were supposed to open

in August remained closed until October (BBC News, 2014).


  These short-term school closures may have long-run impacts on the educational attain-

ment of affected children. Older children of legal working age may opt to drop out of

school and join the workforce after a prolonged closure, thus acquiring a lower level of

educational attainment than they might might have otherwise. Younger children who have

their schooling disrupted even for short periods of time may suffer negative effects. For

example, Marcotte and Hemelt (2008) find that unscheduled school closings due to weather

negatively affect student performance on third grade state assessment exams. Middle-grade

students may have lower rates of educational attainment if their learning is disrupted dur-

ing key periods of development (Lloyd, 1978; Hernandez, 2011). Whether these effects
  1
    Lee (2012) finds that even avoiding illness may lead to increased educational attainment; she finds that
compulsory state vaccination laws had positive effects on educational outcomes.

persist into the long run is less clear. Card and Krueger (1992) find that men educated

in states with higher-quality schools (measured by term length, student-teacher ratio, and

teacher wage) earn higher economic returns from their schooling; however, Pischke (2007)

uses data from a German school district that had a one-time shortening of the school year

and finds that the short school year had no negative effect on earnings and employment

later in life, although it did lead to more students repeating a grade and fewer students

entering higher secondary school tracks.


  In this paper, we provide insight into the impact of epidemics on education by examining

the effect of the 1916 polio epidemic on educational attainment reported by adults in the

1940 census. Prior to 1916, most of the U.S. population had limited experience with

polio. Minor and relatively isolated outbreaks occurred previously in the United States,

with Vermont enduring a notably large outbreak in 1914. Between 1909 and 1915, the

rate of reported polio cases had not risen above 7.9 per 100,000 population (Paul, 1971).

In contrast, the 1916 outbreak affected more than three times the number of people as

previous outbreaks, with 28.5 cases reported per 100,000 people (Paul, 1971; Nathanson

and Kew, 2010). The 1916 epidemic struck in late June and continued into November.2


  While New York City and New Jersey were the first to experience outbreaks and expe-

rienced the greatest rates of infection, 27 other states reported large scale outbreaks of the

disease as the virus migrated west and south, as shown in Figure 1. Over the course of the

outbreak, there were over 5,000 deaths and 23,000 more documented infections, numbers

that eclipsed those of previous epidemics (Lavinder et al., 1918; Trevelyan et al., 2005).

Departments of public health and politicians faced an acute crisis. As the disease spread,
   2
     The 1916 epidemic may also have been underreported compared to later epidemics; prior to 1945, only
cases with paralytic symptoms were reported (Nathanson and Kew, 2010). Moreover, Trevelyan et al.
(2005) suggest that the 1916 epidemic was more intense than subsequent outbreaks since it had the highest
rates of notification per capita of any U.S. polio epidemic.


                                                   4
officials became increasing desperate. Many states restricted the movement of people, en-

forced broad quarantines, and shut down schools at the start of the academic year. These

school closures may have led some students to drop out of school and join the labor force,

and may have lessened the number of days in the school year for others.


  We hypothesize that children who were of legal working age (above age 13 in most

states) would be more likely to leave school than other children, since they faced a higher

opportunity cost of remaining in school. It is true that our measured effect combines this

indirect effect of polio lessening educational attainment through school closures with the

direct effect of polio, which may have lessened educational attainment for infected children.

In this case, our results are an upper bound for the plausible effects of school closures on

educational attainment. While we cannot ascertain the magnitude of the indirect effect,

we believe it to be greater than the direct effect since nearly 90 percent of children infected

by polio before 1919 were under the age of 10 (Nathanson and Kew, 2010).


  Since we do not have data on school closures, we use within state-of-birth variation in

polio morbidity rates to measure the effect of the pandemic on adult educational attain-

ment reported by individuals in the 1940 census.3 Our results suggest that individuals

living in areas harder hit by polio in 1916 experienced decreases in educational attainment,

depending on their age during the outbreak. We find that an increase of one standard

deviation more cases per 10,000 population resulted in about 0.07 fewer years of schooling

for children between the ages of 14 and 17, relative to the reference cohort of people aged

19-21. Children who were already ages 17 or 18, or who were between 10 and 14 were not

affected. Given that returns to schooling may be greater now than in 1916, we offer these

     The U.S. Federal Government did collect information on schooling at the state level, but information
is missing for the 1916/1917 school year. This is because the government transitioned from reporting the
information on an annual basis to a biannual basis this exact year. As such they did not collect they did
not collect data for the 1916/1917 school year.

estimates as an upper bound of what might happen to educational attainment currently if

pandemics lead to school closures.



2       The Pathology of Polio and the 1916 Epidemic

    Polio is caused by the poliovirus, an enterovirus transmitted via the fecal-oral route.

Evidence on Egyptian stele (depicting an adult with a withered leg and crutch) dating

from 1580-1350 BC suggests that polio has existed for thousands of years (Nathanson and

Kew, 2010). Although the existence of polio dates to antiquity, it was not until the late

19th century that epidemics began occurring in the United States and Europe. The most

plausible explanation for this pattern is that prior to the late 19th and early 20th centuries,

most people were probably exposed to polio during infancy, when infants had circulating

maternal antibodies that made the infection much less severe. Over the next 100 years,

improved public sanitation delayed exposure to the virus, thus increasing both the age of

primary infection as well as the severity of the illness, since maternal antibodies were no

longer circulating. As a result, epidemics that became increasingly severe were reported

each summer and fall, and the average age of persons infected increased (Hamborsky et al.,

2015; Nathanson and Kew, 2010).


    In most cases, patients infected with polio are asymptomatic or experience minor symp-

toms that resolve in a week (including fever, sore throat, headache or nausea) (Hamborsky

et al., 2015; Nathanson and Kew, 2010; Oshinsky, 2006). In some individuals (about one

in 150 persons infected), the virus can enter the bloodstream, and then invade the central

nervous system, leading to paralysis.4 The extent and duration of the paralysis differs

across individuals; while some people recover completely, others may remain permanently
    4
    There are three polio virus subtypes, which differ in their virulence and effect. Poliovirus type 1 was
responsible for 80 percent of paralytic cases in the prevaccine period (Nathanson and Kew, 2010).


                                                    6
weak or paralyzed (Hamborsky et al., 2015).


  The 1916 outbreak generated substantial fear because it struck higher-income families

as much or even more than lower-income families, with seeming random incidence. While

polio outbreaks tended to follow seasonal patterns, the geography of outbreaks was unpre-

dictable. Areas that experienced pervasive and widespread viral outbreaks one year might

never again see a significant outbreak. The potential lifelong crippling associated with the

disease can arise in youth without warning, and a large share of cases in New York City

in 1916 occurred among native-born children living in single-family dwellings with clean

surroundings and inside toilets (Lavinder et al., 1918).


  In attempting to prevent the spread of the epidemic and allay public fear, officials were

quick to implement various protocols. Children ages 16 and under were prohibited from

leaving New York City for travel unless they produced “. . . a certificate that the premises

occupied by them were free from poliomyelitis, and had been free from this disease since

January 1, 1916.” This was supplemented by a medical examination of such travelers at

the point of departure (Emerson, 1917). In New York City, Health Commissioner Haven

Emerson ordered the city streets to be washed with millions of gallons of water each day

(Offit, 2005).5 In addition to flushing streets, public employees enforced sanitary and

quarantine regulations. Quarantines were part of the standard set of protocols employed

by public health officials during the early 20th century and were widely employed during the

1916 epidemic. New York’s State Department of Health recommended particularly harsh

measures, ordering individuals diagnosed with poliomyelitis to be quarantined (Paul, 1971).

Placards were also placed in front of homes of infected individuals to notify the community
   5
     Washing streets with water was not an effective means of sanitation; polio virus can be killed with
bleach, but not with plain water nor disinfectants such as alcohols or cresols (World Health Organization,
1999; Hamborsky et al., 2015). Similarly, Philadelphia officials ordered the streets of South Philadelphia
washed with 10-million gallons of water each night (Rogers, 1992).


                                                    7
of the public health risk. In at least one case, a child suffering from polio was forcibly

removed from his home to a hospital, against the wishes of his parents (Emerson, 1917).

Government policy also called for a ban on public gatherings in areas where numerous cases

were reported Emerson (1917). In the summer of 1916, New York public health officials

barred children from movie theaters and libraries, closed Sunday schools, and banned

picnics (The New York Times, 1916b,d; Rogers, 1992). Even though drastic measures were

undertaken to control the spread of the disease, hundreds of new infections were reported

every week.


  As autumn approached, fears that afflicted youths would infect their peers and a belief

that quarantines could limit the virus’ spread led many school districts to delay the start

of the 1916 school year until the pandemic waned. As the Department of Health noted,

“The unprecedented virulence and extent of the existing epidemic, and unfamiliarity with

the disease, has engendered in the public such a state of mind that concession to public

alarm seemed advisable” (Emerson, 1917). New York City schools opened two weeks late

(The New York Times, 1916c). Newspaper accounts show numerous other cities nation-

wide joined New York in postponing the start of school. Philadelphia delayed opening

schools until September 18th, and both Washington, D.C., and Fort Wayne schools were

not reopened until October 2nd (The Washington Times Company, 1916; Evening Public

Ledger, 1916a,b). Evidence from The Tacoma Times in Washington, The Bemidji Daily

Pioneer in Minnesota, and The Princeton Union in New Jersey shows school closures oc-

curring in response to where cases of poliomyelitis arose and in rural locations. Lines from

these newspapers read: “Seattle has five paralysis cases; school is closed,”6 “Infantile Crisis

closes rural school,”7 and “Miss Parkander of Cambridge, a young lady about 22 years old,

succumbed to infantile paralysis early Monday morning, and the schools of our neighboring

village have closed as a matter of precaution.”8 Even when schools may not have been offi-

cially closed, there is evidence that parents worried about sending their children to school.

For example, even after the delayed reopening in New York City, worried parents withheld

their children from school; up to 200,000 students were absent the first few weeks after

schools opened, and the district announced “leniency” for parents who failed to send their

children to school (The New York Times, 1916a).9


  If a significant portion of the student population in 1916 did experience delays in starting

school, it may have resulted in individuals acquiring less education relative to those in

their individual age group who were not impacted by illness and school closures. Older

children who could have worked instead of attending school may have opted to stay in the

labor market. In 1910, 22 states had legislated 14 as the minimum age for employment in

manufacturing (Moehling, 1999).10 Around 16.8 percent of males and 5.8 percent of women

between the ages of 10 and 15 were active participants of the workforce in 1920, suggesting

that many school-age individuals in 1916 would have possessed workforce alternatives to

education (Carter and Sutch, 1996). Together, this evidence implies that a notably large

portion of youth ages 14 and older had viable and legal employment alternatives available to
   8
      9/07/1916 issue of The Princeton Union, page five.
   9
      Closing schools in response to outbreaks and parental concern about outbreaks continued to occur
throughout the 20th century. Clausen and Linn (1956) report that following an outbreak of polio in the
Boston area in July, 1955, officials delayed opening schools for two weeks. Over 80 percent of mothers
surveyed in three Boston area communities reported avoiding crowds, and up to 60 percent believed that
schools should not have opened on schedule (Clausen and Linn, 1956).
   10
      An analysis of these laws by Moehling (1999) shows that state minimum working-age legislation had
little effect on youth employment in manufacturing, and that much of the decline in the use of child labor
cannot be attributed to these legal restrictions. Furthermore, the laws setting age 14 as the minimum
age for manufacturing employment were comparable to much of the state legislation during this period.
Lleras-Muney (2002) notes that state laws for the minimum age of a work permit and the legal age for
starting and leaving school are not harmonized and are, in fact, complex. However, it is true that the legal
age for work permits in 37 states at this time was 14. Only in OH, MI , CA, and SD was the age older, at
15.




                                                     9
them in 1916.11 Waiting for schools to reopen may have generated a significant opportunity

cost, and many individuals may have chosen to enter the workforce rather than wait for

schools to reopen.


    In addition to affecting older children who may have left school to join the workforce,

younger children may be affected by interrupted schooling as well. For example, research

into the area of “red shirting” by Deming and Dynarski (2008) suggests that individual

students who begin school at an older age reach the legal age of school at a lower level of

education and therefore may be more likely to drop out of public education. In addition,

there is some evidence that interruptions in schooling at crucial points of development may

have long run impacts. Hernandez (2011) suggests that children in third grade experience

a pedagogical shift from “learning to read” towards “reading to learn.” A failure to de-

velop this proficiency in reading on time appears to inhibit human capital accumulation

of students and limits the potential to keep pace with their peers. Lloyd (1978) suggests

that students who perform at a lower level than their peers may be more likely to drop

out of school, with third-grade academic performance accurately predicting whether an

individual would drop out of school nearly 70 percent of the time.



3        Data and Empirical Methodology

    Using the 1916 poliomyelitis epidemic as a natural experiment, this paper examines the

effects that epidemiological induced panics and large-scale school closures have on the edu-

cational outcomes of school-age children. We rely on two primary data sources to analyze

the effect of the polio epidemic on educational attainment. The U.S. Public Health Reports
    11
    A sizable literature on the effects of compulsory schooling laws suggests that educational attainment is
also affected by increases in the legal age of school exit, increases in the age at which children can legally
work, and decreases in the maximum age of school entrance. For a full discussion, see Angrist and Krueger
(1992); Margo and Finegan (1996) and Lleras-Muney (2002).

provide data on reported polio cases at the state level in 1916 (U.S. Surgeon General and

U.S. Public Health Service, 1916) and the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS)

of the 1940 Census provides information on individual educational attainment and other

characteristics (Ruggles et al., 2010).     12




  We measure 1916 polio pandemic exposure by reported infections at the state level, so

that our main identifying assumption is that people who were school age in 1916 would

be exposed in their state of birth.13 This assumption would be violated if children and

adolescents migrated between states prior to 1916 epidemic. While we can only speculate

as to the number of children who moved across states during childhood, we do know that

in 1940, 77 percent of people were residing in the same state in which they were born.

Further, migration would bias the treatment effect towards zero if migration prior to the

pandemic was not systematically correlated with polio morbidity. Equation (1) represents

the reduced form empirical regression used to study the effects of the 1916 pandemic on

educational attainment:


                Yi,b,s,a = αb + κs + Σj βj ∗ P oliob ∗ AgeBina,j + Xb ∗ γa + i,b,s,a               (1)


       Yi,b,s,a denotes educational outcome for individual i, born in state b, residing in state s

in 1940, and born in age cohort a. The variables αb , κs , and γa denote state of birth, state

of residence in 1940, and age cohort fixed effects. State of birth fixed effects control for

factors common across persons born in the same state, and state of residence fixed effects

control for factors that are shared among persons residing in the same 1940 enumeration

state. Common shocks shared across birth year cohorts, such as WWI, are controlled for
  12
     By 1940, the educational attainment of most children who were school-age during the polio epidemic
should have been complete.
  13
     Using state of birth to proxy for pandemic exposure is not ideal but is the most precise measure of
exposure given that the Census does not report more disaggregated information about birthplace.


                                                  11
using birth year fixed effects. In the full specification, we also include state level economic

and demographic controls for 1916 state of birth.14 These controls are denoted by Xb and

include manufacturing wage earners per capita, doctors per capita, education expenditures

per capita, ln manufacturing wages per earner, and ln population. Interacting these con-

trols with age cohort fixed effects allows the effect of these state-level characteristics on

educational attainment to vary across different age cohorts. We want to compare the effect

of polio on the educational attainment of cohorts who are likely in school with the effect

of cohorts from the same birth state who are slightly older and not likely to be in school.

Thus, the main variables of interest are the interactions between the state polio case rate in

1916 per 10,000 population (P oliob ), and the age specific cohort bins (AgeBina,j ). These

interactions allow the state-level treatment effect of the pandemic to vary across birth

year cohorts. Identification of these coefficients arises from variation in treatment intensity

across birth cohorts from the same birth state. Finally, i,b,s,a denotes a heteroskedastic

error term clustered at the state of birth level.


  In order to test whether the pandemic influenced the educational attainment of exposed

cohorts, we match a sample of white males born between 1895 and 1905 (who were between

the ages of 11 and 21 during the pandemic) with the 1916 polio morbidity rate in their state

of birth. We restrict the sample to males since they entered the workforce as permanent

participants, and we exclude blacks to limit potential measurement error in educational

attainment, access to education, and other potentially unobserved confounding factors.

Table 1 reports summary statistics for the primary sample.


  Our main specification consists of four pooled birth-year cohorts consisting of individuals

born between 1895 and 1905. In order to test our hypothesis that children of different

ages may have been differentially impacted by the polio pandemic based on their labor

market alternatives, we bin them into three age groups: ages 17-18 (born in 1898), ages

14-17 (born between 1899 and 1901), and ages 11-14 (born between 1902 and 1905).15

We include indicator variables for each age bin in the regression, and interact each age

bin with the polio morbidity rate. The excluded reference cohort consists of people born

between 1895 and 1897, who form a plausibly untreated group since they would have been

between the ages of 18 and 21 during the pandemic and likely not in school.16 Since the

cohort of persons born in 1898 may have included both school-aged and non-school-aged

individuals, we also separately include an indicator variable for individuals born in 1898

(and its interaction with the polio morbidity rate) in the analysis.



4        Results

    In our analysis, we run six different regressions, reported in Table 2. Columns (1)-(3)

report results from estimating equation (1) with the level of educational attainment as the

dependent variable. Column (1) includes fixed effects for state of residence in 1940, state

of birth, and birth year. Column (2) also includes the full set of fixed effects and Census

region x age-cohort trends to control for potential underlying geographic trends common

across cohorts born in different areas of the country, and column (3) replaces the Census

region trend with flexible state of birth economic and demographic controls interacted with

age cohort dummies. Columns (4)-(6) present estimates for the same specifications with
    15
     For our formal specification, we decided to limit the sample to persons ages 11-21 because birth cohorts
close in temporal proximity are less likely to violate this assumption than cohorts which are spread further
apart as it is unlikely that unobserved economic, demographic, and environmental conditions have changed
radically over a short period, and the empirical model assumes that the treated cohorts have similar
unobserved characteristics relative to the reference cohort.

     We choose a three-year reference cohort rather than a single-year reference cohort to reduce the likeli-
hood of arbitrarily selecting a single-year reference cohort with unobserved characteristics that could make
comparisons between treated and untreated cohorts invalid.

the dependent variable measured as the natural logarithm of educational attainment, which

may resolve issues arising from the fact that education cannot take non-zero values. All

coefficient results discussed refer to the most restrictive specifications, (3) and (6), unless

otherwise noted.


  Results presented in Table 2 confirm our hypothesis that the polio pandemic of 1916

had different effects on educational attainment for children of different ages. School-aged

children who were old enough to have labor market alternatives (those who were between

ages 14 and 17), and who were living in areas more affected by the pandemic had lower

educational attainment than similarly-aged children living in areas with lower polio mor-

bidity rates. This result is robust even in our models with the the most restrictive controls,

and suggests that a one-standard-deviation increase in the polio morbidity rate per 10,000

persons (reported as 4.42 in Table 1), results in persons aged 14-17 having around 0.07

fewer years of educational attainment on average. This effect is equivalent to every four-

teenth person in the cohort receiving one fewer year of education relative to the reference

cohort.17 The results from columns (4), (5), and (6) provide further evidence suggesting

that the 1916 polio pandemic had adverse affects on educational attainment on children of

working age. We find that a one percent increase in the polio morbidity rate would lead to

approximately a 6 percent reduction in average educational attainment for the cohort.18


  In contrast, the pandemic of 1916 did not statistically significantly affect the educa-

tional attainment of younger individuals who were unable to legally work in most states;
  17
    To get this value, divide one by the marginal effect for an average person in the cohort.
  18
    Given that some individuals born in 1902 may have been 14 years old in the fall of 1916, we estimate
an alternative specification where these individuals were included in the cohort of persons between 14 and
17, and results do not significantly change. In general, results are robust to defining age bins differently.
Given our bin definition may be somewhat arbitrary, we present results from regressions with single-year
age x polio interactions in the appendix, as well as results from a regression where age-bins span two years.
Both tables in the appendix show similar results to those reported in Table 2.



                                                     14
the estimated coefficient on the interaction between polio morbidity and the age bin for

persons born between 1902 and 1905 is not statistically different than zero in any of the

six specifications. Relative to individuals born before 1898, the educational attainment of

people born in that year was not affected by polio morbidity rates.19


4.1      Robustness Checks

  To check the robustness of our results, we perform a series of placebo tests to test whether

polio morbidity at the state level is spuriously correlated with unobserved factors that affect

educational attainment. In the first analysis, we select a sample of persons who would

have already completed school by the fall of 1916. In this falsification test, we compare the

educational attainment of those born between 1884 and 1892 to persons born between 1893

and 1895. These persons would have been ages 18 to 32 during the pandemic, so should not

have their educational attainment affected by polio morbidity rates in 1916. Results from

the placebo test are reported in Table 3. Specifications (1), (2), and (3) report the effect

of increased cohort exposure to the pandemic on years of education. These results suggest

that persons born between 1893 and 1894 in areas with greater morbidity had slightly less

educational attainment relative their peers born between 1895 and 1897, but this negative

effect is smaller than in the main specification and becomes statistically insignificant once

controls for local economic conditions are added. Specifications (4), (5), and (6) report

the effect of increased cohort exposure to 1916 polio morbidity on log years of education.

Unlike specifications (1) through (3), these tests find no statistically significant effect on

the 1893/1894 cohort. Overall, the falsification test fails to find any consistent effect of

increased pandemic exposure and educational attainment in post-schooling cohorts.
 19
      The results are robust to the merging of the 1898 cohort with the reference cohort.




                                                     15
    We also perform an additional regression that includes younger cohorts born between

1906 and 1916. Results are reported in Table 4. In our primary specification, we ex-

clude these children from the sample because the 1916 pandemic affected primarily young

children, who may have had educational attainment interrupted because of the disabling

effect of polio. This complicates the treatment effect of the pandemic and makes it diffi-

cult to make claims regarding the school closures as a causal channel. Furthermore, this

multifaceted treatment effect makes finding an appropriate control cohort for comparison

more difficult. Comparing young cohorts to persons already out of school would likely

violate the comparability assumption made earlier. The unobserved institution, political,

and economic factors likely differ substantially between these two populations. The results

presented in Table 4 include pre-school age cohorts, but these populations would have had

a much higher rate of polio infection, in addition to being affected by parental behaviors

such as red-shirting. If parents of five year old children in the fall of 1916 decided to

postpone their enrollment until 1917, these children would have reached the legal work age

one grade earlier than their peers, which may have ultimately affected their educational

attainment. If anything, the inconsistent results reported in Table 4 suggest that polio may

have increased educational attainment for the youngest cohorts and had no affect on the

others, leading us to conclude that excluding younger children from our test is appropriate

when looking at schooling as a causal channel and preserving the comparability of cohorts

close in time.



5     Conclusions

    The first major polio epidemic in the United States struck in the summer of 1916 and

persisted into the fall. With over 23,000 cases of polio diagnosed, the epidemic tested the

nascent system of public health departments. Officials engaged in a variety of measures


                                            16
to stem the outbreak, including quarantines, washing streets, and closing public schools.

In this paper, we examine the effect of public school closures on educational attainment.

Our results show that children of legal working age living in areas with higher rates of

polio infection had lower educational attainment than similarly aged children living in

states with lower infection rates. This result, which is strong, robust and consistent across

specifications, does not hold for age groups who were not of legal working age, nor does

it hold for slightly older children who had already completed their secondary schooling.

Our results suggest that a one-standard-deviation increase in the number of polio cases

reported in a person’s birth state resulted in the person having around 0.07 fewer years

of educational attainment on average – an effect which is equivalent to every fourteenth

person in the cohort receiving one fewer year of education relative to the reference cohort.


  We consider this number to be an upper bound to the plausible effect on school closures in

the modern era on educational attainment for two reasons. First, our measure combines the

indirect effect of school closures on educational attainment with the direct effect of having

polio (and missing school) on educational attainment. While 90 percent of polio cases

were in younger children, we cannot completely eliminate the direct effect on educational

attainment given available data. Second, it is probably the case that the opportunity cost

of remaining in school today is much lower (given increases in returns to schooling over the

past 100 years) than in 1916. Nevertheless, results suggest that there is a long-run cost

when schools are closed as a response to disease outbreaks.
