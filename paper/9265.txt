                                           ABSTRACT

   This paper focuses on the causes of increased wage inequality in OECD countries in recent years
and its decomposition into the component factors of trade surges in low wage products and
technological change that has preoccupied the trade and wages literature. It argues that the length
of production run and degree of fixity of factors is crucial in such analyses. In particular, if the
observed wage inequality response to price and technology shocks reflects a short-run response in
which factors and output have not adjustedfully across industries, then decomposition analysis of
the causes of the observed increases in inequality is substantially altered relative to a long-run
factors mobile world. This conclusion applies both when one type of labour has mobility costs and
in the Ricardo-Viner case where there is an additional, sectorally immobile factor. Furthermore, only
small departures from the fully mobile model can greatly change decompositions. This finding is
important because most data used in earlier work are interpreted as reflective of a long-run full
mobility response, when this may not be the case. Incorrect conclusions as to how trade surges and
technology contribute to wage inequality can be easily drawn, if the data are in fact generated by a
short-run adjustment process.

1. INTRODUCTION

      This paper focuses on the causes of increased wage inequality in OECD

countries in recent years, more specifically its decomposition into the compo-

nent factors of trade surges in low wage products and technological change

that has preoccupied the trade and wages literature1 . We argue that if we

assume that if the observed wage inequality response to price and technology

shocks reflects a short-run response in which factor allocations and output

have not fully adjusted across industries, then decomposition analysis of the

causes of the observed increases in inequality is substantially altered relative

to a long-run world in which all factors are mobile. This finding is impor-

tant because most data used in the debate are interpreted as reflective of a

long-run full mobility response, when this may not be the case. Incorrect con-

clusions as to how trade surges and technology contribute to wage inequality

can be easily drawn if the data are generated by a short-run adjustment

process.

      We examine two cases of factor immobility: a two-factor model where

one factor is subject to mobility costs, and a Ricardo-Viner model with a

third factor, immobile in the model run. In both cases, relatively small

departures from the fully mobile Hecksher-Ohlin model greatly change the

decomposition results.

2. LONG AND SHORT RUN MODELS FOR TRADE AND
WAGES ANALYSIS

   We use trade-based models to decompose the observed change in skilled-

unskilled wage inequality in the UK between 1979 and 1995 to evaluate the

relative importance of world prices (trade changes) and technological progress

(whether sector- or factor-biased) in generating wage change. We compare

results from short-run models in which some factors are either immobile

of face adjustment costs moving between sectors, to those from a longer-

run Hecksher-Ohlin type model where all factors are fully mobile between

industries.

   Models where not all factors can move easily between sectors (Mayer,

Mussa, 1974, and Neary, 1978) have investigated the implications of this fea-

ture for relative incomes in a two-factor model (such as whether the Stolper-

Samuleson theorem still holds) and are the starting point for this paper. In

these papers, the factor inputs are labour and capital, with capital immobile

between sectors.

   We discuss the case where the factor inputs are unskilled (U ) and skilled

(S) labour, with U being the factor subject to adjustment costs. In this

case, if there is a fall in the world price of the U -intensive good, with S

freely mobile between sectors, then since U cannot easily move towards the

S-intensive sector in the short run, its wage will rise in the expanding sector


                                      4
and fall more steeply than the goods price in the declining sector. The wage of

S will fall in the short run, though by less than that of the U-intensive good.

In the longer run, as factor U becomes free to move towards the S-intensive

sector where its wage is higher, the output of this sector will expand. Given

the shift towards the S-intensive sector, S’s wages will rise, while U ’s wage

will fall further in both sectors2 . This relative wage eﬀect reflecting the shift

over time in factors can be more marked than the initial impact eﬀect of the

price shock, and is the main factor behind the long-run Stolper-Samuelson

influences on relative wages (a fall in the U-intensive good price will reduce

U’s wage and raise S’s wage).

       Although U ’s income will fall sharply in the U -intensive sector when the

goods price falls, it will actually fall further, rather than be mitigated, once

U becomes free to move to the other sector, as S’s share of income gets bid

up by the shift of output to the S-intensive sector. This suggests that some

   2
     The mechanism behind this seemingly counter-intuitive result can be seen as follows.
Looking at a 2-good, 2-factor Heckscher-Ohlin model, compare a base case and two cases,
V , where both factors are variable, and F , where factor U is fixed in particular sectors.
Both V and F see an identical fall in the world price of the U -intensive good. In case V ,
both factors move out of M to sector E, and there is a change in output composition. As
the export good is much more intensive in S, the relative wage of S is driven up and that
of U falls.
   In case F , U is immobile. As sector M contracts, S is still free to move to sector E, but
the expansion of that sector is greatly dampened because of a shortage (in that sector) of
unskilled factor U (which drives up U ’s wage in the expanding sector E). Consequently,
there is much less demand for S, and its wage does not rise as in case V . Since S is cheaper,
and the price of output of good E is the same in case V as case F in a Heckscher-Ohlin
model, it follows that the wage of U is higher in case V than case F , even in the declining
sector.

                                              5
of the conclusions of the short-run model may diﬀer from the longer-run H-O

model, in that much of the impact of trade on relative facator rewards takes

place only as trade and output here are able to change (the ’magnification’

eﬀect). Also factor price insensitivity to endowments does not apply when

not all factors are able to move, so any ‘short-run’ study of the causes of

changing wage inequality needs to take account of changing endowments,

not simply world prices and technology.

   This conclusion is supported by our alternative, Ricardo-Viner case, where

both types of labour are mobile, but capital is immobile. Again, the capital

immobility greatly reduces the shift in output between sectors in response

to a price change, and this has a very large damping eﬀect on changes in

labour demand and wages. Sector output movement and changes in factor

demand are greatly reduced even when only 2% of value added comprises a

fixed factor.

   We consider the possibility that the changes in relative wages observed

in a small open economy reflect the short-run response of the economy to a

combination of world price, technological and demographic shocks. The pro-

cedures we employ are to calibrate a numerical general equilibrium model to

the UK economy using data for 1979 and 1995, and then to make computa-

tions to decompose the observed change into component parts by considering

the eﬀects of changes separately. We use a Heckscher-Ohlin model, which

                                     6
assumes that factors can freely move between sectors, a short-term model

which incorporates adjustment costs for unskilled labour and a Ricardo-Viner

model.

2.1 A Long-run Trade and Wages Model

       For our long-run model, we use a 2-factor, 2-sector Heckscher-Ohlin type

formulation of a small, open economy3 .          Of the two sectors, sector E (ex-

portables) is assumed to be intensive in the use of skilled factor S compared to

unskilled factor U relative to sector M (importables): ie UE /SE < UM /SM .

This holds for any pair of wage rates Wu and Ws (ie there are no factor

intensity reversals). The factor input-output ratios for E and M , auE , asE ,

auM and asM are all functions of Wu and Ws .

       We assume both labour markets are perfectly competitive. In equilibrium,

these markets will clear, and factor prices and the associated input-output

ratios and goods outputs will all adjust to clear the two factor markets. These

equilibrium conditions imply that



                  auE (WU , WS ) .YE + auM (WU, WS ) .YM = U                         (1)

                  asE (WU , WS ) .YE + asM (WU , WS ) .YM = S

   3
     Strictly speaking, Heckscher-Ohlin trade models provide an explanation of trade pat-
terns between countries in terms of relative factor abundance. We use the term here to
refer to a mobile factors formulation of a single country.




                                           7
where YE and YM are outputs of the two goods and U and S are the economy

wide endowments of unskilled and skilled labour.

   Competition ensures prices equal unit costs in both sectors, ie



                auE (Wu , WS ) .WU + asE (Wu , WS ) .WS = P E                               (2)

               auM (Wu , WS ) .WU + asM (Wu , WS ) .WS = P M



where P E and P M are the two goods prices set on the world market.

   In order to capture the separate eﬀects of factor- and sector-biased tech-

nical progress, we use a CES production function for each sector of the form


             k                                                             l(σi /(1+σi ))
      Yi = Ai β i (αu Ui )((1+σi )/σi ) + (1 − β i ) (αs Si )((1+σi )/σi )                  (3)



where Ai is a scale parameter, σ i is the elasticity of substitution between

skilled and unskilled labour in production, β i is a share parameter and αu

and αs are factor-augmenting technical change parameters. We can interpret

an increase in Ai as representing a general increase in total factor productivity

in sector i, which is purely sector-biased in its eﬀects. Changes in αu and

αs represent technical progress which increases the productivity of one factor

across both sectors (factor biased technological change).

   Diﬀerentiation of these production functions yields the following first-


                                               8
order conditions:



             Wu = Pi .Ai . (Yi /Ai .Ui )−1/σi β i (.αu )σi /(1+σi )            (4)

              Ws = Pi .Ai . (Yi /Ai .Si )1/σi . (1 − β i ) (.αs )σi /(1+σi )



   If we make the simplifying assumption that the elasticity of substitution

between factors is the same in both sectors (σ i = σ for all i) the eﬀects of

various influences on the ratio of skilled to unskilled wage rates can be sum-

marized in this model by equation (5) (derived by rearranging the indirect

cost functions for the two industries). This links relative wage rates to relative

goods prices over the price range for which where there is no specialisation:


                                                                                  
Ws /Wu = [θ um . (PE .AE /PM .AM )1+σ − θuE ]/[θSE − θ SM . (PE .AE /PM .AM )1+σ ] .

                                                                               (5)




Where the θ parameters represent the composite eﬀect of share and factor-

augmenting change for each sector and each factor, ie




                                            9
                         θsi = (1 − β i )−σ /αs1+σ

                              = θui β i −σ /αu1+σ

                           i = {E, M }                                    (6)



   In this formulation, Ws /Wu is higher the larger is PE or AE , and the

smaller is PM or AM . An increase in αu /αs will reduce Ws /Wu (this is the

same result as in Davis (1997) and Haskel and Slaughter (2002)). Changes

in the CES share parameters, β, however, have ambiguous eﬀects on relative

wages.

   As Abrego and Whalley (2000) note, following Harry Johnson (1966), in

the CES case specialization can occur for surprisingly small changes in goods

prices. If specialization does occur, beyond this point traded goods prices

do not aﬀect relative wages, though changes in factor supplies will have an

influence.

   It is perhaps worth noting that the model equations outlined above do

not contain any statement of consumer demand or utility. In this framework,

prices of all goods are set on the world markets, and consumer demand at

home does not aﬀect prices or output if we assume the economy is small

and open. This means that the production and consumption sides of the

                                     10
economy are separable; and given our focus on the determination of relative

wage change we can concentrate on modelling the production side alone. The

same argument appies for the short run model to which we turn next.

2.2 A Short-run Adjustment Model of Trade and Wages

   We formulate a short-run trade and wages model similar to the long-run

model above, but in which labour cannot move costlessly between sectors due

to adjustment costs. These may be search costs, transportation or removal

costs, transactions costs in housing markets, or even psychological costs and

preference for location.

   In the model, we assume these transactions costs create a wedge between

the wage oﬀered in the sector where labour is currently employed and the

wage needed to be oﬀered in another sector in order for a worker to move.

Wage rates in sectors which are expanding following an international price

shock to the economy are thus higher than those in contracting sectors where

labour shedding occurs.

   In this model, factor U will only move from a declining sector M to an

expanding sector E if wages in E exceed those in M by some proportionate

amount λui : ie if WuE − WuM ≥ λu .WuM , and likewise for factor S if it also

faces adjustment costs. This means there are 3 kinds of sectors; expanding

sectors, where employers pay a high wage (gross of adjustment cost); de-

clining sectors where the wage is lower, but adjustment costs are lower; and

                                     11
sectors where employment is not changing. These sectors are paying wages

high enough that their labour force does not find it attractive to move to the

expanding sector once adjustment costs are taken into account.

   In expanding sectors, we define the wage gross of adjustment costs as

WUg i where i ⊂ e, the set of expanding sectors. The wage net of adjustment

costs WUni = WUg i /(1 + λU ). In declining sectors (i ⊂ d, the set of declining

sectors) the wage rate will be the same as the wage in expanding sectors

net of adjustment costs is WU j = WUnj = WUg j /(1 + λU )(where j ⊂ e is the

set of expanding sectors). A sector i will be have unchanged employment

if its wage lies between WUg j and WUg j /(1 + λU ).(where, once again j is an

expanding sector j ⊂ e).

   To capture these features we modify equation (4) to apply diﬀerent wages

to diﬀerent sectors, expressing wages in all sectors in relation to the gross

wage in the expanding sectors: WUg j where j ⊂ e. We will call this our

reference wage, and label it as WUR . As we consider a two sector model, we

can limit ourselves to only expanding and contracting sectors.

   For each sector, we express the proportional diﬀerence between the wage

received by labour in the unskilled intensive sector WUR , and the (gross of

adjustment cost) wage paid by employers, WUg as lUi . This allows us to char-

acterize the diﬀerence in sectoral wage rates as follows:



                                      12
                   In expanding sectors (i ⊂ e) : lUi = 0

                    In declining sectors (i ⊂ d) : lUi = λu               (7)



   We define the benchmark (pre-shock) levels of employment of U and S

in each sector as Ui∗ and Si∗ ; the levels of employment if nobody leaves the

sector. In a declining sector i(i ⊂ d, ) adjustment costs mean that the wage

discount factor lUi equals the maximum permitted, λu , and labour can moves

(ie the sector is ‘declining’).

   The adjustment costs borne by those factors which move (which may

be in the form of either temporary unemployment or a loss of productive

eﬃciency) are given by:


                                      [
                         µu = WuR .        lui . (Ui∗ − Ui )              (8)
                                      i
                                      [
                         µs = WsR .        lsi . (Si∗ − Si )
                                      i



   If adjustment costs are denominated in labour, this reduces eﬀective econ-




                                      13
omywide endowments


                           [
                                 Ui = U − Mui /WuR                             (9)
                             i
                           [
                                 Si = S − Msi /WsR
                             i



   The eﬀects of introducing adjustment costs into the model are thus: i)

the wage of each factor will now diﬀer between sectors by a proportion λU

for U and λs for S. (ii) factors are now less mobile in response to a price or

other shock. In particular, there is a range of traded goods prices over which

factors will not move, and this is wider the larger are λu and λs . (iii) following

Neary (1998) reduced mobility reduces the eﬀects of price changes on relative

wage changes in both sectors. (iv) because of the eﬀects of the adjustment

costs on factor movements and relative wages, the specialisation eﬀects in a

classical Heckscher-Ohlin model less likely to occur. The model is easier to

reconcile with observed data, where extreme changes in specialisation are not

observed. (v) if we assume that in the long run λu and λs are zero, a price

change will have larger eﬀects on output, employment and wages in the long

run than over the short-run. (vi) the long-run model is simply the short-run

model with the parameters λu and λs set to zero.

2.3 A Ricardo-Viner Fixed Factor Model of Trade and Wages

   Our Ricardo-Viner model utilizes a nested CES function to combine three


                                        14
factors: unskilled labour, U , skilled labour, S, and capital.                        Skilled and

unskilled labour are mobile across sectors with a common wage, WS , WU ,

while capital is sector specific, set at a level Ki . A CES nesting structure is

used in which the two types of labour are used in each sector i are combined

to form aggregate labour Li using a CES aggregate. This is then combined

with capital in a Cobb-Douglas function to yield total sectoral output, Yi .

   The CES aggregation function for the sectoral labour aggregate, Li , is of

the same form as equation (3)


       k                                                           lσi /(1+σi )
Li = Ai β i . (αu .Ui )(1+σi )/σi + (1 + β i ) (αs .Si )(1+σi )/σi                     (i = u, s)

                                                                                             (10)


   We can diﬀerentiate this to obtain first order conditions for the two wages

WU and WS in terms of a sectoral aggregate wage Wi and Li :


                                                      σ i /(1+σi )
       WU = Wi .Ai . (Li /Ai Ui )−1/σi .β i .αu                          (i = u, s)          (11)

                                                                σi //(1+σ i )
       WS = Wi .Ai . (Li /Ai Si )−1/σi . (1 − β i ) .αs                         (i = u, s)



   The aggregate labour wage, Wi is given by :



                               Wi = (Wu .Ui + Ws .Si ) /Li                                   (12)




                                               15
    The Cobb-Douglas aggregation of Li and Ki to form Yi is given by: Yi =
     γ    1−γ i
Υi Ki i .Li

    where γ i is the capital share coeﬃcient for industry I, Υi is a scale coeﬃ-

cient and from the first order conditions



                           Wi .Li = (1 − γ i ) .Pi Yi                      (14)

                              Ri = γ i .Pi Yi



where Ri is the rental return to capital.

3. CALIBRATION AND DATA

   To use these models in decomposition experiments to assess the relative

importance of trade surges and technological change for changes in wage in-

equality, we can calibrate each to observed data for 1979 and 1995 for the

UK. Since we compare the eﬀects of alternatively assuming changes between

those dates represent either short- or the long-run responses, we use three

calibrations. In the Ricardo-Viner model we have three factors: capital,

skilled and unskilled labour. In the other two versions (Heckscher-Ohlin or

H-O, and partial mobility) we reallocate capital income from our database

proportionately by sector, so the simplified model just has two factors. The

H-O model diﬀers from the partial mobility one in that λu and λs are set

to zero: calibration based on this assumption means assuming a long-run

equilibrium in the economy (ie the standard H-O model), whereas with λu

set at a non-zero level we are assuming the economy is at a short-run equi-

librium only. This latter treatment means that the adjustment process for

the unskilled factor reflects an outcome influenced by short-run adjustment

costs.

   To calibrate either the H-O or partial mobility models to the start- and

end-years, we solve the model for parameter values given data for the two

years, 1979 and 1995 with prices, wages, output and employment set at their

observed values. We assume a value for the elasticity of substitution between

                                     17
factors in production σ (we assume the same elasticity for both sectors, to

rule out the possibility of factor intensity reversals), and we assume values

for the diﬀerential between skilled and unskilled wages in the expanding

and declining sectors E and M . The unknowns at this stage are the model

parameters for each sector and each time period (αuit , αsit , β it and Ait ).

   We use the eight first-order conditions for cost-minimising behaviour

(equations for 2 factors for 2 sectors for 2 years, (1979 and 1995)).



            Wuit = Pti .Ait . (Yit /Ait .Uit )l/σi .β it .αsσ

                                                              i /(1=σi )
                                                                                    (15)

                                                                     sσ /(1+σ i )
             Wst = Pti .Ait . (Yit /Ait .Sit )l/σi . (1 − β it ) .αit i



   We assume a value for the elasticity of substitution between factors in

production, which we also assume to be constant across sectors (we carry out

the calibration and simulations for a central case σ = 1.25 with sensitivity

values of σ = 0.5 and σ = 2.0). Using this, it is possible to calibrate the

model so as to generate values of the technical coeﬃcients (αu , αs .β, and A)

for each sector. The other constraint we assume is that there is no decline in

industry-specific technology in either sector (ie Ai cannot decline from period

0 to period 1), based on the assumptions that technological innovations will

not be unlearnt once developed.

   For the Ricardo-Viner model, we calibrate capital share coeﬃcients γ i


                                            18
from income shares. The unskilled share parameters, β i , and the labour

quality coeﬃcients, αui and αsu are the same as in the H-O model, while the

Ai scale parameters for labour income are smaller.

   Having determined parameter values in each of the models using the cal-

ibration procedures described above (which we use for the long-run model

where λu , λs = 0 and the short-run model where λu > 0), we then compute

counterfactual equilibria with each model. Using the 1979 UK price, tech-

nology and endowment data as inputs, we compute equilibria for the UK

economy if endowments, prices and/or technological parameters are sepa-

rately changed to their 1995 model values. We then compare these computed

model equilibria to the actual 1995 data in which all these changes jointly

appear.

   Previous studies (eg Abrego and Whalley (2000)) have decomposed the

causes of increased inequality by carrying out simulations, first altering prices,

then technological parameters (or vice-versa). Due to model nonlinearities,

the order of decomposition can make a diﬀerence to how much change is

attributed to which cause. For this reason, we follow a method (similar to

that in Kose and Riezman’s (1999) study of customs unions), in which en-

dowments, trade and technology are changed in a series of small steps (first

1/10 of the total change in endowments, then 1/10 of the total change in

prices and 1/10 of the total change in technology, then repeating the cycle):

the smaller the steps, the less order matters.

3.1 Data

       We use data for the UK for 1979 and 1995 for our model analyses, similar

to those used by Abrego and Whalley (1999). They use data on skilled and

unskilled employment and wages for two broad categories of industry, taken

from the UK Labour Force Survey. We use an estimate of a 7.9 per cent fall

in the relative price of unskilled imports between 1979 and 1995 based on an

estimated derived by Abrego and Whalley (1999) from Neven and Wyplosz

(1999)4 .

       As two of our models have only two factors, against the three in Abrego

and Whalley (1999a), we reallocate income accruing to the fixed factor in

each sector between skilled and unskilled labour in the proportions used in

that sector. Following Abrego and Whalley value added is rounded to equal

gross output.

       The 1979 and 1995 UK data we use are shown in Table 1 below. Price and

wage data are in real terms. The rise in the average real wage of unskilled

labour was approximately 23 per cent between 1979 and 19955 , reflecting an

increase in the premium for skilled over unskilled wage rates from 22% in

   4
     Although Neven and Wyplosz find that prices of imports from OECD countries or from
developing countries do not vary much by sector skill-intensity, imports from developing
countries fall relatively in price to those from OECD countries, and these weigh more
heavily in total UK imports in the skill-intensive sectors.
   5
     This is calibrated to UK GNP growth — see the UK national accounts 1996 Table 1.3.


                                          20
1979 to over 59% in 1995. This occurs despite the ratio of skilled/unskilled

labour inputs rising in both sectors. While there is an increase in the share

of skilled intensive exportables in total production, both sectors show rising

output. The change in industrial structure in the data is therefore a relatively

minor factor compared with what a Heckscher-Ohlin model would usually be

expected to produce in response to the assumed 7.9% fall in the relative

goods prices6 .

       The unskilled labour mobility cost, λu , reflects studies which tend to

indicate that unskilled labour may be less mobile between sectors than skilled.

Kruse (1988) suggest unemployment periods in the US are generally longer

for unskilled rather than skilled workers, which, in terms of our model might

suggest a higher threshold wage diﬀerential for the unskilled before they start

to move between sectors. This is borne out by Haynes, Upward and Wright’s

(2000) UK study, which suggest that those with lower skills experience longer

unemployment duration.

       We have chosen, for simplicity, to assume that only unskilled labour,

factor U , is aﬀected by mobility costs (ie λs = 0; λu ≥ 0) and we use a

   6
    With an elasticity of substitution of 1.25 between the two fully-mobile factors, and
starting with output and employment as in our database for 1979, we show complete
specialisation in good X after a price fall of just 6.3% in good M. This corresponds to a
change of nearly 40% in relative skilled wages.Details of this calculation are available on
request from the authors.

figure of 13.7 % for 19957 , an ‘upper end’ estimate of mobility costs. In later

sensitivity analysis, we also evaluate models with lower values.




   7
    This assumes that the 7 34 % diﬀerence in wages between sectors reported by Green-
away et al. (1999) for the UK in 1990 is explained entirely by lower unskilled wages in the
declining sectors, in turn reflecting an unwillingness to move due to mobility costs. We
assume the 7 34 % diﬀerence in average wages comprises no diﬀerential for skilled workers
and a 13.7 % diﬀerential for unskilled.

4. MODEL RESULTS

   We use three calibrations to the 1979 and 1995 data: one involving a long-

run two-factor model in which all factors are able to move freely in response

to price and technology shocks; a second short-run model in which unskilled

labour is only partially mobile, if intersectoral wage diﬀerentials exceed a

threshold, assumed to be 13.7% of wages; and a third using a three-factor

Ricardo-Viner model with sectorally fixed capital. We concentrate initially

on the case where the elasticity of substitution between factors of production

is 1.25 in both sectors.

   Table 2 outlines our decomposition results for observed than actually ob-

served changes in relative wages of skilled and unskilled labour between 1979

and 1995 using these three calibrated models. The contribution of various

causal factors to the observed change in the average skilled to unskilled wage

ratio, which Table 1 indicates increased from 1.22 to 1.59, and is expressed

by the contribution of each causal factor as a percentage of the total change.

   In the long-run Heckscher-Ohlin factors mobile model (first column of

numbers), the increase in skilled and fall in unskilled factor endowments has

no eﬀect, as the factor price insensitivity result (due to Leamer and Levinsohn

(1995)) suggests. However, the model shows substantial sensitivity to the

change in world prices, which alone accounts for 152 % of the total observed

wage change. There is also substantial factor bias in favour of the skilled

                                      23
factor (skill bias +184% and factor quality +255%), and rise in the skilled

share of output. These results fit the observed wage and output changes due

to a sizeable sector-biased technical change in the opposite direction (-491%),

favouring the unskilled intensive sector M .

   In the second column, the partial mobility model shows diﬀerent results.

The change of endowments has a large eﬀect on relative wages narrowing

the gap between skilled and unskilled wage rates (-92% of the total net

observed change). The eﬀect of world prices is reduced to around 83% of

the observed total wage change, while sector bias, which still favours the

unskilled-intensive good, is also smaller in this model compared to the fac-

tors mobile model (-228% of the observed change against -491%). The main

factor in this model behind the increased inequality is the change in the skill

share within industries (187% of the observed change), with a slightly smaller

contribution from factor quality.

   The final column of Table 2 reports results for the Ricardo-Viner fixed

factors model sectoral output and employment are less sensitive to price

or sector-biased technical changes. World price changes account for just

19% of the total observed change in relative wages, 1/10 of the change in

the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Sector-biased technical change has a moderate

damping eﬀect on inequality (-43%). The main picture conveyed by this

model is strong factor-biased change within industries (+256% of the ob-

                                      24
served net change) in favor of skilled labour, oﬀset partially by large eﬀects

of endowment changes (-191%).

   Table 3a reports the sensitivity results for the partial mobility model to

changes in the assumed mobility cost. Moving rightward the columns show

adjustment costs for labour increasing from zero (Long-run model) to our

maximum 13.7 %, and shows that the eﬀect of trade in explaining wage

changes falls markedly as the adjustment cost rises, from 152% of total ob-

served changes in the Heckscher-Ohlin case to 83% in our maximum adjust-

ment cost case. The latter is still, however, somewhat larger than estimated

by most other empirical studies of the contribution of trade. But it is worth

noting that even a relatively modest adjustment cost, such as the 5% cost

in our second column, significantly changes the decomposition results com-

pared to Heckscher-Ohlin: the eﬀect of trade is reduced from 152% of the

observed change to 126%.The roles of factor-biased technology changes, in

the opposite direction: the role of endowment changes rises rapidly as factor

mobility costs are introduced.

   Table 3b summarizes the sensitivity of the Ricardo-Viner fixed factor

model to diﬀerent assumptions about the share of fixed factors in value added.

The higher the assumed share of fixed factors in value added, the less role for

trade or sector bias and the greater the role of endowment changes. However,

the most revealing column is that where we have assumed just 2% of value

                                      25
added consists of fixed factor payments. Even with this low share, the model

behaves very diﬀerently to the Heckscher-Ohlin model: the eﬀect of traded

prices, for example, is cut from 152% of observed changes to 101%. For a 5%

factor share, the price eﬀect is just 65% of total wage changes. This indicates

that the magnitude of Stolper-Samuelson trade eﬀects is not at all robust in

the face of even small amounts of fixed factors.

   Table 4 explores the sensitivity of our decomposition results in the three

models to the elasticity of substitution between unskilled and skilled labour

in production, which we set at 0.5 and 2 instead of our central case value of

1.25.

   Comparing estimates of the contribution of various factors when the

assumed elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labour is

changed shows that the relationship between elasticity and decomposition es-

timates is neither simple or monotonic. In most cases the eﬀects of skill bias

(positive) and endowments change (negative) on relative wages are higher

when the elasticity of substitution between factors is lower. Factor quality is

more important in explaining relative wage changes with higher substitution

elasticities. The relationship with price changes and sector bias seems to be

non-monotonic.

5. CONCLUSIONS

   In this paper, we compare the use of short-run and long-run trade models

to decompose changes in observed wage inequalities between skilled and un-

skilled labour over the period 1979-95 for the UK into trade and technology,

and endowment change components. Results of these decompositions are

very diﬀerent depending upon whether a short-run model, with limited mo-

bility of unskilled labour, or a long-run model is used to explain the observed

changes. This emphasises that assumed model structure applied to the same

data in decomposition will substantially aﬀect the perception of the role of

trade in wage inequality change.

   In the long-run model, the usual Heckscher-Ohlin result of factor price

insensitivity holds, so that the rise in relative supply of skilled labour has

no eﬀect on skill premia. The factor-bias of technical change has no eﬀect

(except insofar as the relative quality of skilled labour has risen). In contrast,

the eﬀects of observed world price increases are very large: on its own this

price increase would cause a larger shift in output towards the skill-intensive

goods, and a larger rise in skill premia than actually observed. The long-run

model can only be made consistent with the observed output and income

changes if the sector-bias of technical change (the residual category of the

decomposition) is in the opposite direction: for UK total factor productivity

in the unskilled-intensive sector to have risen faster than in the skill-intensive

                                       27
sector, so damping the tendency of output to switch.

   By contrast, when we use a short-run model for these decompositions,

one in which, unskilled labour is only partially mobile, the decomposition

results are quite diﬀerent. The rise in the relative supply of unskilled labour

now has a sizeable damping eﬀect on inequality.         Factor-biased technical

change (leading to a rise in skilled/unskilled input ratios in both sectors) de-

spite rising skill premia will raise relative skilled wages in a short-run model.

The eﬀect of trade is less marked in the short-run model, though still quite

substantial. The sector-bias in technical progress (which had been large and

favoured the unskilled-intensive sector in the long-run model) is relatively

minor in our short-run model.

   The other short-run model specification we examine is a Ricardo-Viner

model, where capital is assumed to be fixed. The eﬀects of this are even

more marked than in the partial mobility case - prices and sector-biased

technical change move only a small eﬀect, while factor-biased change is the

main cause of insensitivity in inequality, oﬀset by endowment changes. Sen-

sitivity analysis shows that, even when only a small proportion of valued

added is linked to fixed factors; the model is greatly changed compared to

the Hecksher-Ohlin formulation.

   There are a number of reasons we believe for the short-run model de-

composition to be the more plausible. First, the sign of the sector bias in

                                       28
our calibrated long-run model is contrary to what comparisons the eﬀects of

computerisation on wage inquality (eg by Haskel and Slaughter would indi-

cate. Second, the eﬀects of labour upskilling and of factor-biased technical

change in the short-term models are more consistent with what studies by

labour economists would indicate (eg Borjas et al., 1992; Murphy and Welch,

1991; and Katz and Murphy, 1992)
