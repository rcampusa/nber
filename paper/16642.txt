                                             ABSTRACT

Fire sales are forced sales of assets in which high-valuation bidders are sidelined, typically due to debt
overhang problems afflicting many specialist bidders simultaneously. We overview theoretical and
empirical research on asset fire sales, which shows how they can arise, how they can lead to asset
under-valuations, how contracts and bankruptcy regimes adjust to the risk of fire sales, how fire sales
can lead to downward spirals or cascades in asset prices, how arbitrage fails in the presence of fire
sales, and how fire sales can reduce productive investment. We conclude by showing how asset fire
sales shed light on several aspects of the recent financial crisis, and can account for the success of
the liquidity provision and asset purchase policies of the Federal Reserve.

       Analysts of the recent financial crisis often refer to the role of asset “fire sales” in

depleting the balance sheets of financial institutions and aggravating the fragility of the

financial system. For example, a report from the U.S. Treasury (2009) held: “An initial

fundamental shock associated with the bursting of the housing bubble and deteriorating

economic conditions generated losses for leveraged investors including banks. . . . The

resulting need to reduce risk triggered a wide-scale deleveraging in these markets and led

to fire sales.”    Similarly, a discussion of the crisis by leading American financial

economists (French et al., 2010, p. 67) argued: “A bank that simply suffers large losses

may be forced to reduce its risk by selling assets at distressed or fire-sale prices. If other

banks must revalue their assets at these temporarily low market values, the first sale can

set off a cascade of fire sales that inflicts losses on many institutions. Thus, whether

through defaults or fire sales, one troubled bank can damage many others, reducing the

financial system’s capacity to bear risk and make loans.” Economists at the Federal

Reserve (Carlson, Haubrick, Cherney, and Wakefield, 2009), in explaining the Fed policy

of guaranteeing money market funds during the crisis, write: “The effect of the

announcement was to permit an orderly management of withdrawals from the money

funds, preventing a liquidation of assets at distressed prices, which could have

destabilized the funds’ net asset values.”

       The current crisis is not the first where terminology of a “fire sale” has been used.

In 1998 testimony to Congress following the collapse and rescue of the Long-Term

Capital Management hedge fund, Fed Chairman Greenspan testified (as quoted in

Caballero and Simsek, 2010): “Quickly unwinding a complicated portfolio that contains

exposure to all manner of risks, such as that of LTCM, in such market conditions



                                              2
amounts to conducting a fire sale. The prices received in a time of stress do not reflect

longer run potential, adding to the losses incurred.”

       The term “fire sale” has been around since the nineteenth century to describe

firms selling smoke-damaged merchandise at cut-rate prices in the aftermath of a fire.

But what are fire sales in broad financial markets with hundreds of participants? How

can fire sales matter for generic goods, such as airplanes or financial securities? In

modern financial research, the term “fire sale” has acquired a different meaning. As we

suggested in a 1992 paper, a fire sale is essentially a forced sale of an asset at a dislocated

price. The asset sale is forced in the sense that the seller cannot pay creditors without

selling assets. The price is dislocated because the highest potential bidders are typically

involved in a similar activity as the seller, and are therefore themselves indebted and

cannot borrow more to buy the asset. Indeed, rather than bidding for the asset, they

might be selling similar assets themselves. Assets are then bought by nonspecialists who,

knowing that they have less expertise with the assets in question, are only willing to buy

at valuations that are much lower.

       Assets sold in fire sales can trade at prices far below value in best use, causing

severe losses to sellers. Of course, borrowers and lenders can seek to negotiate and

renegotiate contracts to avoid fire sales, but sometimes they fail. Fire sales and efforts to

avoid them shed light on a range of empirical phenomena, such as the structure of debt

contracts, organization of bankruptcy regimes, and even the failures of arbitrage and

market efficiency in financial markets. Fire sales can also lead to fragility of financial

markets during crises. When a fire sale leads to a sharp reduction in an asset’s price,

similar assets held by other market participants decline in value as well, which might



                                              3
bring them also to financial distress and forced asset sales. This self-reinforcing process

can lead to downward spirals or cascades in asset prices and net worth of market

participants.    Because of fire sales, risk becomes systemic. Through this process, asset

fire sales and the deterioration of the net worth of firms and financial institutions can

severely undermine financial intermediation, leading to reductions of real investment and

output.

          In this paper, we selectively review some of the research on fire sales,

emphasizing both concepts and supporting evidence. We begin by describing our 1992

model of fire sales and the related findings in empirical corporate finance. We then show

that models of fire sales can account for several related phenomena during the recent

financial crisis, including the contraction of the banking system and the failures of

arbitrage in financial markets exemplified by historically unprecedented differences in

prices of very similar securities.      We then link fire sales to macroeconomics by

discussing how such dislocations of security prices and the reduction in balance sheets of

banks can reduce investment and output. Finally, we consider how the concept of fire

sales can help us think about government interventions in financial markets, including the

evidently successful Federal Reserve interventions in 2009. Fire sales are surely not the

whole story of the financial crisis, but they are a phenomenon that binds together many

elements of the crisis.



Modeling Fire Sales

          A fire sale of an asset is a forced sale, which can occur for a number of reasons.

A person might sell his car quickly because he has urgent medical expenses. A mutual



                                              4
fund might sell securities because it faces capital withdrawals by its shareholders (Coval

and Stafford, 2007). A firm might quickly sell a division to pay a regulatory fine.

However, the most common mechanism that precipitates forced sales of both real and

financial assets is collateralized lending. In such lending agreements, collateral is a

borrower’s pledge of specific property to a lender to secure repayment of a loan. If the

borrower defaults on a loan, the borrower forfeits to the lender the property pledged as

collateral—sometimes automatically and sometimes through a legal process. Most debt

contracts, including mortgages and corporate debt, are collateralized. When the borrower

fails to either repay or meet some conditions of the loan, the lender has the right to sell

collateral, and might wish for various reasons to do this quickly.

       Despite the importance of collateralized lending in the world, the traditional

model of corporate finance of Modigliani and Miller (1958) has no role for collateral in

supporting debt contracts. In that model, debt is simply a promise of a part of cash flows

of the firm. Even second-generation corporate finance models emphasizing asymmetric

information, such as Myers and Majluf (1984), leave no room for collateral. These

models thus fail to capture what can in situations of financial distress become the central

feature of debt contracts.

       Models of debt contracts supported by collateral began to appear in corporate

finance in the late 1980s, as the field shifted its attention from describing securities in

terms of their cash flows to emphasizing their voting and other control rights (Grossman

and Hart, 1988; Aghion and Bolton, 1992; Hart, 1995). In an early paper along these

lines, Townsend (1979) models debt as a contract that gives the lender the right to

investigate the borrower and then seize its cash flows if the borrower defaults on its debt.



                                             5
In this costly state verification model, control over the cash flows shifts from the

borrower to the lender after default. More natural models of collateralized debt were

proposed in the late 1980s by Hart and Moore (1994, 1995, 1998). In their models, the

lender has the explicit legal right to seize and liquidate collateral in the event of a default.

The threat of liquidation provides an incentive for the borrower to repay.

       In these models, the liquidation value of collateral is taken as exogenous.

Although liquidation value can be low for a highly idiosyncratic asset with no alternative

use (Williamson, 1988), there is no reason in these models why liquidation value should

be especially low for a generic asset such as a commercial airplane or a financial security.

For such assets, the most plausible reason why specialists are not buying is that they

themselves are financially constrained. This might happen, for example, when all the

industry specialists suffer the same adverse industry-wide or market-wide shock, and so

are distressed, and selling assets, at the same time. The constraints facing industry

specialists are the second essential feature of fire sales. An asset fire sale is thus a forced

sale in which high-valuation bidders are sidelined, often due to debt overhang problems

afflicting many specialists simultaneously (Shleifer and Vishny, 1992).

       To describe this situation, we used a version of a model in Hart (1993) and Hart

and Moore (1995). An entrepreneur borrows some money from a lender to buy an asset,

such as an airplane, used to generate cash flows. The optimal contract is a combination

of short-term and long-term senior debt collateralized by the asset, the former used to

force liquidation when the project turns out to be bad, the latter used to provide debt

overhang that prevents the borrower from borrowing more and wasting money. If the

project is bad, the optimal contract calls for the sale of the asset. Unlike Hart and Moore,



                                               6
we considered liquidation as a sale of the asset in a market in which there is a potential

high-valuation industry specialist who values the asset a lot, but also low-valuation

outsiders, who are not expert at using the asset and hence have lower valuations.      For

example, if the asset is a plane, and the seller is an airline, the high-valuation industry

specialists would be other airlines.    In this case, low-valuation outsiders might be

financial buyers, who would buy planes to lease them to other airlines.

       The key observation is that the specialist industry buyer, who would be the natural

candidate for buying the assets, might itself be financially encumbered, and hence unable

to bid, at precisely the time when the assets are being liquidated. This would happen, for

example, if liquidation is prompted by an industry-wide adverse shock. In the case of

airplanes, consider a decline in travel caused by higher perceived terrorism risk, which

creates cash shortages and external financing problems for nearly all airlines. If industry

specialists do not have, and cannot raise, external funds to bid, the asset in liquidation

will need to be acquired by an industry outsider at a lower price than value in best use.

The specialists are sidelined.   Financially constrained industry buyers have become

central to many models, and have been variously referred to as specialists, natural buyers,

optimists, and farmers, as we discuss below.

       This analysis raises a number of questions.       Why don’t the lender and the

borrower renegotiate, rather than have the lender repossess the asset? Why doesn’t the

lender, once it has repossessed the asset, hold on to it until market conditions improve?

Presumably, it is in everyone’s interest to avoid a fire sale. As we discuss below,

substantial efforts are often made by market participants to avoid fire sales, by means of

both how contracts are structured before the default and finding new financing rather than



                                               7
repossessing the asset after the default. The Coase theorem is hard at work. But such

solutions are not always possible. Borrowers often do not have the cash needed to avoid

a fire sale, and cannot raise additional funds because (as in the Hart–Moore optimal

financial structure) they face overhang from senior debt.          When negotiations do not

succeed because additional cash flows cannot be pledged and a high-valuation buyer is

not available, a fire sale is difficult to avoid.

        There are two related ideas in finance used to explain why some bidders do not

bid, and hence the price falls below value in best use. Grossman and Miller (1988)

introduced the idea of slow-moving capital, arguing that sometimes it takes time for

capital to come to the market, and in the meantime the price can deviate from

fundamental value. The authors had in mind a very short time period, perhaps a few

minutes or hours, during which price pressure from a rapid sale would be felt. This

theory is a less-compelling account of price dislocations that last for months. Allen and

Gale (1994) stress the costs of market participation as the explanation for the absence of

some buyers. Allen and Gale’s theory is a good explanation for why only industry

insiders, and not others, are present in the market at the time of the sale. One still needs

an explanation of why, in a fire sale, it is these insiders, and especially the insiders, who

are sidelined.

        Our model of fire sales yields a notion of liquidity as the difference between

market price and value in best use.                 When market participants are financially

unencumbered, liquidation brings prices close to value in best use, and markets are said

to be liquid. When, in contrast, market participants—and in particular specialists in using




                                                    8
or holding the asset—are financially encumbered, liquidation leads to sale of assets to

outsiders at lower prices, and markets are said to be illiquid.



Evidence on Fire Sales of Real Assets

       The theory of fire sales raises questions. Do fire sales actually exist? Do they

have significant effects on prices? Do firms take actions to avoid them? Do the terms of

collateralized loan contracts reflect the risk of fire sales?     Are bankruptcy regimes

responsive to the risk of fire sales?

       The empirical research on fire sales of real assets began with Pulvino’s (1998)

study of prices of used airplanes. Commercial airplanes present a great advantage for the

study of asset sales because the industry is heavily regulated, and as a consequence, an

enormous amount is known about each airplane, so that it becomes possible to control for

quality. Pulvino compared the prices of planes sold by financially distressed airlines to

those sold by the airlines that were not distressed, holding the exact characteristics of the

planes constant. He found that used planes sold by distressed airlines bring 10 to 20

percent lower prices than planes sold by undistressed airlines. Similar magnitudes appear

in other studies. For example, Campbell, Giglio, and Pathak (forthcoming) report in a

study of forced home sales that “foreclosure discounts are on average 27% of the value of

the house.”

       Other research shows that firms try to avoid such sales of assets in illiquid

markets. Asquith, Gertner, and Scharfstein (1994) find that, when industry conditions are

bad, a debt work-out is more likely than a liquidation. Schligemann, Stulz, and Walkling

(2002) study divestitures of business units by U.S. firms, and find that firms are more



                                              9
likely to divest segments from industries with a more liquid market for corporate assets,

even when this means keeping some of their worst-performing units.                  Almeida,

Campello, and Heckbarth (2009) show how poorly performing firms agree to be acquired

by firms with substantial liquidity, even when there are no synergies in the merger, in

order to avoid having to sell assets in illiquid markets. These are clear efforts by firms

and their lenders to avoid joint wealth loss in a fire sale.

       What about contractual adaptations to the risk of fire sales?          Benmelech and

Bergman (2008) take advantage of the fact that, in the United States, the acquisition of

airplanes by airlines is often financed by individual plane debt contracts. They then

consider what happens during renegotiation of debt contracts collateralized by airplanes.

They find that airlines successfully renegotiate their lease obligations downward when

their financial position is sufficiently poor and when the liquidation value of their fleet is

low. What determines an airline’s bargaining power is the ability of the lessors to lease

the plane to its competitors, which falls when the industry is in distress. Benmelech and

Bergman (2009) find that airlines borrow on more attractive terms when airplanes used as

collateral have less financially-encumbered buyers.             Benmelech and Bergman

(forthcoming) show quite remarkably that the bankruptcy of an airline raises the cost of

capital to its competitors who have similar airplanes.         Using a broader sample of

industries, Ortiz-Molina and Phillips (2010) also find that firms in industries with more

liquid assets (meaning more potential buyers), and during periods of high asset liquidity,

face a lower cost of capital. This evidence suggests that lenders to firms are aware of the

costs of fire sales and structure debt contracts to take them into account.




                                              10
       Fire sale considerations also play a role in the debate on the optimality of the two

main choices in corporate bankruptcy: reorganization (Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy

Code) or liquidation (Chapter 7). Many economists and legal scholars favor Chapter 7

liquidation, using the argument that auctions generally allocate resources to those who

value them most (for example, Baird, 1986). In our 1992 paper, we argued that this logic

does not hold when high-valuation bidders in auctions are financially impaired. Indeed,

the standard case for Chapter 11 reorganization, while not focusing specifically on fire

sales, warns about the risk of lost value arising through piecemeal liquidation of firms for

prices substantially below the value in best use. In countries that rely on Chapter 7-style

liquidations, such as Sweden, the original lenders to firms finance the liquidation bids,

often by the existing management, thus avoiding fire sales (Stromberg, 2000).

Subsequent research on a cross-section of countries has confirmed that liquidation can be

very costly. In developed countries, in particular, liquidation leads to lower recovery

rates for creditors than reorganization (Djankov, Hart, McLiesh, and Shleifer, 2008).

       The punch line of corporate finance research is that fire sales of real assets do

exist, that they lead to substantial price discounts, and that firms and lenders are aware of

these discounts and take them into account both before and after the onset of financial

distress. But there is limited drama in fire sales of real assets because firms, unlike

financial institutions, do not exacerbate crises when they sell assets in fire sales. Fire

sales of financial assets raise new challenges.



Fire Sales of Financial Assets




                                             11
       Fire sales of securities have broader effects than fire sales of real assets because

financial investors, such as hedge funds or banks, finance themselves with money that

can be withdrawn quickly.      Demand deposits in banks are the standard example, but

investors in mutual funds and hedge funds can also withdraw funds on short notice.

Financial institutions are also typically heavily leveraged, and some of their loans are

short-term, collateralized, or both. Many banks fund their activities with commercial

paper, which is a debt instrument with duration between a day and several months. Such

funding requires almost continuous renewal. More recently, hedge funds and dealer

banks financed some of their activities with repurchase agreements, which are extremely

short-term loans collateralized by longer-term securities.       Adrian and Shin (2010)

document high and growing leverage ratios of financial institutions, reaching debt-to-

equity ratios of 30 or more for dealer banks.         Much of this debt is short- term

collateralized loans.

       The extreme vulnerability of financial investors to sudden stops in short-term

financing can lead to cascades of liquidation. When financial investors are forced to

liquidate their holdings, security prices decline. These declines, in turn, prompt further

fund withdrawals and collateral calls for both these investors and their competitors.

Such self-reinforcing fire sales were central in the recent financial crisis. We begin by

describing the relevant mechanisms, and then turn to crisis facts.

       In financial economics, the discussion of fire sales of financial assets is intimately

related to an older idea of limited arbitrage, which is the central building block of models

of market inefficiency and behavioral finance (Shleifer and Summers, 1990).           In the

standard view of arbitrage, arbitrageurs lean against the wind to correct the mispricing of



                                            12
financial assets—and thus their influence is fundamentally stabilizing.    But might it be

possible that arbitrageurs lose funds under management, and hence their ability to lean

against the wind, at precisely the same time as prices move away from fundamental

values and arbitrage opportunities improve? Might arbitrageurs be more likely to exit

their positions, rather than doubling up, when prices are most wrong? Might they sell

assets in a fire sale?

        In Shleifer and Vishny (1997), we connected the ideas of limited arbitrage and fire

sales in a model of arbitrageurs, such as hedge funds, who experience capital withdrawals

when their performance is poor. Consider an arbitrageur that raises funds from outside

investors and bets against a mispricing of a security which the arbitrageur knows for

certain will disappear after some time.          Suppose, however, that this mispricing

temporarily gets more extreme, and so the arbitrageur loses money. Unfortunately for

this arbitrageur, outside investors do not know whether the losses on these positions are

due to a temporary deepening of mispricing, or rather to the errors in this arbitrageur’s

strategies.   Absent such knowledge, the outside investors may choose to withdraw

capital. If they do so, the arbitrageur who is fully invested has to reduce its position and

return capital to investors, even though holding on, or even adding to the holdings, is

extremely attractive.

        But here comes the problem. It is likely that the arbitrageur is not unique in

following a particular strategy. When this arbitrageur and a number of the arbitrageur’s

competitors who are doing the same thing all face fund withdrawals, they all start

liquidating their positions, which only causes mispricing to widen further. This is a fire

sale of financial assets, but with an even deeper problem: As arbitrageurs liquidate their



                                            13
positions and mispricing widens, their losses grow, so that fire sales and the withdrawals

of funds from arbitrage are self-reinforcing.      This feedback effect from growing

mispricing to arbitrageur causes prices to spiral or cascade away from fundamental

values. This process can lead to a complete collapse of the market, or it can be arrested

by the entrance of outsiders to support the market when prices fall far enough.

       Our 1997 model focused on the withdrawals of investor funds, but a similar and

even stronger argument can be made if arbitrageurs finance their positions with debt. In

an important paper, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) develop a macroeconomic model of

credit cycles driven by self-reinforcing changes in asset values and availability of

collateralized loans. In their model, there is a homogeneous asset called “land.” They

refer to high-valuation users of land as “farmers,” and to low-valuation users as

“gatherers.” Because farmers are the high-productivity users of land, they borrow as

much as they can to invest, using their land holdings as collateral. But suppose that an

adverse shock hits farmers’ profits. Now their net worth is not as high, and they cannot

maintain as high a level of borrowing.       Because the farmers are levered up to the

maximum, they have to liquidate some land. But all the other farmers are also fully

levered up, so the land must be sold to the less-productive gatherers who have some spare

debt capacity but value the land less. A fire sale occurs.        As land shifts to less-

productive gatherers, its fundamental value declines, which reduces its market value as

collateral and precipitates further deleveraging and fire sales of land by farmers. The

process only stops because gatherers face decreasing marginal productivity, so eventually

land becomes so unproductive in their hands and cheap that farmers can afford to hold it.

In this way, Kiyotaki and Moore obtain a feedback from the declining value of collateral



                                            14
to further deleveraging by high-valuation users, which results in a downward spiral in

prices.

          Gromb and Vayanos (2002) present a related model of fire sales leading to

widening mispricing in the context of financial arbitrage. In their model, a widening of

mispricing can lead to forced deleveraging by arbitrageurs due to a decline of collateral

values, which in turns leads to further widening of mispricing.           Equity and credit

withdrawals by financiers from arbitrageurs work in the same direction of causing a

downward price spiral in the valuation of a mispriced asset.

          The workings of our 1997 model and the Gromb–Vayanos (2002) model were

seen in the collapse of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998 (referred to in

the Greenspan testimony mentioned at the start of this paper). LTCM was a heavily

leveraged hedge fund that sustained some losses on its positions during the Russian

government’s bond default in summer 1998. These losses precipitated substantial calls

for cash or more collateral by short-term lenders to LTCM, as well as fund withdrawals

by its investors. Unable to come up with cash, LTCM had to liquidate its positions in a

fire sale, which caused enormous price dislocations and losses for other hedge funds,

which then also had to liquidate. The process was stopped before it could run its full

destructive course by a takeover of LTCM by a consortium of financial institutions,

organized by the New York Federal Reserve to “avoid a fire sale liquidation of LTCM’s

positions” (Edwards, 1999).

          An important feature of debt contracts collateralized by securities is time-varying

margins often called “haircuts.” To protect themselves from default, lenders require

borrowers to post a margin, which means that they lend less than 100 percent of the price



                                              15
of the collateral. If the market price of collateral falls, lenders require either more

collateral or some cash back, which the borrower has to come up with to avoid having the

collateral liquidated by the lender. This mechanism can precipitate a fire sale in two

distinct ways. First, as the value of collateral declines, the borrower might be unable to

come up with the cash to maintain its loan, and hence the collateral will be liquidated.

Second, the margins or haircuts are determined endogenously (Geanakoplos, 2003). A

negative shock to collateral can lead to increased price volatility (or alternatively

increased disagreement among investors), and thus increased equilibrium margins and

haircuts imposed by lenders keen to protect themselves against losses. If that happens,

the borrower must come up with still more collateral, or return some cash. This is again

extremely destabilizing, since increases in margins force traders to reduce their positions,

which can in turn further deepen mispricing.

       Several of the mechanisms just described are analyzed together by Brunnermeier

and Pedersen (2009), who model the simultaneous determination of security prices and

margins. In their model, as security prices fall, margins or haircuts required to borrow

using these assets as collateral rise because by assumption volatility increases.        They

refer to this phenomenon as a decline in “funding liquidity.” Unable to meet margin

calls, arbitrageurs are forced to sell their securities in a fire sale, making markets illiquid

in the sense of prices diverging from values. They refer to this as “market liquidity,”

similar to the sense of our 1992 paper. The two spirals described by Brunnermeier and

Pedersen reinforce each other: as prices fall, margins rise, arbitrageurs sell, and prices fall

further, leading to a collapse of both prices and liquidity in a market.




                                              16
       Even before the financial crisis, considerable empirical work documented the

significance of limited arbitrage as related to fire sales in permitting deviations of prices

from fundamental values. We describe two strands of this research. The first concerns

failures of arbitrage directly. Mitchell, Pedersen, and Pulvino (2007), for example, study

merger arbitrage during the crash of 1987 and convertible bond arbitrage in 2005, a time

when the convertible bond market imploded following investor withdrawal of equity

capital from money-losing hedge funds. They show quite directly the self-reinforcing

effects of arbitrageur losses, equity withdrawals, and liquidation of positions, which in

turn lead to further losses. Mitchell and Pulvino (2010) present an even more striking

study of arbitrage failures during the current financial crisis. The authors look at a range

of very common arbitrage strategies involving corporate securities, such as convertible

debt arbitrage, credit default swap–corporate debt arbitrage, and several others. They

show that in the worst months of the crisis during 2008, arbitrage spreads—differences in

the prices of nearly identical securities—reached fantastic levels.           For example,

convertible debentures normally included in arbitrage trades, and typically mispriced by

less than 2 percent, sold at a 10 percent discount.

       A second line of research, initiated by Coval and Stafford (2007), focuses on the

behavior of mutual funds. These funds are forced to sell securities immediately in

response to withdrawals by their investors. Coval and Stafford point out that by focusing

on portfolios of stocks that mutual funds hold at the beginning of the quarter, and

knowing their returns during the quarter (since mutual funds report net asset values

continuously), one can predict roughly which stocks will be sold when investors liquidate

their holdings of poorly performing funds at the end of the quarter. This approach turns



                                             17
out to successfully predict future negative returns on the stocks held by poorly

performing funds, and has been used in other studies (Dong, 2010; Ellul, Jotikasthira, and

Lundblad, 2010; Greenwood and Thesmar, 2009; Jotikasthira, Lundblad, and Ramodarai,

2010).



Fire Sales and the Financial Crisis

         To illuminate the significance of fire sales in the recent financial crisis, we start

with a generally accepted narrative of the crisis, as summarized in Table 1. We sketch

only the most basic outline; more detailed accounts are contained in Brunnermeier

(2009), Gorton and Metrick (2010), and Pozsar, Adrian, Ashcraft, and Boesky (2010).

The financial crisis was most proximately related to the bubble in the housing market and

to the financing of this bubble with mortgage-backed securities. These mortgage-backed

securities were created by pooling together portfolios of mortgages and then separating

them into tranches such that the most senior tranches were perceived to be virtually safe

and rated AAA by credit rating agencies (Coval, Jurek, and Stafford, 2009). Because of

this high rating, senior tranches of mortgage-backed securities ended up in the portfolios

of institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies, but also as

highly leveraged investments on the balance sheets of hedge funds, dealer banks,

commercial banks, and special investment vehicles guaranteed by these banks.

         There remains a controversy as to why dealer banks were so exposed to mortgage-

backed securities. Some of their holdings were surely explained by inventory and other

market-making considerations, but some banks were perhaps speculating on the spreads




                                              18
                                    Table 1
                       A Narrative of the Financial Crisis


1. A housing bubble inflates in the mid 2000s. Homes are financed by mortgages
   that are increasingly securitized. Although the quality of mortgages deteriorates,
   the securities into which these mortgages are packaged are perceived to be safe
   and receive AAA-ratings.

2. Financial institutions such as banks and dealer banks retain substantial exposure
   to the real estate market through direct holdings of commercial real estate and
   direct holdings of mortgage-backed securities, but also through implicit
   guarantees of special investment vehicles they organize that hold mortgage-
   backed securities and finance them with commercial paper.

3. Bad news about the housing market in the summer of 2007 surprises investors in
   AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities and precipitates a sequence of substantial
   disruptions in financial markets, such as the collapse of the asset-backed
   commercial paper market. Aggressive liquidity interventions from the Federal
   Reserve, including lending to market participants against risky collateral, stabilize
   markets through the summer of 2008 despite continued bad news about housing.

4. In September 2008, several events, including a run on money market funds,
   nationalization of AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, and particularly the
   collapse of Lehman Brothers, precipitate a massive financial crisis. Banks’
   balance sheets contract because of massive losses on assets and withdrawal of
   short-term financing, which prompts banks to liquidate assets in fire sales. The
   consequences of fire sales are exacerbated by uncertainty about bank solvency
   and government policy.

5. In response to their losses and to reduced availability of financing, banks cut
   lending to firms.

6. The economy slides into a major recession.

7. Starting in October 2008, the government begins massive interventions in
   financial markets, including equity injections in banks, expansion of lending
   against risky collateral, but also direct purchases of long-term agency bonds,
   which sharply reduce the supply of risky bonds in the market. The combination
   of government interventions eventually stabilizes the financial markets by spring
   2009, although the real economy remains sluggish.




                                         19
between returns on mortgage-backed securities and the cost of funding these positions

with commercial paper and repurchase agreements (Acharya, Schnabl, and Suarez 2010;

Gorton and Metrick 2010). It also seems likely that many market participants, including

the rating agencies themselves, did not understand the risks of mortgage-backed

securities (Jarrow, Li, Mesler, and van Deventer, 2007; Coval, Jurek, and Stafford, 2009;

Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny, forthcoming). Whatever the true reasons for investor

confidence in mortgage-backed securities, the result was that the high-valuation buyers of

mortgage-backed securities (and similar asset-backed securities), such as hedge funds and

financial institutions, financed some of their holdings with collateralized short-term debt.

       As the grim news about the housing market and the safety of AAA-rated

securities started to unfurl in 2007, investors in AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities,

like many others, were caught by surprise. Some of the short-term funding arrangements,

such as asset-backed commercial paper, evaporated.        The Federal Reserve intervened

starting in the summer of 2007 by facilitating mergers of troubled financial institutions

and lending to others against risky collateral.   This series of interventions successfully

delayed a major crisis by over a year.

       In September 2008, however, as bad news about the housing market and the

values of mortgage-backed securities continued to pour in, markets collapsed.           The

immediate impetus for the collapse was some combination of the run on money market

funds investing in the commercial paper of banks, virtual nationalization of the AIG

insurance company as well of government-sponsored housing enterprises Fannie Mae and

Freddie Mac, and most importantly the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers investment bank.

As these events rolled out in quick succession, many forms of short-term financing, such



                                             20
as commercial paper and repurchase agreements, dried up, forcing banks to shrink their

balance sheets.     Banks also had to improve the quality of their assets for regulatory

purposes, forcing them out of previously safe but now risky securities. To accomplish

this, banks sold assets in a market where other banks and financial institutions were

themselves liquidating their holdings, resulting in massive price declines and dislocations

(Adrian and Shin, 2010). We saw a classic cycle of price collapses and deleveraging

described by fire sales models, driven by both capital withdrawals because of declining

collateral values and growing haircuts because of increased risk.

       In fall 2008, the price of risk rose to unprecedented levels, and financial markets

plummeted. But why were the events after September 2008 so much worse than those

before? After all, bad news about housing and AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities

started arriving in the summer of 2007, and dramatic events, such as the drying up of the

asset-backed commercial paper market, started then. In our view, after the Lehman

bankruptcy a much larger proportion of specialist investors were sidelined from bidding

for securities than in 2007 or early 2008. Banks sustained massive losses and could not

easily borrow to buy assets. The contraction of commercial paper and repo markets

eliminated short-term funding that financed the holdings of dealer banks (Adrian and

Shin, 2010; Gorton and Metrick, 2010). Hedge funds as well sustained major losses and,

if anything, were liquidating their holdings because of investor redemptions and

withdrawal of prime broker financing.      Before the Lehman bankruptcy, in contrast,

liquidity provision by the Federal Reserve kept most of the specialist buyers in the

market. With natural buyers of distressed securities sidelined after Lehman, security

prices went into a free fall.



                                            21
       The Federal Reserve began to intervene in markets almost immediately after

Lehman, injecting equity into commercial banks, expanding lending to financial

institutions against risky collateral, guaranteeing the commercial paper markets, and

eventually buying hundreds of billions of dollars of risky securities, mostly bonds of

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.          Essentially, the Federal Reserve became the high-

valuation holder of risky securities. Between accepting risky collateral as a guarantee for

loans on advantageous terms, and removing massive quantities of securities from the

market, the Federal Reserve stabilized banks and the financial system by spring 2009.

The price of risk fell. The economy remained sluggish, but a depression was avoided.

Importantly, the fundamentals of the economy were probably worse in spring 2009 than

earlier; the fact that financial markets stabilized quickly suggests that liquidity problems

caused by fire sales were indeed severe after Lehman, and had to be addressed through

public interventions. The financial crisis appears to have been a liquidity crisis, not just a

solvency crisis.

        The fire-sales mechanism unifies several aspects of the propagation of the crisis.

It explains how hedge funds, dealer banks, and commercial banks suffered huge financial

losses, largely from reductions in the value of their security holdings. It sheds light on

massive violations of arbitrage conditions as hedge funds lost their financing (Mitchell

and Pulvino, 2010; Krishnamurthy, 2010; Garleanu and Pedersen, 2010). And it explains

why investors most reliant on short-term financing were particularly exposed, and pulled

back the most. The common theme in all these phenomena is the sidelining of natural

buyers of distressed securities, contributing to the near-shutdown of key parts of the

financial system.



                                             22
Fire Sales in Macroeconomic Models

       How did fire sales and deterioration of balance sheets of banks lead to a broader

economic crisis? How did government policy stabilize the market? In this section and

next, we argue that the fire-sales perspective can shed light on these questions as well.

       The idea that asset liquidations can have adverse consequences for real activity

has been present in the macroeconomics literature at least since the 1930s. In his debt

deflation theory, Fisher (1933) argues that an adverse shock to the value of corporate

assets forces firms to sell those assets to meet their debt obligation, and that such asset

sales lead to declines in output prices. The resulting deflation raises the real value of debt

denominated in nominal terms and forces further liquidations, leading to a vicious debt

deflation cycle. Although the theory is not entirely transparent, Fisher offers some

impressive data consistent with the story.

       For a more modern analysis, we need to explain why fire sales of financial assets

such as bonds would entail real consequences. Why would pecuniary effects from

mispricing not only transfer wealth from sellers to buyers of securities but also

undermine physical capital investment? The financial crisis saw the decline of bank

lending to firms and of real investment (Ivashina and Scharfstein, 2010; Campello,

Graham, and Harvey; 2010, Kahle and Stulz, 2010). What can explain it?

       Bernanke and Gertler (1989) argued that shocks to corporate net worth reduce the

ability of firms to post collateral and borrow, and as such undermine corporate real

investment. The Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) paper, in addition to modeling price spirals

due to deleveraging and fire sales of land by farms, shows that, as land values decline, so



                                             23
does the net worth of farms and their investment. In the crisis, a sharp decline in asset

values was inevitable as the housing bubble burst, but fire sales have worsened these

declines.

       Most attention in the analysis of the crisis has however focused on the declines in

balance sheets of banks. Such declines would reduce bank-financed investment through

the so-called bank lending channel (Bernanke and Blinder, 1988). As a bank’s net worth

declines, so does its ability to extend credit. Research establishing the importance of the

lending channel is voluminous; Kashyap and Stein’s (2000) is among the most

convincing papers. Stein (2010) explains how the bank lending channel can account for

investment reductions during the crisis.

       There are two additional ideas of how fire sales of securities and the reductions in

the net worth of banks can undermine investment. Price dislocations resulting from fire

sales influence bank decisions about whether to lend to real investment projects, to hold

cash, or to pursue other financial investments. Fire sales may increase the attractiveness

of the alternatives to financing real investment.

       One key alternative is for a bank to hold cash and “keep its powder dry” because

it might need cash in the future. The idea that banks might want to hoard liquidity has

been around for awhile, going back to Keynes’ description of “liquidity preference” as an

alternative to real investment. In the context of asset fire sales, in Shleifer and Vishny

(1997), we discuss “the hold back effect,” whereby financial investors might hoard cash

if the possibility of deepening mispricing and improving arbitrage opportunities seems

likely. Holmstrom and Tirole (1998) describe liquidity hoarding as a precaution firms or

banks use against future liquidity needs.         Caballero and Simsek (2010) present an



                                             24
argument for cash hoarding when banks face uncertainty about the solvency of other

banks they are dealing with. Several recent papers have looked at these issues in fire-

sales models, emphasizing macroeconomic consequences of cash hoarding (Acharya,

Shin, and Yorulmazer, forthcoming; Brunnermeier and Sannikov, 2010; Diamond and

Rajan, 2010).      Consistent with these studies, there is compelling evidence that banks

sharply increased their holdings of cash and deposits with the Federal Reserve in 2009,

presumably at the expense of lending (He, Kang, and Krishanmurthy, 2010).

          In Shleifer and Vishny (2010a), we alternatively argue that real investment must

compete with investment in financial assets when bank capital is scarce. We start with

the observation that fire sales of assets by deleveraging financial institutions, such as

banks, drive the prices of those assets below fundamental values. If price dislocation is

extreme enough, banks will choose to invest in underpriced assets rather than lend money

to firms, and real investment will suffer. The evidence presented by He, Kang, and

Krishnamurthy (2010) and Ivashina and Scharfstein (2010) is consistent with the

prediction that banks have used spare balance sheet capacity, including capital injections

from the government, to buy securities rather than to lend in the wake of the financial

crisis.

          The mechanisms we have described focus on the social costs of fire sales after

they have occurred.      But presumably if market participants consider the possibility of

fire sales before they arise, the conditions of borrowing and lending should reflect the

risks of fire sales. In this situation, there might be no social losses from pecuniary

externalities, and no over-borrowing relative to the social optimum. Several studies have

however argued that this is not so. Lorenzoni (2008) shows that when firms ignore the



                                             25
effect of fire sales on other firms, the level of borrowing need not be socially efficient.

Stein (2010) begins with the crucial observation that, prior to the crisis, many of the

securitized mortgages were essentially transformed by financial intermediaries into

shorter-term securities, such as commercial paper, that were subsequently sold to

investors. In his model, this demand from money market funds for safe short-term assets

drove the securitization process and made it profitable. Stein then shows that, because

the consequences of fire sales of securities are not fully internalized by banks, the

creation of short-term assets was excessive from the social point of view.

       An alternative approach to explaining why leverage is socially excessive is to

drop the assumption of rational expectations. In Shleifer and Vishny (2010a), we focus

on investor optimism in the securitized loan market as a precursor of a crisis. As banks

make and securitize loans to cater to investor demand, the incentives of even fully

rational banks lead to overexpansion of lending and excessive leverage in good times, but

then fire sales and credit crunches in bad times.        Such credit crunches create real

efficiency losses when good investment projects are not financed.

       In Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (forthcoming), we also dispense with rational

expectations, but argue alternatively that during the period of growing home prices and

securitization, market participants neglected the risk that home prices could collapse,

leading to defaults even on AAA-rated securities.      We show that this neglect of small

risks could have led to the massive assumption of such risks by risk-averse investors,

who then fled to safety when they became aware of the risks they were bearing.

       The punch line of this analysis is that the sidelining of natural buyers in fire sales

can lead to declines in asset prices and the net worth of financial institutions, which in



                                            26
turn trigger cuts in lending. Fear of future fire sales likewise encourages financial

institutions to hoard cash rather than finance investment. The fire-sales mechanism thus

entails real, and not just financial, consequences.



Policy Implications

        Economic theory suggests the possibility of efficiency losses from fire sales.

Before the event, banks might expand their balance sheets excessively if they or investors

make mistakes or if they fail to take into account the social cost of fire sales. After the

event, fire sales undermine the ability of financial institutions and firms to lend and to

borrow by reducing their net worth. The presence of externalities provides a justification

for policy interventions.

        Some policies aim to reduce the chances of a fire-sale scenario arising. Examples

of such policies include increases in the capital cushions of financial firms and

improvements in the plumbing of the financial system (French et al., 2010; Hanson,

Kashyap, and Stein, in this issue).   Likewise, policies such as mandating higher haircuts

and margins in derivative markets aim to stop the cycle of deleveraging and fire sales

before it starts.

        Here, we focus on policies that seek to contain and limit the effects of fire sales

that are already underway. When the government reacts to a fire sale in progress, what

should it be seeking to accomplish, and what type of intervention is most likely to be

beneficial? During fire sales, many key financial institutions such as banks are sidelined

due to their inability to access capital. In this setting, two distinct ways to increase bank

lending and real investment have been proposed: 1) the government can lend to banks



                                             27
against risky collateral; 2) the government can purchase assets directly or provide

subsidies targeted at the purchasers of certain assets.

       The relative merits of these two types of interventions have been addressed, albeit

briefly, in the recent literature. Diamond and Rajan (2010) support liquidity injections

into the banking system over government asset purchases on the grounds that the

government is not able to judge whether asset prices are truly dislocated. Conversely,

they argue that misguided government purchases could distort asset prices in other

directions and even result in losses. On the other side, in Shleifer and Vishny (2010b), we

argue that liquidity injections into the banking system may not increase asset prices or

lead to new lending to firms. Instead, banks may engage in precautionary hoarding of

liquidity or may purchase assets but still leave their prices well below the level at which

new lending becomes attractive. A further problem with providing loans or equity to

banks is that the government may end up supporting institutions that ultimately fail and

perhaps encourage some of the desperate intermediaries to gamble with government

funds by taking on more risk. Security purchases can address asset price dislocations

directly, without providing extra subsidies to weak or irresponsible banks.        To avoid

overpaying for assets, government purchases could target potentially less-toxic asset

classes, with greater prospects of reviving new lending in the short run and a lower

chance of government losses.

       The idea of the government buying financial assets may seem suspicious to a

number of economists. After all, most economists would not think of the government

buying airplanes, even during a fire sale. But buying financial assets during a fire-sale

crisis is very different from buying airplanes.           First, financial markets have more



                                             28
systemic implications for the rest of the economy than markets for used airplanes.

Restoring the balance sheets of banks would unlock the lending channel in a way that

restoring the balance sheets of airlines would not. Second, the government would be a

terrible owner of airplanes, unable to negotiate leases nearly as efficiently as the private

sector. In contrast, the Federal Reserve might be a reasonably efficient owner of certain

fixed-income securities, especially if it can mostly avoid buying “lemons” by purchasing

the relatively safe ones.

       How does the Federal Reserve know that some securities are cheap, rather than

reflecting a high risk of insolvency of underlying issuers? Of course, it can never know

for sure, but in the aftermath of the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008, there were

many striking indications that illiquidity was a problem.          For example, 10-year

government agency bonds that the Fed ended up buying were yielding up to 170 basis

points more than similar duration Treasury bonds. This compares to a normal spread on

agency paper of 10 to 30 basis points. In many other markets, wide credit spreads for the

highest quality borrowers pointed to illiquidity rather than fundamental problems. Even

setting credit spreads aside, the Federal Reserve witnessed the near implosions of

commercial paper and repo markets, effectively sidelining natural buyers who relied on

these markets to finance purchases of risky debt.     This too seems to point to fire sales

and illiquidity rather than pure solvency problems.

       U.S. government policies in response to the financial crisis and to fire sales in

particular took various forms. The government bailed out some financial institutions, but

also lent money against risky collateral and bought some assets.      Prior to the Lehman

bankruptcy in September 2008, liquidity provision to financial institutions was the



                                            29
dominant strategy; in 2009, purchases of agency debt became important. We do not

know which one of these strategies was ultimately effective in arresting the crisis in

spring 2009, although it does appear that pure liquidity injections and rescues of

institutions in 2008 were insufficient to stop the slide.     Federal Reserve Chairman

Bernanke (2009) described the Fed policy of credit easing in winter 2009, and his

justifications seem to largely correspond to the analysis of fire sales presented here. In

Shleifer and Vishny (2010b), we describe the virtuous circle and the multipliers that arise

from government security purchases as market liquidity improves.

       What emerges most clearly from the fire-sales models is the complementarity

between tough preventive policies to reduce the risk of fire sales and soft policies when a

fire sale and financial crisis is underway. The basic prescription of these models is for

the government to intervene in markets to stop fire sales quickly, because failure to do so

can severely harm the financial system and the economy as a whole. Although the choice

is a controversial one, we think there is a case for the government supporting purchases

of dislocated securities by market participants, or even buying them directly, rather than

supporting weak or poorly run financial institutions. But this type of softness in the face

of an actual crisis works best when combined with safeguards that minimize the chance

that the banking system becomes engulfed in fire sales.
