                                             ABSTRACT

The choice to breastfeed rather than formula-feed an infant as well as the duration of doing so has
been scrutinized in more recent times. Yet, key identification issues remain to be resolved, including
the array of possible child development benefits, the optimal intensity of breastfeeding versus formula-
feeding, and the possibility of confounding with other inputs that promote child health. This study
uses the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey – Birth Cohort to explore the causal effect of breastfeeding
on development across the early years of childhood. We examine a range of health, physical, and
cognitive outcomes and relate these to a set of breastfeeding and formula-feeding intensities. Adjusting
for a very extensive set of potential confounding factors that also promote child development, our
empirical method uses simultaneous equations models and propensity score measures to understand
the link between breastfeeding and child outcomes. Our results indicate that breastfeeding and not
formula-feeding at birth are associated with increased probabilities of being in excellent health at 9
months. Furthermore, they are protective against obesity and improve cognitive outcomes at 24 months
and 54 months. Breastfeeding for 6 months or more increases motor scores at 9 months.

1. INTRODUCTION

         Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a child’s life has been promoted by the

World Health Organization, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the U.S. Department of Health

and Human Services, and Healthy People 2010. The choice to breastfeed rather than formula-

feed an infant as well as the duration of doing so has been scrutinized, with more recent studies

showing limited benefits regarding the returns to breastfeeding when cognitive performance is

the outcome being analyzed (Ip et al. 2007). Yet Healthy People 2010 had as its goal a

prevalence of 75% for breastfeeding and 50% for breastfeeding at six months (USDHHS, 2000).1

         Nevertheless, empirically identifying the influence of breastfeeding on child development

is challenging for several reasons. Breastfeeding may be the natural preference since it contains

all the nutrients a child needs and is designed for human infants. As the primary or single source

of sustenance in the first months of life, we might anticipate an array of immediate and or longer-

term developmental benefits for the child. Yet understanding the potential mechanism through

which breastfeeding affects children’s outcomes is important. Is it solely due to the nutrients

contained in milk and the lack of preservatives?2 Is it due to the increased bonding a mother

experiences with her child? Or is it due to potential problems with formula?3 If the quality of

  While breastfeeding initiation is now at 75%, the prevalence of breastfeeding at six months is 43% and that of
exclusive breastfeeding at six months is 13.3%. See the CDC’s Breastfeeding Report Card at

  According to Campbell (1996): “Human milk is rich in secretory IgA, produced partly in response to specific
intestinal and respiratory pathogens encountered by the mother. It also contains other immunoglobulins, lysozyme,
lactoferrin, bifidus factor, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophil granulocytes, cytokines and complement.” A
recent study also found that a part of human milk cannot be digested but serves to protect the infant’s small intestine
(Zivkovic et al., 2010).

  Formula is closely monitored, with a bill specifically focusing on infant food, the Infant Formula Act of 1980
(amended in 1986), which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to ensure the safety and nutrition of
infant formulas (Woolley and Peters 1980). This bill was passed by President Carter in response to reports in 1979
of soybean-based formulas with an insufficient amount of chloride, resulting in over 100 infants becoming seriously
ill (Woolley and Peters 1980). More recently, a fatal case of meningitis in Tennessee was linked to contaminated
powdered infant formula (Baker 2002). The Infant Formula Act apparently does not have rigid sterility
requirements, although it says that “good manufacturing practice” should be followed (Baker 2002).

                                                           3
the formula is at issue, joint policies to both encourage breastfeeding and tighten regulations on

infant formula may be proposed to improve child health outcomes. Moreover, breastfeeding is

not a monolithic activity of given duration and intensity, and is often undertaken in conjunction

with some formula-feeding. Finally, a potential identification issue that arises in this type of

study is that of statistical endogeneity. Unobservable family inputs to child health (such as the

mother’s education) or circumstances related to the birth of the child (such as prematurity) may

be associated with breastfeeding. Such endogeneity may show an effect of breastfeeding on

child outcomes in linear probability models when there is no causal effect.

       This study attempts to address these issues using the Early Childhood Longitudinal

Survey – Birth Cohort. We use several measures of breastfeeding in our analysis: (1) breastfed

ever, (2) duration of breastfeeding, (3) breastfed in the week prior to survey, and (4) formula-fed

at birth. Specifically, our comprehensive analysis examines a range of developmental outcomes

measured at multiple points in time, including health, physical, and cognitive outcomes. With

detailed information on the birth circumstance, the family characteristics, and the early

development of the child, we are able to take potential confounding factors into account. Our

empirical method is based on covariate models, propensity score measures, and instrumental

variables models using internally generated instruments to understand the link between

breastfeeding and child outcomes. We also exploit the large subsample of twins available in our

data to estimate twin fixed effects models.

       We believe these estimates are an advance over prior results. Few prior studies

simultaneously use longitudinal data where outcomes at multiple points in time are analyzed to

gauge duration of effect; explore a range of outcomes relating to health, physical, and cognitive

outcomes; and address causality using several econometric methods. In addition, to our



                                                 4
knowledge, this study is the first to assess outcomes pertaining to maternal attachment, motor

scores, and physical activity. Our results indicate that breastfeeding and not formula-feeding at

birth are associated with increased probabilities of being in excellent health at 9 months.

Furthermore, breastfeeding is protective against obesity and improves cognitive outcomes at 24

months and 54 months, but has little effect on respiratory outcomes after 9 months.

Breastfeeding for 6 months or more increases motor scores at 9 months. Broadly, these results

are not sensitive to model specifications.

2. BACKGROUND LITERATURE

       This section focuses on the determinants of breastfeeding and the effect of breastfeeding

on child outcomes in developed countries. Our theorized relationships are shown in Figure 1.

2.1 Determinants of Breastfeeding

       There are many independent determinants of the decision to breastfeed and, as such, it is

necessary to control for many different factors. While difficulty with technique and concern

over sufficient food for the child have also been reported as obstacles to breastfeeding, not being

able to take time off work is the main reported reason not to breastfeed (Baker and Milligan

2008; Kools et al. 2006; Fein and Roe 1998), causing the marginal cost of breastfeeding to be

high if generous maternity leave laws are not in place. Baker and Milligan (2008) use variation

in maternity leave mandates across provinces in Canada to show that mother’s time away from

work is a predictor of breastfeeding duration. Prior to 2000, mothers were allowed a maximum

of six months of compensated maternity leave. For those children born after December 21, 2000,

compensated maternity leave was extended to one year, generating an exogenous variation

across mothers with infants born before and after the policy change.




                                                 5
       A higher wage rate implies a higher opportunity cost of time associated with

breastfeeding. In light of the higher opportunity cost of breastfeeding for those women with

higher incomes, in addition to some evidence that minorities are more likely to breastfeed due to

cultural differences (Chapman and Pérez-Escamilla 2009), one might be led to believe that

effects of breastfeeding on subsequent cognitive and health outcomes for the child may be

downward biased. Interestingly, breastfeeding has been found to be more prevalent among

lower SES groups in certain populations (Gibson-Davis and Brooks-Gunn 2006; Victora et al.

2000) and among foreign-born mothers (Gibson-Davis and Brooks-Gunn 2006), even though

breastfeeding is more likely among the college educated (Ryan et al. 2002), older mothers, and

those not participating in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program (Gibson-Davis and

Brooks-Gunn 2006). Very low birth weight (Smith et al. 2003), private insurance (Smith et al.

2003), and delivery via Caesarean section (Pérez-Escamilla et al. 1996) are associated with lower

probabilities of breastfeeding. Not being encouraged by a clinician to breastfeed and being

depressed are associated with a mother’s lower likelihood of breastfeeding (Taveras et al. 2003).

Regional differences are observed, with the prevalence of breastfeeding highest in the West and

lowest in the South (Ryan et al. 2002). As pointed out in the American Medical Association’s

Family Medical Guide, “[s]ome people prefer the convenience of bottle-feeding because other

people can help out with feedings. It also gives the father and older siblings and opportunity to

participate in feedings and form their own attachment to the baby” (AMA 2004, p.540).

2.2 Determinants of Child Outcomes

       A comprehensive review of scholarly articles on the possible benefits of breastfeeding in

developed countries was conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2007

(Ip et al. 2007). We draw heavily on this report, which screened over 9000 abstracts and



                                                 6
included 400 studies in their final review. The report concluded that breastfeeding was

associated with a reduction in the risk of ear infections, gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract

infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma, obesity, diabetes, childhood leukemia, sudden infant death

syndrome (SIDS), and necrotizing enterocolitis.4 However, little effect was found for cognitive

ability as measured by the Peabody individual achievement test (PIAT) administered to 5- to 14-

year olds (Der et al. 2006). Moreover, the summary did not provide a comprehensive inventory

of possible impacts. Outcomes related to maternal attachment, motor scores, and physical

activity were not mentioned in the report, which cautioned that the majority of the articles were

based on observational studies, and “one should not infer causality based on these findings.”

         A summary of the literature on the effects of breastfeeding provided by the American

Academy of Pediatrics (1997) reaches similar conclusions. In addition to the aforementioned

Baker and Milligan (2008), which primarily focused on determinants of breastfeeding, studies

that attempt to address causality from breastfeeding to health outcomes include Kramer et al.

(2001), who find effects on gastrointestinal infection and dermatitis using randomly assigned

maternity support in Belarus, and Der et al. (2006), who use the 1979 cohort of the National

Longitudinal Survey of Youth to analyze sibling pairs and whose study will be discussed in more

detail in the next paragraph. Baker and Milligan (2008), relying heavily on variation over time,

find little effect of breastfeeding on child health, as measured by health status, nose and ear

infections, asthma, allergies, chronic conditions, and injuries. They control for gender, age,

province, city size, parents’ age and education, immigration status, presence of siblings, and

unemployment (to capture labor market changes over time) in their regressions. Mild effects that

disappear at older ages are found among 7- to 12-month olds for asthma, allergies, and chronic

4
 A review conducted by the World Health Organization around the same time gave similar results (Horta et al.
2007). This review assessed the effects of breastfeeding on blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, obesity, and
cognitive outcomes, generally concluding that beneficial effects of breastfeeding could be seen for all outcomes.

                                                          7
conditions. They do note, however, that their main contribution is showing how a mother’s

increased time at home, through the Canadian maternity leave mandates, affected breastfeeding.

Their primary focus is not on the effects of breastfeeding on outcomes. Moreover, their health

outcomes analysis is of the mandates and not breastfeeding per se. Research using historical data

from Germany (Haines and Kintner 2008) finds that breastfeeding has substantial positive effects

on adult stature.

       Of these studies, we focus on two that use data from the United States – namely, those of

Der et al. (2006) and Rees and Sabia (2009). Using the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth, Der et al. (2006) analyze sibling pairs and conclude that family background

explains much of the observed correlation between breastfeeding and cognitive outcomes. They

use the total PIAT scores, even though the test was administered biennially to respondents

between the ages of 5 and 14. It is unsurprising that no effect in general is found using their

methods. Their analysis relies on sibling pairs and controlling for maternal intelligence, which

has the potential to soak up most variation that can be found, particularly due to the potential

endogeneity of mother’s IQ itself. The authors also exclude low birth weight and premature

babies. That being said, the authors do find significant effects of the duration of breastfeeding on

cognitive outcomes, yet dismiss the effects as being too small. However, combined with the

benefits of breastfeeding on physical and health outcomes, the overall effects may not be

insubstantial.

       Rees and Sabia (2009) use a similar method (sibling fixed effects) and find a positive and

significant effect of breastfeeding on educational attainment, as measured by high school GPA

and college attendance. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health

and controlling for measures of cognitive ability and maternal attachment, they also conduct



                                                 8
falsification tests, using outcomes relating to drunkenness, smoking, television watching, and

having been in a physical fight. They acknowledge that while comparing siblings accounts for

family-level unobservable factors, it reduces sample size and identifying variation, may not be

generalizable to all children, and, perhaps most importantly, does not account for “unmeasured

within-family heterogeneity resulting from the fact that the decision to breast-feed is not

random” (Rees and Sabia 2009).

         Our analysis builds on these studies in that we are able to use more recent data, younger

children, multiple time points, and various methods to address potential confounding factors.

We estimate the relationship between formula-feeding and child outcomes, largely missing in

most studies carefully accounting for causality.5 We analyze a rich set of outcomes at 9, 24 and

54 months, so we are not concerned with disentangling factors that may affect the child at later

stages in life.

3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

         We apply an economic framework to modeling both the determinants of breastfeeding

and its outcomes. While there has been some opposition by economists to the use of utility

functions to discuss the economics of the family (such as Samuelson 1976), this may serve as a

useful tool originally posed by Becker (1965, 1981) and modified by Pollak (1988), with

assumptions that may be relaxed.6 However, the economic approach that an individual




5
  Although some studies in the health literature analyzing asthma, gastrointestinal infection, lower respiratory tract
disease, and cognitive outcomes use exclusive breastfeeding in their models (Ip et al. 2007), these studies largely
suffer from methodological issues such as not adjusting for confounding factors, as found, for example, in a meta-
analysis of studies analyzing the effects of breastfeeding on asthma (Gdalevich 2001). Der et al. (2006) and Rees
and Sabia (2009) do not analyze exclusive breastfeeding. Baker and Milligan (2008) only analyze exclusive
breastfeeding as an outcome.
6
  For example, Pollak has “long been a critic of the Stigler-Becker view that preferences are fixed and exogenous”
(Pollak 2003). Habit formation and interdependent preferences that change over time are fundamental to his
models.

                                                           9
maximizes utility subject to constraints and thus reaches an equilibrium is taken here (Pollak

2003).

         Investment in a child’s health is presented in the context of a household production

function with one parent for simplicity (the mother in the context of breastfeeding),7 whose

child’s health (commodity ZH) enters into the parent’s utility function in a paternalistic fashion.8

A child’s health may thus enter directly into parent’s utility function but may also increase a

future income stream, leading it to be both a consumption and investment good (Grossman

1972).

                                                    ,    ,                  (1)

where ZH is a child’s health, ZV is a vector of other commodities entering the parent’s utility

function, and UC represents the child’s utility function. If a child’s health is largely a function of

breastfeeding, as many studies show, but does not enter directly into the child’s utility function,

we can rewrite equation (1) as:

                                                   , ,       ,              (2)

where B is the length of time breastfeeding and F is the length of time formula-feeding. The

above utility function is simplified in that breastfeeding and formula-feeding are not functions of

one another, whereas in reality they may be substitutes or complements. If breastfeeding

promotes the mother’s health, then the assumption of paternalistic preferences is not required, as

breastfeeding will enter into the parent’s utility function directly through its effects on a parent’s




7
  If another parent is present, that parent may work, thus freeing up time for the mother to breastfeed, and
additionally contributing to the child’s cognitive and physical development.
8
  This allows for the parent’s utility function to not only depend on the child’s utility function but also the child’s
consumption. This implies that, for example, a parent may prefer that a child do her homework rather than watching
television. If preferences were purely altruistic, the child’s consumption would only appear in her utility function
and not directly in the parent’s, and television watching may be preferred to doing homework.

                                                             10
health; moreover, it may enter into it directly through the pleasure associated with bonding with

the child.

           Breastfeeding is mainly a time-intensive activity, with few direct monetary costs.

Formula-feeding, on the other hand, may be less time-intensive if another individual formula-

feeds the baby, although it carries with it monetary costs. If breastfeeding is only a function of

the time it takes to breastfeed an infant (tB), and we assume that all income is earned income, the

full income constraint is:9

                                                                                           (3)

                                                                                           (4)

where w is the mother’s wage rate (assumed to be constant), tW represents time spent at work,

is time spent formula-feeding,             represents inputs into formula-feeding,               is the price of the

inputs into formula-feeding,             represents inputs into the consumption of other commodities,

is a vector of prices of inputs          , and tZv represents time spent in producing or enjoying other

commodities ZV. Maximizing utility subject to the full income constraint, we obtain the simple

first order condition, which equates the marginal benefit of breastfeeding with its marginal cost,

equal to the time cost associated with breastfeeding                       multiplied by the marginal utility of

full income (λ):

                                                                                  (5)

The RHS represents the opportunity cost of breastfeeding; the higher the wage rate, the greater

the opportunity cost. Also, the more time-intensive breastfeeding is, the higher its cost.

           A similar first-order condition for formula-feeding is:

                                                                                  (6)

9
    Breastfeeding is likely to be a function of many factors, which we explore in the empirical section.

                                                            11
Here the RHS suggests that the higher the monetary cost of formula-feeding, the higher the

marginal cost. Formula-feeding is likely less time-intensive than breastfeeding for the mother,

and so      <    . However, if the marginal benefit of breastfeeding is higher than the marginal

benefit of formula-feeding, which we empirically test in this paper, then        <    . We

hypothesize that this is the case for most individuals, and therefore the marginal utility subject to

the full price of breastfeeding is substantially greater than the marginal utility subject to the full

price of formula-feeding.

4. DATA

         Our analysis relies on the Birth Cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey

(ECLS-B). The ECLS-B follows a sample of 14,000 children born in 2001 through until

kindergarten. Nationally representative, the study also oversamples for twins, low birth weight

children, and racial minority subgroups. Data were collected at four points of the children’s

early lives, although we restrict our analysis to the first three waves, when the children are 9

months old, 24 months, and 4 years old (preschool age). A series of survey instruments were

applied at each wave, along with direct tests and observations of the children. At each wave, the

primary care parent (almost all biological mothers) was surveyed with information collected on

both the mother and the child. From these respondents we obtain data on the characteristics of

the mother and the child at each point in time. The 9-month wave is especially useful: it includes

information on the mother's prenatal experiences, as we several questions related to

breastfeeding practices and the circumstances of the birth of the child. The surveys to the

primary care parent included questions on the health status of the children; these parent-reported

measures are used as indicators of children’s health development. As well, independent

cognitive and motor tests were administered to the children at each wave; and body mass index

                                                  12
(BMI) measures for the child were also collected at the 24 month and preschool waves. At 9-

months and 24-months general mental ability was measured using a modified Bayley Short Form

to estimate BSID-II scores; for the pre-school wave a range of instruments were used to measure

language, literacy, and math skills. Gross and fine motor skills were also measured using the

Bayley Short Form. Collectively, this data is used to capture cognitive and physical

development. Finally, the ECLS-B includes information from birth certificate records; these

records yield further information on complications associated with birth and some maternal data.

        The ECLS-B data is high quality and well-suited to the purposes of our analysis. There is

detailed information on each family over time; this information includes self-report and

independent evidence on the child across multiple time periods. This allows us to investigate an

array of possible developmental outcomes for the child. For breastfeeding, there is a series of

questions, allowing us to check the validity of parental responses.10 The survey response rates

are high.11 For the 9-month wave, there are 10,500 usable responses, although this falls to

approximately 8,900 by the pre-school wave. These correspond to response rates of 76% and

64%, respectively, from the initial total sample. To ensure our analytical results are nationally

representative, we apply survey weights. Finally, there is an oversample of twins, with

information collected on each twin; this allows us to compare across twins.

        Tables 1a and 1b provide ECLS-B summary statistics for our sample (unweighted). The

incidence of ever breastfeeding is 67% (Table 1a), which is comparable to reported estimates of

73% from the 2005 National Immunization Survey of U.S. (Ip et al., 2007) and 72% from Li et

al. (2005). Our estimate of breastfeeding for at least six months is 12%, which is also close to


10
   To the biological mother, the questions are: “Did you ever breastfeed child?”; “For how many months did you
breast-feed him/her?”; “During the past seven days, was child breast-fed, formula-fed, or fed regular cow’s milk?”;
“How old was child in months when you began feeding him/her formula?”
11
   The ECLS-B are restricted-use data and all analyses must be reported to the nearest 50.

                                                         13
the 13.3% estimate of (exclusive) breastfeeding at six months reported by Li et al. (2005).

Slightly different estimates are expected; as Chapman and Pérez-Escamilla (2009) note, the

wording of the questions tends to be inconsistent across surveys.12 For example, Baker and

Milligan (2008) find pre-reform (1994-2000) breastfeeding estimates in Canada of 86% but the

question included attempts to breastfeed (“Did you breastfeed or try to breastfeed your baby,

even if only for a short time?”). Table 1a also shows the prevalence of breastfeeding within last

week, with the sample restricted to mothers whose child were 8 or 9 months old at the time of

survey; the rate for this group is 19%.13 Our fourth indicator is of whether the child was

formula-fed at birth: this rate is 44%, which indicates considerable overlap between breast and

formula-feeding. In fact, one quarter of those who breastfed also formula-fed from birth. This

percentage (44%) is comparable to the prevalence of formula-fed infants (including infants also

breastfed) in the United States of approximately 50% in 2001 found by Ziegler et al. (2008).

Hence, we utilize all these indicators of breastfeeding in our analysis below.

5. METHODS

5.1 Breastfeeding as an Outcome

        Prior to examining the effects of breastfeeding on child outcomes, we explore the

determinants of breastfeeding (as classified in four ways). We use data from the 9-month wave

of the ECLS, with contemporaneous indicators for maternal (M) characteristics and child (C)

characteristics, as well as variables measuring the circumstances of the birth. Specifically, we

include dummy variables for whether primary care was by mother, center, relative, or non-

relative; region; race/ethnicity; gender of child; health insurance status (at 9 months); obese


12
   For example, the question in the ECLS-B is “Did you ever breastfeed (child)?” The question in the National
Immunization Survey, which Li et al. (2005) use, is: “Was (child) ever breastfed or fed breast milk?”
13
   This discrepancy with the frequency for 6+ months reinforces the need for validity checks on the phrasing of
survey questions.

                                                         14
mother; religiosity; mother’s employment status14; mother’s education; whether child has a twin;

number of siblings; father non-resident; mother’s age at birth; and mother’s marital status.

Related to the circumstances of the birth, we include variables for: low and very low birth

weight; if the baby was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU); if the mother smoked while

pregnant; if the mother consumed alcohol while pregnant; if the mother wanted the child; if

mother was not told that breastfeeding was important; if mother had maternity leave; if mother

participated in WIC; and county establishments for health/social assistance.

         In addition, we investigated a series of local context variables that may influence

breastfeeding rates but may be exogenous to the family’s utility function or child’s birth

circumstances, results of which are shown in Appendix Table 1. These variables were measured

as availability per 1,000 persons of services related to religious organizations; individual family

assistance; physicians; hospitals; and child day care.15 We also investigated the relationship

between breastfeeding and the price of baby food (used as a proxy for the price of formula) and

the local unemployment rate (both measured at the county level),16 and between breastfeeding

and the percent of females in the county who are: employed; with a college degree; married;

obese; with health insurance; and in excellent or very good health.17

5.2 Child Development Outcomes

         Using the standard controls on the RHS, we analyzed the following health, physical, and

cognitive outcomes at 9 months: Respiratory problems; gastroenteritis; asthma; excellent health;

maternal attachment; motor scores; and cognitive scores. The following outcomes were

   Including prenatal care, which did not have much variation as almost all mothers in our sample sought it, did not
alter the results.
17
   These data come from the 2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. See http://www.cdc.gov/brfss.

                                                         15
analyzed at 24 months: Respiratory problems; gastroenteritis; asthma; excellent health; maternal

attachment; motor scores; underweight; overweight; obese; and cognitive scores. The following

outcomes were analyzed at 54 months: Respiratory problems; gastroenteritis; asthma; excellent

health; motor and copy form skills scores (based on block tower building); high physical activity;

underweight; overweight; obese; reading score; math score; and literature score. These outcome

measures come from various sources: the health conditions measures are self-report by the parent

of diagnosed incidences; the maternal attachment and some of the cognitive and motor measures

are based on independent observers’ reports within the home; the later cognitive scores are based

on tests administered to the children; and the underweight, overweight and obesity indicators are

calculated based on measured BMI.

       We use basic ordinary least squares and probit specifications, with controls for

covariates, as a base case for the results. However, a potential concern with analyzing the effect

of breastfeeding on child outcomes using linear probability models is that unobserved

characteristics common to both breastfeeding and child outcomes are not controlled for and, as

discussed in Section 2 above, these characteristics are many. We attempt to identify the potential

causal effect of breastfeeding on outcomes using a variety of techniques.

5.3 Robustness Checks for Development Outcomes

5.3.1 Instrumental Variables

       Excluded instruments in our instrumental variables models pertain to Caesarian birth,

mother’s behavior regarding smoking and alcohol consumption prior to the child’s birth, whether

the mother wanted to become pregnant, maternity leave, and county-level establishments related

to health care and social assistance. In order to be valid, these instruments must jointly predict

breastfeeding in addition to passing the appropriate overidentification tests for exclusion



                                                 16
restrictions. However, there may still be concern that these variables cannot theoretically be

excluded from the child health equation, in that they may be correlated with the error term in the

second stage. We therefore perform several robustness checks and find our external instruments

to be invalid as they are not legitimately excludable from the main equations of interest. Results

from these models are therefore not reported.

5.3.2 Lewbel Estimation

       Lewbel (2007) presents an IV technique that is useful when valid external instruments are

weak or not available. This procedure relies on the presence of heteroscedasticity in the error

term of the first-stage equation, which is tested using a Breusch-Pagan (1979) test. The Lewbel

IV procedure uses                 as the identifying instruments, where X is a vector of

independent variables that may include all independent variables or a subset of them, and        is

the predicted residual from the first-stage (breastfeeding) regression. Both Sabia (2007) and

Kelly and Markowitz (2009) successfully use this procedure and find the Lewbel IV results to be

more plausible than the IV results that rely on external instruments of questionable validity.

5.3.3 Twins Estimation

       In this context, it has been suggested that “[s]ibling analysis provides a method to control

for hereditary and household factors that are important in certain outcomes” (Ip et al. 2007).

This method is useful is that unobserved heterogeneity arising from genetic factors and family

background are largely controlled for. While this has the potential to underestimate the effect

that breastfeeding has on outcomes since all characteristics common to both siblings are

completely accounted for, it may be illuminating. This regression is estimated by analyzing a

fixed effects model where twin identification is controlled for. This model has the disadvantage

of washing away any variables that are similar to both twins. Moreover, if a mother makes a



                                                17
decision about breastfeeding, she is likely to apply that decision to both babies, and thus

identifying variation is limited.

5.3.4 Propensity Score Analysis

           Propensity score matching may be used to determine the average effect of the treatment

(breastfeeding) on the treated (a dichotomous health outcome variable such as obese status).

This can be estimated as:18

                                                                 |         1

                                                         |           1,

                                  |     1,                   |            0,   |    1   (5)

where the propensity score (p(W)) is defined as the probability of being obese given pre-

treatment characteristics (W). We assume that the effect of unobservable characteristics on the

propensity score is the same as that of observable characteristics.

5.3.5 Stratified Samples

           Low birth weight infants are likely systematically different from other infants; as seen in

Table 2, for example, they are both less likely to be breastfed as well as less likely to be formula-

fed at birth, possibly due to their presence in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Additional

unobserved attributes may render them different, and thus we stratify the sample by birth weight

status to ensure that low birth weight babies are not driving the results one way or another.

           Moreover, in order to observe for which groups the benefits of breastfeeding, if any, may

be realized, we stratify the sample by poverty status, mother’s employment status, and marital

status. These results are reported in Appendix Tables 2 and 3.

6. RESULTS

6.1 Determinants of Breastfeeding
18
     See Becker and Ichino (2002) and Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) for more detail.

                                                        18
       We present results for the determinants of breastfeeding in Table 2. The first three

columns focus on breastfeeding outcomes, with ever breastfed, breastfeeding duration, and

breastfed in the week prior to survey (restricted to 8-9 month olds) as dependent variables of

interest. The last column focuses on an alternative specification where formula-fed at birth is the

outcome of interest. This last specification captures the factors discouraging mothers from

breastfeeding exclusively and includes mothers who exclusively formula-feed their infants, and

should generally yield coefficients carrying signs opposite to the specifications shown in

columns 1-3.

       Some notable results emerge in Table 2. While strongest for “breastfed in last week,” the

results show a significant, negative effect of care other than parental care on breastfeeding

practices. This is interesting in light of a study using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study,

Kindergarten cohort (ECLS-K) suggesting that non-parental child care can adversely influence a

child’s weight outcomes (Herbst and Tekin, forthcoming), in addition to cognitive and

behavioral problems (Herbst and Tekin 2010). In terms of region, those in the West are most

likely to breastfeed and less likely to formula-feed at birth. Low birth weight babies (<2500

grams) are less likely to be breastfed but more likely to be formula-fed at birth, while very low

birth weight babies (<1500 grams) are also less likely to be formula-fed at birth. This may be

due to their initial care in the NICU, either because of alternative feeding practices or more

restricted access to the child for the mother. Babies with obese mothers, working mothers, or

mothers who smoked during pregnancy are less likely to be breastfed and more likely to be

formula-fed at birth. Perhaps due to the widespread availability of literature on the benefits of

breastfeeding, and because educated individuals are more aware of health-related information

(Hammond 2003), education has a consistent strong and significant effect on breastfeeding, with



                                                 19
those with more education more likely to breastfeed and less likely to formula-feed at birth. A

mother who has continued with studies obtaining her college degree is 23.2 percentage points

more likely to ever breastfeed and 25.6 percentage points less likely to formula-feed at birth than

her counterparts with less than a high school degree. There is some evidence that twins are less

likely to be breastfed and more likely to be formula-fed at birth, which is consistent with babies

in general that may be born prematurely.19 The negative effect of WIC on breastfeeding (and

positive effect on formula-feeding) is in line with WIC’s indirect promotion of formula-feeding

through the dissemination of free formula (Kent 2006).

        Results from alternative specifications for the determinants of breastfeeding are shown in

Appendix Table 1, where the first column is the same as the first column of Table 2. In Column

2 we utilize information from the Birth Certificate record on type of delivery (vaginal versus

Caesarean), risk factor at birth, and whether the baby was in the NICU. Of these, vaginal birth

emerges are being a strong predictor of breastfeeding, which prior research has found (Pérez-

Escamilla et al. 1996). Columns 3 and 4 explore the sensitivity of the coefficients to the

inclusion or exclusion of variables on maternal behavior, with few notable differences. In

Column 5, information from County Business Patterns on establishments for religious

organizations; individual family assistance; physicians; hospitals; and child day care, with

religious organizations emerging as a significant negative predictor of breastfeeding. While this

may seem surprising, this variable on the county level may be correlated with socioeconomic

status and geographic characteristics that negatively affect the probability of breastfeeding.

(Note that we already control for individual religiosity.) The last column adds county-level

information from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a nationally representative


19
  Twins are substantially more likely to be born prematurely, with an estimate of 54% of all twins being born
prematurely, according to Gardner et al. (1995).

                                                        20
health survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The percent of

females in the county with a college degree and the percent of females in the county in excellent

or very good health positively affect the probability of breastfeeding, significant at the 5% level.

6.2 Child Development Outcomes from Breastfeeding

        Table 3 presents results for the effect of breastfeeding on health (respiratory problems,

gastroenteritis, asthma, reported excellent health), physical (maternal attachment, motor scores,

physical activity, weight), and cognitive (reading, math, literature) outcomes, as measured at 9

months, 24 months, and 54 months. The inputs for breastfeeding are slightly different from the

outcomes in Table 2 with breastfed for 6+ months replacing duration. For outcomes at 9 months,

results that are most robust pertain to respiratory problems, excellent health, maternal

attachment, and motor scores.20 For outcomes at 24 months, asthma, weight status, and

cognitive scores emerge as being significantly correlated with breastfeeding and formula-

feeding, with the expected outcomes. The strongest effects are found for obese as an outcome at

24 months, with being breastfed for 6+ months being associated with a 5.6 percentage-point

decrease in the likelihood of being obese, a decrease of about 35% from a mean of 16% (see

Table 1b). These protective effects are weaker when analyzing outcomes at 54 months, with

cognitive outcomes being the most positively affected by breastfeeding and not formula-feeding

at birth. Duration of breastfeeding is marginally associated with increased physical activity at 54

months.

6.3 Robustness Checks on Child Development Outcomes from Breastfeeding

        Instrumental variables estimates where internal instruments are generated in the presence

of heteroscedasticity are shown in Table 4. Results generally corroborate the findings in Table 3


20
  Body mass index is not measured at 9 months. The equivalent measure used for infants and toddlers is weight-
for-recumbent length.

                                                       21
in terms of sign, magnitude, and significance. The most robust results across the various

breastfeeding specifications pertain to respiratory problems and excellent health at 9 months,

obesity and cognitive outcomes at 24 months, and obesity and cognitive outcomes at 54 months.

In particular, children of mothers who have ever breastfed them are 4.7-8.8 percentage points

less likely to be obese, and those of mothers who formula-fed them at birth are 2.8-5.4

percentage points more likely to be obese. Children of mothers who have ever breastfed them

have improved cognitive outcomes at 24 and 54 months, while those of mothers who formula-

fed them at birth appear to have consistently worse cognitive outcomes (although the coefficient

is imprecisely measured for math at 54 months).

       As expected, twin fixed effects reveal very little in terms of significance and the

coefficients are inflated in magnitude, as indicated by the results shown in Table 5. There is

mild evidence of positive effects of breastfeeding on reported health (at 9 months) and

respiratory problems, asthma, and physical activity, yet these results are not very consistent.

Moreover, the assumption that the twins have similar characteristics and are treated similarly is

unlikely to hold if one is being breastfed and the other one is not.

       Propensity score matching results are presented in Table 6. Results generally remain

robust to those in Table 3, often with similar magnitudes, and stronger effects emerging for

cognitive outcomes at all ages.

       Table 7 reveals results where the sensitivity of the coefficients on breastfeeding from

Table 3 (as measured by “ever breastfed”) is analyzed. If the coefficients drastically decrease in

magnitude with the addition of covariates, then statistical endogeneity is likely problematic in

this context. Percentage changes in the coefficients on breastfeeding from the baseline model

(which includes controls for child characteristics pertaining to race/ethnicity, gender, twin status,



                                                 22
and number of siblings) are reported. Column 1 includes birth weight status to the baseline

model; Column 2 further includes maternal characteristics pertaining to obesity, religion, marital

status, father’s residency status, and age at birth; Column 3 adds maternal employment and

education; and Column 4 includes center based care, region, and health insurance. The lack of

consistency in the movement of the coefficients reveals that the coefficients are not

systematically decreasing in magnitude with the addition of covariates.

       In Appendix Table 2, covariates results for “ever breastfed” (comparable to those shown

in Table 3) stratified by birth weight status and poverty status are reported. As expected, results

for the “not low birth weight” group are comparable to those shown in Table 3, as low birth

weight babies are systematically different. Results by poverty status reveal that the benefits seen

at 9 months for maternal attachment and at 24 months for asthma are driven by those below the

poverty threshold. In contrast, the beneficial effects of breastfeeding on cognitive outcomes at

24 and 54 months are mainly seen for those above the poverty threshold.

       Results stratified by mother’s employment status and mother’s marital status are shown

in Appendix Table 3. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of breastfeeding seen in

Table 3 are more precisely measured for mothers who do not work full-time and for married

mothers.

7. DISCUSSION

       The present study casts some doubt on the limited effects for cognitive performance

found by some recent studies analyzing the effects of breastfeeding on various outcomes. While

we do not find consistent protective effects of breastfeeding and not formula-feeding on

respiratory outcomes post 9 months, our preferred estimates suggest that formula-feeding at birth

is positively associated with obesity and negatively associated with cognitive outcomes.



                                                 23
Children of mothers who have ever breastfed them are 4.7-8.8 percentage points less likely to be

obese, and those of mothers who formula-fed them at birth are 2.8-5.4 percentage points more

likely to be obese. If we were to increase breastfeeding from 67% to 75%, in line with Healthy

People 2010 goals, this implies that obesity among two-year-olds may decrease by 0.38-0.70

percentage points with the initiation of breastfeeding. With the increased likelihood of obesity in

adulthood for obese children, and with economic costs of obesity currently estimated at $117

billion per year (USDHHS, 2001), promoting breastfeeding may have the added benefit of

decreasing obesity rates in addition to improving cognitive outcomes for children. Preferred

estimates further suggest that, at 9 months, motor scores are improved, excellent health is

improved, and respiratory problems are reduced through breastfeeding.

       Our study is unique in that it explores a rich set of outcomes, addresses potential

endogeneity using multiple econometric techniques, analyzes outcomes at multiple time points,

and explores effects of breastfeeding on maternal attachment, physical activity, and motor

scores. It does, however, suffer from several limitations. The actual amount of milk consumed

is not measured, and our duration measure does not capture how intensive the breastfeeding

sessions were. Our results are thus only valid on the extensive margin of breastfeeding. As

noted, the wording of the questions may be problematic. Moreover, our data come from the

U.S., and the generalizability of these results to other countries may be limited.

Source: ECLS-B, birth to pre-school waves. Notes: Each cell is coefficient of breastfeeding variable on dependent variable in column (1). Estimations with probit and OLS,
survey weights applied (W1R0-W3R0). Estimation controls for: early care variables; maternal characteristics; race; region; and socioeconomic status (as per Table 2).
Estimations for breastfed for 6+ months include dummy variables for breastfed at 1-2 months and 3-5 months. Coefficient for breastfed for 6+ months relative to default category
of never breastfed. Estimations using 9-month cohort include interviewer fixed effects for cognitive scores and motor scores. a The 54-month motor score is based on a block
building exercise, with motor skills derived as a standardized composite variable based on ten motor skill tasks. b The 54-month cognitive score is a copy forms score: this is a
standardized composite variable based on the child’s score on eight copy form tasks (e.g. draw vertical line from the Bruininks-Oseretsky test). Sample sizes vary per estimation.
Sample for ‘breastfed in last week’ restricted to children aged 8 or 9 months at first survey date. ***, **, * denotes significance at 1%, 5%, 10%.

Source: ECLS-B, birth to pre-school waves. Notes: Each cell is coefficient of breastfeeding variable on dependent variable in column (1). Estimations with survey weights
applied. Propensity score derived using instrument covariates. Balancing property satisfied. Estimation controls for: early care variables; maternal characteristics; race; region;
and socioeconomic status (as per Table 2). Estimations using 9-month cohort include interviewer fixed effects for cognitive and motor scores. Sample sizes vary per estimation.
Sample for ‘breastfed in last week’ restricted to children aged 8 or 9 months at first survey date. Sample for breastfed for 6+ months restricted to either 0 months or 6+ months.
***, **, * denotes significance at 1%, 5%, 10%.

Notes: Specification as per Table 3 for breastfed ever. All models control for age of child at survey date. 9-month responses control for interviewer fixed effects. Baseline model
controls for child characteristics: race, sex, twin status, number of siblings. Base sig. refers to statistical significance of breastfeeding coefficient using the baseline model, ***1%,
**5%, and *1%. Model [1] adds to the baseline: birth weight status. Model [2] is [1] plus maternal characteristics: obesity, religion, marital status, father non-resident, age at
birth. Model [3] is [2] plus maternal employment and education. Model [4] is [3] plus center based care, region, and health insurance.
