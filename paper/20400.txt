Within-Mother Estimates of the Effects of WIC on Birth Outcomes in New York City

                                             ABSTRACT

There is a large literature suggesting that “WIC works” to improve birth outcomes. However, methodological
limitations related to selection into the WIC program have left room for doubt about this conclusion.
This paper uses birth records from New York City to address the limitations of the previous literature.
We estimate models with mother fixed effects to control for fixed characteristics of mothers and we
directly investigate the way that time-varying characteristics of mothers affect selection into the WIC
program. We find that WIC is associated with reductions in low birth weight, even among full term
infants, and with reductions in the probability that a child is “small for dates.” These improvements are
associated with a reduction in the probability that the mother gained too little weight during pregnancy.
Improvements tend to be largest for first born children. We also find that women on WIC are more
likely to be diagnosed with chronic conditions, and receive more intensive medical services, a finding
that may reflect improved access to medical care.

       There is growing acceptance of the idea that prenatal conditions can have health effects

not only at the time of the birth, but lasting into adulthood (Almond and Currie, 2011). This

observation leads people to question whether there are “shovel ready” policies that can be

implemented to improve children’s life chances? The U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Program for

Women, Infants, and Children (called WIC) would seem to be ideally suited to play such a role.

The program provides nutritious food, counseling, and assistance with access to medical care to

pregnant women, as well as to their infants and young children. Bitler et al. (2003) show that the

program serves a large fraction of pregnant women in the U.S. In fiscal year 2011, 9 million

participants were served each month including 2.1 million pregnant or lactating women which

can be compared to the roughly 4 million births in that year (USDA, 2012).

       Yet, despite decades of research suggesting that “WIC works” in the sense that women

who use WIC during pregnancy have healthier babies than other similar women, the suspicion

persists that the observed positive association between WIC participation and outcomes might

not be causal.1 There are two limitations to most WIC research.2 First, since women choose

whether or not to participate in WIC and when to begin participating, it is possible that women

who seek out WIC benefits are different from other observationally similar women in some

unobservable way that is conducive to better birth outcomes. Despite this concern however,

there has been little direct examination of the determinants of selection into the program.

       Second, the longer a woman is pregnant, the longer she has to enroll in WIC. Hence, a

positive correlation between WIC and length of gestation could reflect this “longer window of

opportunity” effect. Moreover, since the fetus gains most of its weight in the third trimester, if

women with longer gestations are more likely to sign up for WIC, then we would also expect

their babies to have higher birth weights.

       This paper addresses these limitations of the previous literature. Starting with a sample

of all New York City births from 1994 to 2004, we focus on women with more than one

singleton birth over the sample period and estimate models with mother fixed effects. In these

models, the effect of WIC is identified by comparing births to the same mother, with and without

WIC. This specification controls for the fact that women who use WIC may be different in

some unobservable fixed respect than women who do not. It is still possible however, that time-

varying characteristics of mothers are associated with both WIC participation and positive birth

outcomes. Hence, we also use our data to directly investigate this type of selection and ask when

mothers are most likely to use WIC in terms of these time varying characteristics?

       In order to deal with the possibility of a mechanical correlation between gestation length

and probability of WIC enrollment, we focus much of our attention on full term births as well as

asking whether infants were “small for dates” (that is, below the 10th percentile of national

weight standards given gestational age). We also ask whether the effects of WIC are bigger for

first born children. Women pregnant with their first born child may lack information about

healthy practices and may not know that they are at risk for poor birth outcomes, so it is possible

that WIC would have particularly large effects in this group.

       We are able to document important facts about selection into the WIC program – mothers

who change WIC status between births are more likely to use WIC when they are younger,

unemployed and/or unmarried. Women are also much more likely to be referred to WIC if they

have had a previous poor pregnancy outcome. However, mothers are also more likely to be
diagnosed with chronic hypertension or chronic diabetes when they are on WIC suggesting that

WIC may improve access to medical care.

       We find that WIC is associated with reduction in low birth weight, even among full term

infants, and with reductions in the probability that a child is “small for dates.” These

improvements are associated with a reduction in the probability that the mother gained too little

weight during pregnancy. Effects on low birth weight are concentrated in first born infants,

although effects on being “small for dates” and weight gain are present for all WIC mothers.

These findings suggest that WIC counselling may be particularly useful for first time mothers.

We also find that women on WIC and their infants receive more intensive medical services, a

finding that may reflect improved access to medical care.



Background

       This section does not attempt to review all of the voluminous literature on WIC (see

Currie, 2003 for a review of the older literature). Instead, we first provide an overview of the

program, and then focus on studies that have attempted to address some or all of the empirical

problems outlined above, and discuss how our study builds on and adds to these efforts.

       WIC is a supplemental feeding program for pregnant and lactating women, infants, and

children up to age 5. In addition to belonging to one of these groups, a WIC participant must

either have income less than 185% of the federal poverty line, or must have Medicaid coverage

(available to pregnant women with incomes less than 200% of the federal poverty line. In New

York, the threshold was about $38,000 for a family of three in 2012). Women must also be

evaluated and deemed to be “at nutritional risk,” though in practice this requirement does not

seem to be very binding (Bitler et al., 2003).
        WIC clients receive coupons or a debit card which can be used to purchase only

specifically selected nutritious food items.3 In 2012, New York WIC provided food benefits

worth an average of $55 per participant per month.4 To maintain their benefits, clients are

required to attend nutritional counseling and breastfeeding education sessions at regular

intervals.     One of the open questions about WIC is why it works (if indeed it does) given

that the benefits are small relative to people’s monthly food budgets. Possible answers are that

the healthy WIC foods available or the nutritional counseling “nudge” people’s diets in a

healthier direction, or that the availability of WIC benefits helps to facilitate access to medical

care.

        As discussed above, most studies of WIC have difficulty dealing with possible non-

random selection of women into WIC benefits. If women who enroll in WIC are, for example,

more concerned about their child’s health, or more motivated to change their behaviors than

other women, then the measured positive effects of WIC could reflect these unobserved

characteristics of mothers who enroll in the program.

        In view of this concern, it is surprising that few WIC studies have estimated models with

maternal fixed effects since these models offer a way to control for all observed and unobserved

fixed characteristics of mothers.5 The study closest in spirit to ours is Kowaleski-Jones and

Duncan (2002) who use data from the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

  As an example, the New York regulations state the following about infant cereal: “This is the
only brand of cereal allowed for infants up to 12 months old: Gerber Cereal for Baby; Plain
varieties only: barley, oatmeal, rice, whole wheat, or mixed; 8 and 16-ounce containers are
allowed; NOT ALLOWED: Organic, extra ingredients such as DHA, fruit, formula, or added
protein.”

  A third study, by Hicks and Langham (1985) focuses on the beginning of the WIC program in
Louisiana. They look at 19 sibling pairs in which, due to the timing of the phase in, one child
received WIC in utero, and the other did not receive it until they were already a year old. They
find positive effects of prenatal WIC participation on IQ and cognitive test scores.
and estimate sibling models. Unfortunately, they had only 104 sibling pairs, and only 71 with

discordant WIC participation. Nevertheless, they found a statistically significant effect on birth

weight (of 7 ounces) and a positive effect on temperament scores. They did not find a

statistically significant effect on measures of motor and social skills.

       Rossin-Slater (2012) estimates maternal fixed effects models in a study of the effects of

the closure of WIC clinics in Texas. She finds that having a WIC clinic in ones zip code

increases maternal weight gain and birth weight, but is also associated with more diagnoses of

diabetes and hypertension during pregnancy. She speculates that this latter result might reflect

better access to medical care, which in turn leads to higher diagnosis rates.

       Joyce et al. (2005) also examine birth records for New York City. In order to deal with

selection, they focus on relatively narrowly defined groups, e.g. Hispanic mothers with a first

pregnancy, and use matching models with propensity scores. In order to deal with the

mechanical correlation between gestation and the window available for WIC enrollment (i.e. the

fact that longer pregnancies both allow more time to enroll and also generally result in healthier

infants), they focus on birth weight conditional on gestational age. Joyce et al. (2008) examine

data from nine states and ask whether earlier initiation of WIC is associated with better maternal

behaviors and better birth outcomes. Both papers argue that a positive association between WIC

and gestation is suspect for the reasons given above. Both of these papers do however find

positive effects of WIC on infant outcomes, though they argue that the effects are smaller than

those found in the previous literature.

       Bitler and Currie (2005) and Figlio et al. (2009) also attempt to deal with selection by

narrowing the comparison group. Bitler and Currie focus on a large national sample of mothers

whose births were paid for by Medicaid (so that all of the mothers were adjunctively eligible for
WIC). Figlio et al. use administrative data from Florida and focus on families in a narrow

income band around the WIC eligibility threshold. They also use a tightening of WIC income

documentation requirements to try to identify the effect of WIC receipt. Using this design, they

find a strong effect of WIC on the incidence of low birth weight (birth weight less than 2500

grams) even though, as they point out, the marginal mother eligible for WIC may benefit less

than infra-marginal recipients.

        Hoynes et al. (2011) focus on the roll out of the WIC program in the late 1970s in a

difference-in-differences framework and show that in counties that adopted WIC, the incidence

of lower birth weight fell. However, arguably the factors affecting the nutritional status of

pregnant women could be quite different today than they were in the 1970s, given sharp declines

in the relative price of food over time, as well as large increases in obesity.

        This brief review indicates that our study is one of very few to examine the effects of

WIC in models that control for mother fixed effects. It is also the first large scale analysis of

selection into WIC, and the first to examine effects of WIC by birth order. The exploration of

within-mother selection into the WIC program and of the effects of WIC on firstborns is of

independent interest and sheds light on the way that “WIC works.”



Methods

        In order to investigate the way that time-varying maternal characteristics are associated

with participation in the WIC program, we estimate models of the form:

    (1) Zit = ai + a1Xit + a2Month + a3Year + a4Neighborhood + eit,

where Zit is a vector of maternal characteristics including pre-pregnancy weight, whether she has chronic

diabetes, whether she has chronic hypertension, age, whether she smoked at all during the pregnancy,

whether she was employed, whether she was married, and whether the mother had a previous poor
pregnancy outcome (the later outcome can only be examined in mothers who had a previous birth that is

included in our data set). The vector ai represents a fixed effect for each mother. The vector Xit includes

time varying characteristics of the mother and child which might be associated with selection into the

program including child gender, maternal education (<12, 12, 13-15, 16+, missing), parity (1, 2, 3,4+,

missing), and maternal age (<20, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35+, missing). (Note that these age dummies are

omitted when the dependent variable in question is maternal age).

        We also include dummy variables for each month and year of birth in order to control for time

trends in these variables, and for maternal neighborhoods within New York City, since neighborhood is

an important indicator of economic and social status.6 Finally, eit represents a random error term.

        Our object in estimating (1) is to determine whether time varying characteristics of mothers are

systematically related to WIC enrollment. If we find that a mother is more likely to be on

WIC when she has a dangerous chronic condition that complicates her pregnancy, then we should take

this information into account when interpreting the within-mother estimates of the effects of WIC

participation on birth outcomes. For example, chronic diabetes is associated both with a higher risk of a

small and preterm baby, and with a higher risk of a very large baby with a complicated delivery. Children

of diabetic mothers also have a higher incidence of congenital anomalies and so may be at higher risk of

negative developmental outcomes (Nold et al., 2004). If mothers diagnosed with diabetes were more

likely to be referred to WIC, then this type of selection could bias the estimated effect of WIC on birth

outcomes.

        Turning to outcomes of pregnancy that we might expect to be affected by the WIC

program, we estimate models of the form:

    (2) Yit = ai + a2WICit + a3Z’it + a4Xit + a5Month + a6Year + a7Neighborhood + eit,




6
 Neighborhoods are defined by the Department of City Planning and are at the level of areas such as
“Brighton Beach,” “Clinton Hill,” or “Hunts Point.” See
http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/dwn_npa.shtml.
where Yit is a vector of outcomes including whether the baby is low birth weight, whether the baby is

small-for-dates, whether the baby had a low APGAR score, whether the baby was preterm (gestation less

than 38 weeks), whether the baby was admitted to the neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU), and whether

there were complications of labor and delivery; WIC is an indicator for whether the mother used WIC

during the pregnancy, and Z’ includes the following time-varying characteristics of the mother: pre-

pregnancy weight, whether she has chronic diabetes, whether she has chronic hypertension, whether she

smoked at all during the pregnancy, whether she was employed, whether she was married. The other

variables are defined as in (1) except that Xit includes one additional variable which is whether the

information about the father is missing from the birth certificate. This variable can be viewed as an

indicator of father involvement.


    Finally, we also estimate models that allow the effects of WIC to differ for first born children. There

are two reasons why this exercise is of interest. One is that first born children may be more affected by

WIC because their mothers do not know what to expect and so the guidance offered by WIC might be of

particular value. Second, as we show below, mothers who have had a previous poor pregnancy outcome

(such as an infant death) are more likely to use WIC in the current pregnancy. Failure to control for this

negative selection into WIC could bias result in downward bias in the estimated effect on infant health;

therefore it is of interest to compare the effects of WIC on firstborns with the effects of WIC for

subsequent pregnancies. These models take the form:


    (3) Yit = ai + a2WICit + a3WICit*Firstborn + a4Z’it + a5Xit + a6Month + a7Year +

        a8Neighborhood + eit,

Where Firstborn is an indicator equal to one if the child is the mother’s first born, and all other variables

are defined as described above. In this regression, a2 is the estimated effect of WIC on all children, and a

significant value for a3 indicates that the effect is different for firstborns.
        We conduct our analyses for all mothers, and for subsamples of mothers defined by Medicaid

coverage, education less than 12 years, and by race. We examine these subsamples largely for the sake

of comparability with previous research. Some previous analyses have found larger effects of WIC

among African-American mothers. As discussed above, several previous analyses have confined their

attention to mothers with Medicaid coverage. Finally, one might think that the counseling aspect of WIC

could be particularly valuable to less educated mothers, so we also examine this group separately.


Data

        The data for this study come from the New York City Department of Health and Mental

Hygiene’s Vital Statistics Natality system for collecting and recording information from the

certificate of live birth. Data for these certificates come from two worksheets. One is completed

by the mother and asks information about her circumstances and behaviors (such as marital

status, smoking during pregnancy, and pre-pregnancy weight). The other worksheet is

completed by the medical facility where the birth takes place using medical records. This

worksheet includes information about prenatal care visits, risk factors for the pregnancy,

complications of labor and delivery, and newborn health. We start with all live singleton births

in New York City between 1994 and 2004, which yields approximately 1.2 million records.

        Table 1 provides an overview of our data. In the full sample, 42% of the births were to

mothers who used WIC at some point during pregnancy. The second column of Table 1 shows

means for those children with a sibling in the sample, roughly 45% of the sample births. The

remaining two columns focus on this subsample of sibling births, and divide them into births in

which the mother used WIC and births in which she did not. Focusing on these last two

columns, we can see that the incidence of negative outcomes is generally higher for the WIC

infants: They are more likely to be low birth weight, small for dates, to have low APGAR scores
(a measure of the health of the infant at birth that is taken out of 10), and to be premature.7

Strikingly, the WIC infants are almost twice as likely as the non-WIC infants to end up in the

neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU).

       Of course much of the gap between the WIC infants and the non-WIC infants is likely to

be due to differing maternal characteristics. Table 1 indicates that mothers of the WIC infants

were much less educated (a mean difference of more than two years), younger, half as likely to

be married, twice as likely to be missing the father’s information on the birth certificate and

more likely to smoke. They also have higher incidence of chronic diabetes and chronic

hypertension, are less likely to receive prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy, and are

almost entirely dependent on Medicaid coverage. The WIC mothers are a little heavier on

average before the pregnancy but less likely to have gained an adequate amount of weight during

pregnancy.8 They are also more likely to have complications of labor and delivery. Finally WIC

mothers who have already had one child are more likely to have had a poor outcome in a

previous pregnancy. We define a poor outcome to include: A previous infant death (very rare),

admission to the NICU, premature, or low birth weight infant. These stark differences between

the circumstances of WIC infants and non-WIC infants illustrate the importance of adequately

controlling for the characteristics of WIC mothers when evaluating the effects of the program on

outcomes.

Results

          Table 2 examines the relationship between maternal characteristics and participation in

the WIC program using mother fixed effects models. Therefore, these estimates rely on the

sample of mothers who used WIC for one pregnancy but did not use it for another to tell us when

they were relatively more likely to use WIC. The table shows estimates for all births, full term

births only, and for different groups of mothers defined by insurance status, race, and education.

          The first three columns of Table 2 show that mothers tend to use WIC when they are not

employed, when they are unmarried, and when they are younger. These differences exist for all

the groups we examine, except that there is no difference in age among less educated mothers.

All but African-American mothers have lower pre-pregnancy weights when they go on WIC,

whereas African-American mothers, who are the highest mean weight group, are more likely to

use WIC when they are relatively heavy.       Together these results suggest a scenario in which

mothers use WIC (and smoke) when they are relatively young, unemployed, and unmarried. As

they grow older they may be more likely to quit smoking, become employed, and/or marry and

they become less likely to use WIC.

          It is surprising then that we also find that women are more likely to have chronic diabetes

and chronic hypertension when they are on WIC since these are conditions that increase in

prevalence with age. An examination of the subgroups shows that this relationship is strongest

among African-American women. We think that, consistent with Rossin-Slater’s observations in

Texas, women on WIC may be more likely to be properly diagnosed and treated if they have

chronic diabetes or hypertension, so that these conditions are more likely to be subsequently

recorded on the birth certificate. Consistent with this interpretation, Table 2 also shows that

women on WIC are more likely to get prenatal care in the first trimester.
       The last column of Table 2 shows that in the subset of women who have already had a

birth that we can observe, women who had a previous poor pregnancy outcome are much more

likely to be on WIC. This finding could reflect women being more motivated to try to improve

their pregnancy outcomes, or a pattern of referring women with poor outcomes to WIC.

       Changes in these time varying maternal characteristics are likely to bias estimated WIC

effects if they are not controlled. The fact that women use WIC when they are relatively

disadvantaged (young, unmarried, unemployed) would be expected to bias estimated effects of

WIC downwards in the absence of controls for these variables. Similarly, if women who know

that they are at risk of future poor outcomes are more likely to use WIC, then estimates that do

not take this selection into account would understate the benefits of WIC. If women on WIC are

really more likely to have chronic diabetes and/or hypertension, then this would also tend to be

reflected in poorer birth outcomes. However, as discussed above, it is possible that this pattern

reflects differential reporting of chronic conditions for women on WIC rather than actual

increased prevalence of these conditions.

       Table 3 shows estimated effects of WIC on infant outcomes. The estimates in this table

and in Table 4 are based on equation (2) and include observable time-varying characteristics

associated with selection into the WIC program: Maternal age, employment, marital status,

smoking during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy weight,9 chronic diabetes, chronic hypertension, and

whether women received prenatal care in the first trimester. We have also estimated these

models excluding the prenatal care variable, and find that this exclusion has little effect on the

estimates.



9
 When used as a control, indicators for the following categories of pre-pregnancy weight have been
included: missing, >90-<110 pounds, 110-<120 pounds, 120-<135 pounds, 135-<159 pounds, 159-<185
pounds, and >=185 pounds.
       Since we only observe previous poor pregnancy outcomes for a subset of women in our

data set, we have not controlled for that variable here. Below, we show estimates which allow

the effect of WIC to vary for first born children and other children. These estimates will shed

light on potential the importance of information mothers may have about previous pregnancy

outcomes, since no mother has such information for first births.

       Column 1 in the first panel suggests that consistent with the vast majority of WIC studies,

WIC participation is estimated to have a negative effect on the incidence of birth weight less than

2500 grams: The coefficient in the first row and column of .0041 can be compared to the

fraction low birth weight which is also given in the table and thus implies a 6.12% reduction in

the overall probability of low birth weight. However, it is possible that some of the estimated

“effect” is driven by the mechanical correlation between gestation and the probability of

enrollment in WIC (due to having a longer time period in which to enroll) that was discussed

earlier. Column 2 suggests that WIC has a large effect on prematurity, reducing it by 10.05%

which again, may reflect this mechanical correlation. Hence, column 3 shows estimates of

whether the baby was “small for dates.” Conditioning on gestation length in this way suggests

that WIC reduces the overall probability of a small-for-dates baby by 2.92%. This smaller effect

suggests that some of the estimated WIC effect in low birth weight and prematurity is indeed due

to the mechanical relationships between gestation length, a longer window in which to enroll in

WIC, and positive birth outcomes. However, the significant effect on whether the baby is small-

for-dates indicates that WIC has a significant effect even conditional on gestation. The fourth

column provides some evidence regarding potential mechanisms, suggesting that the probability

of low weight gain during pregnancy (defined as weight gain less than 6kg) is significantly

reduced by participation in WIC, falling by 9.18%.
       Columns 5 and 6 examine complications of labor and delivery, and the probability that

the infant was admitted to the NICU, respectively. Surprisingly, the estimated effect of WIC is

significantly positive in both cases, indicating that receiving WIC prenatally increases the

probability of these outcomes. Since not even the harshest critics of WIC have suggested that it

actually harms women and children, it seems likely that these estimates reflect improved access

to medical care during and after the birth among WIC recipients rather than a causal effect of

prenatal nutritional assistance or counseling.

       The second panel of Table 3 shows estimates for mothers who were covered by Medicaid

in both pregnancies. The estimated effects of WIC are almost identical to those in the full

sample of mothers for all the outcomes examined. Hence, it appears that although Medicaid

participants are adjunctively eligible for WIC , WIC participation is not simply a proxy for

Medicaid coverage. Hence any improvements in access to medical care that are associated with

WIC are not coming solely through the provision of health insurance, but through some other

channel. The estimates for mothers with less than 12 years of education are very similar to those

for Medicaid covered mothers.

       Turning to the estimates by race, the effect on “small for dates,” which is the most

reliable measure of infant health in this table, is about one third larger in terms of the point

estimate for African-Americans, but is not precisely estimated given the smaller subsample. The

effect of WIC on the probability that the mother gained too little weight is also negative and

about a third larger than for the sample as a whole. This estimate is statistically significant.

Thus, the table provides some support for the hypothesis that the effects of WIC are larger for

African-American women than for other groups.
        Aside from the regressions using “small-for-dates” as the dependent variable, the

estimates in Table 3 are potentially colored by the mechanical correlation between gestation and

WIC enrollment that has been discussed. Hence, Table 4 repeats the same analyses on the subset

of infants who are full term, that is, born after 37 weeks gestation. Perhaps surprisingly, these

estimates are similar to those in Table 3, and in some cases are larger. For example, in this

sample WIC is estimated to reduce the probability that an infant is small for dates by 4.88%.

Turning to the subsamples, the effect is significant for Medicaid mothers and less educated

mothers When we look by race, the impact of WIC on low birth weight is over twice as high for

African-Americans as for other mothers. The effects are also larger for African-Americans in

the models of low weight gain, small-for-dates, and NICU use.

        Table 5 shows estimates from model (3), which allows the effect of WIC to be different

for first born children than for children of higher birth order. Columns 2 through 5 suggest that

the estimates are, for the most part, quite similar to Table 4. There is no significant difference in

the effect of WIC on being small for dates between firstborn and other children: Both groups of

children are 4.81% less likely to be small for dates compared to siblings who did not receive

WIC in utero. The effects of WIC on low weight gain are somewhat larger for firstborns, but

statistically significant for all children.

        Moreover, there appear to be significant effects of WIC on complications of labor and

delivery and the probability of NICU use for most children, including first born children. The

sole exception is among African-American mothers. In this group, WIC has no significant effect

on complications of labor and delivery, and has a much weaker effect on NICU use among first

borns than among other children. Recall, that we presented some evidence earlier suggesting that

women with previous poor pregnancy outcomes are referred to WIC. Since mothers of first born
children have not had previous poor pregnancy outcomes, the effect of WIC on the use of these

medical services cannot be driven by such referrals in this group. Stronger effects of WIC on the

utilization of medical care amond later born African-American children are consistent with such

a pattern of referrals, however.

       One result that is quite different for firstborns than for other children appears in column

(1). Only firstborn children have significantly lower probabilities of being low birth weight

when they received WIC. Moreover, WIC is estimated to reduce the probability of low birth

weight in this group by a third.



Discussion and Conclusions

        This paper presents the first large-sample mother fixed effects estimates of the effects of

WIC on infant outcomes and use of health care. Since fixed effects estimates only control for

fixed characteristics of mothers, we also pay careful attention to time-varying factors associated

with within-mother changes in prenatal WIC participation. The portrait that emerges is one in

which young, unmarried, unemployed women use WIC initially, but are less likely to use it for

subsequent pregnancies in which they are older and married or employed.

       The evidence also suggests that women receive more intensive medical care when they

are on WIC, at least in New York City. Women are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic

diabetes and hypertension when they are on WIC despite being younger; they are more likely to

be diagnosed with complications of labor and delivery; and their infants are more likely than

non-WIC siblings to spend any time in the NICU. These results contrast with earlier estimates

(e.g. Bitler and Currie, 2005) which suggested that WIC resulted in immediate cost savings due

to reductions in use of medical care among women and newborns. Moreover, even firstborns are
more likely to be diagnosed with complications of labor and delivery and to use the NICU if

their mothers were on WIC during pregnancy, which suggests that the overall effect cannot be an

artifact of women with poor previous pregnancy outcomes being referred to WIC, though it is

possible that the pattern among African-Americans reflects such a referral pattern.

       We also find, consistent with most previous WIC studies, that WIC participation has

positive effects on infant health: WIC infants are less 5.6% likely to be low birth weight and

4.9% less likely to be small for dates (even when we only look at full term infants). However,

consistent with the critiques of Joyce et al. (2005, 2008) and others, these estimates are quite a

bit smaller than many that are in the literature.10 An exception is among firstborns, where WIC

reduces the probability of low birth weight by a third. Thus, the results suggest that WIC

promotes weight gain and reduces the probability that a child is “small for dates” among most

women, but has especially strong effects on women delivering for the first time.

       One possible caveat to the current study is that the estimated effects may actually be too

small. Random measurement error in WIC status, which is self-reported by the mother, could

bias the estimated coefficients towards zero. Also, it is not clear that one should expect the

estimated effects of WIC to be the same in every time and place as they must depend on the

average health and nutritional status of women in the program, the composition of program

benefits, and the medical and nutritional benefits available outside the WIC program.

       In summary, we find that infants whose mothers used WIC during pregnancy are

healthier than siblings born when the mothers were not using WIC. Some of the effect seems to

come through a reduced probability of low weight gain during pregnancy, which is reflected in

heavier babies and a lower incidence of “small-for-dates” babies. WIC mothers in our sample

10
 For example, Bitler and Currie (2005) find a 29% reduction in the incidence of low birth
weight.
were also heavier users of medical care, and were more likely to be diagnosed with chronic

conditions (probably reflecting this more intensive use of care). We believe that mother fixed

effects techniques applied to even richer administrative data (such as future mergers of

educational records with birth records) could yield even greater insights into the long-term

benefits of WIC.
