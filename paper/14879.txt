A New Test of Borrowing Constraints for Education

                                                ABSTRACT

We discuss a simple model of intergenerational transfers with one-sided altruism: parents care about
their child but the child does not reciprocate. Parents and children make investments in the child’s
education, investments for other purposes, and parents can transfer cash to their child. We show that
for an identifiable set of parent-child pairs, parents will rationally under-invest in their child’s education.
For these parent-child pairs, additional financial aid will increase educational attainment. The model
highlights an important feature of higher education finance, the “expected family contribution” (EFC)
that is based on income, assets, and other factors. The EFC is neither legally guaranteed nor universally
offered: Our model identifies the set of families that are disproportionately likely to not provide their
full EFC. Using a common proxy for financial aid, we show, using of data from the Health and Retirement
Study, that financial aid increases the educational attainment of children whose families are disproportionately
likely to under-invest in education. Financial aid has no effect on the educational attainment of children
in other families. The theory and empirical evidence identifies a set of children who face quantitatively
important borrowing constraints for higher education.

     There has been long-standing interest in whether U.S. students have access to sufficient

resources to support efficient human capital investment (see, for example, Becker, 1967). But

despite a large literature, no paper on borrowing constraints for higher education focuses on the

family’s role in financing college, particularly through their expected family contribution (EFC).

The EFC is the difference between a child’s cost of attending college and what the federal

financial aid formulas determine is the family’s “adjusted available income” for college. The

EFC, however, is neither legally guaranteed nor universally offered. Children whose parents for

one reason or another refuse or are unable to make their EFC may face financial constraints in

attending college.1

     It is difficult to study directly the EFC and how it affects educational attainment. There are

few datasets that have detailed information on parental income, assets, and the demographic

factors that are required by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), along with

the contributions parents actually make for college. Moreover, the EFC is determined, in part,

by the college that children attend. Consequently, the EFC is endogenous to the outcomes,

namely college entry or years of completed education, that are of typical interest to researchers.

Even if an arguably exogenous EFC measure could be computed, borrowing constraints may

have their most important effects on the decision of whether or not a child goes to college. For a

child who ends up not going to college, the parent will clearly not provide college expenses. So

the counterfactual – what the parent would have contributed had the child gone to college – is

unobserved. This unobserved counterfactual is a major obstacle to the direct examination of the

school you are considered dependent on your parents’ income and have to include their income on you FAFSA
which will count against you when figuring your expected family contribution. For those of us who did not receive
any financial support from parents other than cosigning loans this is a real kick in the ass. Not only is my family
lower middle class and unable to contribute to my education, but the government will tell me that they expected
them to contribute and will punish me by lowering my available loan total” (http://www.becker-posner-

effect of parents’ education transfers on educational attainment.

      In this paper we introduce a new approach to studying borrowing constraints and higher

education. Our starting point is the observation that parents and children are distinct decision-

makers.2 Specifically, in our model we assume parents face complete credit markets and they

care about their own consumption and about the well-being of their adult child. We assume a

child cannot borrow against future earnings and they care only about their own consumption (and

not their parent’s). We show the child’s education may be suboptimal due to borrowing

constraints. The parent may be poor relative to the child or care too little about the utility of their

child to provide financial help for college, since parents cannot access the returns to their child’s

education.3 Alternatively parents and children may disagree about the optimal investment in

education because of the possibility that the child will end up relying too heavily on the parent.

     There are two regions in the equilibrium of our model. One region is distinguished by the

presence of post-schooling cash transfers (and parents are relatively wealthy, or altruistic, or the

child’s ability is relatively modest). Here children achieve the efficient level of investment in

education, so the return to education equals the financial market rate of return. There are

strategic concerns, however, so the parent “ties” (by making an education-specific transfer) a

portion of their intergenerational transfers. The other region is distinguished by no post-

schooling cash transfers (and parents are relatively poor, or egoistic, or the child is relatively

able). In this portion of the equilibrium, there will be underinvestment in the child’s education,

so the return to additional human capital investment will exceed the financial market rate of

return. It is precisely this group of parents that will rationally not meet their EFC. Parents will

tolerate this inefficiency because they have no way to write a binding contract to ensure that

some portion of the child’s future earnings will be repaid in return for supporting their child’s

education.

    Financial aid will have sharply different effects on parent-child pairs in the two regions of

the model’s equilibrium. For parents who make post-college transfers, additional financial aid

should have no effect on educational attainment, because parents will already make the efficient

level of investment in their child’s education. But children of parents who do not make post-

college transfers under-invest in education, due in part to their inability to borrow against future

earnings. For these children, increases in financial aid will increase educational attainment.

    For expositional clarity, our model abstracts away from important considerations both in

parent-child relations and in higher education finance. Among the most important is the fact that

a child’s post-college earnings are uncertain, which may affect post-college transfers, and the

fact that some children finance college by working while in school or by extending the amount of

time they attend college. We extend the model to address these concerns in Appendix 2 and

show that the central intuition still holds: financial aid should be more likely to affect the

educational attainment of children whose parents do not make post-college transfers than

children whose parents do make post-college transfers.

    Examining the empirical implications of the model requires data on three things: parent-

child pairs; financial aid, and intergenerational transfers, ideally for a substantial period

following college, so we can separate parent-child pairs into those parents who do and those who

do not make post-college transfers. No dataset has all three features. The Health and Retirement

Study (HRS) comes close, with good data on parent-child pairs and intergenerational transfers

over a long period. The HRS also offers a good proxy for financial aid. The dollar amount of

financial aid will depend on the overlap of a child’s college years with those of his or her




                                                   3
siblings. As a result, we rely on the birth spacing of siblings as a proxy for variation in students’

federal aid.

     As implied by our analytic model, we find a positive and statistically significant relationship

between educational attainment and sibling overlap when no post-schooling cash transfers are

reported, and no significant relationship when positive transfers are reported. Our empirical

models include family-specific fixed and random effects specifications and the results are

consistent across several specification checks motivated by institutional features of financial aid.

The magnitude of the association implies a difference in educational attainment of nearly one

semester between children with zero and four years of sibling overlap in college ages. Our

results suggest that borrowing constraints for higher education are important for children in

families where parents are unwilling or are unable to meet their expected family contribution.

I. A model of intergenerational transfers

     The starting point for our model is the small theoretical literature on collective family

schooling decisions.4 In order to generate an equilibrium that distinguishes between transfers for

education and cash transfers and the timing of these, there must be scope for disagreement

between parents and children over children’s investments. Repeated transfer opportunities can

generate a threat of strategic over-reliance of a child on an altruistic parent. In this case parents

may prefer more education for the child due to the threat of over-reliance, but may also prefer

less education for the child given that the parent cannot access the returns from the child’s




4
  When studies of borrowing constraints for education include analytic models, they invariably assume that families
make unitary college decisions based on parents’ resources and children’s ability. Two interesting papers that do
not examine borrowing constraints but do investigate behavioral consequences of parental transfers to school-age
children are Sauer (2003) and Perozek (2005). Sauer examines the effects of parental transfers during law school on
borrowing and work while in school and post-school earnings for a sample of University of Michigan law school
graduates. Perozek characterizes altruistic transfer rules in a dynamic setting and empirically explores the education
investments of a parent and multiple children using the HRS.

a. The Economic Environment

     Consider a two-period model where parents have altruistic concern for their children’s

utility. We assume that parents and children make independent, non-cooperative decisions. In

particular, the parent moves first, choosing her consumption and physical capital investment,

along with the dollar amounts of a cash transfer to the child and a tied transfer for college

education. The child sees these choices and then decides how much to consume, invest in

schooling, and save. In the second period, the parent again consumes and chooses a cash gift to

the child; the child’s only action is to consume the gift and the returns to his various investments.

While the parent has full access to credit, we assume that the child cannot borrow against his

future income.6

     Define a as the total parent and child investment in physical capital, and define e as their

total investment in the child’s postsecondary education. Assume that the rate of return on

physical capital is constant at R and the return to total human capital investment e is h(e) such

that h′(⋅) > 0, h′′(⋅) < 0 and h′(0) > R. The child can receive financial aid τ , which augments

family human capital investments (we assume that h′(τ ) ≥ R ). Hence e = e p + e k + τ .

     The parent, p, and child, k, have utilities of consumption in the two periods given by

                   U k (c1k , c2k ) = u (c1k ) + β u (c2k ) and
                                                                          (                     )
                   U p (c1p , c2p , c1k , c2k ) = u (c1p ) + β u (c2p ) + α u (c1k ) + β u (c2k ) ,


5
  The Samaritan’s Dilemma, evident here in the possibility of the child’s over-reliance on the parent, was first
described by Buchanan (1975), and results on the Samaritan’s Dilemma in Lindbeck and Weibull (1988), Bergstrom
(1989), and particularly Bruce and Waldman (1990) have also shaped our approach. Bruce and Waldman (1991) are
the first to connect the Samaritan’s Dilemma to the motive for tied transfers. Pollak (1988) uses preferences for
education to motivate parents’ investments, and observes that distinctions among transfer forms must rely on a
disagreement between parents and children and that effective tied transfers cannot function as collateral or be resold.
6
  As discussed in Brown et al. (2006), both assumptions – non-cooperative behavior and children have more limited
ability to borrow than parents– are necessary to obtain empirical predictions on the timing and magnitude of
transfers.


                                                               5
where ctj represents the period t consumption of agent j, α expresses the parent’s degree of

purely altruistic concern for the child’s welfare, and β is the rate at which each agent discounts

future utility. Single period utility of consumption for each agent, u (⋅) , is such that

u′(⋅) > 0, u′′(⋅) < 0 and u′(0) = +∞.

     The parent acts as a Stackleberg leader, moving first in period 1, choosing

c1p , a p (assets), e p and first period transfer to the child g1 , subject to constraints

c1p + a p + e p + g1 ≤ x p , g1 ≥ 0 and e p ≥ 0. 7 As a result of the one-sided altruism and non-

cooperative interaction between the parent and the child, the parent is unable to draw resources

from the child through a negative transfer or through negative investment in the child’s

education. The non-negativity of cash transfers in the second period will play a crucial role in

determining equilibrium investments.

     The child takes the parent’s choices of c1p , a p and e p as given, choosing c1k , a k and ek

subject to constraints c1k + a k + e k ≤ g1 , e k ≥ 0 and a k ≥ 0 . In the second period, the parent

determines consumption c2p and the amount of the second period cash transfer to the child, g 2 ,

subject to constraints c2p + g 2 ≤ Ra p and g 2 ≥ 0. The child consumes his total resources, so that

c2k = Ra k + h(e p + e k + τ ) + g 2 .

b. Period 2

     The parent’s problem in the second period is


      g 2 ≥0
               {
     max u ( Ra − g 2 ) + α u ( Ra + h(e + e + τ ) + g 2 ) ,

                                                                }

7
  Our assumptions imply that g1 ≥ 0 does not bind at the parent’s optimum; e p ≥ 0 , however, may bind. Key
results in this paper hold even when the child has an endowment that can support first period consumption (Brown et
al., 2006).

and the optimal transfer, given the second period resources of the parent and child, is

                                       ⎧ g2 such that u′( Ra p − g2 ) = α u′( Rak + h(e p + ek + τ ) + g2 )

                                       ⎩
When the transfer that equates second period marginal utilities across generations is positive, the

parent achieves his/her preferred allocation of the family’s total final-stage resources.8 The

parent’s altruism toward the child implies that the final transfer decreases with the child’s assets

and earnings, no matter what choices preceded them, so second period transfers, when made, are

compensatory. The key point of equation (1) for our purposes, however, is that when the

parent’s marginal utility from consuming everything in period 2 exceeds the marginal utility they

would get from the first dollar of cash transfers, the parent will not make second period transfers.

Whether or not second period cash transfers are made distinguishes the two segments of the

equilibrium.

c. Period 1: Child

     In the first period, the child determines his or her own consumption, saving, and educational

investment given the ( g1 , a p , e p ) chosen by the parent. The child’s problem is


                max
         c1k ,c2k ,ek ≥0,a k ≥ 0
                                   {u(c ) + β u(c )}

                                       1
                                                k
                                                2


         s.t. c1k + ek + a k ≤ g1 ,
                 c2k = Ra k + h(e p + ek + τ ) + g 2 ( Ra p , Ra k + h(e p + ek + τ )) and
                 g 2 ( Ra p , Ra k + h(e p + ek + τ )) as in (1).

The function g 2 ( Ra p , Ra k + h(e p + e k + τ )) is continuous but non-differentiable where

α u′( Ra k + h(e p + ek + τ )) = u′( Ra p ) .


8
 This surprisingly robust prediction is the focus of the theory and empirical analysis in Altonji, Hayashi and
Kotlikoff (1997).


                                                             7
        The first order conditions for the child’s problem make it clear that whenever g 2 > 0 , the

child would like to over-consume in the first period in order to achieve consumption path

{c1k , c2k } such that


                            {
        u ′(c1k ) = β max R, h′(e p + e k + τ ) ⎛⎜1 +

                                                                                    ⎠
                                                                                           2



This will be possible only if there exists an e k ≥ 0 and a k ≥ 0 that satisfy (2), given the parent’s

choices. As we show in the appendix, the parent can choose g1 , e p and a p such that

ek ≥ 0 and a k ≥ 0 bind, thus mitigating the strategic concerns (and equation (2) ends up not

holding in the g 2 > 0 case).

d. Period 1: Parent

        In period 1, the parent chooses c1p , g1 , e p and a p to maximize his or her utility, subject to

c1p + a p + e p + g1 ≤ x p , g1 ≥ 0 and e p ≥ 0. We note three features of the model in proposition 1.10

Proposition 1: (i) Equilibrium consumption levels {c1p , c2p , c1k , c2k } are unique. (ii) If g 2 > 0 in any
equilibrium, then h′(e p + ek + τ ) = R and the equilibrium transfers (e p , g 2 , g1 ) are unique. (iii) If
g 2 ≥ 0 binds in any equilibrium, then h′(e p + ek + τ ) > R – there is inefficient investment in
education – and the equilibrium transfers need not be unique, since only the sum, g1 + e p , is
determined.

        The solution partitions the parameter space into two regions. In one region g 2 > 0 and

h′(e p + ek + τ ) = R . The parent’s c1p , g1 , e p and a p meet conditions

          u′(c1p ) = α u′(c1k ), u′(c1p ) = β Ru′(c2p ), h′(e p + τ ) = R, and u′(c2p ) = α u′(c2k ),
                                                                                                                          (3)
          where c1p = x p − g1 − e p − a p , c1k = g1 , c2p = Ra p − g 2 , and c2k = h(e p + τ ) + g 2

    Recall the partial derivative                                   is negative since second period transfers are compensatory.

     Proofs of both propositions are given in Appendix 1.


                                                                            8
The solution will be in this region when parents are relatively wealthy and altruistic, and the

child’s return to human capital investment falls relatively quickly to the real interest rate.

     In the g 2 > 0 equilibrium strategic concerns arise so the parent bears all responsibility for

the investment in the child’s education. The child realizes that the parent will be in the interior

of the transfer region in the second period. Hence, given the opportunity, the child over-

consumes in the first period, as shown in equation (2). The parent takes this into account and

makes a cash gift of only what she prefers for the child to consume in the first period. The

parent ties all additional first period transfers to education, exhausting the region of educational

investment that yields a return at or above the real interest rate. To summarize, we find that

families in the g 2 > 0 equilibrium face strategic concerns, and yet make efficient educational

investments and hence they relieve the child’s educational borrowing constraint.

     The other region of the parameter space occurs where conditions (3) can be met only with

g 2 < 0 . In this case, g 2 = 0 and h′(e p + ek + τ ) > R .11 The equilibrium is described by

         u ′(c1p ) = α u ′(c1k ), u ′(c1p ) = β Ru′(c2p ), h′(e p + ek + τ ) > R, u′(c2p ) > α u′(c2k ),
         and u ′(c1k ) = β h′(e p + e k + τ )u′(c2k ), where c1p = x p − g1 − e p − a p ,                  (4)
          c1k   = g1 ,   c2p   = Ra , and
                                   p
                                            c2k   = h(e + e + τ ).
                                                       p   k



The absence of a second period transfer means that the child has no incentive to behave

strategically. As a result, the parent and child agree on the intertemporal condition to be met by

the child’s consumption: u ′(c1k ) = β h′(e p + e k + τ )u ′(c2k ) .

     While parents and the child agree on the intertemporal condition, the g 2 = 0 equilibrium is

inefficient. The post-schooling consumption that the parent prefers to allocate to the child is less

11

But given incomes, altruism and other model parameters, this case has no consequence for our empirical work.


                                                               9
than the earnings produced by the efficient human capital investment. In other words, conditions

(4) imply c2k < h(e* ) , where e* = h′−1 ( R) . Since parents cannot reclaim the return to e p invested

in the child’s education, they invest in human capital to support the child’s second period

consumption but physical capital to support their own. This leads parents to tolerate the

h′(e p + e k + τ ) > R wedge in the investment returns, despite their unbounded access to credit.

Families in the g 2 = 0 equilibrium face no strategic concerns, yet are led by an intergenerational

borrowing constraint to invest inefficiently in their children’s human capital.

     It is this group of g 2 = 0 families, where parents are relatively poor, or egoistic, or a child’s

return to human capital investment falls relatively slowly with additional education, who

rationally may choose to not meet their expected family contribution, as determined by the

federal rules determining financial aid for higher education.

     The next proposition shows financial aid will have very different effects on the educational

attainment of children in the g 2 > 0 and in the g 2 = 0 groups.

total educational attainment.

     Propositions 1 and 2 formalize our new strategy to examine borrowing constraints for

education. With data on parent-child pairs, g 2 , and financial aid, we can examine the correlation

between children’s years of schooling and financial aid, conditioning on child characteristics,

using two separate subsamples. The first is one in which parents make a post-schooling transfer

( g 2 > 0 ), and the second is one in which they do not ( g 2 = 0 ). Our model implies that financial

aid will have no effect on the educational attainment of children in the first ( g 2 > 0 ) sample, and


                                                    10
a positive effect on the educational attainment of children in the other sample. We discuss our

HRS-based work implementing this strategy below.

e. An Economic Environment with Greater Realism

     A skeptic might argue that that our simple model abstracts away from too many important

features of reality. To address this concern, we examine the robustness of our analytic results in

Appendix 2 where we develop a model that incorporates three additional features relevant to our

problem. First, in our simple model the sample is cleanly split by g 2 , second period cash

transfers. If income is uncertain, of course, post-college transfers will be affected by income

shocks that parents and children receive after the child is out of college, so our sample-splitting

strategy will not be sharp. Hence, in the Appendix 2 model we allow for shocks to earnings.

Second, credit card promotions on college campuses are commonplace, so we allow the child to

borrow at a higher rate than the parent. Third, many children work while in college.

Consequently, in the appendix we incorporate a standard production function where time and

expenditures are complementary in producing human capital. This allows us to model a child’s

decision to work while in college.12 The model does not have an analytic solution, so we solve it

using numerical methods.

     For a broad range of utility and human capital production function parameters, the appendix

model confirms the simple model’s central intuition: families who do not pass on post-college

gifts to their children are more likely to under-invest in their children’s education. Children of

parents who make post-college gifts are likely to have received transfers that allow them to reach

their efficient level of education. Parents who have the option to make an education transfer and

12
  Work while in college is the mechanism children use to relieve borrowing constraints in Keane and Wolpin
(2001), for example. They differ from our approach by assuming all children face the same tuition. In contrast, we
assume that there are colleges of varying costs and consequently low income families with high ability children will
choose to attend less expensive colleges and go to school for fewer years (since time and expenditures are
complements), if they are borrowing constrained.


                                                        11
choose not to are foregoing a high rate of return investment opportunity. Since parents are at a

point in their lifecycle where they do not face borrowing constraints, the decision to under-invest

cannot be rationalized if parents have sufficient resources to make cash gifts later on. For

reasonable parameters of the income process, the intuition from the simple model holds

probabilistically, but the g 2 sample split is no longer sharp.

        In the appendix model, children of parents who do not make education transfers can borrow,

work while in college, or even postpone college. Still, their optimal schooling is less than the

efficient level. The reason is that each of these “make do” options are costly. This is obviously

true for borrowing at an interest rate that exceeds the financial market rate of return. Working

while in college helps relieve borrowing constraints, but takes time away from human capital

acquisition as well as leisure.13 In short, we find that a constrained child who receives no help

from his or her parents will, at the margin, consume less, work a little more while in college, and

choose to go to a lower cost college for fewer years than would an otherwise identical child with

more generous parents. Thus, the additional model features we examine mitigate the importance

of borrowing constraints, but they do not eliminate their importance.

II. The effects of financial aid on education in intergenerationally constrained and
unconstrained families

        The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) has good information on parent-child pairs and

post-college transfers. It is a national panel study with an initial sample (in 1992) of 12,652

persons and 7,607 households. It oversamples blacks, Hispanics, and residents of Florida. The

baseline 1992 study consisted of in-home, face-to-face interviews with the 1931-1941 birth

cohort and their spouses, if married. Follow-up interviews were given by telephone in 1994,

1996, 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004. Other cohorts, born before 1923 (Asset and Health Dynamics

13
     Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2003) provide evidence on costs of working while in college.

of the Oldest Old), between 1923 and 1930 (Children of the Depression), and between 1942 and

1947 (War Babies), were added to the main HRS cohort in 1998.14 We use data from all these

cohorts as long as needed information is available.

     Some supplemental analyses in this paper (and more in our 2007 paper draft) use data from

the NLSY-97, a national panel survey of 8,984 youths who were born between 1980 and 1984,

first fielded in 1997. The NLSY-97 cannot be used as our central data source because it does not

yet have suitable data on post-college transfers.15

a. Measuring post-college cash transfers

     In waves 3 through 7 of the HRS respondents are asked the following question about cash

transfers exceeding $500 in the last 24 months.16 The specific wording in 2000 (Wave 5) reads:

     “Including help with education but not shared housing or shared food (or any deed to a
     house), in the last 2 years did [the Respondent or Spouse] give financial help totaling $500
     or more to any of their children or grandchildren?”

Those answering “yes” were then asked how much. We aggregate transfers reported by parents

over the period 1998-2004 (Waves 4 through 7) for our first measure of post-college cash

transfers, g 2 .17 There are three reasons for using this measure. First, starting in 1998 (wave 4)

the HRS is a representative sample of all households born before 1948, so it is natural to start

with this wave. Second, even if we were willing to ignore data from the new cohorts added to
14
   A 1948 to 1953 cohort (Early Baby Boomers) was added in 2004, but because we do not have information on this
group in earlier waves, we do not include them in our study.
15
   The earlier NLSY-79 is not ideal because the latest measure of g 2 in that survey was elicited when children were
21 to 28 years old. The ideal measure for identifying parents with active post-schooling financial linkages gathers
information over a long post-college period. Moreover, the age distribution of the sampling frame is such that there
are too few siblings to estimate models with family fixed effects. The value of conditioning on time-invariant
family-specific factors is discussed below.
16
   Wave 1 asks about transfers exceeding $500 in the last 12 months and wave 2 asks about transfers exceeding $100
in the last 12 months.
17
   Recall that the purpose of g 2 is to separate the sample into intergenerationally constrained and unconstrained
parent-child pairs. The fact that the primary transfer question includes grandchildren is not ideal, given that the
model we write down considers only two generations. But we think parents making cash gifts to grandchildren are
likely to have relieved educational borrowing constraints for their children, so we do not view the inclusion of
grandchildren in the transfers question to be an important limitation of the study.


                                                        13
the HRS in 1998, it is not clear how to aggregate over the first three waves due to differences in

the way the transfers question was worded in each wave. Third, problems with missing

responses increase with the number of waves we use.

     We would prefer, however, to use a measure of significant post-college transfers over a

longer time period in the estimation. While no long-term retrospective question on major cash

transfers to children is available in any of the HRS core surveys, Wave 2 of the HRS, fielded in

1994, does include a topical module on parent-child transfers. The Wave 2 survey (in Module 7)

asked 827 HRS respondents in 427 households:

     “Other than contributions toward education expenses, have you ever given substantial gifts
     to your grown children?”

     Those who answer “yes” are asked the total amount of these gifts. This is arguably the

exact question we require to distinguish families with relatively wealthy or altruistic parents who

have active post-schooling financial linkages from those with relatively poor or egoistic parents

who likely have no post-schooling financial linkages. The drawback to this question is that it

was asked only of a small subsample. Thus we report estimates using both the shorter window

of cash transfers observed for the full HRS sample and this longer transfer window observed

only for Wave 2, Module 7 respondents. Responses to this question are available for 334 of the

9,471 families for whom we have complete demographic and education information on multiple

siblings aged 24 and older. These families include 1,262 children.18

b. A proxy for financial aid

     The U.S. Higher Education Act of 1965 authorized grants and subsidized loans for students

pursuing post-secondary, graduate, and professional education. The Higher Education Act was

reauthorized every 4 years between 1968 and 1980, and every 6 years thereafter. The 1992

18
  Appendix Table 1 gives more detail on the construction of the full HRS sample and the module sample that we
use for our analyses.


                                                      14
reauthorization came with several major reforms. Before 1992, parents’ EFC was calculated

according to separate formulas for Pell Grants (the Pell Grant Index) and subsidized loans (the

Congressional Methodology). After 1992 a common Federal Methodology was used.19

     It would be difficult to trace and aggregate all of the historical details of U.S. financial aid

policy over the relevant period for our sample children, and impossible to uncover parental asset

and income information relevant to financial aid formulas at the potential date of college entry

for each sample child. One consistent feature of the aid formulas, however, allows us to infer a

major component of within-family aid variation from family structure alone. Both before and

after the 1992 reform, the EFC has been independent of the number of children a parent had in

college in a given year. Once the family’s “Adjusted Available Income” is determined based on

income and assets, the EFC comes from dividing it by the number of children in college in the

relevant academic year. This means there are large discontinuities in financial aid as a function

of number of siblings in college.

     Define COA as the cost of attending college for a given student, including tuition and fees,

room and board, books and travel expenses. The objective of federal aid, in cooperation with

most U.S. colleges, is to provide grants and loans that cover the cost of attendance after the

individual student’s expected family contribution is removed, COA – (AAI/# children in college).

This implies that for a lone student for whom COA > AAI, the amount of college costs not

covered by aid is decreased by AAI/2 dollars when another sibling attended college in the same

year. Depending on the size of the expected family contribution, this formula may create large

swings in individual siblings’ costs of college as family members age through the education

process and may be responsible for large differences in the costs of educating siblings within the

Monks (2004), and Wu (2006).


                                                      15
same family.

     We use the variation in college financial aid due to children’s birth spacing to proxy for

unobserved aid levels.20 The median year in which children in our HRS sample reach the age of

18 is 1977, with most being college age in the 1970s, 80s, and early 90s. The landmark 1965

reforms in higher education finance occurred after the vast majority of children in our sample

were born, so decisions about birth spacing were very unlikely to be affected by financial aid

considerations.

     A natural question to ask is whether sibling overlap is significantly, positively correlated

with financial aid. We cannot examine the relationship between sibling overlap and financial aid

using the HRS because it does not include information on financial aid. But we can examine the

relationship using the NLSY-97. To do this we regress the financial aid a student received in his

or her first term of college on a set of covariates, including parental income, parental income

squared, net worth, net worth squared, AFQT, AFQT squared, a constant, and a measure of

sibling overlap. We measure a point-in-time sibling overlap variable as the number of siblings

who are college age (ages 18 through 21) at the time financial aid is being measured for the child

in question.21 The sibling overlap variable does not require the sibling to be in college at the

time, since this information is not available in the HRS.22 The coefficient of the overlap variable

given in Appendix Table 2 is $358 and it is significant at the 5 percent level.23 This result, along


20
   Our use of child birth spacing is similar to the approaches taken by Kim (1999) and Monks (2004) to estimate the
savings effects of the asset tax implicit in the federal financial aid formula.
21
   We used the household and non-household rosters to construct information on respondents’ siblings (so that we
could get siblings living both in and out of the respondent’s home). Siblings are defined to be biological, half, step,
adoptive, or foster siblings. Our measure of financial aid includes the dollar amount of any grants, scholarships,
loans, work study, or other kinds of government/institutional aid a respondent received during his/her first term of
post-secondary schooling.
22
   Another reason the overlap proxy relies on potential and not actual overlap in college attendance is because
realized overlap or a siblings’ realized college attendance while the child is 18-21 would be mechanically related to
our outcome variable of interest, educational attainment.
23
   The mean financial aid for all NLSY-97 college students is slightly under $3,000.


                                                          16
with evidence from Liu and van der Klaauw (2007), adds to our confidence that the financial aid

proxy used in the HRS analyses does, in fact, capture financial aid differences within and across

families.

        Given that parental resources affect financial aid, families might want to declare their

children’s financial independence. The standards for independence, however, are strict. In order

to declare independence a student must (i) reach age 24 by January of the academic year, or (ii)

enroll in a graduate program, or (iii) be married, or (iv) have a dependent child or other

dependents, or (v) be an orphan or ward of the court, or (vi) be a veteran of the U.S. Armed

Forces (IFAP 2006). Thus a child under age 24, whose parents decide not to make the expected

family contribution, will need to cut back their schooling, work while in college, stretch out the

time they are in college, or find some other way to adapt. As discussed earlier, all these

adaptations lower the net returns to schooling so, as argued in Appendix 2, the implications of

the model still hold.

c. Estimation samples and covariates

        Our sample selection criteria include the requirement that we observe parents’ household

income and net worth and complete information on the education, date of birth, and relationship

to the family of each child reported by the HRS respondent. We also require that children

included in the estimation have at least one sibling. Finally, we include only children aged 24 or

older (in 2000) in our estimation sample. The intention of this restriction is to allow the sample

children time to complete their schooling, and to consider only cash transfers that take place

following completion of the children’s’ schooling.24 This leaves us with a sample of 34,593

children from 9,471 HRS families.

        Our empirical models include child variables that allow us to condition on factors that may
24
     The qualitative results are similar if we require sample children to be aged 30 or older in 2000.


                                                             17
influence the schooling attained by a young adult student, particularly relative to his or her

siblings. These include the child’s age in 2000, the child’s gender, indicators for whether the

child is an oldest or youngest child, and a cumulative measure of sibling-years of overlap for a

college-age child. Specifically, the child’s sibling-years of overlap is the sum of the number of

siblings the child had between the ages of 18 and 21 while he or she was 18, plus the number of

siblings aged 18-21 while he or she was 19, and so on, until the child is age 21.25

     Table 1 gives descriptive information for these variables for both the full HRS analysis

sample and for the Wave 2, Module 7 respondents. Forty-nine percent of core sample children

have parents who made positive cash transfers to them or to a sibling between 1998 and 2004,

and 37 percent of the children of module respondents have parents who ever made substantial

non-educational transfers to their adult children.26 These variables allow us to split samples

based on post-schooling transfers as suggested by the analytic model. Roughly half of each

sample is female. The median child age in 2000 is 41 for both samples. Birth order indicators

tell us that 29 (26) percent of core (module) sample children are oldest siblings, 26 (24) percent

youngest, and 45 (50) percent are middle siblings. We exclude any variables that were likely

determined after the completion of the child’s schooling, such as marital status or earnings in

2000.

     The dependent variable in our primary empirical specification is the child’s education. Core

sample children have attained a mean of 13.8 and a median of 13.0 years of schooling (it is 13.3

and 12.0 in the module sample). The large sample and broad range of ages give us a standard

25
   Triplets, for example, each have eight sibling-years of overlap in college ages. A child with two siblings who are
three and six years younger, respectively, has one sibling-year of overlap in college ages. The middle child in this
family has two years of overlap, and the youngest child has one.
26
   Readers might expect that the fraction of the sample ever giving cash gifts would exceed the fraction of the
sample giving cash gifts between 1998 and 2004. Three factors make the 49 and 37 percent responses not
comparable. First, the Wave 2, Module 7 question refers to “substantial” gifts while the other question asks
specifically about gifts exceeding $500. Second, the Wave 2, Module 7 question is asked of a much narrower cohort
of households. Third, the core sample question includes gifts to grandchildren exceeding $500.


                                                         18
deviation of 6.88 years of schooling, despite the top-coding of schooling years to 17 for graduate

and professional education.27 The primary independent variable of interest is years of overlap

with siblings. Its mean and median are 2.34 and 2.00 in the core sample and 2.63 and 2.00 in the

module sample. There is substantial variation in sibling-years of overlap in both samples, with a

standard deviation for this variable of roughly 2.1 years in each.

III. The empirical model, results, and robustness

        Many factors likely influence the difference in schooling between two arbitrarily chosen,

unrelated students. Among other issues, parents may differ in their attitudes toward education

and the investments they make in their children. Heritable components of academic aptitude that

the students received from their parents might also differ. We would have a difficult time

controlling adequately for these between-family differences using the HRS data. To account for

time-invariant, within family characteristics, our empirical model includes a family-specific

effect:

                                         eis = ωi + X is β + γ ois + ε is ,                               (5)

where families are indexed by i = 1,…,N and siblings in family i by s = 1,..., Si .28 In this

expression eis represents the education of sibling s in family i, X is is a vector of exogenous

characteristics of sibling s in family i, and ois represents the number of years of overlap in

college ages that sibling s in family i shares with his or her siblings. The family fixed effect ωi

represents the unobservable contribution to educational attainment shared by the children of

family i.

        The main coefficient of interest is γ , the effect of the overlap variable (which proxies for


27
     The youngest children in the sample are 24. The oldest 1.8 percent of children have reached retirement age.
28
     The number of siblings varies from 2 to 11 across families, creating an unbalanced panel.


                                                             19
financial aid) on children’s total schooling. Recall that our model suggests that γ will be

positive and significant for children whose parents make no subsequent gifts ( g 2 = 0 ), but γ will

be insignificant for children whose parents do make subsequent gifts to children ( g 2 > 0 ). With

fixed effects, of course, γ is identified by comparing the educational attainment of children

within the same family. For example, in a three child family in which the first child is born three

years before the second child and five years before the third child, we are asking whether the

closely spaced younger siblings obtain more schooling than the older sibling. To the extent that

family background characteristics are identical among siblings, the family fixed effect estimates

hold them constant.

     Table 2 reports estimates for the gift and no-gift subsamples using the full HRS sample and

the special question asked of Wave 2, Module 7 respondents. We find a coefficient on overlap

of 0.105 in the no-gift, full HRS sample, which is significantly different from zero at the one

percent level. The corresponding coefficient in the gift, full HRS sample is 0.034. The estimate

is not significantly different from zero at standard confidence levels. A similar pattern emerges

in the results using the Wave 2, Module 7 sample. The coefficient on overlap in the no-gift

sample is 0.094 and differs significantly from zero at the one percent level. The coefficient on

overlap in the gift sample is -0.050 and is insignificant.29

     Other coefficients in Table 2 reflect the correlations between children’s demographic

characteristics at the time of schooling decisions and their educational attainment. Brothers get

less schooling than their sisters on average, and this effect is significant at the five percent level

in two of the samples. The implied difference in schooling between brothers and sisters on


29
  In simultaneous estimation of all group-specific coefficients for the gift and no gift samples, F-tests reject the null
hypotheses that the gift and no gift overlap coefficients are the same for the full and module samples at the ten and
six percent levels, respectively.


                                                           20
average is a third of a year or less. Controlling for birth order, older siblings get significantly

less schooling than younger ones in both no-gift samples; one year more of age is associated with

5 hundredths of a year of school in the two samples. Oldest children receive more education

than their middle-child siblings on average, though the estimated coefficient on the oldest child

indicator is significantly different from zero for only one of the four samples. There is no clear

pattern in the level of schooling of youngest children relative to those of middle children.

        Before describing our robustness checks, we briefly mention two less far-reaching

specification and sampling alternatives.30 First, we recognize the coefficient estimates on

gender, age, and youngest and oldest child indicators vary across samples in magnitude and

significance. Specifications where we exclude all within-family covariates except the family

effect and the overlap measure also yield a positive and highly significant overlap coefficient for

the no gift group and a small, insignificant overlap coefficient for the gift group. So the key

result in Table 2 is not sensitive to the inclusion of covariates. It also does not depend on

whether or not step-children are included in the sample. Several authors have noted that parent-

child behavior and outcomes can differ for stepchildren relative to biological children of either

parent.31 We repeated the central estimation shown in Table 2 using only never married parents

and parents who were still married to their first spouses in 2000 in an effort to drop step families.

The results for the parameters of interest were very similar.

b. Estimation issues and sensitivity analyses with the HRS sample

        In the remainder of this section we describe six sampling or robustness checks that increase

our confidence that we are interpreting the empirical results sensibly. While we elaborate on

each in greater detail below, we can roughly break the discussion into a) who is being affected –

here we make sure the affected groups are, in fact, children who could plausibly be affected by

financial aid; and b) is it something else – here we try to rule out spurious explanations for the

results.

1. Who is being affected? The distributional effects of financial aid policy

     There are nonlinearities in the financial aid system that we do not account for in the

equation (5) empirical model. In particular, the children of very wealthy parents should expect

no federal financial aid whether or not they have siblings in college (also see Monks, 2004).

Similarly, federal aid formulas provide approximately full support to the children of very poor

parents, and therefore educational achievement should be unrelated to sibling overlap. Thus,

even in the no-gift subsample, we would expect years of schooling to be unresponsive to sibling

overlap for children in low-income families, because they receive full financial aid, and for

children in high wealth families, because there will be no differences in schooling costs across

children (within a family) due to financial aid considerations.

     We do not know the parent’s financial circumstance at the time their children were in

school. So, to address the concern about non-linearities, we repeat the initial estimation, but this

time estimate separate overlap coefficients for each parental net worth tercile. If the findings in

Table 2 are indeed driven by financial aid effects, and not some other feature of birth spacing,

then overlap should not matter for any tercile of the gift sample and it should be strongest for the

middle tercile of the no-gift sample.

     Estimates are given in Table 3 using the full HRS sample and a sample based on the special

question asked of Wave 2, Module 7 respondents. The estimated overlap coefficients are small

and not significantly different from zero for each of the net worth terciles of both gift samples.

In the no gift samples, we find small, insignificant overlap coefficients for the poorest and




                                                 22
wealthiest terciles. However, the significant (at conventional level) point estimates on sibling

overlap are 0.189 for the middle tercile of the full HRS sample and 0.197 for the much smaller

special module sample. F-tests reject the null hypotheses that the middle tercile coefficient is

equal to the high and low tercile coefficients at the five and ten percent levels, respectively in the

full sample (but only rejects the equality of the middle and high coefficients in the smaller

module sample).

        Though we have no way of knowing whether the net worth tercile categorization

appropriately reflects the parental income and wealth regions where financial aid is either

complete or zero, we nevertheless expect that the aid received by middle wealth children varied

most in response to sibling years of overlap. The evidence that the effect of sibling overlap on

educational attainment occurs for middle wealth families in two samples is encouraging, given

the structure of financial aid policy.

2. Who is being affected? Historical changes in financial aid policy

        Financial aid to middle and higher income families increased substantially in 1978 as a

result of the Middle Income Student Assistance Act (MISAA). Before the MISAA, the Pell

Grant and Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) family income caps were $15,000 and $25,000,

respectively. The U.S. median household income in 1978 was $15,064. The MISAA extended

both types of aid to children of families with higher incomes, and was followed by a tripling in

the number of GSL program loans over 3 academic years.32

        With more aid available for middle-income children as a consequence of the MISAA, we

expect the main beneficial effects on attendance to occur for those children who now have

greater access to aid, but whose parents, for one reason or another, were not fully committed to

paying for college. In the context of the Table 3 empirical specification, we expect the
32
     Detail on the short-run effects of this and other aid reforms can be found in Baum (1986).


                                                           23
interaction of overlap and the middle wealth tercile to be larger (while still positive and

significant) following the MISAA than before enactment of the MISAA. We further expect the

MISAA to have no beneficial effects on attendance for the g 2 > 0 subsample (though parents

presumably benefit from inframarginal subsidies).

     We split the sample into a pre-reform subsample that includes only students who reached

age 18 in 1978 or before, prior to the bill passage and expansion in aid. The post-reform

subsample includes only students who reached age 18 in 1979 or later, after the aid expansion.

Estimates for the Table 3 empirical model, pre- and post-reform, are given in Table 4.

     As expected, the coefficient for the overlap by middle wealth tercile interaction is precisely

estimated and larger – nearly twice the size – in the post-reform subsample as in the pre-reform

subsample. Hence the expansion of aid to families above the median income following the

MISAA is accompanied by a shift in the estimated association between the aid proxy and

attainment of children in middle wealth families.33

     As in the previous specification, the overlap by high-wealth interaction is insignificant in

both groups both pre- and post-reform. In addition, five of six coefficients in the g 2 > 0

subsample are insignificant, as expected. We find two unexpected results in Table 4, both

occurring for the pre-reform sample for the overlap-by-lowest-wealth-tercile coefficients. The

positive, significant coefficient for the low-wealth, pre-reform subsample might suggest that aid

was scarce even for low-wealth (and income) children, so having a closely spaced sibling

enhanced the ability to finance college relative to observationally similar children without a

closely spaced sibling. But this explanation is hard to reconcile with a negative significant

coefficient for closely spaced siblings in families who made post-college gifts.

33
  The coefficients also reflect the fact discussed by Kane (2006) and Belley and Lochner (2007) and others that the
real cost of college has risen sharply while federal financial aid has not kept pace.


                                                        24
3. Who is being affected? The attainment margin should be related to college

     Many children in our samples were born in the late 1940s and 1950s. A high school degree

for this cohort was less common than it is today. Our preferred interpretation of our results

would clearly be wrong if the margin through which education increases for closely-spaced

children in the no-gift sample is that they were more likely to get to 11th grade rather than 10th

grade. Put differently, college financial aid should have its primary influence on college

enrollment and attainment.

     When we exclude high school dropouts, we get similar results for the association between

overlap and educational attainment, with the exception that the positive, significant overlap

coefficient in the no-gift sample is substantially larger.34 As in Kling (2001), we find that the

response to our schooling cost measure is greatest at the college entry margin.

4: Is it something else? Random effects

     Our family fixed effect estimates have the potential drawback that siblings in two-child

families have identical years of overlap, so the central overlap coefficient is identified only from

families with three or more children. Even the most casual observation will confirm that cross-

family differences are enormously important in explaining educational attainment. Random

effects specifications allow us to identify the overlap coefficient using families with two or more

children, at the cost of assuming that family effects are independent of the regressors.

     The random effect estimates from the full HRS sample are presented in Table 5. The results

are consistent with the fixed effect results in Table 2. The overlap coefficient is 0.071 and

significant in the “no gift” sample, and 0.034 and insignificant in the “gift” sample. Like others,

we find that parental education is strongly correlated with educational achievement in both


34
  Moreover, overlap is insignificant in the g 2 > 0 and g 2 = 0 samples if both are restricted to those children with
high school or less education.

subsamples.35

5: Is it something else? Ability and birth spacing

     We do not have an ability measure in the HRS. This is one of the reasons why a within-

family (fixed effect) specification is useful, since it accounts for time-invariant, family-specific

ability differences that might arise from the home environment. Nevertheless, there are

obviously ability differences between children within a family. If closely spaced children have

significantly different ability than children with greater birth spacing, our HRS-based estimates

might be biased. For this bias to explain most or all of the results, it must be the case that the

ability levels of closely spaced children exceed the ability levels of children spaced apart in

families where there are no post-schooling transfers (constrained families, or families with

g 2 = 0 ), and this ability differential with birth spacing does not occur in unconstrained ( g 2 > 0 )

families. If families with closely spaced kids are resource-constrained over their life-cycle,

either in the time or the money they are able to allocate to closely-spaced siblings, it seems

unlikely the constrained subset have higher ability children relative to others, at least in an

economically important magnitude.

     We can shed a little further light on this potential explanation using data from the NLSY-97:

in particular, we look at whether sibling overlap is correlated with AFQT. In Appendix Table 3

we show the result of regressing AFQT on sibling overlap and covariates that we expect to be

correlated with AFQT, including mother’s education, parental income, parental income squared,

indicator variables for the number of siblings, female, black, Hispanic, broken home, living in an

urban area, and living in the South. Sibling overlap is significantly correlated with AFQT, but

the relationship is negative, and the empirical magnitude is -0.51, while the standard deviation of

35
 Parental education is measured for the HRS family respondent. Most but not all family respondents are mothers.
We chose to do this in order to retain families in which only the mother or only the father is represented in the HRS.


                                                         26
AFQT is 29.2 in the sample. Hence, we find it implausible that unobserved ability accounts for

the empirical patterns we document in the HRS data.

6: Is it something else? The role of altruism

    Underlying family characteristics – parental resources, the shape of the human capital

production function, and altruism – will determine the region of the parent-child equilibrium.

One unusual feature of the HRS is that it includes, for a small subsample, self-reported measures

of parents’ financial generosity toward their children. Wave 5 of the HRS from 2000 contains an

Economic Altruism Module where parents were asked

       “Suppose that [your child/one of your children] had only half/three-quarters/one-third as
       much income per person to live on as you do. Would you be willing to give your child
       5% of your own family income per month, to help out until things changed – which
       might be several years?”

Our analytic model shows that post-college giving will be more common among parents with

higher α values. If the responses to the special HRS module question are informative about α ,

we expect financial aid to have a smaller effect on the educational attainment of children with

high- α parents than those with low- α parents.

    914 parents (with 3,292 children) responded to this question and have complete information

on other covariates included in our empirical model. Only 3 percent of children had parents who

said they would give at 1/3 but not above. So we pool the 1/3 respondents with those who

indicate that they would not give 5 percent of their income under any of the scenarios.

    We estimate the empirical model given in (5), modified so that

                                                   3
                             eis = ωi + X is β + ∑ γ j m j ois + ε is ,   (6)
                                                   j =1



where indicators m1 = 1 if the parent gives under no circumstances or only when the child’s

income is 1/3 of hers (12 percent of the sample), m2 = 1 if the parent gives when the child’s



                                                       27
income is ½ of hers but not when it is ¾ (26 percent of the sample), and m3 = 1 if the parent gives

when the child’s income is ¾ of hers (62 percent of the sample).

     The estimates are presented in Table 6. The overlap coefficient is insignificant (with a t-

statistic below one) for the most altruistic families: those who will give 5 percent of their

income when their child’s person-adjusted income is ¾ of theirs. The overlap coefficient is

large, positive and highly significant for each of the less generous parent categories. F-tests fail

to reject the null hypothesis that γ 1 = γ 2 but strongly reject the null that γ 1 = γ 2 = γ 3 . To the

extent that high self-reported generosity is predictive of the giving equilibrium, these results also

align with the model and our previous results in that financial aid is inframarginal for children of

the most altruistic parents but that it matters for the children of other parents.

7. Summing up

     We develop an analytic model that tells us precisely how to approach the data to examine

whether borrowing constraints affect education decisions. The key issue is whether parents meet

their expected family contribution. Children whose parents do not will have a harder time

financing college than will other children. Issues may arise with any single specification we

examine. But we have not been able to come up with a coherent alternative explanation to

borrowing constraints for the empirical patterns we have documented. Specifically, close birth

spacing is a strong predictor of college financial aid. Among the children of a parent who makes

no post-schooling transfers, siblings with closer birth dates complete more education than their

siblings with more isolated birth dates. Birth spacing does not matter for families making post-

college transfers. The effects only appear for middle-wealth families who would be expected to

not receive complete financial aid or no financial aid. The effects are larger during periods when

more financial aid is available. Similar results arise when the sample is split based on an



                                                     28
experimental proxy for parental altruism: Birth spacing has no effect on educational attainment

of children with the most altruistic parents while spacing is significant for children with less

altruistic parents. We think the evidence, taken together, supports the implications of the model

where strategic concerns result in some parents investing less than the efficient level in their

children’s education.

    Kane (2006) surveys the extensive literature documenting the fact that college attendance is

responsive to changes in financial aid. To a certain extent this is the expected response to “price

effects,” namely, that financial aid makes education less expensive, so more of it is purchased.

In the notation of our framework, recall that the marginal condition dictating the optimal choice

of education is given by h’(e)=R. If prices are all that matters, financial aid makes e cheaper,

whether through loans or grants, and hence it must rise in equilibrium. Why do our results not

simply reflect the fact that education decisions respond to price? There are two reasons.

    First, most loans come with a cap on borrowing. Suppose for example that the optimal

investment is around $15,000 for a child. Federal loans will rarely subsidize this entire amount.

If a smaller amount is borrowed at a lower interest rate, the marginal condition remains

unaffected. So long as the parent or the child is contributing at least a dollar to the child’s

education, the marginal dollar is subject to the market interest rate and not the lower, subsidized

rate. Since almost all of our families contribute a positive amount to their children’s education,

this increases our confidence that the loans are infra-marginal for the families that are

intergenerationally unconstrained to begin with.

    Second, our results are quite specific: we see that closely spaced children in families in the

middle wealth tercile get more education than their siblings spaced farther apart, but only in

families that make post-college transfers. Families in the g 2 > 0 sample also receive greater




                                                  29
financial aid when their children are closely spaced. Yet there is no evidence that closely spaced

siblings in these families get more education than their siblings spaced further apart, either in

aggregate or in any wealth tercile. Finding effects in the g 2 = 0 sample but no significant effects

in the g 2 > 0 sample is consistent with the implications resulting from our analytic framework.

If price effects are driving the empirical patterns in the data, it is not clear why they would be

present in only one of the six distinct wealth tercile groups that we examine.

IV. Conclusions

    A student’s federal assistance for college is determined based on their parents’ presumed

ability to pay, and standards for financial independence from parents are stringent. Parents are

under no legal obligation to meet their expected contribution as specified in federal financial aid

formulas. If parents refuse to pay, children may face financial constraints in attending college.

According to their parents, a third of all children in the Health and Retirement Study who got

some post-secondary education did so without their parents’ financial assistance. This fact is not

solely a consequence of need-based financial aid differences. A quarter of children whose

parents held $200,000-$400,000 in net worth in 2000 attended college without parental support,

as did 16 percent of those whose parents’ net worth exceeded $400,000. The scope for some

students having financial difficulty in attending college appears quantitatively important.

    Given this fact, we present a theory of efficient human capital investment, focusing on the

roles of parent and child decisions and financial aid. The theory implies that financial aid

increases the educational attainment of intergenerationally constrained children who receive no

post-schooling gifts from their parents, but financial aid does not matter to the attainment of

intergenerationally unconstrained children. These effects each rely on an asymmetry in the

access of parents and their college-aged children to credit.



                                                 30
    Estimates using data from the HRS support the model’s predictions. Based on an

idiosyncrasy in the dependence of U.S. financial aid on the number of children a parent has in

college, we use years of overlap with college-age siblings as a proxy for financial aid. We find

the educational attainment of children whose parents are not observed to make post-schooling

cash gifts is affected by financial aid. The educational attainment of children whose parents do

make gifts is not affected by financial aid. These results, along with a series of specification and

robustness tests, suggest that parents can relieve educational borrowing constraints for their

children, but that they do not always choose to do so. The results further indicate that parents

and children make distinct choices regarding children’s schooling, and that these choices may

well be consequential for financial aid policy.

    To provide some perspective on magnitudes of our results, the coefficient on overlap for the

no gift group drawn from the full HRS sample in Table 2, for example, indicates that a college

student with no siblings in college (during all four years) attains almost one semester less

schooling than a student who has one sibling in college for each of the four years, all else equal.

If we assume that first term aid behaves similarly to aid in other college terms, and that a degree

is earned by NLSY-97 cohort students in 8 semesters (or 15 quarters), then the NLSY-97

Appendix Table 2 estimates imply that the child with one sibling in school in each term can

expect, on average, $2,864-$5,370 more financial aid than the only child over the course of a

bachelor’s degree. Put differently, that amount of financial aid would result in nearly one

semester more educational attainment, assuming that the relationship of aid to birth spacing is

similar for NLSY-97 children and children of HRS respondents.

    A large, insightful prior literature documents empirical relationships that authors interpret as

being consistent with educational borrowing constraints (see, for example, Manski and Wise,




                                                  31
1983; Hauser, 1993; Kane, 1994; Card, 1999; Kane and Rouse, 1999; Ellwood and Kane, 2000;

Keane and Wolpin, 2001; Rothstein and Rouse, 2007; and, at least in data from the National

Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort, Belley and Lochner, 2007). The same can be said

for the papers that argue that U.S. educational credit markets are nearly complete by Cameron

and Heckman (1998, 2001), Shea (2000), Carneiro and Heckman (2002), Cameron and Taber

(2004), and Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2008).36

     Our paper does not resolve this tension in the literature. But by modeling explicitly how the

interactions between parents and children may rationally lead to credit constraints for college, it

offers a new perspective on the nature of credit constraints. Our framework also suggests that

research strategies that attempt to investigate the importance of credit constraints by examining

the income gradient of college attendance or of educational attainment will be difficult to

interpret.

     In our model, holding all else equal, educational attainment will vary inversely with parental

resources for those intergenerationally constrained families where parents contribute nothing to

their children’s education. The explanation comes directly from financial aid rules. As parents’

resources increase, the expected family contribution (EFC) increases. If children have parents

who refuse or are unable to meet the EFC, the larger the unmet EFC, the more difficulty the child

will have in financing college. For low-income families who get full financial aid, educational

attainment will be non-decreasing with parental resources. Of course other factors, some likely

unobserved, may lead to a positive correlation between parental income and educational

attainment. The relationship between parental income and their children’s educational

attainment will be difficult to interpret in empirical studies that mix families willing to meet and


36
  Carneiro and Heckman (2002) find that up to 8 percent of the relevant U.S. population may be short-run credit
constrained.


                                                        32
unwilling to meet their expected family contribution

    Our results provide evidence that the inability to borrow against future earnings affects the

educational attainment of a set of children living in families where parents, for one reason or

another, are unwilling or unable to meet their expected family contribution. Increases in

financial aid for these children would increase educational attainment. At the same time, greater

financial aid would likely reduce contributions made by families currently meeting (or

exceeding) their expected family contribution. So policy-makers will need to grapple with this

tradeoff – providing marginal subsidies for borrowing constrained students against infra-

marginal subsidies to families willing to support their children’s educational goals. Our evidence

suggests that financial aid increases can increase educational attainment, though clearly at a cost

that exceeds a perfectly targeted policy.

Lemma 1: If g 2 > 0 in equilibrium, then it must be the case that a k = 0 .

The intuition behind lemma 1 is that, since both the parent and the child earn return R on
physical capital investment, the parent who anticipates a positive second period gift will always
prefer to save for the child. A formal proof of lemma 1 is available from the authors.

Lemma 2: In the first period, the parent can do no better than to choose ( g1 , a p , e p ) to
                                                                  }
maximize {u (c1p ) + β u (c2p ) +α ( u ( g1 ) + β u (c2k ) ) subject to
c1p + a p + e p + g1 = x p , c2p = Ra p − g 2 ( Ra p , h(e p )) , c2k = h(e p ) + g 2 ( Ra p , h(e p )) , g 2 ( Ra p , h(e p ))
as in (1), and e k ≥ 0 and a k ≥ 0 binding for the child.
        Assume an equilibrium consisting of
         (e p , a p , g1 , e k , a k , g 2 ( Ra p , Ra k + h(e p + e k + τ )))
where e k + a k > 0 , and associated consumption levels
       {c1p , c2p , c1k , c2k } = {x p − g1 − e p − a p , Ra p − g 2 ( Ra p , Ra k + h(e p + e k + τ )),
                          g1 − e k − a k , Ra k + h(e p + e k + τ ) + g 2 ( Ra p , Ra k + h(e p + e k + τ ))}.
We find that the parent can replicate the consumption paths of any such equilibrium by deviating
from the equilibrium in period 1 to choose first period transfer g1 = g1 − a k − e k , savings
a = a p + a k and human capital investment e = e p + e k . In the deviation, constraints e k ≥ 0
  p                                                   p


and a k ≥ 0 bind for the child. This implies that the parent can replicate any feasible consumption
path by choosing ( g1 , a p , e p ) in the first period such that e k ≥ 0 and a k ≥ 0 bind. Therefore the
parent can do no better than to choose her most preferred period 1 ( g1 , a p , e p ) subject to e k ≥ 0
and a k ≥ 0 binding for the child. A formal proof of lemma 2 is available from the authors.

Proof of Proposition 1:

           and e k ≥ 0 and a k ≥ 0 binding for the child.




                                                                   37
Recall that the requirement that condition (7) holds is equivalent to the requirement that e k ≥ 0
and a k ≥ 0 bind. Suppose that the parent is permitted to choose g 2 such that
u′( Ra p − g 2 ) = α u ′(h(e p + τ ) + g 2 ) , even if this implies g 2 < 0 . Without imposing (7), the
parent’s choice of ( g1 , a p , e p ) meets conditions
         u ′(c1p ) = α u ′( g1 ), u ′(c1p ) = β Ru ′(c2p ), h′(e p + τ ) = R, u ′(c2p ) = α u′(c2k ),
                                                                                                  (9)
         where c1p = x p − g1 − e p − a p , c2p = Ra p − g 2 , and c2k = h(e p + τ ) + g 2 .
                                                                                      ∂g 2
Conditions (9) imply u′(c1k ) = β Ru ′(c2k ) . In transfer expression (1),                      ≤ 0 . Given
                                                                                ∂ (h(e p + τ ))
h′(e p + τ ) = R in (9), it must be the case that
         u ′( g1 ) = β Ru ′(c2k )
                                             ⎛      ∂g 2     ⎞
        ⇒ u ′( g1 ) ≥ β max{h′(e p + τ ), R} ⎜1 +            ⎟ u′(c2 )
                                                                   k

                                             ⎝ ∂ (h(e + τ )) ⎠
                                                      p


and therefore (7) is satisfied at the parent’s preferred feasible ( g1 , a p , e p ) . Conditions (9) are met
by a unique set of consumption levels {c1p , c2p , c1k = g1 , c2k } . If conditions (9) can be met with
g 2 ≥ 0 , then these consumption levels result from the parent’s optimal actions given her resource
constraints and the choices available to the child.

However, it is possible that conditions (9) cannot be met with g 2 ≥ 0 . Where g 2 ≥ 0 binds for
the parent, the solution to (8) is such that
        u′(c1p ) = α u ′( g1 ), u ′(c1p ) = β Ru ′(c2p ), h′(e p + τ ) > R, u ′(c2p ) > α u′(c2k ),
         u′( g1 ) = β h′(e p + τ )u′(c2k ),                                                             (10)
       where c1p = x p − g1 − e p − a p , c2p = Ra p , and c2k = h(e p + τ ).
                                                                          ∂g 2
Note that h′(e p + τ ) > R , u′( g1 ) = β h′(e p + τ )u′(c2k ) , and                 ≤ 0 together imply
                                                                     ∂ (h(e p + τ ))
       u ′( g1 ) = β h′(e p + τ )u ′(c2k )
                                        ⎛          ∂g 2         ⎞
               ≥ β max{h′(e p + τ ), R} ⎜1 +                    ⎟ u ′(c2 ),
                                                                       k

                                        ⎝ ∂ (h(e + τ )) ⎠
                                                     p


so that again (7) need not be imposed. Like conditions (9), conditions (10) are satisfied by a
unique set of consumption levels {c1p , c2p , c1k = g1 , c2k } . In either case, Lemma 2 implies that the
parent’s lifetime welfare at this consumption vector, u (c1p ) + β u (c2p ) + α ( u (c1k ) + β u (c2k ) ) ,
represents the maximum equilibrium welfare available to the parent given the resource
constraints and the child’s available choices. The uniqueness of the consumption levels that solve
(8) implies that no other set of feasible consumption levels yields higher welfare for the parent,
and therefore {c1p , c2p , c1k , c2k } represents the family’s unique equilibrium consumption,
completing the proof of (i).




                                                             38
We know, based on (9) and (10), that {c1p , c2p , c1k , c2k } can be generated by only one set of parental
choices {g1 , a p , e p , g 2 } at which ek ≥ 0 and a k ≥ 0 bind . It may still be the case, however, that
this same consumption path can be supported by different transfers and investments where
e k and a k take positive values. Define {c1p (0), c2p (0), c1k (0), c2k (0), g1 (0), a p (0), e p (0), g 2 (0)} as
the values of {c1p , c2p , c1k , c2k , g1 , a p , e p , g 2 } in the only equilibrium in which ek + a k = 0 . The
parent transfers to the child through g1 (0) , e p (0) , and g 2 (0) . We seek to determine whether the
same consumption is supported when the parent transfers some portion of g 2 (0) or e p (0)
through g1 , expecting the child to save for herself or invest in her own education.
When g 2 (0) > 0 , the answer is clear. The child’s choices of e k and a k meet condition (2) where
ek + a k > 0 . Whenever g 2 (0) > 0 , (1), (2), and h′(e p ) = R together imply u′(c1k ) < β Ru ′(c2k ) .
However, among conditions (9) is the requirement that u′(c1k ) = β Ru ′(c2k ) . Thus whenever
g 2 (0) > 0 , the parent and the child disagree on the child’s optimal intertemporal consumption
path. Allowing the child to save independently or invest in her own education will lead to
consumption other than {c1p (0), c2p (0), c1k (0), c2k (0)} . Thus the e k + a k = 0 equilibrium is the only
set of actions that supports the parent’s preferred {c1p , c2p , c1k , c2k } . The parent chooses
{g1 , a p , e p , g 2 } = {g1 (0), a p (0), e p (0), g 2 (0)} as in (3) in this unique equilibrium, imposing
e k + a k = 0 and h′(e p + τ ) = R . This completes the proof of (ii).

When g 2 (0) = 0 , however, the parent may reallocate transfers and still achieve
{c1p (0), c2p (0), c1k (0), c2k (0)} . Only the reallocation of e p to g1 must be considered. Define e such
that u′( Ra p (0)) = α u′(h(e + τ )) . Suppose that the parent increases g1 to g1 = g1 (0) + ε , where
ε ∈ ( 0, e p (0) − e ⎤⎦ , while maintaining a p = a p (0) and g1 + e p = g1 (0) + e p (0) . Since e p ≥ e , the
second period transfer is still zero. Further, the child’s choice of e k = 0 given
( g1 (0), a p (0), e p (0) ) implies that she chooses an ek at which e p + ek ≤ e p (0) given
( g (0) + ε , a
   1
                  p
                      (0), e p (0) − ε ) . Therefore, by conditions (10), h′(e p + ek + τ ) > R and the child’s
condition (2) determining her choice of e k reduces to
        u′(c1k ) = β h′(e p + ek + τ )u′(c2k ).

Since the above agrees with the intertemporal condition on the child’s consumption in (10), we
see that the parent’s reallocation of ε ∈ ( 0, e p (0) − e ⎦⎤ from e p to g1 results in the same
equilibrium {c1p (0), c2p (0), c1k (0), c2k (0)} . Finally, condition (2) and the definition of e together
indicate that where p reallocates ε ∈ ( e p (0) − e, e p (0) ⎤⎦ from e p to g1 the child’s educational
investment may or may not be such that conditions (10) hold. Therefore where g 2 (0) = 0 there
does exist a continuum of equilibria
{g1 , a p , e p , a k , ek } ∈ ⎡⎣{g1 (0), a p (0), e p (0), 0, 0}, {g1 (0) + e p (0) − e, a p (0), e, 0, e p (0) − e}⎤⎦ that


                                                              39
support the unique equilibrium values of {c1p , c2p , c1k , c2k } , and there may exist further equilibria
{g1 , a p , e p , a k , ek } ∈ ⎡⎣{g1 (0) + e p (0) − e, a p (0), e, 0, e p (0) − e}, {g1 (0) + e p (0), a p (0), 0, 0, e p (0)}⎤⎦
that support the unique equilibrium values of {c1p , c2p , c1k , c2k } . Each possible equilibrium satisfies
(10) and therefore implies h′(e p + ek + τ ) > R , completing the proof of (iii).

Proof of Proposition 2: In the g 2 > 0 equilibrium,
          h′(e p + e k + τ ) = R
          ⇒ e p + e k = h′−1 ( R) − τ .
                                                               ∂ (e p + e k )
Since h′ ( R) is a fixed and exogenous level of investment,
           −1
                                                                              = −1 and total
                                                                    ∂τ
educational investment is invariant to the child’s financial aid, completing the proof of (i).

The g 2 = 0 equilibrium requires only that h′(e p + ek + τ ) > R , and in it only G1 = g1 + e p is
                                                         ∂ (e p + e k )

                                                                        ≤ −1 . Then
                                                              ∂τ

Appendix B: An Economic Environment with Greater Realism

In this appendix we extend the baseline model, allowing uncertain earnings and the child to
borrow at a higher interest rate than the parent, and we explicitly model the human capital
production function of the child, which allows us to model a child’s decision to work while in
college. We show the central result from our simple model in the text holds: financial aid will
have a larger effect on the educational attainment of children from families that do not make
financial transfers in the second period ( g 2 = 0 families) compared to children from families that
do make second period transfers ( g 2 > 0 families). Since we now consider a stochastic version
of the model, we can no longer say that all children in the g 2 = 0 sample will be constrained in
their human capital investment decisions. Instead, we show these children are significantly more
likely to under-invest in their human capital than children in the g 2 > 0 sample.

We start by assuming the child faces uncertainty in future earnings. The child solves

                                            {                                        }
                                      max u (c1k , l1k ) + β ∫ u (c2k , l2k )d Θ(θ ) ,
subject to
                                         c1k + a k + e k = g1 + w(1 − l1k − n k ),
and
                         c2k = R(a k ) + θ w(1 − l2k )h(n k , e p + e k + τ ) + g 2 ,
where the function R is given by
                                                ⎧⎪ Ra k , if a k ≥ 0

                                                                       .

We assume that the rate at which children can borrow R ' exceeds the market rate of return R .

In the above formulation, l stands for leisure, n denotes time spent in college, w stands for the
wage rate, and θ denotes uncertainty in labor earnings. While the child experiences the same
rate of return to savings, R , as does the parent, the cost of borrowing against his or her own
future earnings is higher and is denoted by R ' . We assume that the distribution from which
shocks are drawn is the same for all levels of human capital.37

The parent cares about the child, so the parent’s decision problem is given by



                                {                                                                 }
                          max v(c1p ) + v(c2p ) + α ⎡⎣u (c1k , l1k ) + β ∫ u (c2k , l2k )d Θ(θ ) ⎤⎦

subject to
                                                c1p + a p + e p + g1 = x p

37
   If we assumed highly educated households face less uncertainty about their future earnings, we would be more
likely to find that parents who do not follow up with post-schooling gifts under-invest in their children’s education.


                                                             41
and
                                                      c2p + g 2 = Ra p

The model is now substantially more complicated than before – there are many more choice
variables, and uncertainty in earnings breaks the one-for-one link between efficient investment in
human capital and second period cash gifts. Hence, this economic environment needs to be
solved numerically.

Parameterization

We assume that children’s preferences are Cobb-Douglas between consumption and leisure,
                            1−θ
                 ⎡cη l1−η ⎤
i.e. u (c, l ) = ⎣        ⎦ where 0 < η < 1 determines the relative taste for consumption versus
                    1−θ
leisure. Cobb-Douglas preferences are widely used in the macro literature, since they are
consistent with balanced growth, irrespective of the choice for θ . Moreover, this specification
implies non-separability between consumption and leisure, which is consistent with some
microeconomic empirical evidence (for example, Heckman, 1974). The parameter η can be
identified by the share of disposable time people devote to market work. A typical value for η is
 1
   . Our preferences imply that the parameter θ governs both the intertemporal elasticity of
 3
substitution for consumption and the corresponding elasticity for hours worked. In particular,
                                                                  1
the intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption is . A standard value for θ is 4.
                                                                         θ
The coefficient of relative risk aversion is then 1 − η + ηθ . Our parameters imply a risk aversion
coefficient of 2 and a Frisch labor supply elasticity of 1. We experiment with η between 0.1 and
0.5 and θ between 1 and 6. These cover the range of available estimates for the labor supply
elasticity and risk aversion.

Our human capital production function is parameterized as h(n, e) = znγ1 eγ 2 . Time and goods
inputs are combined with ability, z , to produce human capital. This specification follows the
pioneering work of Ben Porath (1967). There are numerous papers that estimate the parameters
γ 1 and γ 2 . A prominent set of estimates suggest that the returns to scale in the human capital
production function, γ = γ 1 + γ 2 are 0.9 or higher (see Browning, Hansen and Heckman, 1999).38
In our baseline parameterization we assume that γ = 0.9 and γ 2 = 0.3 . Finally, we assume that
 R equals 5 percent while R ' equals 10 percent. Here, we have in mind uncollaterized loans such
as credit card loans that typically come with an interest rate well above 10 percent. Higher
values of R ' would make our results stronger.




38
     If γ 2 = 0 , expenditures do not affect human capital production


                                                             42
The distribution of earnings after college is the result of two underlying sources of heterogeneity.
First, children are different on the basis of their ability before college. This reflects both innate
differences in children as well as differences in acquired human capital before college. Second,
earnings are also affected by luck shocks that the child realizes after completing college. Two
moments are used to parameterize the two distributions – the distribution of schooling and the
distribution of earnings. We obtain this information from the Health and Retirement Study.

Results

As we have noted several times, uncertainty breaks the tight link between the optimality (from
the child’s perspective) of first period education transfers and second period financial transfers.
Given this, our strategy is to split the sample into those who do give gifts and those who do not
and then examine whether families who do not pass on gifts are more likely to under-invest.

In the baseline specification of preferences, we find that 69 percent of families who do not pass
on gifts in the second period, under-invest in college education. In contrast, only 17 percent of
families who do end up with positive post-schooling cash transfers under-invest in their
children’s education.

It is instructive to examine the implications of two assumptions – the possibility of borrowing
while in college and work while in college. If we assume that work while in college is not
possible and that the child cannot borrow against future income, then fraction of households
(with zero gifts) that under-invest increases to 87 percent from 69 percent. This suggests that
while both these options relieve borrowing constraints, a substantial fraction of parents who do
not give gifts still have children who are unable to get the efficient level of education, even when
work and high-cost borrowing are available. As mentioned earlier, we also experiment with a
range of parameter values, allowing η to vary between 0.1 and 0.5 and θ to vary between 1 and
6. Then the fraction of households with zero gifts that under-invests ranges from 59 percent to
91 percent depending on parameter values, and this fraction is always substantially higher than
the group that does give gifts.

These results add to our confidence that the main implications of our simple model stand up to
further scrutiny. This is perhaps not all that surprising since the results depend on two
assumptions – parents are altruistic and human capital production is subject to diminishing
returns. The assumptions (along with optimizing behavior) will lead parents to equate the
marginal return to investing in education to the real financial market rate of return. Parents who
get to this margin will then give post-college gifts. Parents who do not, will be significantly less
likely to give post-college gifts.
