Recessions, Older Workers, and Longevity: How Long Are Recessions Good For Your Health?

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper examines the impact of exposure to higher unemployment rates in the pre-retirement years
on subsequent mortality. Although past research has found that recessions reduce contemporaneous
mortality, these short-term effects may reverse over time, particularly for older workers. If workers
experience an economic downturn in their late 50s, they may face several years of reduced employment
and earnings before “retiring” when they reach Social Security eligibility at age 62. They also may
experience lost health insurance, and therefore higher financial barriers to health care, through age
65, when Medicare becomes available. All of these experiences could contribute to weaker long-term
health outcomes. To examine these hypotheses, we use Vital Statistics mortality data between 1969
and 2008 to generate age-specific cohort survival probabilities at older ages. We then link these survival
probabilities to labor market conditions at earlier ages. We also use data from the 1980-2010 March
Current Population Surveys and the 1991-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys
to explore potential mechanisms for this health effect. Our results indicate that experiencing a recession
in one’s late 50s leads to a reduction in longevity. We also find that this exposure leads to several
years of reduced employment, health insurance coverage, and health care utilization which may contribute
to the lower long-term likelihood of survival.

I. INTRODUCTION

        The 2007-2009 recession and the lingering levels of high unemployment in the United States

afterwards are the worst since the Great Depression. One might imagine that Americans’ health

would be adversely affected by the downturn, given the income losses from unemployment. Yet an

extensive literature has shown that high unemployment rates are, perhaps counter-intuitively,

associated with improved health outcomes. Ruhm (2000) was the first to show that mortality rates

actually fall when the economy deteriorates.1 Others have confirmed this, including Stevens, et al.

(2011) who show that many age groups experience mortality declines during recessions, but that

these declines are concentrated among the older population. In this paper, we extend the existing

literature to explore the longer-term consequences of recessions, focusing on individuals who are

approaching retirement at the time the downturn begins.

        Individuals who are approaching retirement when a recession hits may be particularly likely

to suffer long-lasting negative consequences. These individuals may have considerable difficulty

finding new jobs if job training is viewed as a poor investment for older individuals given their

relatively short time horizon in the labor market or if there is discrimination against older workers in

the labor market (Lahey, 2008). This may lead to a long period without a job leading up to a

retirement that may not be voluntary. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (2012) found that

around one-third of unemployed workers over age 55 in 2010 and 2011 had been without a job for

over a year. Johnson and Butrica (2012) document that in the latest recession, older unemployed

workers were substantially less likely to be re-employed than their younger counterparts. Exploring

the link between labor market conditions and retirement over the past thirty years, Coile and Levine

(2011a and 2011b) show that recessions are associated with systematically increased rates of

1
 In contrast to this finding, Sullivan and von Wachter (2009) indicate that job displacement of long-tenured men
increases mortality in both the short and long-term. We describe this work in more detail subsequently.
                                                                   Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 2


retirement, particularly at exact age 62, when individuals first become eligible for Social Security

retirement benefits. They also provide suggestive evidence that subsequent retirement income may

be reduced for these groups, presumably because of the reduced Social Security benefits resulting

from early retirement.

       Compounding the effects of reduced employment and income, the employer-provided nature

of health insurance in the United States suggests that older individuals affected by the recession may

lose their health insurance as well. The potentially long duration of their unemployment spells means

that the period of lost coverage may be quite lengthy, for some lasting until Medicare eligibility at

age 65. The loss of health insurance, and any resulting reduction in health care utilization, could

pose a serious health risk for older workers, who often have chronic health problems and frequently

experience health shocks such as a heart attack or new cancer diagnosis (Coile, 2004).

       Taken as a whole, the lost income during unemployment and retirement, in addition to

decreased access to health insurance and health care in the years leading up to Medicare eligibility,

could plausibly have a negative long-term impact on health outcomes. In principle, these effects

could reverse the contemporaneous health gains that accompany a recession.

       The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of recessions on subsequent mortality,

focusing specifically on those workers approaching retirement age when the recession hits. We

closely follow the empirical strategy in much of the existing literature, using unemployment rates as

our key measure of recessions, and relying on variation across states and over time in the

unemployment rate to identify their impact. We begin our analysis by constructing state- and age-

specific survival rates between the ages of 55 and 79 from Vital Statistics Mortality data for a

number of birth cohorts. We use these data to trace out the impact of a higher unemployment rate at

each age on contemporaneous survival and on survival at subsequent ages. We go on to explore
                                                                    Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 3


plausible mechanisms that could generate long-term health effects, including employment, health

insurance, and health care losses, using data from the 1980 through 2010 March Current Population

Surveys (CPS) and the 1991 through 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

surveys.

       Our results indicate that for workers in their late 50s and through age 61, any short-term

positive health benefits associated with a recession are temporary and, ultimately, are more than

offset by subsequent health deterioration. Interestingly, this pattern is not present for cohorts that

face recessions starting at age 62, the age of early entitlement to Social Security. We also find that a

recession leads to lengthy periods of unemployment and to financial barriers to health care due to

lower rates of health insurance coverage, lasting through the ages of early entitlement to Social

Security and Medicare eligibility, respectively. Our results suggest that these programs might buffer

the long-term negative health consequences of recessions. Although we cannot definitively

determine that reduced employment, insurance coverage, and health care use are the mechanisms

underlying our mortality findings, we view all of them as plausible. Regardless of the mechanism,

our findings underscore the fact that the contemporaneous effect of recessions on health – which has

been the focus of a substantial and important literature – is only part of the story. For those who are

approaching retirement when a recession hits, an economic downturn can have long-lasting effects

that more than offset the well-known contemporaneous health benefits of recessions.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW

       As we briefly referenced earlier, a substantial body of research has emerged that focuses on

the contemporaneous effect of economic conditions on health outcomes. Ruhm (2000) was the first

entry into this literature, showing that mortality rates fall when the economy deteriorates. This

finding holds for a broad range of causes of death, including heart disease, flu and pneumonia,
                                                                               Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 4


vehicle accidents, and infant and neonatal mortality. In subsequent work, Ruhm (2003) shows that

economic downturns improve other measures of health, such as the prevalence of chronic conditions,

and Ruhm (2005) shows that higher unemployment is related to reduced smoking, increased physical

activity, and reduced obesity. 2

        More recent work by Miller et al. (2009), however, argues that the observed short-term effect

of economic conditions on mortality must be driven by external factors rather than by changes in

health behaviors among job losers, because the mortality effects are largest among the elderly

population, which is unlikely to be directly affected by unemployment. Stevens et al. (2011) extend

this work, providing evidence that improved nursing home staffing during recessions may be an

important mechanism for the improved mortality among the elderly. All of these papers focus on the

contemporaneous impact of high unemployment and do not address the potential long-term impact

on health outcomes.

        The long-term impact of job loss on displaced workers is examined by Sullivan and Von

Wachter (2009), who present evidence that job loss is associated with both higher short-term and

long-term mortality. They find that, even twenty years after losing a job, displaced workers continue

to have higher mortality rates. The authors posit that the long-term mortality effect that they observe

among displaced workers may be attributable to the long-term reduction in earnings associated with

job loss. These findings are an interesting counter-point to the rest of the literature, because they

indicate that, even if recessions improve health on average, there are important subpopulations for

whom recessions may worsen health. They also raise the possibility that the short-term mortality


2
  Several recent studies have also examined the impact of recessions on health-related behavior. For example, using data
from Iceland, Asgeirsdotter et. al. (2011) find that the Great Recession led to reductions in health-compromising
behaviors and increases in some health-promoting behaviors. In the United States, using data from the American Time
Use Survey, Aguiar et. al. (2011) find that unemployment is associated with more time spent on TV-watching and
sleeping, as well as home production and leisure activities.
                                                                    Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 5


gains that are present on average could be offset over time, as the contemporaneous benefits of

recessions on non-workers dissipate and the long-term effects of job loss on a subset of the

population becomes more prominent. Reconciling our findings with those from these two disparate

streams of research is a critical task that we undertake subsequently.

       A related literature focuses on the impact of income changes on the health status of retirees.

Snyder and Evans (2006) examine the impact of the “Social Security notch” on the mortality rates of

retirees. The Social Security notch was created by a mistake incorporated into legislation that led to

the double indexation of Social Security benefits to inflation. When the mistake was fixed, it led to a

“notch,” where a certain cohort of retirees received lower Social Security benefits than those retirees

who immediately preceded them. Snyder and Evans find that additional income in retirement leads

to higher mortality rates and they argue that social isolation among retirees may be responsible.

Although this analysis provides an interesting experiment related to the effects of an income shock,

the shock generated by an unemployment spell may not necessarily have the same impact.

       In related work focusing on recessions and older workers, Coile and Levine (2010, 2011a,

and 2011b) address the impact of a weak labor market on retirement decisions and subsequent retiree

income. They find that higher unemployment leads older workers to “retire” (i.e. completely

withdraw from the labor force) beginning at age 62. This suggests that Social Security may provide a

lifeline to older workers who experience an employment shock, struggle to find new work, and

finally withdraw from the labor force (albeit with reduced benefits) once they make it to that age.

Consistent with this evidence, they also provide suggestive evidence that subsequent Social Security

income is lower when unemployment is high in the period leading up to retirement. These results

indicate that approaching retirement at the time of a recession can have important consequences for
                                                                                 Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 6


subsequent labor market activity and income. An obvious extension of this work is to examine

whether approaching retirement at the time of a recession also has health effects.



III. EFFECTS ON MORTALITY

A. Empirical Approach

         Our empirical strategy is designed to build on the foundations set by Ruhm (2000, 2003,

2005a, and 2005b), Miller, et al. (2009), and Stevens, et al. (2011), all of whom use the same basic

methodological framework for their analyses. Specifically, they estimate regression models of the

form:3

                                  lnMjt = Xjt·β + URjt·γ + αt + ϕj + ϕjT + εjt                                         (1)

where ln M is the natural log of the mortality rate in state j and year t, X is a vector of demographic

controls, and UR is the state unemployment rate. The vector of year specific fixed effects,                               ,

captures national time effects, and the vector of state specific indicator variables, ϕ , controls for

time-invariant state characteristics. State-specific time trends, ϕ T, are also included. The main

source of identification in this model is state and year level variation in the unemployment rate. A

specification like this is the starting point for our analysis; as we show subsequently, we are able to

largely replicate the main features of the results from these previous studies.

         We then extend this approach by altering the focus from a point-in-time analysis to a

lifecycle analysis.       As described earlier, our goal is to estimate the long-term health effects

associated with experiencing a recession in the period leading up to retirement. We introduce an

empirical specification that begins with the contemporaneous positive health shocks that occur in

response to a rise in unemployment and then examines whether those effects persist, fade away, or
3
 This notation is largely the same as in Stevens, et al. (2011), but has been modified slightly to clarify the distinctions
between their model and the one we specify subsequently.
                                                                     Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 7


even reverse course over time. To estimate these dynamic effects, we revise the estimation strategy

to focus on the probability of survival as one ages as a function of the labor market shock

experienced in an earlier period. As we move to survival analysis, the relevant form of data switches

from pooled cross-sections to cohorts. We aim to answer the question: what was the effect on

subsequent survival of nearing retirement in differing economic environments?

       The model we estimate to formally incorporate these ideas takes the form:

                               Sjca = URjcA·γAa + αc + ϕj + ϕjT + εjca                               (2)

The first main change as we move from Equation (1) to Equation (2) is that the dependent variable is

now the survival probability (S), measured in levels, not in logs. If we are to track the absolute

impact on survival over time (i.e. determine whether the positive immediate impact on survival

returns to zero or even turns negative over time), survival rates in levels are the appropriate outcome.

       Second, we are still indexing observations by state of residence, j (although we will provide

additional discussion of this subsequently), but now we are tracking cohorts, c, measured at different

ages, a, starting from age A, the year in which the shock occurs, and continuing to age 79, the oldest

age at which we track survival probabilities. In other words, if a particular cohort experiences an

increase in the unemployment rate at, say, age 60 (age A), what impact does that have on survival

probabilities between ages 60 and 79 (ages a)? Note that when a = A (i.e. at age 60), this model is

very similar to Equation (1), where the probability of survival through age 60 is one minus the

mortality rate in that year. This interpretation also highlights why the coefficient on the

unemployment rate, γ, is subscripted by A and a, because the impact of the age 60 unemployment

rate is estimated for survival to ages 60 through 79, or 20 times.

       A third difference between this specification and Equation (1) is that we have dropped

population characteristics, labeled X in the earlier model. We made this decision partly because it is
                                                                      Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 8


not clear at what age to capture those characteristics in the context of a survival model and partly

because of issues in gathering these data; no obvious source provides large samples at each exact age

over the relevant time period. As we show subsequently, omitting those explanatory variables from

Equation (1) does not alter the qualitative nature of earlier findings.

       Fourth, we have changed our notation to indicate that we are controlling for cohort fixed

effects (αc) rather than year fixed effects (αt) because this is a cohort-based model. This change is

merely a notation change and is not empirically relevant, since these age-specific regressions make

year fixed effects identical to cohort fixed effects.

       Our approach has the advantage of allowing us to confirm earlier findings and then extend

them to focus on our question, but it comes with disadvantages as well, which are largely a result of

data limitations. The first limitation is our inability to track migration as people age. Our goal is to

estimate the effect of a one percentage point increase in the age 60 unemployment rate in, say,

Missouri, on an individual’s subsequent survival. Unfortunately, however, we can only determine

state of residence at the time of death from our data, not state of residence at some earlier age. If the

Missourian moved to Florida at, say, age 68, we would inadvertently associate her death with the

Florida cohort and not the Missouri cohort. Migration at these ages is reasonably prevalent,

particularly in some states. Using data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Censuses, we estimate that 5

percent of those between the ages of 60 and 70 moved across state lines in the preceding five years.

For those residents of Arizona and Florida at these ages, 20 and 12 percent, respectively, lived in a

different state five years ago.

       Although it would be ideal to perfectly track state of residence over the relevant age ranges,

we do not believe that this limitation will substantively alter the results of our analysis. First,

migration to improve one’s job-finding prospects seems unlikely at these ages, so movement
                                                                                 Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 9


between states is likely to introduce classical measurement error that would introduce a downward

bias in our estimates. To the extent that we obtain results that are statistically different than zero,

then this is just an understatement of the true effect. Second, we have re-estimated all the models

reported below excluding Arizona and Florida, the main states that experience substantial migration

inflows, and we obtained very similar results.

         A second limitation of our approach is that the data requirements are formidable. We define

“nearing retirement” as being between the ages of 55 and 65.                         Our goal is to track survival

probabilities through age 79. This means that we need to calculate survival probabilities for upwards

of 25 years for each cohort, which requires mortality data in each of those years. Although we have

available the universe of death certificates from the United States Vital Statistics system, these data

are available beginning only in 1968 and through 2008 at the time of this analysis.4 Population data

by state and exact age are available (from the National Cancer Institute, available at seer.cancer.gov)

beginning only in 1969, making that the first year for which we can calculate survival rates. We

focus on the 1910 through 1929 birth cohorts, for whom we are able to calculate a complete set of

survival rates for ages 59 through 79 (the 1910 birth cohort was age 59 in 1969 and the 1929 birth

cohort was 79 in 2008). To expand the age range to earlier ages, we must reduce the number of

cohorts we examine. For instance, to start the survival analysis at age 58, the 1911 birth cohort is the

first one we can use. To go back to an age 55 starting age, we focus on the 1914 through 1929 birth

cohorts. We prefer this approach (using a slightly smaller number of cohorts when examining

  State identifiers in Vital Statistics Mortality data are available publicly through 2004, but then require permission from
the Centers for Disease Control to use them in more recent years. These more recent data are treated as confidential and
we are unable to share them.
                                                                                Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 10


survival rates at ages 55 to 59 but making use of the 1910 through 1914 cohorts in the rest of the

analysis) because of the additional power available.5

         One additional consideration in the specification of this model is the inclusion of the

unemployment rate associated with the base age (A) only. In theory, survival in each year between,

say, ages 60 and 74 might be affected by the unemployment rates in each of the intervening 15 years.

Our specification omits the unemployment rates in the intervening years, focusing on labor market

conditions at the base age (i.e. age 60). Our decision to exclude all of these other unemployment

rates was made to focus on the subsequent effect of an initial shock. Unemployment rates tend to be

serially correlated over short periods of time, but not over longer periods of time.6 This means that

excluding a considerably more recent unemployment rate (i.e. excluding the age 70 unemployment

rate in a specification focused on the effect of unemployment at age 60) will not introduce omitted

variable bias in the coefficient on the base age unemployment rate, while including it will reduce the

precision of the estimate. We chose to omit the unemployment rate from neighboring years (i.e. the

age 61 unemployment rate) because it will be serially correlated with the base age unemployment

rate, standard errors will be inflated, and we will have difficulty interpreting the results. If we

include only the age 60 unemployment rate, part of the effect we estimate may be capturing the fact

that the high unemployment rate lingered for another year.                         We do not view this as being




5
  We have also estimated all models using the smaller sample of 1914 through 1929 birth cohorts for survival between
ages 55 and 79 as well as the 1914 through 1933 birth cohorts for survival between ages 55 and 75. In each case, we
obtained qualitatively similar results (which are available upon request).
6
  In a simple analysis, we find that a state unemployment rates is positively related to unemployment rates in the same
state from each of the prior three years, after controlling for state fixed effects and year fixed effects. Not surprisingly,
the relationship is strongest for the unemployment rate in the immediate prior year. This relationship does not hold for
unemployment rates that are more than three years apart.
                                                                             Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 11


problematic for our purposes, as it is the cumulative effect of a recession that we are trying to

capture.7

        This discussion clarifies the nature of the data we use in this analysis. As we already

highlighted, we use Vital Statistics Mortality microdata between 1969 and 2008, making use of the

age at death, the birth year, and the state of residence. We augment this with the SEER estimated

population data by state and age from the National Cancer Institute to create annual mortality rates

by birth cohort and state of residence. We treat state of residence as a constant. This enables us to

convert these mortality rates to survival rates; we do this for the 1910 through 1929 birth cohorts and

estimate survival from ages 59 through 79. We estimate survival rates beginning at ages 55, 56, 57,

and 58 by restricting the birth cohorts further, starting in 1914, 1913, 1912, and 1911, respectively.

State unemployment rates are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics starting in 1976. For

earlier years, we use the state unemployment rates available from the U.S. Department of Labor in

their series, Manpower Reports of the President (various years).8




7
  To further address this specification issue, we estimated analogous models as in equation 2, but we aggregated the
unemployment rate into averages over three year windows (starting with age 55-57 average unemployment and survival
through age 57). We replicated the specification in equation 2 using these averaged unemployment rates and we obtained
similar results to those reported below. Then we continued including average unemployment rates over subsequent three
year intervals (i.e. at 58-60, 61-63, 64-66, …) to examine the impact of the full time series path of labor market
conditions, but reducing the influence of serial correlation. As we add unemployment rates at subsequent ages in the
model, our estimates on the base period unemployment rate become somewhat less precise, but the magnitudes are
similar to those we report below. The coefficients on the unemployment rates at subsequent ages, however, start
becoming erratic as more years of unemployment rate data are included (these results are available on request). We
believe that these results affirm our more parsimonious model specification.
8
  The source of state unemployment rates from Manpower Reports of the President in the years earlier than 1976 is not
clear. The only detail provided in these reports are table notes indicating their source as “state employment security
agencies cooperating with the U.S. Department of Labor.” To assess the value of these data, we have compared their
means to national averages, compared state patterns/values in the years just before 1976 to values just after, examined
cyclical patterns by state (looking for greater cyclical responsiveness in Michigan, for instance), and compared their
values to measures of the insured unemployment rate (which are traditionally lower). All of these comparisons suggest
that these data represent meaningful measures of labor market conditions in a state that are comparable to BLS data for
subsequent years. We have also conducted our analyses using only data beginning in 1976 and obtained results that were
qualitatively similar, although less precise, than those we report here.

B. Replication Exercise

         Before presenting the results of our survival analysis, we first present Table 1, which shows

the results of our replication analysis addressing contemporaneous mortality based on the work of

Stevens, et al. (2011).9 We begin by attempting to replicate the results that Stevens, et al. present in

their Figure 2, which displays the impact of a one percentage point increase in the unemployment

rate on contemporaneous mortality by exact age.10 Replicating their results by exact age is

appropriate since the remainder of our analysis focuses on outcomes by exact age. To reduce the

amount of material to report, in Table 1 we have chosen to provide the results at exact ages between

55 and 75 in five year intervals. The first two columns of the table provide mean mortality rates over

the 1969 through 2008 sample period (Column 1) and for the 1910 through 1929 birth cohorts

(Column 2) at each age. These statistics are presented for purposes of comparison with coefficient

estimates presented subsequently to provide some context for their magnitude.

         We begin reporting the results of our replication attempt in Columns 3 and 4, which display

the results from Stevens, et al. (2011), and our attempt to replicate those estimates. As the second

line of the table indicates, we use the 1978 through 2006 sample years for all available birth cohorts

in those years, as they do. Our findings are not identical to theirs, but the differences are very small;

in each case, they differ by less than 0.1 of a standard deviation. Based on this, we are confident in

proceeding.11



9
  Stevens, et al. (2011) also successfully replicated the findings in Ruhm (2000), making our analysis a third generation
replication.
10
   We are grateful to the authors of this paper for sharing the publicly available parts of their data with us along with their
detailed results so that we could have access to the exact coefficients and standard errors for the points listed in their
Figure 2.
11
   After examining our underlying data (through 2004, since subsequent data are confidential) and statistical code, we are
able to detect very small differences in the data in both population counts and the number of deaths beginning in the year
2000. This is likely attributable to minor revisions in these data that were made between the times they were
downloaded for use in the two studies.
                                                                    Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 13


       The remainder of the table is designed to translate our specification from that expressed in

Equation (1) to that expressed in Equation (2). As we described earlier, it is unclear how to

incorporate the explanatory variables (other than the fixed effects) in a longitudinal analysis, so the

next thing we do is test the sensitivity of our results to dropping these variables. The results in

Column (5) are similar to those in Column (4), so we do not believe that we are imparting bias by

dropping these variables. In Column (6) we extend our sample to include mortality and labor market

outcomes between 1969 and 2008, adding nine years of data before and two years of data after that

used by Stevens, et al. This change has a bigger impact on the results. In general, we observe a

stronger negative relationship between unemployment and mortality; the magnitude of these

differences is up to a full standard deviation. The sensitivity of the results to the sample period is a

finding that Stevens, et al. (2011) report as well, so we are not surprised by this finding.

       The next change that we make is to restrict the data to focus on the 1910 through 1929 birth

cohorts. Those results are reported in Column (7). For the most part, this alteration does not have

much of an impact other than to inflate standard errors somewhat, as one would expect when we

reduce the amount of data used in estimation. The one change of significance is observed for

mortality at age 75. For workers at that age, focusing on the 1910 through 1929 birth cohorts

eliminates a negative and statistically significant impact. One possible cause of this is that these birth

cohorts hit age 75 between 1985 and 2004. This means that these cohorts did not experience the

major recession of the early 1980s at that age, meaning that the variation in the data used to estimate

this model is largely based on the two mild recessions in the early 1990s and early 2000s. If we

replicate the Stevens, et al. model using post-1985 data, we similarly observe a large reduction in the

point estimate. As a result, we believe that this sensitivity is also attributable to the sample window

used for estimation.
                                                                    Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 14


           The final change that we make in Column (8) is to convert the dependent variable from

mortality measured in logs to levels. This change has very little impact on the results. This can be

seen by comparing t-statistics between Columns (7) and (8) or by comparing the ratio of the Column

(8) to Column (2) statistics to create percentage change effects and then comparing that to the results

in Column (7). Either way, it is clear that estimating the model in levels or logs provides the same

substantive results. The results in column (8), which show the same basic pattern of results as the

previous literature on the contemporaneous effects of recessions, constitute estimates of Equation (2)

for five cases where A=a. These results are the starting point for our analysis of long-term survival

effects.

B. Results of Survival Analysis

           This section reports the results of estimating statistical models of the form represented by

Equation (2). In order to better interpret these findings, we first present some descriptive statistics on

aggregate survival rates beginning at age 55 and continuing through age 79. The age 55 survival rate

is the probability of surviving through age 55 conditional on having survived up to age 55, so it is a

number slightly less than one. Survival rates at subsequent ages are the probability of surviving

through that age conditional on surviving up to age 55. Appendix Table 1 provides a full set of

survival probabilities. For simplicity, we present in Figure 1 these survival rates for the 1915 and

1925 birth cohorts to demonstrate not just the patterns by age, but the general patterns across cohorts

as well. Among members of the 1915 birth cohort who survived to age 55, the probability of

surviving to age 79 is 49.7 percent. Members of the 1925 birth cohort live longer, unsurprisingly,

surviving to age 79 at the rate of 54 percent.

           The full set of results from estimating Equation (2) is presented in Appendix Table 2. The

number of regressions that are inherent in that model is somewhat overwhelming. For
                                                                   Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 15


unemployment shocks experienced at each age between 55 and 79, we estimate the impact on

survival probabilities at each age between the base age and age 79. This means that our full set of

results contains 435 regressions. Even reporting just the key unemployment rate coefficient and its

standard error from each regression is overwhelming in any traditional format.

       Instead, we adopt the following approaches to reduce the extent of reporting. First, we

provide Appendix Table 2, which reports a complete set of results for all models in which the

unemployment shock is measured between ages 55 and 65. These are the ages leading up to

retirement that are the focus of this analysis. Second, we present two figures that show coefficients

from selected regressions and are designed to capture the critical features of these results. Estimated

effects that are statistically significant at the 5 percent level are indicated by diamonds on the

figures.

       Figure 2 displays the contemporaneous effects, meaning the impact on current age survival of

an increase in the unemployment rate at that age. This analysis is virtually identical to that reported

for selected ages in Column 8 of Table 1 (although mortality there is converted to survival here, so

negative mortality effects become positive survival effects). These results indicate that higher

unemployment increases survival probabilities across all of our age groups at a roughly similar rate.

Specifically, a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate increases one-year survival

probabilities by around 0.0005, or by 0.05 percentage points. With mortality rates that average

around three percent, this 0.05 percentage point increase in the one-year survival rate reflects about a

1.7 percent decrease in mortality rates. A larger impact is observed around age 70. Again, these

results are generally consistent with the findings in Stevens, et al., with perhaps the exception of

those in their late 70s. As described earlier, this exception is likely a result of different sample

periods.
                                                                       Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 16


        Figure 3 displays the long-term effects, meaning the impact of an increase in the

unemployment rate at some specified age on the path of survival rates from that age through age 79.

Rather than provide these effects for unemployment rate increases at each possible age, which would

be overwhelming, we selected five specific base ages (55, 58, 60, 62, and 65) that provide an

adequate characterization of the complete set of results. Note that the first point on each line is the

contemporaneous effect, as reported in Figure 2 for the relevant age. Other points on the line show

subsequent effects on survival, as measured at the ages that are denoted on the horizontal axis. To

condense the necessary content of these figures as much as possible, we again use a diamond on

each line to reflect those effects that are statistically significant at the 5 percent level.

        As we reported in Figure 2, the contemporaneous effects are typically small and positive,

indicating that survival rates increase when the unemployment rate goes up. None of these

contemporaneous effects displayed are statistically significant, but Figure 2 shows that they are at

some ages.     One interesting extension of these results is that the positive effect on survival

probabilities may even increase in the few years following the rise in unemployment.

        The issue upon which we would prefer to focus, however, is what happens subsequently, and

particularly as workers age into their retirement years. For those who experience a weaker labor

market at age 55, the positive impact on survival quickly fades and becomes insignificantly different

from zero through their 70s. Similarly, for those who experience higher unemployment at ages 62

and 65, we see no statistically significant longer-term impact on survival. For those who experience

a weak labor market at ages 58 or 60, however, an increase in the unemployment rate has long-term

deleterious effects on survival probabilities. Within five or so years after the labor market shock,
                                                                               Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 17


these cohorts have lower survival rates than others who did not experience a shock, and those lower

survival rates are statistically significant and continue throughout most, if not all, of their 70s.12

         The magnitude of these effects indicates that a one percentage point increase in the

unemployment rate when an individual is in his or her late 50s reduces the probability of survival

into his or her 70s by 0.0003 to 0.0004 percentage points. A major recession that increases the

unemployment rate by 5 percentage points (as we experienced in the early 1980s and in 2008),

would have a 0.0015 to 0.0020 percentage point impact on survival. Although these effects might

appear to be incredibly small, it is important interpret them within the context of the number of

workers who lose their jobs during a recession, the number who may lose health insurance, and then

the number of those whose health may be seriously affected as a result. We place these estimates

into this broader context subsequently.

IV. EFFECTS ON HEALTH CARE USE, HEALTH INSURANCE, AND EMPLOYMENT

A. Data and Empirical Strategy

         In this section of the paper, we explore potential mechanisms for the long-term increase in

mortality associated with recessions that occur when cohorts are in their late 50s and very early 60s.

We specifically examine the short- and long-term impacts of recessions on access to health care,

health insurance coverage and labor market outcomes. The best data source for examining insurance

coverage and employment over a long period of time is the March CPS; we pool data from the 1980

to 2010 surveys for our analysis. Although the CPS is available for earlier years, health insurance

variables are not defined consistently prior to 1980, so we choose to limit our sample to these 31

12
   We have examined these effects separately by gender and find that the point estimates are very similar for males and
females. We would prefer to also distinguish the data by level of education, but we are unable to do so since Vital
Statistics mortality data only began recording the education level of the deceased in 1989 and because population
estimates by exact age, state, and education level are not available to be able to create the mortality rates that serve as
inputs to the survival rate. We also considered incorporating cause of death into the analysis, but our focus on survival
rather than mortality complicates such an analysis.
                                                                              Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 18


survey years.13 For health care use, we provide evidence from the BRFSS, pooling the 1991-2010

survey years for our analysis. While the BRFSS survey collects more information on health

behaviors than on health care utilization, it does include a question about whether, during the past 12

months, the respondent needed to see a doctor, but did not because of cost. We use this question to

construct our key measure of health care access/use. 14

        Ideally, we would use exactly the same empirical strategy examining these outcomes as we

did for mortality in the previous section. Those regression models, however, impose formidable data

requirements. We were able to meet those requirements in our analysis of survival probabilities,

because of the availability of Vital Statistics data, which include the universe of deaths. In contrast,

survey data sets such as the BRFSS and CPS introduce some limitations and therefore require

modifications to our empirical strategy.

        The first limitation is that we are no longer able to follow a fixed panel of birth cohorts, as

we do in Vital Statistics data. The BRFSS and CPS both provide repeated cross-sections so, of

course, we are not able to follow the same individuals as they age from their 50s into their 70s. In

addition, we could only follow a small number of fixed birth cohorts over the twenty year period

from their 50s into their 70s. For example, we could follow only the 1925 through 1932 birth

cohorts in the 31 years of Current Population Surveys.                    Therefore, we choose to include all

observations between the ages of 53 and 79 who appear in these surveys, regardless of birth cohort.15


13
   Even within these 31 survey years, health insurance variables are not entirely consistent. We have tested the
sensitivity of our results to using a narrower sample period with more consistently-defined measures of health insurance.
We obtain qualitatively similar results, but with less precision.
14
   We have also examined health care utilization variables (and health outcome measures) in the National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS) and the BRFSS, including outcomes like doctor visits in the past 2 weeks and hospital days.
Unfortunately, it became obvious to us that these sources of data did not contain sample sizes large enough to provide
the necessary power to draw strong conclusions from these analyses.
15
   For some of the observations on the oldest individuals in the 1980 through 1985 CPS surveys, we do not observe the
unemployment rates that they faced in their early and mid-50s, because our unemployment data do not extend earlier
than 1960. We have re-estimated our CPS regressions excluding the 1980-1985 surveys and find that our results are not
                                                                             Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 19


        The second limitation is that these data sets are too small to precisely identify the impact of

the unemployment rate at a single age on outcomes at a single age. Therefore, we pool the data into

nine three-year age groups, from ages 53-55 to ages 77-79. We calculate the average unemployment

rates for a cohort and state across each three-year age group and use that average as the key

independent variable in our regressions. Our regression equation builds on that in Equation (2), but

incorporates these modifications. It takes the form:

                                 Yijtg = URjtG·γGg + δt + ϕj + ϕjT + λa + εijtg                                     (3)

where Y is an outcome, such as insurance coverage or employment, for individual i in age group g in

state j and year t. URjtG is the average unemployment rate that would have faced an individual in

state j and survey year t when they were in age group G. The regression is estimated separately for

each combination of age groups g and G. Like the survival models, these regressions control for a

full set of state fixed effects and state-specific linear trends. Whereas the survival regressions

included cohort fixed effects, these regressions include survey year fixed effects. The only other

difference is that these regressions include fixed effects for the exact year of age, a, since each

regression includes three ages. The key regressors of interest are the  gG coefficients. As with

mortality, our results are most easily seen graphically, but we are also able to present them in tables

given the smaller number of results. Standard errors are clustered on state.

B. Results

        The first set of results shows the impact of recessions on access to health care.                          The

dependent variable is an indicator for whether, during the past 12 months, the respondent did not see

a doctor, when needed, due to cost. The coefficients are reported in Table 2 and shown graphically in

materially affected. Also, for the 2009 and 2010 surveys, there are observations in our sample for whom we have not yet
observed all of the relevant unemployment rates for calculation of the three-year average unemployment rate in their age
group. Again, we have re-estimated our regressions excluding the 2009 and 2010 survey years and find that the results
are qualitatively similar.
                                                                     Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 20


Figure 4, with diamond markers denoting any coefficients that are statistically significant at the 5

percent level. These results suggest that increases in the unemployment rate are associated with

contemporaneous increases in the probability of missing a doctor’s appointment due to cost, for

recessions that occur before age 65, the age of Medicare entitlement.             The magnitude of the

contemporaneous effect ranges from a 0.181 to a 0.457 percentage point increase in the probability

of a missed doctor’s visit for a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate.

Interestingly, our results suggest that the elevated probability of a missed doctor visit associated with

a recession persists for three to six years after the recession, suggesting that the impact of recessions

on access to health care use may extend for a number of years. This long-term effect on access to

care provides a plausible mechanism for recessions to have longer-term negative consequences for

health. It is also worth noting that we see some evidence of increased access to care six to nine

years after a recession, although of a smaller magnitude than the initial decrease. In the next set of

results, we explore potential explanations for these patterns.

       We next turn to measures of health insurance coverage as dependent variables. We use two

measures of health insurance coverage: an indicator for having any health insurance coverage, and

an indicator for having any private health insurance coverage. The health insurance questions in the

CPS are intended to elicit information about insurance coverage in the prior year. However, survey

respondents have a tendency to provide health insurance information about the survey year instead

of the prior year (Swartz, 1986). Indeed, in our sample, reported Medicare coverage spikes from 16

percent among 64-year-old survey respondents to 83% among 65-year-old survey respondents. This

spike would not occur (or would be much smaller), if people were actually reporting their insurance

status in the prior year. In light of this information, we treat the insurance data as if they apply to the

survey year.    Although this approach may introduce a bit of downward bias attributable to
                                                                                Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 21


measurement error, the year-to-year serial correlation in unemployment likely dampens the

magnitude of this problem. The coefficients are, again, shown graphically in figures, with diamond

markers denoting any coefficients that are statistically significant at the 5 percent level.

         Figure 5 shows coefficients in models where the dependent variable is an indicator for

coverage by any form of insurance (Table 3 reports the same coefficients with corresponding

standard errors). Not surprisingly, there is a large decline in the probability of any insurance

coverage in periods of elevated unemployment for all age groups below the age of Medicare

eligibility. The magnitude of the contemporaneous decline in the probability of insurance coverage

ranges from 0.18 to 0.39 percentage points for a one percentage point increase in unemployment.

These results are consistent with earlier findings on the contemporaneous effect of unemployment on

health insurance coverage (Cawley and Simon, 2005; and Gruber and Levitt, 2002).16

         Interestingly, Figure 5 also shows that the largest decline in insurance coverage, based on

point estimates, is seen in the time period that is approximately 3 years after the recession. This lag

is long enough that it is probably not attributable to serial correlation in unemployment rates, but it

might reflect the fact that COBRA coverage mitigates the loss of health insurance in the first 18

months after a job loss.17 While the other coefficients are generally not statistically significant, the

point estimates suggest that, for individuals who experience a labor market downturn at ages 53-55,

it can take nearly a decade – until Medicare become available at age 65 – for insurance coverage to

return to its pre-recession level. The fact that Medicare eligibility begins at age 65 ensures that those

who experience recessions at ages 62 to 64 experience substantially shorter spells of uninsurance.

16
  The estimates by Gruber and Levitt (2002), like ours, are based on the CPS; they estimate effects that are slightly larger
than ours (0.43 to 0.57), but this difference is likely attributable to the older population in our sample. In more recent
work using the Survey of Income and Program Participation, Cawley et. al. (2011) estimate larger effects of the Great
Recession on insurance coverage than those implied by earlier studies.
17
  COBRA coverage was introduced by legislation beginning in 1985, so that it is available for most of our sample
period.
                                                                              Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 22


Recessions occurring after that age lead to no deficit in insurance coverage. These age patterns are

quite consistent with the pattern of effects on financial access to care in the BRFSS and, therefore,

may help to explain the finding that recessions are associated with a reduction in long-term survival

when they coincide with an individual’s late 50s and very early 60s but not if they occur at older

ages.

        Figure 6 focuses on private health insurance coverage (Table 4 shows the same coefficients

and corresponding standard errors).18 For those under the age of 65, private insurance is likely to be

the individual’s primary source of insurance; for those over the age of 65, private insurance is likely

to be a supplemental insurance policy that covers copayments and deductibles for Medicare. About

half of these supplemental insurance policies are purchased through former employers, and the other

half are purchased individually on the Medigap market.                        Given the prevalence of private

supplemental policies, it is not surprising that average private insurance coverage does not fall off

very much at the age of Medicare eligibility; in our data, it falls from 78 percent at ages 62 to 64 to

71 percent at ages 65 to 67. In Figure 6, we see that the decline in insurance coverage associated

with higher unemployment is, not surprisingly, driven by declines in private health insurance

coverage. As with the overall insurance coverage results, the largest impact on private health

insurance coverage (based on point estimates) occurs with a lag of approximately three years, after

COBRA coverage expires. The other notable result in this panel is the statistically significant

increase in private health insurance coverage among those aged 68-70 associated with recessions

that occurred when those individuals were in their mid-50s. One possible explanation for this result

is that it is the result of increased labor market participation at older ages by those who experienced


18
   We have also examined the effect of recessions on public health insurance coverage. We find no statistically
significant effect, which is not surprising given the eligibility rules for Medicare and Medicaid. We do not report these
results in figures or tables.
                                                                                Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 23


recessions in their 50s and may feel they need to work longer to make up for lost income and

pension contributions. This finding may also explain the decreased financial barriers to health care

that we found among those aged 68-73 associated with recessions that occurred when those

individuals were in their mid-50s.

         These results suggest the possibility of longer-term employment effects; we next examine

labor market outcomes as a function of the unemployment rate at various ages.19 Our data set and

empirical framework is identical to that for our insurance coverage regressions, but we now estimate

linear probability models using an employment indicator as our key dependent variable. The results

of this analysis are reported in Figure 7 and Table 5. All age groups, of course, experience a

contemporaneous decline in employment when unemployment rates are high. Specifically, we find

that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a contemporaneous

0.3 to 0.5 percentage point decline in the probability of employment in our sample. The fact that

there is not a one-for-one relationship between the unemployment rate and employment in our

sample is likely related to the fact that older workers are typically less likely to lose their jobs during

recessions than younger workers.20 The magnitude of the effect diminishes over time, but remains

apparent in the data for 6 to 9 years.

         Interestingly, we also observe a statistically significant increase in the probability of

employment in an individual’s late 60s and early 70s, lasting approximately 6 years, for those




19
   Although we are primarily interested in analyzing employment in order to put our other results into context, we
acknowledge that retirement itself could have direct effects (either positive or negative) on physical and/or mental health.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to estimate this empirically, since the potential for endogeneity is so great. For two recent
examples from this literature, see Bound and Waidmann (2007) and Coe and Zamarro (2011).
20
   For example, Johnson and Butrica (2012) report that, in the most recent recession, during a period when the monthly
employment rate for 25-to-34-year-olds was, on average, 9.4 percent, the unemployment rate for 50-to-61-year-olds was,
on average, only 6.1 percent.
                                                                              Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 24


cohorts that experienced recessions between the ages of 53 and 64.21 This increase in employment

after the age of normal retirement is shorter and less pronounced for those who experience

recessions between the ages of 62 and 64.22 This effect could suggest that some of those who

experience a recession in their 50s need to remain in the labor force longer or return there later in

life, to make up for lost incomes, pension accrual, or Social Security accrual. Those who experience

a recession after they have reached the early entitlement age for Social Security, on the other hand,

experience less loss of income and less loss of pension and Social Security accrual, and therefore do

not increase their employment at older ages by as much.23 We have repeated this exercise using the

natural log of total personal income in the CPS as the dependent variable and obtained patterns very

similar to those described regarding employment, as one would expect.

V. DISCUSSION

         Our results indicate that experiencing a recession in the years preceding retirement results in

a short period in which mortality is lower, but a longer period in which mortality is higher, resulting

in lower survival rates at older ages. A plausible mechanism for this longer-term finding is the long

period of lower rates of employment, health insurance coverage, and access to health care that we

find comes with exposure to an economic downturn in one's late 50s or early 60s. These effects




21
   This increase in employment appears to explain a portion of the increase in private health insurance coverage between
the ages of 65 and 70. When we use an indicator for having private health insurance and being employed as our
dependent variable, we obtain coefficients that are similar to, but somewhat smaller than, those in Table 3.
22
   We have examined health insurance and employment outcomes by gender. We find some differences in point
estimates, with generally larger health insurance effects for women and larger employment effects for men. However,
these differences are not statistically significant.
23
   It is worth noting that these effects are generally at least an order of magnitude larger than the effects on survival
probabilities, so these results are not explained by selection bias due to the deaths of the individuals who were least
likely to remain in the labor force at older ages. Working longer in response to experiencing a recession in the late 50s
and very early 60s could have a positive or negative potential impact on long-term mortality. If it were negative, this
could be a potential mechanism driving our mortality effects. We are unaware of any literature that directly addresses the
link between labor market longevity and longer-term survival probabilities.

could go on for several years for affected workers and appear to be ameliorated by eligibility for

Social Security and Medicare at ages 62 and 65, respectively.

       One useful exercise that would help support the plausibility of these findings is a comparison

of the relative magnitudes of their effects. We begin with the employment effects, which should be

the largest in magnitude. As described earlier, a one percentage point increase in the unemployment

rate at, say, ages 56-58 reduces the likelihood of any employment at those ages by 0.5 percentage

points. The less than point-for-point impact makes sense because older workers do not suffer as

much job loss as the average worker when a recession hits; furthermore, since the relevant outcome

is any employment, workers whose unemployment spells are short would not be captured here. This

effect does not dissipate by ages 59-61 but falls by about half at ages 62-64 (after Social Security

becomes available) and then falls again to roughly zero by 65-67 (after the Social Security normal

retirement age passes). We believe these results are plausible and suggestive of long-term

employment losses for many older workers who experience a job loss.

       The estimated effects on health insurance coverage suggest that the same one percentage

point increase in the unemployment rate at ages 56-58 reduces private health insurance coverage by

around 0.25 percentage points from those ages through ages 62-64 (although the effect is only

statistically significant at 59-61, suggesting the power of this analysis is somewhat limited). This

indicates that roughly half of those with long-term employment losses also lose access to private

health insurance. Spousal coverage is likely to account for those who do not, as well as COBRA

coverage in the short run; there is also no loss in insurance for those job losers who were uninsured

even when working. The impact on any health insurance coverage could also be mitigated if

unemployed older workers apply for and receive Social Security disability insurance (cf. Autor and

Duggan, 2003), although Medicare coverage is only available starting two years after the onset of
                                                                   Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 26


the disability. The magnitude of the estimated effect on reporting missing a doctor visit due to cost is

similar to the magnitude of the effect on insurance coverage, which would indicate that almost all of

those who lose health insurance coverage experience financial barriers to care. This seems plausible,

especially for an age group where doctor visits are quite common.

       In terms of survival probabilities, we find that a one percentage point increase in the

unemployment rate at, say, age 58 reduces the likelihood of surviving through age 79 by 0.045

percentage points. This means that if the entire impact on survival is generated from those initial

workers who suffered long-term unemployment resulting from a recession, an additional one in ten

of those workers would not survive to age 79 as a result of the labor market downturn. An

alternative way to interpret these numbers is to estimate the impact on life expectancy assuming that

all of the survival effect was transmitted through employment reductions. These calculations suggest

that a worker who lost their job at age 58 as a result of a recession could be expected to live three

fewer years (19 years instead of 22) as a result. It is important to interpret these numbers with some

caution. First, lost employment does not need to be the only mechanism for such an effect, as

Miller, et al. (2009) and Stevens, et al. (2011) indicate, which would result in overstated effects on

job losers. Second, standard errors are associated with each of these estimates, suggesting that some

confidence interval exists around these estimates. Nevertheless, incorporating these caveats, we

believe that these magnitudes are plausible.

       Another critical element in interpreting our results is the relationship between our findings

and those of past analyses that have examined similar questions. As we described earlier, there are a

number of relevant previous studies and their findings are not obviously consistent with each other.

Ruhm (2000) found a general reduction in contemporaneous mortality associated with an economic

downturn. Sullivan and von Wachter (2009) find that job displacement among long-tenured men
                                                                   Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 27


increased mortality in the short- and long-term, particularly for those at prime working age. Miller,

et al. (2009) show that higher unemployment rates generate reduced contemporaneous mortality,

particularly for elderly individuals. We find negative short-term mortality effects that are consistent

with Miller, et al. (2009) for workers in their late 50s and very early 60s, but then we find reduced

longevity for these workers. Taken at face value, virtually all of these results appear to contradict

each other.

          These conflicts have been noted by the authors of previous studies and several explanations

have been offered. Sullivan and von Wachter (2009) make a distinction between the average worker

who loses his or her job in a recession and the high-tenure displaced workers that they study, who

presumably suffer a considerably more severe economic shock resulting from their unemployment.

In their view, the differential effects between the two groups (the former being considerably larger)

are reasonable, so there is no conflict with Ruhm (2000). Miller, et al. (2009) argue that the

differences in their findings as compared to those of Ruhm (2000) result from the fact that health

improvements observed during a recession are not the result of changes in own labor force status,

but are attributable to external factors, which they go on to explore in more detail in Stevens, et al.

(2011).

          Our own evidence builds on some of these arguments, but other discrepancies between our

findings and the more recent entries into this literature also need to be reconciled. In comparing our

results with those of Miller, et al./Stevens, et al., the main distinction is in terms of interpretation;

they argue that the main effect of a recession is external to the employment relationship. That may

be true for the short-term impact and our short-term results are very similar to their findings. On the

other hand, we believe that our findings are consistent with reduced employment, health insurance

coverage, and health care access plausibly explaining a significant portion of the long-term negative
                                                                  Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 28


health impact. Since their analysis never focuses on these long-term effects, there is no direct

conflict in our interpretations.

        Our primary result – that recessions have negative long-term effects on survival for those

approaching retirement – is also mainly consistent with the key findings of Sullivan and von

Wachter (2009). One place where the papers may appear to diverge is in the relative effect of

unemployment at different ages. We find that unemployment shocks at ages 57 to 61 have the

biggest long-term effect on survival, while shocks at earlier (ages 55 to 56) or later (ages 62 to 65)

ages have no significant long-term effect. Sullivan and von Wachter find that shocks occurring at

younger ages (before age 45 or between ages 45 and 54) have a bigger effect than those at older ages

(age 55 and above). Yet since we do not study the effect of shocks at younger ages, the two sets of

results are not directly comparable; Sullivan and von Wachter do not provide results by exact age

that could be compared against our results. A second point of divergence between the two papers is

that we find positive effects of unemployment shocks on survival in the short run, while they find

negative effects in both the short- and long-term. As already discussed, the effect of unemployment

on an average worker may be different from that on a high-tenure worker.               For example,

employment and income losses may be less severe for average workers. As a result, average

displaced workers may be spared the negative short-term mortality effects that plague those

displaced from long-tenured positions, but both groups appear to suffer negative long-run health

consequences.

        Overall, our findings suggest that experiencing a recession in one’s late 50s or early 60s is

bad for health in the long run. Interestingly, we find that unemployment shocks at or after age 62

have no long-term negative health effects.      The availability of Social Security at age 62 and

Medicare at age 65 may play an important role in this finding. These programs serve as a buffer
                                                                            Coile, Levine, and McKnight: p. 29


against the income and health insurance losses that often accompany unemployment. Indeed, we

find that unemployment shocks trigger lengthy reductions in employment and income for older

workers; Social Security starts filling in the income gap at age 62. These shocks also trigger lengthy

reductions in insurance coverage and increased difficulty in accessing health care; these effects

disappear once individuals reach age 65 when Medicare begins.24 As policy makers contemplate

possible changes to Social Security and Medicare to restore them to stronger financial footing, such

as raising the age of eligibility for these programs, it will be important to develop a better

understanding of the role that these programs may play in mitigating the negative effects of an

unemployment shock.




24
 The fact that the impact on mortality ends at age 62 may simply mean that gaps in insurance coverage of a year or two
may not substantively alter subsequent mortality.
