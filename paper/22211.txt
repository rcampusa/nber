                                          ABSTRACT

We estimate growth rates of real incomes in the U.S. by quintiles using the Congressional Budget
Office’s (CBO) post-tax, post-transfer data as basis for the period 1979-2011. We improve upon
them by including only the present value of earnings that will accrue in retirement and excluding
items included in the CBO income estimates such as “corporate taxes borne by labor” that do not
increase either current purchasing power or utility. We estimate a high and a low growth rate
using two price indexes, the CPI and the Personal Consumption Expenditure index. The major
consistent findings include what in the colloquial is referred to as the “hollowing out” of the
middle class. According to these estimates, the income of the middle class 2nd and 3rd quintiles
increased at a rate of between 0.1% and 0.7%per annum, i.e., barely distinguishable from zero.
Even that meager rate was achieved only through substantial transfer payments. In contrast, the
income of the top 1% grew at an astronomical rate of between 3.4% and 3.9% per annum during
the 32-year period, reaching an average annual value of$918,000, up from $281,000 in 1979 (in
2011 dollars). Hence, the post-tax, post-transfer income of the 1% relative to the 1st quintile
increased from a factor of 21 in 1979 to a factor of 51 in 2011. However, income of no other
group increased substantially relative to that of the lowest quintile. Oddly, the income of even
those in the 96-99 percentiles increased only from a multiple of 8.1 to a multiple of 11.3. We next
estimate growth in welfare assuming diminishing marginal utility of income. A logarithmic utility
function yields a growth in welfare for the middle class of roughly 0.01% to 0.07% per annum,
which is indistinguishable from zero. With interdependent utility functions only the welfare of the
5th quintile experienced meaningful growth while those of the first four quintiles tend to be either
negligible or even negative.

Introduction

       While the concept of income and its distribution—amongst the most salient variables in

all of economics—is theoretically straightforward, the empirics associated with their real-world

version are actually quite complicated. As a consequence, the measurement of income and its

growth remains somewhat controversial. Most estimates are based on pre-tax pre-transfer

incomes collected by the Census, which are, of course, important in themselves insofar as they

reveal market outcomes; however, they fail to reveal accurately either actual purchasing power

or the corresponding welfare enjoyed by households. However, post-transfer incomes calculated

by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has its own problems, namely that much of it is

financed through government debt so the burden of the transfers will be born, in the main, by

generations yet unborn and consequently cannot be netted against government liabilities. This, of

course, introduces a difficult-to-calibrate bias into the calculations insofar as the accumulated

debt is not accounted for anywhere in these statistics. Hence, the post-transfer incomes leave the

impression that the accumulation of government debt could be income and welfare enhancing.

       An additional formidable challenge is posed by a litany of intractable problems associated

with the estimates of the rate of inflation which introduce measurement errors upon which the

whole exercise might well turn and which might affect various income groups differently.

       The goal of this paper is to improve upon the CBO estimate of post-tax and post-transfer

income growth in five quintiles and, in addition, also ventures for the first time an estimate of the

growth of welfare between 1979 and 2011. In the process we point to major lacunae in the

empirical evidence in this critical area of economics without which we are not on solid ground in

understanding even the most fundamental aspects of economic performance, namely its ability to

generate income and welfare across the income distribution. The paper takes the most recent

                                                  1
CBO data as its starting point, insofar as it is the most comprehensive estimate of disposable

household income and its distribution (CBO, 2014). It modifies it slightly in order to make it

more appropriate for the purposes at hand, the estimation of income and welfare growth.

Subsequently, we use two estimates of the inflation rate to convert nominal into real incomes by

quintiles. The 5th quintile is further decomposed into four percentile groups including the top 1%.

The upshot is that most Americans are scarcely better off than their parents were a generation

ago, except those at the very top and considering relative incomes almost all are actually worse

off.

Data
       Income

       The CBO’s main goal is not to calculate income growth per se but to estimate the

incidence of taxes on various income groups, whereas our goal is to estimate the increase in real

income so as to gauge the gains in welfare along the income distribution. This difference dictates

some deviation from the CBO procedure as far as the income transfers are concerned. 1 Hence,

we modify the CBO data in three rather minor ways:

       1) We exclude those items that do not increase utility such as the CBO’s estimate of

“Corporate Tax Born by Labor”. From the CBO’s point of view, the rationale behind including

this item as “income” is that taxes levied on corporations induce them to pay lower wages and

therefore the assumption is that labor’s income would have been greater by this amount in the


1
  Another variant, referred to as comprehensive income, focuses on consumption and changes in
net wealth (Armour et al., 2013). Formally, it is defined as Y = C + ∆NW, where Y is income, C
is consumption and ∆NW is the change in net worth. We do not use this formulation because we
do not have data on net worth. In addition, this formulation has the disadvantage that wealth
might well be based on unrealistic prices as many home owners found out in the aftermath of the
recent financial crisis. There is also the problem associated with the riskiness of the asset
position of the individual that the above formulation does not consider.
                                                2
absence of corporate taxes. So, in effect, this is the incidence of corporate taxes on labor, i.e.,

labor foregoes this amount or “pays” this part of the tax. While this procedure is appropriate for

understanding tax incidence it is not so for estimating only those components of income that

enhance utility, because employees never see or even know about these amounts. Insofar as it is

not shown on their paychecks, it does not increase their utility or welfare. Hence, this item is

subtracted from the CBO data.

       The same argument applies to “Corporate Tax Born by Capital”, except it pertains to

shareholders rather than to employees. This is the incidence of corporate taxes paid by

shareholders, but again these amounts are not utility enhancing, so they will also be subtracted

from the CBO data.

       2) In addition, it is important to consider that some of the current “income” will actually

accrue in the future. Insofar as only their present value generates utility, they should not be

conflated with cash income received immediately. After all, the discounting of future incomes is

one of the basic tenets of economics. Hence, we add to total income only the present value of

future incomes.

       The present value of future incomes such as “Employer’s Share of Payroll Taxes” are

estimated by assuming that the discount rates vary by income quintile from the lowest to the

highest as follows: 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, and 0.05. To be sure, these values, chosen for

convenience, are arbitrary, but useful nonetheless, insofar as “the large empirical literature

devoted to measuring discount rates has failed to establish stable estimates for the U.S. There is

extraordinary variation across studies” (Frederick et al., 2002). Given the necessity of

discounting future income, taking such plausible numbers (even if conjectural) is the best we can

do at this time. Nonetheless, it does seem plausible that the discount rate would be inversely



                                                   3
related to the level of income, insofar as one would be more anxious to increase current income

the less income one has.

       These discount rates imply that the present value of $1 received (with certainty) in

retirement (averaged over the forty five age groups between the ages of 20 and 65) in the five

quintiles in increasing order are: $0.08, $0.10, $0.14, $0.21, and $0.39.2 Hence, they do not

increase current income substantially. These approximations are used to calculate the present

value of “Employer’s Share of Payroll Taxes.” (They leave out of consideration the probability

of surviving into retirement, which would reduce the estimates even further.)

       Arguably, even these small amounts are likely to be upwardly biased insofar as they

disregard the stark reality that so many people lack confidence that they will reap comparable

benefits from the Social Security system in the future. After all, fully half of young people

believe that they will not receive any Social Security benefits at all by the time they retire, given

the doubts about the survival of the system in its current form, on account of the increases in the

political attacks on the system. 3 Another 38% believe that the benefits will be reduced (Pew

Research Center, 2014). Only a tiny minority (8%) believe that they will receive benefits at the

current level. This implies that the employer’s contribution to the Social Security system does

not improve welfare of most of the employees by even the small amounts implied by the

discounted value of these payments. After all, these payments are not being saved for the



2
  The average of these five discount rates is $0.18, which is used for the median income.
3
  They are paying taxes now to provide for retirement income for their grandparent’s generation
and are poorer for it, not wealthier. Will future generations yet unborn be honor-bound to
continue Social Security payments on their behalf by the time they retire? There is no guarantee
that they will. There is no generational contract, no pledge, and no promises that they will have
retirement benefits waiting for them. One cannot have a contract with people who are not yet
born. With such an uncertain future for the system, they can hardly be blamed for being skeptical
about the benefits they will actually receive as a consequence of these contributions to the
retirement system ostensibly on their behalf.
                                                  4
employees but are instead used to pay for the retirement benefits of those currently retired.

Hence, arguably they could be discounted further insofar as they probably have but an

inconsequential effect on welfare. However, we do continue to add their discounted value to total

income in order to err on the side of caution.

       3) Three items pertaining to health insurance are not considered in total income:

“Employer’s Contributions to Health Insurance,” “Medicare,” and Medicaid payments.”

Employer’s Contributions to Health Insurance increased only marginally between 1979 and 2011

from 3.1% to 4.3% of labor income so excluding it is inconsequential in any event. However,

even if they had increased by more they would have to be discounted, because the benefits

accrue in the future (with uncertainty).

       Although Medicare and Medicaid payments did increase from 2.5% to 8.8% of total

income, the actual benefits most likely have not increased meaningfully over time. Moreover,

these increases were most likely caused by the aging of the population which necessitates greater

Medicare expenditures. This consideration points to one of the more serious shortcomings of all

of these estimates, namely that they are not standardized for the age structure of the population

which changed obviously over time and the demand for medical services is particularly age-

sensitive. 4 As a consequence of all these issues, it seems appropriate to leave these items out of

consideration until these uncertainties are resolved. 5 They were most likely neither increasing

disposable income nor experienced utility noticeably more in 2011 than they did in 1979.

Price Indexes

2010. https://www.census.gov/population/age/data/2012comp.html, accessed November 27,
2015.
5
  Another probable reason for the increases in these payments is that the price of medical services
has increased faster than the rest of the price index.
                                                  5
       There is no consensus on how best to estimate the rate of inflation either. The CBO

converts nominal into real income using the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price

index calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) while the Census and the Bureau of

Labor Statistics (BLS) uses the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers instead.

       The two indexes differ in a multitude of large and small ways; for instance, the PCE uses

weights derived from business surveys, whereas the CPI uses weights derived from household

surveys which are more appropriate for our purposes. The minutiae of differences include the

fact that the BEA imputes prices for “financial services furnished without payment,” 6 that is to

say, services for which banks do not charge explicitly, such as processing of checking accounts

(Hood 2013).

       Actually, both indexes are imperfect (Boskin et al., 1998; Whelan, 2002; Hausman,

2003). The main focus of the PCE index is calculating real U.S. national income. This implies

that the PCE includes purchases not only by households but also by non-profit institutions

(McCully et al., 2007) as well as by intermediaries (such as insurance companies) on behalf of

households which may or may not pass price changes onto consumers. Thus, the CPI does have

the advantage of using only out-of-pocket expenditures of the consumers themselves, which

makes it more suitable for our purposes, i.e., to estimate welfare growth. 7

http://www.bea.gov/faq/index.cfm?faq_id=83 accessed September 23, 2015.
7
  Other differences include the fact that the PCE uses weights that change from quarter to quarter
while the CPI market basket is updated every two years. The PCE uses a chained Fisher index
formula whereas the CPI uses a Laspeyres-type formula. The PCE uses the CPI for 74% of its
items, the producer price index (PPI) for 9%, input-cost indexes 10% and other 7%. The PPI is
the price of products for the first commercial transaction which makes it more like a wholesale
price index and was called just that until 1978. The weights also differ. Shelter and transportation
have a substantially higher weight in the CPI Index than in the PCE index, 32.7% vs 15% and
17.4 vs 11.9% respectively. On the other hand, medical care receives only 6.1% in the CPI but
20.3% in the PCE index. The big difference in the medical care weights is due to the fact that the
                                                 6
       However, the CPI also has disadvantages insofar as it is confined to the urban population

and unabashedly leaves the prices faced by the rural population entirely out of consideration.

This means that the prices faced by 19% (2010) of the population are disregarded, hardly a

negligible issue inasmuch as the share of rural population was decreasing over time. In 1980 it

was 26%. 8 That alone introduces an uncanny element of uncertainty into the accuracy of the

inflation rate estimates. 9 However, this discrepancy creeps into the PCE index as well insofar as

for about three quarter of the items it does itself use the CPI as a baseline, thereby automatically

absorbing the weaknesses of the CPI in its own index (Moyer, 2006). As it turns out, which

index is used does make a substantial difference to the estimates of real growth rates: “the

average annual inflation rate of the 1979-2009 period was about 0.2 percentage points lower as

measured by the PCE price index than as measured by the CPI” (CBO 2012, p. 21). Although we

suspect that the CPI is more accurate for our purposes, we will nonetheless also use the PCE

index for the sake of completeness.

       There are other conceptual problems with the price indexes as well. The use of hedonic

pricing can lead to a rapid decline in the price index of products characterized by changes in

technical characteristics. 10 For example, the BLS calculates that the price of television services




PCE includes payments made not only by households but also by employers and government
programs (Moyer, 2006).

  Suppose that urban prices were 20% higher than rural prices and assume that both urban and
rural prices had remained unchanged; although prices had not changed at all, the change in
population would imply by itself that prices as they were experienced had increased by 1.2%.
That alone implies that without considering rural prices the inflation rate is inaccurate.
10
   According to one estimate the decline in the price of television using a hedonic index was 21%
just within four years in the mid-1990s (Moulton et al., 1998, Table 5).

has declined from 1980=105 to 2011=6!11 This seems exaggerated insofar as the price of color

televisions in the 70s and 80s was somewhere in the $400-$1,400 range. 12 This is not very

different from what today’s television costs. If the 17.5 ratio were accurate we would be able to

buy a new television today for $22 but such televisions do not exist. Arguably today’s televisions

are smart, have more bells and whistles including more pixels and more channels. On the other

hand, the various features of the TV set are bundled and therefore the consumer does not have

the choice to pick the ones she prefers insofar as the old system is no longer available for $22.

The consumer is forced to use the new system. In such cases the assumptions associated with the

use of hedonic prices do not apply in practice, 13 and hedonic regressions may not reflect

accurately consumers’ willingness to pay for those features. 14

       An additional crucial issue is that the price indexes are unavailable by income quintiles

which introduce an immense amount of inaccuracy and uncertainty into all of the calculations on

account of the fact that the consumption baskets vary substantially across the quintiles. Inasmuch

as the different kind of errors could accumulate over time, the longer is the time that separates

the end dates of the growth rate calculation, the less reliable are the price indexes. This is not a

one a sense of the intricacies and challenges of estimating price indexes. 15

Method of Estimating Welfare
       The growth in welfare is a crucial variable of interest in applied economic analysis. An

overlooked shortcoming of the literature associated with this complex of issues is that generally

welfare growth is conflated with income growth, even though it would be important to recognize

widely that income is actually an intermediate product of economic activity and welfare is the

final product. After all, income is an input into the generation of welfare. Moreover, insofar as

the law of diminishing marginal utility of income is one of the fundamental tenets of economic

theory we shall incorporate such non-linear functions into our estimates of welfare after we re-

estimated real incomes and their distribution.

       Applied welfare analysis has to assume that individual utility can be aggregated into a

social welfare function (Usher, 2016). Otherwise, the whole notion of living standards at the

population level would make little sense (Sen, 1970). “Our social welfare function will always

tend to take the form of a sum (or mean) of individual utilities” (Harsanyi, 1955). Harsanyi

argues that “economists and philosophers influenced by logical positivism have greatly

exaggerated the difficulties we face in making interpersonal utility comparisons” (2008). If the

profession insists on ordinal utility functions which cannot be aggregated and do not allow

interpersonal comparisons of utility than we should be consistent and expunge concepts such as




15
   BLS, “Comparison of BLS Price and Spending Measures,”
http://www.bls.gov/cex/oplc_program_comparisons.htm accessed December 27, 2015.
                                                  9
living standards completely from our canon. In sum, in the real world such comparisons are

unavoidable; indeed, they are central to applied economic analysis. 16

       Thus, we estimate trends in welfare in the spirit of a Bergson-Samuelson social welfare

function that translates the average income of a quintile into the welfare of a representative agent

of that quintile assuming diminishing marginal utility of income. This approach bears some

similarity to the strategy of Jones and Klenow (2010) who compare welfare across countries

using the technical apparatus of a logarithmic utility function on consumption. In a similar vein,

Becker et al. (2005) compare utility across countries after augmenting income with the value of

the gains in life expectancy.

       Analogously, the Human Development Index also assumes that per capita GDP also has

diminishing marginal impact on welfare (Fleurbaey and Blanchet, 2013). A comparable problem

arises in “the literature on sustainable development [which] has taken human wellbeing to be the

object to be sustained (Arrow et al., 2012).” In such cases the tacit assumption is that the utility

function of future generations will be comparable—if not identical—to that of the current

generation. Nordhaus and Tobin also draw a distinction between welfare and monetary measures

of economic activity: “GNP is not a measure of economic welfare.… Economists all know that,

and yet their everyday use of GNP as the standard of measure of economic performance

apparently conveys the impression that they are evangelistic worshippers of GNP (1973, p.

512).” In other words, in practice one can hardly avoid making some assumptions beyond pure

theory: “if one wants to say anything specific about social welfare, one must introduce explicit




16
  For example, Samuelson and Nordhaus discuss “the net social cost” of tariffs by adding the
gain of producers to the losses of consumers “counting each of these dollars equally”, as though
their utility functions and incomes were identical (2009, p. 353).
                                                 10
value judgements (Pattanaik, 2008).” These issues are also part of the optimal taxation literature

(Mirrlees 1971; Diamond and Mirrlees, 1971; Saez and Stantcheva, 2016).

       Although the form of the utility function is difficult to determine empirically, it is clear

that the relationship between income and welfare is concave and non-linear. 17 Hence, we convert

estimates of real income into welfare growth as explained below. Subsequently, assume that

welfare is not only a function of one’s own income but also of relative income (Duesenberry,

1949; Boskin and Sheshinski, 1978). Insofar as there is no consensus on the specification of such

reference-dependent utility functions, we propose two interdependent functional forms as

explained below (Alvarez-Cuadrado and Long 2011; Ljungqvist and Uhlig 2000).

Results
       Note that whenever we refer to the income of the whole population we have the median

for all households in mind; however, when we refer to incomes of the quintiles or percentiles we

have the average of the incomes within that group in mind. Note also that the CBO adjusts

incomes “for differences in household size by dividing income by the square root of the average

number of people in the household (CBO, 2014, p. i)” and we follow this procedure although this

adjustment makes only slight difference to the growth rates, insofar as average household size

changed but slightly in this period. 18

       In order to save space, our results are reported as follows: whenever we report the dollar

value of incomes we use the values before adjusting for household size. However, when we

report growth rates, we report those rates that are obtained after we divided the original values by

the square root of household size which are not reported here.

17
  Aggregating welfare has similar conceptual problems as aggregating incomes.
18
  Average household size was 2.76 in 1979, 2.56 in 2000 and 2.55 in 2011. The CBO assumed
the same household size for all income quintiles. In order to increase the accuracy of these
adjustments one would have to use quintile-specific household sizes which are unavailable.

        Improved Growth Rate Estimates, 1979-2011

        To reiterate, the high estimates use the modified CBO data (deflated with the PCE price

index) while the low estimates use the same data deflated with the CPI.

                Improved high estimates of growth rates

        The high estimates of the growth of median income are not changed markedly from the

original CBO estimates. It increases somewhat from 1.2% to 1.4% per annum (Tables 1 and A1,

Panel B). In addition, the growth rates of incomes in the first four quintiles are less than the CBO

baseline estimates. The lower the quintile the greater is the difference, with the first quintile’s

growth rate declining the most from 1.8% to 1.0% or by 44% (Tables 1 and A1, Panel C). The 5th

quintile’s estimated growth rates do not change at all.

        Growth rates varied considerably across the income distribution (Table 1, Panel C and

Figure 1). The lowest quintile grew well enough at 1.0% per annum, although the dollar value of

its average income was still a meager $17,900, which was barely the poverty threshold for a

family of three. Moreover, their income grew at a much slower rate than that of the 5th quintile


                                                    12
during this 32-year period. Hence, the income of the 1st quintile declined from 15% of the

income of the upper quintile to just 10%. In addition, the growth in income of the lower-middle

class (2nd quintile) and that of the middle class (3rd quintile) was the slowest, growing at a modest

rate of 0.6% to 0.7% per annum, thereby reinforcing the general impression of a floundering

middle class even with these high estimates. However, the upper-middle class (quintile 4) did

better, growing at 1.1% per annum, but it also fell behind the 5th quintile which grew almost

twice as rapidly, at a rate of 2.1%. Moreover, there were noteworthy differences even within the

5th quintile, insofar as the income of the top 1% grew at an “astronomical” pace of 3.9% per

annum, so that in the course of this period it grew from 7 times to 14 times the value of the

median income (Table 1 and Figure 1). Only the income of the 5th quintile grew faster than the

median income. In addition to the growth in median income which was between 0.9% and 1.4%

per annum one can also use the average of the five growth rates across the five quintiles as a

measure of central tendency for the whole population (Usher, 2016). Such an average would

lower the estimated growth rates of income for the whole population to between 0.6% and 1.1%

per annum.

               Improved low estimates of growth rate

       The low growth rate estimates were 0.5% less than the high ones and, therefore, were

quite subdued across the board with the exception of the 5th quintile which grew at a reasonable

rate of 1.6% per annum. The estimated growth rates of the 2nd and 3rd quintiles were hardly

distinguishable from (0.1%-0.2%) (Table 2, Panel C). They differed the most from the high

estimates in percentage terms. In fact, only quintile 5 registered an exceptional performance of

1.6% and within it the income of the top 1% grew at the stellar rate of 3.4%. In the main, all




                                                 13
three middle class quintiles were left very far behind with only quintile 4 advancing slightly at a

rate of 0.6% per annum (Table 2 and Figure 1).

       Growth in Welfare with independent utility functions

       Income growth is of interest primarily to the extent it is welfare enhancing. Hence, we

next convert incomes into an index of welfare and calculate its growth rate, first by assuming




                                                 14
independent utility functions, i.e., using iso-elastic utility functions 19 (Samuelson, 1969, p. 243):

        𝑦(𝑖)α
W(i)=               where W(i) is welfare, y(i) is the estimated income in quintile i= 1…5, and α is an
          𝛼

exponent such that 0.1 ≤α ≤ 1.0. Because we do not have a reliable empirical estimate of α, we

let it vary in increments of 0.1 in each of the quintiles. We also calculate W as the logarithm of

income as, for example, in Jones and Klenow (2010).

        The estimated growth of W depends on the exponent of income (Figures 2 and 3). 20

Generally, the growth rates approach zero as the exponent of income decreases. The range in

growth rates is substantial with the middle class 2nd and 3rd quintiles experiencing the smallest

increases while the 5th quintile and especially the top 1% holding the lead by quite a margin.

(The linear case (α = 1) is the one analyzed above inasmuch as in that case W=Y).

19
    In this function the marginal utility of income is inversely proportional to income. The
estimates of Layard et al. imply that marginal utility falls even faster than that (2008).
20
   In this and subsequent figures the point estimates in each group are connected by a smooth line
generated by the Excel program.

       The estimates trace a “U” shaped pattern across the five quintiles with a longer right arm,

a shape that is frequently referred to in the colloquial as the “hollowing out” of the middle class

(Stiglitz 2011). The 2nd and 3rd quintiles together compose 40% of the population which

experienced the slowest growth rates even the high estimates; the growth rates for this roughly

125 million people remain at or below 0.5% per annum as long as α≤0.6 and are as low as 0.1%

with the logarithmic utility function (or with α=0.1) (Figure 2). This pattern implies that even the

high growth rate estimates imply that for the middle class W might well have grown very

slowly—perhaps even imperceptibly. In vivid contrast, W of the top 1% of income earners grew

consistently at a rate in excess of 1% per annum as long as 0.3 ≤α and as fast as 3.9% with α=1

(Figure 2).

       The low estimates of the growth rate of W (Figure 3) are quite similar in shape and

substance to the high ones: these also indicate the “hollowing out of the middle class” as well as

the asymmetric “U” shape with a longer right arm. The only major difference between these two

sets of estimates is that the growth rates of W in quintiles 2 and 3 are much more compressed


                                                   16
toward zero (0.01%-0.20%) (Figure 3) than in Figure 2 (0.06%-0.73%). In fact, the low estimates

are barely distinguishable from zero for quintiles 2 and 3 regardless of α. In other words, the

“hollowing out” effect is much more pronounced with the low estimates (Figure 3).

          Figure 4 compares the estimated range of the high and low growth rates of W with

α = 0.1 and α = 1.0. This makes it clear that with small α growth in W is hardly distinguishable

from zero in all of the quintiles and with the low estimates the growth rates are minimal for the

middle class 2nd and 3rd quintiles even with large α’s.

          Welfare as a function of relative income

We next explore the growth in welfare as a function of relative income, i.e., with reference

dependence (Alvarez-Cuadrado and Long 2011; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Ljungqvist and Uhlig
                                                                                                 𝛼
                                                                                       𝑦(𝑖)
2000). We first assume an interdependent utility function such that W(𝑖 ) = �                    � ; where y is
                                                                                    �𝑦(5)−𝑦(𝑖)

values in increments of 0.1. 22 In this formulation the highest quintile is the reference group to which

people compare themselves and actual income is divided by the square root of the difference between

the 5th quintile and the other quintiles in the income distribution. For the 5th quintile the denominator

is set equal to one insofar as it is the highest quintile and is therefore its own reference. The results of

this specification are reported in Figures 5 and 6. We find that the growth in welfare is confined

exclusively to the 5th quintile with both the low and high estimates. All other quintiles experienced a

decline in welfare with all exponents. The higher are the α’s the lower are the growth rates in

quintiles 1-4. With large α’s the low estimates indicate that the decline is as high as 1% per annum in

the middle class quintiles (Figure 6).

   Note that the denominator decreases as the quintiles approach the 5th quintile and therefore the
fraction becomes greater. However, this is not the determining factor of the growth rates which
depend on the extent to which these fractions changed over time.

       We next assume that welfare is given by an interdependent utility function such that
                           𝛼
                𝑦(𝑖)
W(𝑖 ) = �                  � , where y is the estimated income in quintile (i), i=1,…4, α is an exponent
            �𝑦(𝑖+1)−𝑦(𝑖)


such that 0.1 ≤α ≤ 1.0 and takes on values in increments of 0.1. The reference group in this

version is the next higher quintile except for the 5th quintile, for which the denominator is again

set equal to one. In this case both the high and the low estimates are positive for the 1st quintile

inasmuch as it grew faster than the 2nd quintile in both periods (Figures 7 and 8). Growth in the

2nd quintile is slightly positive in the high estimates, while the low estimates are negative.

Growth rates in the 3rd and 4th quintiles are negative or negligible in both the low and high

estimates. In other words, the middle-class continues to flounder in this specification as well

(Figures 7 and 8).

Discussion
       This study estimating incomes and their growth rates—arguably among the most

important measures of economic performance—accentuates their sensitivity to the way in which

real incomes are calculated, especially to the price index used to convert nominal to real values
                                                      20
(McFadden 2014). As astonishing as it might sound, one of the salient outcomes of the above

exercise is the realization that these variables and their distribution across the five quintiles

cannot be estimated with great precision, given our current knowledge of the prerequisite

empirical evidence. The inconvenient truth is that there are too many uncertain elements in our

information set, so that much more research is needed in order to overcome these obstacles to

our understanding of this crucial topic. One of the many reasons is that the two price indexes

available provide substantially diverging estimates of the growth rates of real income.

       In addition to the reasons discussed above, there are many products and services today

that did not exist in 1979 which makes it challenging to compare the cost of living across

generations. For instance, in 1979 we did not have to pay at all for watching television while

now we do.23 Aside from introductory offers, basic cable services cost about $64 per month or

$768 per year. 24 If we were to subtract this single expenditure from the annual disposable income

of the bottom quintile of $17,948 the growth rates would decline by 0.1%: the upper-bound one

from 1% to 0.9% and the lower-bound one from 0.5% to 0.4%. In other words, such expenses

did not exist in 1979 but they make it much more difficult for the poor to maintain the living

standard that is considered normal for the times in which they live.

       Another inaccuracy creeps into the estimates on account of the way households are

defined insofar as the 2.3 million people in prison or the 0.5 million homeless, for example, are

left entirely out of consideration without explanation why this should be the case. 25 The number

of people in prison today is about 1.7 million more than in 1979. Suppose that they were all from

the first quintile and let us add their presumably zero incomes to those of the 1st quintile (Palaez,

2014). 26 This alone would lower the growth rate in the lowest quintile by 0.2%. Together with

paying for cable TV, these two factors alone would lower the income growth of the 1st quintile to

between 0.7% and 0.2%. In other words, even such a rough sensitivity analysis indicates that

even though the rate of growth in income of the poor exceeded those of the middle class, all of

their gains barely sufficed to pay for cable service if one also considers increases in the number

who are inexplicably not accounted for in these statistics. In addition, in spite of the gains, the

average income of the bottom quintile in 2011 was just $32 above the poverty income of a three-

person household. 27

       In order to increase the accuracy of the estimates we would also need to know how

household size and age varied by quintiles as well as the composition of the households. A

household with two adults has different needs and expenditures than a household with one adult

and a child and such issues are now left out of consideration. Yet another inaccuracy is

introduced by the fact that sales taxes, which are not progressive, and state taxes and property

taxes are also left out of consideration. Growth rates would also look considerably worst if we

accounted for economic insecurity which arguably increased during the period considered.

       Another question is the extent to which it is rigorous to compare welfare growth between

1979 and 2011 on account of the fact that roughly half of the people alive in 2011 were not alive

in 1979 (Census, 2011). 28 In other words, we are comparing welfare of people with quite

different utility functions. In any event, most people are not going to be impressed by what has

happened since 1979 because that is outside of the range of the experience even of most of the

people alive today. Instead, they are more likely to compare their current situation with more

recent reference points. 29

       An important caveat is that, admittedly, the year 2011 is hardly representative inasmuch

as market incomes were supported by government transfers on the basis of a $1.3 trillion deficit,

that is to say at the expense of generations yet unborn. This is regrettably a major weakness of

using post-transfer incomes as a gauge of economic performance and welfare, insofar as the

massive incidence of the burden of the debt on future generations is left out of the calculus.

Consequently, it appears as though the accumulation of government debt could improve the

welfare of the current generation. This, of course, is illusory not only because of Ricardian

equivalence, not only because the welfare of future generations should be included in the

calculations, but also because there are people today who do worry about the welfare of future

generations and whose anxiety and therefore welfare is influenced by the increasing debt. Given

the uncertainties associated with this complex of issues we do not pursue this line of analysis

   Population in 2010 was 309 million and in 1980 it was 227. That alone implies that 82 million
were not alive at the earlier date. In addition, considering today’s life table, roughly one-third of
the population dies within a 32 year period. That means that of the people alive in 1980 roughly
75 million probably passed away by 2011. Thus, together, about 158 million were not alive in
2011. This is about half of the 309 million population. U.S. Census, “2014 National Population

   Yet another problem with the welfare measure is that it does not include any estimate of risk
such as the variance of income over time. The incidence of such risk probably affects most the
lower income groups. We also do not consider expected social mobility which also has an impact
on utility.

other post-transfer income estimates.

       Note: Negative values indicate that taxes were greater than transfers.

       It is useful to explore the extent to which transfers and taxes modified market incomes.

Not surprisingly government transfers minus taxes were the largest in percentage terms in the 1st

quintile (Table 3). Their market income was increased by 31% by net transfers. The share

declines with higher incomes until it became negative in the 4th quintile. For them taxes were

greater than the transfers they received, so that their net income was smaller than their market

income by 8%. Only the 5th quintile (including the top 1%) was in a substantially negative

position, i.e., only they paid more taxes than the transfers they received. This is an indication of

the extent to which the transfers were financed by debt.

      Note: Negative values indicate that taxes were greater than transfers.

       Another question is the extent to which transfers net of taxes have increased or decreased

during this 32-year period (Table 4). Here we stumble upon the unexpected result that net

transfers of the 1st quintile have actually decreased over time while that of the three middle-class

quintiles increased markedly. The taxes on the 5th quintile (and on the top 1%) increased

substantially. The implication is that the hollowing out of the middle class occurred in spite of

the increases in government transfers.

Note: Negative values imply that taxes were greater than transfers. In such cases the
base used for the calculation is the increase in market income, implying that the gain
in market income was decreased by that percentage in order to obtain actual increase
in total income. In case of positive values the values indicate what share of the
increase in disposable income was made up by the increases in net transfers.
* Indicates that the net gains in income were practically nil so that the ratio is too
large to be relevant


       Consequently, the net transfers made up a substantial portion of the increases in total

incomes of the three middle classes (Table 5). According to the high estimates, all of the gains in

income in this 32-year period were made up of increases in net transfers in the 2nd and 3rd

quintiles whereas in the 4th quintile 37% was. In contrast, according to the low estimates, all of

the gain in total income was made up of net transfers (97%) in the 4th quintile. The net gain in

total income according to the low estimate was so small in the 3rd quintile that the gain in net

transfers was eight times as large as the increase in total incomes. Insofar as the net gains in the

2nd quantile were practically nil, even with the gains in net transfers, the ratio is too large to be

relevant. However, unexpectedly for the 1st quintile the increase in market income was greater

than the increases in disposable income. Thus, net transfers actually reduced the gains in market

income by between 19% and 49% (Table 5). Similarly, in the 5th quintile (and among the top

1%) net transfers were negative and reduced the gains in market income by 13% to 17%.

Conclusion

       The main goal of this paper is to ascertain the growth in welfare and that of post-tax,

post-transfer real incomes, upon which they are based, in the five quintiles of the income


                                                  25
distribution for the period 1979-2011. The 5th quintile is further decomposed into four percentile

groups including the top 1%. We include earnings only to the extent they increase current utility.

Hence, we take the CBO’s post-tax estimates as the basis, insofar as they pertain to disposable

income and, in addition, include cash transfers which the census figures exclude. We differ from

the CBO estimates insofar as we include only the present value of those earnings that will accrue

to the employees in the future. There are innumerable challenges in undertaking such an

exercise. As a consequence, the above estimates have to be considered preliminary. Nonetheless,

there are a few consistent patterns in which we have confidence that they will survive successive

improvements. 30

       These include most vividly what in the colloquial is referred to as the “hollowing out” of

the middle class. The lower-middle class 2nd quintile and the middle class 3rd quintile fared the

worst in all specifications: their income increased at a rate of between 0.1% and 0.7% per annum

(Figure 1 and Tables 1 and 2). In contrast, the only group whose income grew remarkably was

the 5th quintile and especially the top 1% whose income registered an astonishing growth rate of

between 3.4% and 3.9% per annum, reaching an average value of $918,000 by the end of the

period under consideration (Table 1 and Figure 1).

       Somewhat surprising is the consistently positive growth of the income of the lowest

quintile. The poorest group registered an income growth estimated to be between 0.5% and 1%,

i.e., consistently above that of the 2nd and 3rd quintiles, and equaling that of the 4th quintile

(Figure 1). This is all the more surprising insofar as their net transfers decreased over time while

those of the three middle class quintiles increased by as much as $9,000 per annum (Table 4). To



30
  One could also incorporate the value of the gains in life expectancy during this period as in
Becker et al. 2005. Insofar as the value of these gains differs substantially by age more empirical
work needs to be done before we could implement such estimates.
                                                   26
be sure, the income of the 1st quintile remained at the bare minimum to sustain life in the U.S.:

their average income of $17,900 per annum in 2011 was roughly at the level of the poverty

threshold for a family of three.

       The growth in income of the 4th quintile was comparable to that of the 1st quintile and

generally better than the 2nd and 3rd quintiles but much worse than the 5th quintile. These patterns

imply that the ratio of the income in the 2nd and 3rd quintiles declined slightly relative to that of

the 1st quintile whereas that of the 4th quintile remained unchanged and that of the 5th quintile

increased considerably (Table 6 and Figure 9), but it was the top 1% whose income grew

immensely to reach the spectacular level of 51 times the income of the 1st quintile.

       However, it is astounding that the relative income of the rest of the 5th quintile besides the

top 1% did not experience such humongous growth. Relative to the 1st quintile the 81-90

                                                  27
percentiles increased its income only marginally from a multiple of 4.8 to 5.4, the 91-95

percentiles increased from 5.8 to 7.2 and the 96-99 percentiles increased only from 8.1 to 11.3

(Figure 9). Only the top 1% increased enormously from a factor of 21 to a factor of 51, a surge of

no less than 144%. This is not only a clear indication of the rise of inequality 31 but also that it

was exclusively the top 1% whose income grew disproportionally, corroborating the well-known

skewing of the income distribution after 1980 (Lindert and Williamson 2016).

       Another recurring pattern is that the income of the 2nd and 3rd quintiles consistently

lagged behind the other quintiles. This is referred to in conventional parlance as the “hollowing

out of the middle class” (Desilver 2015). The high estimates of the growth rates in these two

quintiles are in the range of 0.6% - 0.7% per annum while the low estimates are in the range of

0.1% - 0.2%, i.e., they are actually difficult to distinguish from zero (Figure 1 and Table 7).

       According to the low estimates, it would take about 600 years for incomes in the 2nd

quintile to double and on the order of a millennium for welfare to double (Table 7). These are

growth rates that are reminiscent of those that prevailed prior to the Industrial Revolution.

Moreover, they are likely to be below the threshold levels for the brain to register a positive

change in the standard of living in real time. 32 This is particularly the case since the annual

absolute increases measured in dollars were all tiny except—again—in the 5th quintile. An

increase of a few dollars or even a few hundred dollars per annum is not likely to have registered

significantly (Table 8).



31
  Inequality also increased in the price of housing (Albouy and Zabek 2016).
32
  As an aside, it would be interesting to find out how fast do incomes have to rise before
individuals actually are able to ascertain an increase in their standard of living. Sensory
thresholds of real income growth would be the minimum level that a person can detect, perceive,
or recognize which is not obvious with thousands of prices changing continuously creating a lot
of background noise. Small changes in real income might well be beyond the computing ability
of the human brain to detect.

       Welfare growth with independent utility functions parallel the growth in incomes but is

moderated by its income elasticity (α): the lower is α, the lower is the growth in welfare. Hence,

welfare growth rates are most likely to be well below the estimated income growth rates. Put

another way, the estimated rates of income growth are the upper bound growth rates of welfare

with α=1. The growth in welfare is likely to be roughly half of the rate of income growth which

makes the estimated growth in welfare of the 2nd and 3rd quintile practically indistinguishable

from zero at between 0.06 and 0.36% per annum (Table 7). A logarithmic utility function yields

an even slower growth in welfare for the middle class of roughly 0.01% to 0.07% per annum.

However, for the top 1% the growth of welfare with α=0.5 implies a reasonable growth rate of

1.7% -- 1.9% per annum 33 (Figures 2 and 3).




33
  It is worthy of note in this regard that Becker et al. (2005) assert that the elasticity of utility
with respect to consumption is 0.2.
                                                   29
         With interdependent utility functions the growth in welfare depends not only on one’s

own income growth but also on the rate of growth of a reference group. Hence, we obtain a

pattern that is entirely different from the one obtained for welfare using independent utility

functions. In the first specification in which quintile 5 is the reference group it is the only one

that experiences positive growth rates (Figures 5 and 6). With the exception of the 5th quintile the

high estimates of welfare growth are either zero or negative while the low estimates are all

negative without exception.

         In the second specification with an interdependent utility function in which the reference

is the next higher quintile, the 1st quintile grows somewhat but only the 5th quintile grows

meaningfully (Figures 7 and 8). In contrast, welfare growth in quintiles 2-4 was mostly negative.

The only slightly positive growth in the three middle-class quintiles was the high estimate of the

income growth of the 2nd quintile (Figure 7). In other words, the “hollowing out” effect is quite

evident also in this specification.

         In sum, none of the estimates point to an economy that is able unambiguously to enhance

welfare of most—let alone all—of its participants. Rather, the evidence points consistently to the

relative decline in the income and welfare of the middle class which is especially strong with

interdependent utility functions. This is one of the most persistent patterns that emerge from this

study.

         Subjective evaluations of economic well-being support the conclusion of a decline in

welfare of the middle class inasmuch as such surveys do not find a lot of positive emotions when

people are asked about their economic situation (Scitovsky 1976). For instance, the happiness

index in the U.S. has been declining for decades even before the financial crisis (Easterlin, 1974;

2015, Figure 13.8; 2016, Figure 2). Moreover, at the time of writing 55% of the population is



                                                  30
said to be thriving, 42% report that they are struggling financially, while 3% are suffering

(Gallup, 2015). These estimates provide quantitative support for these subjective evaluations and

why there is a general feeling of malaise in the population that includes a substantial increase in

the suicide rate (Curtin et al., 2016). As Stiglitz et al., suggest, “one of the reasons that most

people may perceive themselves as being worse off even though average GDP is increasing is

because they are indeed worse off (2010).” 34

 Appendix A. Comparison of original Census and CBO income estimates

        The estimates in this appendix are based on the original data from the Census and from

 the CBO. Hence, they are not appropriate for estimating the growth in welfare insofar as the

 former does not consider transfers and taxes whereas the latter does consider post-tax, post-

 transfer incomes but it conflates current earnings with earnings that will accrue in the future. We

 republish them here nonetheless in order to report of the current state of knowledge in this regard

 and in order to show the differences between these estimates. The Census and the CBO also use

 different price indexes to convert nominal into real values. Consequently, there are considerable

 differences between the two estimates although the median incomes for 1979 are almost

identical; for 2000 they are reasonably close but for 2011 the Census estimate of the median is

$17,000 lower than the CBO’s estimate (Tables A1 and A2 Panel A). That is quite a discrepancy.

               Estimates of growth rates 1979-2011

       During the 32 years that elapsed between 1979 and 2011 the increase in median real

household income was 46% according to the CBO whereas the Census estimate implies a tepid

increase of merely 10% (Tables A1 and A2, Panel B, and Figure A1). The large difference

between the two estimates is due to the use of the different price indexes and the fact that 2011

was a year in which the economy was still in the doldrums but there were unusually large

transfer payments ($1.3 trillion) 35 for unemployment benefits and for food stamps which

increases the CBO data. In 2007 the transfer payments for food stamps amounted to $31 billion

whereas by 2011 it rose to $73 billion. 36 Thus, 2011 is hardly a representative year. Because of

the humongous federal government deficit, the transfers were actually financed by generations

yet unborn.

       As far as growth in the five quintiles is concerned, according to the CBO the lowest and

the top quintiles made significant advances but the middle three quintiles also grew adequately

during this 32-year period: growth rate was above 1.1% per annum in all quintiles (Table A1,

Panel C). In stark contrast, the Census’s estimate shows no increase at all within the lowest

quintile, and only the income growth of the top quintile exceeded 1%. Moreover, the middle

three quintiles hardly grew at all (0.0-0.3%) (Table A2, Panel C and Figure A1). If one were to

consider the additional issue of the standard error of the price index the confidence interval of

these growth rates would include negative values (Shoemaker 2015). As mentioned above, these

estimates are both biased. The Census estimate particularly paints an excessively rosy picture of

economic performance.

                Estimates of growth rates 2000-2011

The two sets of estimates diverge even more for the 21st century. While the CBO estimate does

not indicate a slowdown at all as most growth rates exceed 1.0% per annum, the Census

estimates indicate not only a substantial diminution in growth rates but a sinking into negative

territory for the median as well as for all quintiles with the first quintile declining the most:

-1.4% per annum (Table A2, Panel C and Figure A2). So they could hardly be more different. It

is as though they were not referring to the same country at all. The difference is due to the

increase in transfers (by 56%) and decline in taxes (by 22%) and the concomitant increase in

budget deficit. 37

  In order to calculate the growth rates of welfare more accurately, one would have to consider
the extent to which Ricardian equivalence, i.e., the increase in budget deficit impacted on the
welfare of the population. This is not possible at the present due to the lack of empirical
evidence. While empirical studies tend to disprove the validity of Ricardian equivalence as far as
the economic sphere is concerned (Stanley, 1998), in the recent U.S. situation it seems to have

Appendix B. Improved Estimates of income growth in the 21st century

       Improved high growth rate estimates, 2000-2011

       In the 21st century even the high improved estimates of growth rates in median income

was markedly slower than during the 32-year period. The decline was from 1.4% to 0.3% per

annum (Tables 1 and B1, Panel C). However, the growth rates of the first three quintiles

remained approximately the same as those for the whole period under consideration. This implies

that the 1st quintile continued to have relatively decent growth, whereas the growth in the two

middle-class quintiles remained weak. The 4th and 5th quintiles joined the ranks of the snail-

paced growth ones and the top 1% even experienced a decline in income by about $54,000 from

close to a million dollars to closer to $900,000 per annum. In other words, the only group that

experienced above-average growth rates was the poor, but, of course, income still remained near

the poverty level of just under $18,000 per annum (Table B1). The percentiles between 81% and

99% were also doing well according to these estimates.


had a large impact on politics insofar as the substantial increase in government debt led to the
“Tea Party” movement which then blocked further government action on economic matters.

       Improved low growth rates estimates, 2000-2011

       In the 21st century the improved low estimates of growth of median income came to a

complete standstill; growth was also slower in all quintiles as the sluggish growth spread to the

upper-middle class as well as to quintile 5 (Table B2). The estimates of the rate of growth in the

three middle class quintiles are negligible, between 0.1% and 0.3%. 38 The increase in income in

first quintile in the 11 years was a meager $1,700. The upper 1% experienced a decline in

average income to just over $900,000 per annum.




38
   Note that growth within each quintile is positive while the growth of the median is zero. While
this might appear odd, the reason is that the growth within the quintiles is that of the average in
that quintile and not that of the median. Hence, the higher incomes within a quintile have a larger
impact on the average than they would have if the medians of the quintiles were reported by the
CBO.
