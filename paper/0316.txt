      The Effect of Demographic Factors on Age-Earnings Profiles

                                  ABSTRACT

      This paper examines the effect of the increased number of young

persons on the job market on their earnings relative to the earnings

of older workers.   The principal finding is that the age-earnings

profile of male workers appears to be significantly influenced by

the age composition   o~   the work force.   When the number of young workers

increased sharply in the 1970s, the profile lItwisted l l against them, apparently

because younger and older male workers are imperfect substitutes in production.

The effect of changes in the relative numbers of workers of different ages

on age-earnings profiles is especially marked among college graduates.

By contrast, the age-earnings profile of female workers, which tends to be

quite flat, appears to be little influenced by the age composition of the

female work force, possibly because the intermittent work experience of women

makes younger women and older women closer substitutes in production.

      Whether the sizeable decline in the earnings of the large cohort of

young workers entering the market in the 1970s relative to the earnings of

older cohorts will persist, creating a lifetime lI s ize of cohort" earnings

effect, or whether the new entrants of the 1970s will significantly catch up

in earnings in future years remains to be seen.      The dependence of the age-

earnings profile on demographically-induced movements along a relative demand

schedule suggests that standard human capital models of the profile, which

posit that earnings rise with age or experience solely as a result of indi-

vidual investment behavior are incomplete.

     The age distribution of the labor force varies greatly over time in

response to longterm demographic changes.     Historically high birth rates

produce a relatively large number of younger labor force partie ipants and

an age distribution skewed toward younger ages while historically low
                                        1
birth rates have the opposite impact.       Because of the "baby boom" that

followed World War II and peaked in   1955~60   (U.S. Bureau of the Census,

1977, p. 56), there was an especially significant change in the age

structure of the U.S. work force in the late 1960s and early 1970s,

when the number of young persons increased extremely rapidly.

From 1966 to 1976 the number of labor force participants aged 20-24 grew

from 9.7 million to 16.7 million while the number aged 25-34 grew from

16.9 million to 23.0 million.   The ratio of participants less than 35
                                                                    2
years of age to participartts 35 and over jumped from .46 to .67.

    What are the consequences for the wage structure of such sizeable

changes in the age composition of the labor force?      Does an increase in

the relative number of young workers alter their wages relative to the

wages of older workers?   To what extent do cross-sectional age-earnings

profiles respond to exogenous demographic shifts?      What are the possible

implications of the experience of the late 1960s and 1970s for the

decade of the 1980s, whert the number of young workers is expected to decline?
    The answen Â·to these questions depend on the degree of flexibility

of relative wages by age or, in the context of standard labor demand

analysis, on elasticities of complementarity (Hicks, Sato and Koizuma)

which link changes in factor prices to changes in the supply of inputs.

 If the relevant elasticities are large, changes in the age composition

 of the labor force can substantially alter age-earnings profiles whereas
                                                                     2

if the elasticities are small, profiles will be relatively independent of

the number of workers in different age groups.

    This paper studies the effect of changes in the age structure of

the work force on age-earnings profiles in the U.S. and provides estimates

of the relevant elasticities of complementarity for young and older workers.

It focuses in particular on developments h the late 1960s and in the 1970s,

when the relative number of young workers increased sufficiently rapidly

as to: provide a strong "test" of .the potential dependence of the profile

on exogenous shifts in the age structure of the labor supply.      Section   on~

documents the magnitude of the change in the age structure of the work

force   which constitutes the "-experimental" variation under study.      Sec tion

two presents evidence frem the Current Population Surveys of the U.S.

Bureau of the Census that the age-earnings profile of male workers changed

in the period, with the ratip of the earnings of   ol~er   men to the eacnings of

younger men rising sharply.   Section three develops the relevant labor

demand and production function models needed to analyze the link between

changes in the age structure of the work force and changes in age-earnings

profiles.   Section four estimates the extent to which shifts in age-

earnings profiles can be attributed to demographically induced movements

along labor demand schedules whose magnitude is reflected in the relevant

eiasticities of eomplementarity.

    The principal finding is that the age-earnings profile of male workers,

which has traditionally been viewed as a stable economic relation determined

by human capital investment decisions, appears to be significantly influenced

by the age composition of the work force.   Apparently because younger and

older male workers are imperfect substitutes in production, changes in the

number of young male workers relative to older male workers substantially

influences the ratio of the earnings of younger men to the     earni~qs   of older   ~en.
                                                                  3


The effect of changes in the relative numbers of workers of different

ages on age-earnings profiles is especially marked among college graduates.

By contrast, the age-earnings profile of female workers, which tends to be

quite flat, appears to be little influenced by the age composition of the

female work force, possibly because the intermittent work experience of

women makes younger women and older women closer substitutes in production.

    Whether the sizeable decline in the earnings of the large cohort of

young workers entering the market in the 1970s relative to the earnings of

older cohorts will persist, creating a lifetime "size of cohort" earnings

effect, or whether the new entran1B of the 1970s will significantly catch

up in earnings in future years remains to be seen.

    The dependence of the age-earnings profile on demographically-induced

movements along a relative demand schedule suggests that standard human

capital models of the profile, which posit that earnings rise with age or

experience solely asa result of individual investment behavior are

incomplete.   If, as found in this study, elasticities of substitution

or complementarity among age groups are not infinite, human capital

cannot be treated as a homogeneous input with a single rental price,
 whose "units" of investment determine the age-earnings prof iles.

 Differences in the activities of young and old workers and the underlying

 demand for those activities decisively influence the shape of the profile.

 To understand the relation between earnings and age, it is necessary to

 analyze the demand for workers by age and employer personnel policies

 as well as to analyze human capital investment dec isions.

1.   The Changing Age Struc ture of the Work Fo:.ce

      The broad outlines of the remarkable change in the age structure of

the work force of the United States under investigation is examined in

Table 1, which records the absolute number of workers aged 20-24 and 25-34 and
the number aged 20-24 and 25-34 relative to the number of workers            a~ed   35 and

over for the period 1966 to 1976.      The tab1etreats male and female workers and

college graduates and high school graduates separately.          These patterns of

change stand out in the table:      a remarkable increase in the number of

young workers in total, the result of the "baby boom" that followed World
WarII;an even greater percentage increase in the number of young college

graduate workers, the result of the unprecedented proportion of young persons

choosing to enroll in college in the 1960s; and an especially marked

increase in the number of young female workers, the result of a sizeable

jump in the labor participation rate of young women in the late 1960s and

19705.
      Among male workers, the numbers aged 20-24 and 25-34 increased by

over one-third from 1966 to 1976 while the number of college graduates aged

20-24 and aged 25-34 more than doubled.      As a result of these changes, the

ratio of all male workers 20-34 to those 35 and over rose from .55 in

1966 to .78 in 1976 while the ratio of male college graduate workers 20-34

years of age to male college graduate workers 35 and over increased from
.62 (1966) to 1.02    (l97~).   According to the figures   in   Panel B, the nnmber

of female workers aged 20-24 increased by 76% while the number aged 25-34 in-

creased by 103%.     These gains outstripped the rate of increase of the older female

work force by sufficient magnitudes to raise the ratio of 20-24 to 35+

year old female workers by 53% and the ratio of 25-34 to 35+ year old female

workers by 76%.    Among college graduate workers, the number of young
                                                                          5

 women aged 20-24 more than doubled while the number aged 25-34 more than

 tripled.   While less dramatic, the number of young female high school

 graduate workers also increased, particularly in the 25-34 bracket.

     Data on the number of new high school and college graduates and on

the number of new graduates entering the labor market tell a similar

story about the influx of young persons into the work force, though the

timing of changes necessarily differs from that in Table 1.           Between

1960 and 1970 the nunber of new high school graduates per thousand persons
                                                         1
in the civilian labor force rose from 26.8 to 35.0.-          From 1960 to 1972

the number of high school graduates and dropouts entering the job market

grew from 13.2 per thousand members of the civilian labor force to 17.1
                                                     4
per thousand members of the civilian labor force.            For college graduates

the picture is more complex, as the tendency to enroll for graduate studies

in the 1960s delayed the labor market entrance of the large classes of

the sixties until the following decade.      From the late 1960s to the mid 19705,

however, the ratio of new bachelor's graduates on the market to the civilian
                                 5
labor force increased sharply.

     Because data on graduates refer to flows rather than stocks of persons

in a wide age grouping, they reveal further the beginning of the decline

in the number of young workers which will mark the 1980s.           From 1972 to

1977 the persons graduating fr011l high school grew by a bare 4% (U.S.

Bureau of the Census, p. 153).       From 1974 to 1976, the number of persons

graduating from college fell by 3.0% (op. cit., p. 153).           The beginning of

the demographic change from the large cohorts of young persons of the late

1960s and 1970s to the smaller cohorts of young persons of the 1980s can

be seen in these figures.

      While not a "classical experiment" with all other factors held fixed,

 the sizeable increase in the number of young workers found in Table 1

and in the graduates data cited above and the concurrent change in the

age composition of the work force constitutes the type of exogenous

 shift in the age composition of the work force that should provide a

reasonably strong test of whether the age-earnings relation depends on

 factors beyond investments in training.   Was the change in supply accompanied

by changes in relative wages?




II.   Changes in the Relative Earnings of Young Workers

      Evidence on earnings by age from the Current Population Survey of the

Bureau of the Census provides an answer to this question.     The CPS data show

that for male workers, who traditionally have had steep cross-sectional

age-earnings profiles, the demographic changes of the late 1960s and of

the 1970s were accompanied by a substantial "twist" in the age-earnings

profile against the young.   By contrast, among female workers, who have

traditionally had flat age-earnings profiles, the demographic changes do

not appear to have altered the relative wages of the young.     While other

factors (to be explored in section IV) may have also been at work, the

concatenation of increases in relative numbers and decreases in relative

wages in the period is highly suggestive of movement along a negatively

sloped demand curve, with a moderate elasticity of substitution between

workers of different ages.

      Table 2 summarizes the CPS evidence on age-earnings profiles in

terms of the ratio of the income or earnings of 45-54 year old workers
to the incomes or earnings of 20-24 or 25-34 year old workers, in toto
                                                                        8


and for high school graduates and     colle~e   r,raduates taken separately.

The figures in lines 1-8 are taken from the U.S. Bureau of the Census'

Current Population Reports, with the data for 1975 adjusted to take account

of changes in the imputation procedure used by the Census.        As discussed

in Current Population Reports, Consumer Income Series P-60, No. 105,

the Census made major changes in its methbd of computing estimates in

1975 when it introduced a new imputation procedure to estimate        missin~


records.    The new procedure tends to raise the average earnings of more

educated and older workers relative to what would have resulted from the

previous imputation procedure.      For comparability over time, the 1975

data in    th~   table are adjusted to a pre-1975 basis by multiplying the

reported 1975 figures by the ratio of incomes in 1974 calculated from the

old imputation procedure to incomes in 1974 calculated from the new

     Lines 1-4 treat the mean incomes of all workers who report greater than
zero values for the year.      These incomes are likely to be sensitive to cyclical

changes in unemployment rates.      Lines 5-8 are based on the incomes of year-

round full-time workers, which should be less sensitive to the cycle and

which should offer a better measure of rates of pay than the incomes of all

workers.     For women, the sizeable number of part-time    wor~ers   and significant

non-wage incomes makes interpretation of the incomes for all        work~rs    complex,

suggesting that attention be focused on year-round full-time employees.             The

final lines of the table record ratios of usual weekly earnings.            These

figures have the advantage of refering to labor market earnings rather

than total incomes and of covering narrower age groups.         They suffÂ·er from

lack of information on years of schooling.

in age-earnings profilns, with the income or earnings of older men rising

sharply relative to the income or earnings of younger men:           For all men,

the data in lines 1 and 2 show an increase of 20 points in the ratio of the

incomes of 45-54 year olds to the income of 20-24 year olds and an increase

of 5 points in the ratio of the incomes of 45-54 year olds relative to the

income of 20-24 year aIds.      The comparable changes for year-round and

full-time workers in lines 5 and 6 are 24 points and 8 points.           With the best

measures of   rate~   of pay, median usual weekly earnings, there is a rise

in the ratio of the earnings 'of 45-49 year aIds to the earnings of 20-24

year olds not enrolled in.school of 33      points from 1967 to 1977 and a rise

in the ratio of the earnings of 45-49 year olds to the earnings of 25-29 year

olds of 15 points.

     The figures for college and high school graduates show further that the

"twist" in male age-earnings profiles was most pronounced for college graduates.

Between 1968 and 1975 the ratio of the incomes of 45-54 year old year-round

and full-time male college graduates to the incomes of 25-34 year old year-

round and full-time male college    ~raduates   rose   by   25 percentage points or 18

percent while the comparable ratio for male high school graduates rose by 11

points or 9 percent.     Similarly, for all male college graduates, the ratio of

the incomes of 45-54 year aIds to the incomes of 25-34 year olds rose by 19

percentage points while the ratio of the incomes of high school graduates 45-54

years old to the income of high school graduates 25-34 years old rose by just

9 percentage points.

     The data for women tell a different story.         The mean incomes for all

workers show a rise in the income of women aged 45-54 relative to the income

of women aged 20-24 but do not show a rise in the income of women aged 45-54

'to the income of women aged 25-34 and depict a drop in the income of older high

school or college graduate women relative to younger high school or college

graduate women (lines 3,4).     On the other hand, the mean incomes for

year-round and full-time workers show an increase in the ratio of the income
                                                                         11
of 45-54 year olds compared to the income of 20-24 year olds but not compared to

the incomes of 20-24 year olds.        The unclear pattern in the data may reflect the

general flatness of the age-earnings profile for women, particularly for year-round
and full-time workers.      If the flat profiles result from high substitutnbility

structure of the population would have little or no impact on the          profile~.

     Because age-earnings profiles differ markedly between men and women and

appear to have changed only for men in the period covered, the remainder

of this study will focus solely on male age-earnings relations.           The flat

and apparently stable profiles among women suggest very different economic
processes at work, which merit separate detailed study beyond the scope

of the current inquiry.



Analysis of male earnings using CPS data tapes

     More precise estimates of the extent of change in the          age-earnin~s


profiles of male workers can be obtained by linear regression analysis of

the effect of age on earnings using the CPS data on individuals that

 underlies the published aggregates.         Regression analysis of the data for

 individuals has several advantages over comparisons of published means:

 it permits investigation of labor market earnings (rather than of incomes,

 as given in Current Population Reports Series P-60); it permits calculation

 of weekly earnings (yearly earnings over weeks worked) as an indicator

 of rate of pay; it allows for greater disaggregation of workers by age

 and education; and it can be used more readily to make statistical tests of

 the significance of observed changes. 8

 in the period under study using CPS        dat~   on individuals, the following

The results of the calculations are summarized in Table 3 in terms of differences

between the coefficients on the log earnings of workers aged 45 to 54 and the

coefficients on the log earnings for workers in younger age brackets for persons

with 12 years of schooling (e ..g .. high          ~chool   graduates) and for persons with

16 years of schooling (e.g. college graduates), taken separately.                     Comparable

estimates for other education groups are also available, but for simplicity are

not given in the table.              In the left side of the table the dependent variable is

    the log of weekly earnings, the best measure of rates of pay on the March CPS

    files.        The right hand side of the table treats the log of annual earnings.              The

    computations confirm the finding of a sizeable decline in the earnings of young

    workers relative to the earnings of older workers, particularly among the more

    educated.        Among high school graduates, the log weekly earnings of 45-54 year

    olds is 18 log points higher relative to the log weekly earnings of 18-24 year

    olds in 1977 than in 1968; is .17 points higher relative to the log earnings of

    25-29 year olds in 1977 than in 1968; is .09 points higher relative to the log

    earnings of 30-34 year olds in 1977 than in 1968; and is 10 points higher relative

    to the log earnings of 35-44 year olds in 1977 than in 1968.               Among men    with

    four years of college, the changes are greater, with increases of 30 log

    points in the difference between the log earnings of 45-54 year olds and
                                                                     14


the log earnings of 18-24, 25-29, and 30-34 year aIds respectively from

1968 to 1977.    In other education groups, the results are comparable.    While

not all of the changes in the difference in log earnings are significant at

the 5% level, those for the mare educated group are highly significant.

       The calculations using log annual earnings tell a similar story, with

the earnings of the older workers rising relative to those of younger

workers, especially among the college educated.
       We conclude that there was, in fact, a substantial change in the age-

earnings profiles for male workers during the period when the number of

young workers increased relative to the number of older workers.       Are these

two changes causally linked?     To what extent can the twist in the age-earnings

profile against the young be attributed to the shaTp increase in the relative

nmnber of young workers?


III.    Labor Demand and Age-Earnings Profiles

       In the framework of standard labor demand analysis, the impact of changes

in the relative supply of workers by age on wages depends on the substitutability

of inputs.    When labor of different ages is readily substitutable for other

inputs, large    changes in supply will cause only modest changes in wages

by age.    Conversely, when substitutabil"ity is limited, sizeable changes in

age-earnings profiles are needed for demand to adjust to changes in the age

composition of the work force.    Since the number of workers of different

ages is taken as exogenously determined by demographic changes, the demand

for labor schedule becomes a wage determination schedule, linking factor

prices to factor quantities.     In such a model, Hicks' elasticity of

complementarity, which relates factor prices to inputs (see Hicks, Sato

and Koizuma) is the appropriate elasticity concept, rather than the

standard Allen elasticity of substitution.       In this study I will concentrate

on the inverse of the Hicks elasticity, defined as:
                                                                                                     15

Equation (4) shows lww changes in the quantities of all inputs or changes

in the quantities of inputs relative to the input i alter the wage of input i.

To see how changes in inputs alter relative wages, let i index one input

(say older workers) and k index another input (say, younger workers), then

subtract the factor price equation based on (4) for input k from that for

input i to obtain:

        (5)          Wi - Wk =          j+~l:k[ai(Sij         - Skj)"L j ] + ai[Sii - SkilLi - ak[Sik - Skk]L k Â·


        When factors other than k and i do not affect the ratio of their marginal

products, the elasticity of complementarity is equal to one divided by the

standard Allen elasticity of sub$titution (see Hicks, Sato and Koizuma),

giving the following relative wage determination equation:

        (6)          Wi - W

Production functions and elasticities

     The relevant elasticities of complementarity or substitution for workers

in different age groups are estimated in this study assuming one of two

functional forms for the production process:          the constant elasticity of

substitution (CES) form and the translogarithmic (TL) form.

     The CES form has both desirable and undesirable features for empirical

analysis of the effects of       c~anges   in the relative number of workers by age

on age-earnings profiles.        On the positive side, since the CES has only one
              .
elasticity of substitution, the appropriate relative wage equation

is of the form of (6), which is reasonably simple to estimate and which

provides direct information on the impact of relative quantities on relative

earnings.   The possibility that changes in relative wages, of the type

observed in the 1970s, are due largely to cyclical rather than demographic

changes can be readily        e~amined   with equation (6) by addition of variables   measurin~

the business cycle.     The major disadvantage of the CES is that it cannot be used
to test the possibility that in a consistent production function framework

changes in other factors, such as capital, may be influencing the relative

demand for labor of different ages.

     The translogarithmic production function provides an appropriate

system for examining the effect of changes in the supply of several inputs

on age-earnings profiles.         The TL form yields a consistent system of

demand equations with potentially different elasticities of complementarity

(or substitution) between any pair of inputs.           In the translog production

system, the production function is:

     (7)    lnY   = A + Ea.
                        i ~
                               lnL i + 1/2 LEy .. lnL. lnL.

The derived demand equations are:

     (8)


subject to cross equation and within equation restrictions on the parameters



    (10)         L:y i' =
                 j    J

where a.~    =   share of input i in cost

      Lj     = amount            of input j.

Equation (8) relates the share of each input in cost to the                        qu.:-~ntities


of inputs; since quantities are given, the equations are in effect relative

wage equations, dependent on how the wage components of cost change when

quantities change.                The Hicks elasticities of complementarity can be

readily derived from the translog system by differentiation with respect

to the relevant L                  and appropriate algebraic manipulation using the
                             i
fact that Sij           = ffij/fif j         (See Sato and Koizumi, p. 47).       The resultant
                        12

Equations (11) and (12) relate the elasticities of complementarity to the

parameters of the equation and factor shares.

     The TL system has one major advantage as a model of demand:                             it

provides estimates of elasticities of complementarity for more than two

inputs in a consistent production function framework.                          It has two dis-

advantages.        First, specification                    or measurement error in the equation for

a factor of only marginal concern, such as for capital in the case at hand,

can greatly impact estimates of the demand equations for other factors. Second,

the TL model is an equilibrium model that cannot be readily modified to
                                                                     18


allow for the effect of cyclical factors on relative demands.

     Since neither the CES nor TL models of production or demand are without

problems, the effect of the age composition on relative wages by age will

be estimated using both models.    By using two functional forms, each of which

has weaknesses and strengths, I hope to obtain a better fix on the key

demand relation under study than could otherwise be done.



IV   Determinants of Change in Male Age-Earnings Profiles

      Table 4 presents estimates of the impact of the ratio of the number of

younger workers to the number of older workers, the state of the business cycle,

and a general trend on the curvature of male age-earnings profiles.       The

dependent variables in the calculations are the log of the income of 45-54

year old men relative to the income of 25-34 year old men (lines 1-5)

and the log of the income of 45-54 year old men relative to the income of

20-24 year old men (lines 6-8).    Lines 1"';2 and 6-7 refer to the incomes of year-

round full-time workers.   As noted earlier, these incomes provide a better

measure of wages than do the incomes of all workers; unfortunately they

are not available until 1955.     Lin~s   3 and 8 treat the ratio of the mean

income of all men with non-zero incomes in the relevant age groups over

the period 1947-1974.   These figures provide additional time series

variation in the data at the expense of potential confounding of changes

in utilization of labor with changes in wage paid.      Lines 4 and 5 consider

the age-earnings profiles of college graduates and high school graduates

separately for the limited number of years for which such figures are

available.

      There are three independent variables.      The changing age structure
                                                                    19



of the work force is measured by the log of the ratio of the number of

male workers aged 45-54 to the number aged 25-34 (lines 1-5) or to the

number aged 20-24 (lines 6-8).   To test the possibility that changes in

relative earnings by age are dominated by cyclical rather than demographic

factors, the calculations also include   a   measure of the state of the business

cycle, the deviation of the log of real gross national product (GNP) from

its trend level:   positive deviations reflect a strong economy while

negative deviations are indicative of recession conditions.      This
measure of the cycle is highly correlated with such alternative busindss

cycle indicators as the rate of unemployment or the difference between actual

and   potential gross national product (see Freeman, 1973).     Because of

the operation of formal seniority systems and because older workers will

have cumulated specific human capital while young workers will not, labor

demand is likely to be more cyclical for young than for older workers,

suggesting that the deviation of real GNP from trend will be negatively

related to the ratio of income of older to younger workers.      The third

independent variable, a time trend, is introduced to control for any of a

variety of factors (greater education of the young, gradual shifts in

industrial structure) which might influence the demand for young as opposed

to older male workers and thus the relevant income ratios.

      The regression results suggest that, with trend and cyclical factors

fixed, the relative number of older to younger Â·workers has a significant
impact on male age-earnings profiles.    In~e    calculations focusing on tpe

income of 45-54 year aIds relative to 25-34 year aIds, the measure of

relative numbers by age obtains a significant negative coefficient, except

among high school graduates (line 4).    In line I, which analyzes the incomes
                                                                     20




of year-round and full-time workers with the trend variable omitted, the

log of the ratio of the number of 45-54 year oldto the number of 25-34 year old
workers obtains a coefficient of -.27, three times its standard error.
Inclusion of tthe trend in line 2 reduces the coefficient on relative numbers

substantively, but still leaves a significant relation between relative

numbers by age and relative incomes by age.     In line 3, which treats the

income of all men over the period 1947-1974, the coefficient on the

relative number is a highly significant -.20.

       The regressions for the income of year-round full-time workers

aged 45-54 relative to the income of year-round full-time workers aged

20-24 in lines 6 and 7 also yield sizeable significant coefficients for

the relative number of workers by   ag~   though in these cases addition

of the time trend raises rather than reduces the estimated coefficients.

In line 8, by contrast, the ratio of the number of 46-54 year old workers

to the number of 20-24 year aIds has no apparent impact on relative incomes.

This is due largely to the trend term, which is highly collinear with the

relative numbers variable over the period:     with trend deleted, the

coefficient on relative numbers in regressions explaining the ratio of the

income of 45-54 year aIds to the income of 20-24 year aIds is -.31 with a

standard error of .09.

       The business cycle indicator, the deviation of real GNP from its

trend has little impact on the income ratios of year-round and full-time

male workers in lines I and 2, suggesting that the wages of 25-34 year

old men are no more sensitive to the cycle than those of 45-54 year old

men.    In the regre"ssion for all male workers in line 3, however, the cyclical

variable is accorded a sizeable effect, which presumably reflects the

greater cyclical sensitivity of the time worked of the younger men.

Much stronger cyclical effects are obtained in the calculations for

the income of 45-54 year old men relative to the income of 20-24

year olds in lines 6-8, indicating that cyclical ups-and-downs have their

greatest impact on the incomes of 20-24 year aIds.

      The regressions in lines 4 and 5, which focus on the age-earnings

profiles of collegef,raduates and high school graduates, respectively,

suggest that the increased number of young male workers relative to the

number of older male workers had an especially large impact on college

graduates profiles compared to only a modest impact on high school graduates

profiles.     Similar results based on different models and data, have also

been obtained by other scholars.    Using the Michigan Panel Survey on

Income Dynamics, William Johnson found that the relative size of a

cohort significantly reduced the impact of the earnings of college graduates

but had little effect on the earnings of less educated workers (p. 13).

Using the CPS Demographic files, Finis Welch found a significant effect

of   c~hort   size on earnings in all school groups, with however much

larger elasticities for college graduates.      All of these results suggest

that younger and older workers are better substitutes in the lower

schooling groups than ;:in the college graduate group, and hence that in-

creases in the number of young persons will reduce the earnings

of young high school men.     This is consistent with the much heralded

fall in the rate of return to investment in college education.
      The regression estimates in Table 4 can be used to gage the impact

of the demographic, cyclical; and     trend   variables on the 1970s decline

in the relative income of young workers by multiplying the coefficients

on the explanatory variables by the observed changes in the variables.13

According to these calculations, the regression model explains much of the

1968-1974 increased curvature of cross-sectional age-earnings profiles in

terms of the increased number of younger workers relative to the number

of older workers.    Half of the .06 point increase in the log of the ratio of the

income of 45-54 year old to the income of 25-34 year old workers is attributed

to the increase in the number of 25-34 year old workers relative to the number

of 45-54 year old workers while 60% (.11/ .18) of the increase in the log of

the income of 45-54 year aIds relative to the income of 20-24 year aIds is

explained by the increased number of 20-24 year olds relative to the number

of 45-54 year old workers.    The trend variable accounts for the remainder

of the change in the income ratio of 45-54 to 25-34 year olds while the cyclical

variable explains most of the remaining change in the 45-54 to 20-24 year

olds income ratio.

     In sum, the estimated effects of demographic, cyclical, and trend

factors using relative income equations based on CES-type functional

forms suggest that the observed twist in the age-earnings profile

against young men can be attributed in large part to the changed age

structure of the work force. 14



Translog System Estimates

     The effect of changes in the ratio of the number of younger to the

number of older male workers and of changes in the amount of other inputs

on male age-earnings profiles can be analyzed with the translog system of

demand derived equations (9)- (11) .   Such an analysis enables us to check

on the robustness of the results of table 4 under a different functional

specification and to test two competing hypotheses about the

causes of the observed twist in male age-earnings profiles:     1) That the

twist results from increases in the amount of capital, which shifts demand

for labor toward older as opposed to younger workers.     Increases in capital

would have such an effect on demand if, as seems reasonable, capital is

relatively more complementary (less substitutable) with older than with

younger workers.   One reason for expecting relatively greater complementarity

is that skilled labor has been found to be relatively more complementary

with capital than unskilled labor (Griliches).     Since older workers tend to

be more skilled than younger workers, demand for the former could be

expected to be relatively more complementary with   cap~tal.   Another is that

older workers presumably have also accumulated greater specific human capital,

linked to physical capital.    2)   That the twist in the male age-earnings

profiles is due to the influx of female workers, who are better substitutes

for young male workers than for older male workers.     The reason for

expecting greater substitutability between women and younger men than

between women and older men is that women are more likely to be competing

for entry level or early career jobs than for more senior positions in

firms.   If women are better substitutes for the young, then increased numbers

of women workers would raise the earnings of older men relative to younger
                                                                             25

men.

       A translog derived demand system was estimated with the number of full-

time equivalent female workers aged 20-34, the quantity of capital, and

number of full-time male equivalent workers aged 20-34, and the number of

full-time and equivalent male workers aged 35-64 as inputs.              Workers below

the age of 20 were eliminated due to serious problems in estimating their

earnings.    Male workers were divided into two groups due to the problems

of estimating translog systems with more than four inputs using a limited

number of observations. The younger of the two groups, 20-34 year olds, covers

the 20-24 and 25-34 year olds treated in earlier tables.

       The inclusion of women and capital in the analysis creates considerable

data problems due to inadequate information on the amount and rewards of

these inputs.    The problem for women is that published CPS figures have

historically reported incomes and the number of persons with income rather than

labor market earnings, and workers with earnings.              Since many women have

income but do not work in the labor market, it is imperative to adjust the

data to take account of this difference.              Comparison of the mean earnings of

women to the mean income of women in recent years when both figures were

published in the Current Population Reports show little differences (less

with income and with earnings, however, reveal a sizÂ·eable differentiaL                     In

1974, for example, 38% more women were reported as having income than were

                                16      To take account of this problem and of the

part-time work done by many women employees, the number of full-time

equivalent women working in the         u.s.   was estimated by adjusting data from

the Employment and Training Report of the President 1977, by estimates of

weeks worked from the Work Experience of the Population reports of the B.L.S.
                                                                     26


as described in the table note.      These figures were multiplied by the mean

incomes given in Trends in Income of Families and Persons in the United

States and by mean incomes in the Consumer Income Series P-60, to obtain

factor payments to women.      Comparable estimates of employment of men aged

20-34 and 35-64 were made from the same source and multiplied by the mean

incomes for those age groups to obtain the factor payments going to younger

and older men.

     The problem with data on capital is that we lack good information on

both the capital stock and user cost.     An estimate of private capital was

made from data on corporate and noncorporate investment in nonresidential

business capital, provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Musgrave

1976) and unpublished data on goverament capital stock from the same source.

The user cost of capital is based on methodology developed by Jorgenson

and associates.   The particular measure used takes into account the

differential tax treatment of equipment and structures and the presence of

both equity and debt finance, and adjusts the cost of capital for depreciation

and expected capital gains.      It is based on a weighted average of the user

cost of equipment and the user cost of structures, with weights taken as

the share of each in total investment from the National Income and Product

Accounts.   The precise estimating procedure is described in detail in

Clark and Freeman.

     The shares of each of the inputs in cost was estimated by dividing

the total factor payments to each by the sum of factor payments.      In the sample

the mean share of national income going to men aged 35-64 was .39; the share

going to men aged 20-34 was .18; the share going to women aged 20-64 was

.12; while the share   go~ng   to capital was .31. Though the data leave much

to be desired, they provide at least a crude means of examining in the context

of the translog specification the effect of the increased supply of women

and capital on the age-earnings profiles of men.
                                                                     27

     Estimates of the constrained translog system were made with an interative

version of Zellner I s minimtnn distance estimator.   Given the constraints, one of

the factor share equations is redundant and can be dropped without affecting

results:    the capital share equation was deleted.

     Table 5 records the estimated parameters of the system.      Table 6, presents

the elasticities of complementarity and of factor prices with respect to

changes in quantities derived from the parameters at the mean value of the

shares.    In all cases the elasticities of input prices with respect to the

quantity of the same input are negative, as required by the model.        All of

the labor inputs are complementary with capital (i.e., have positive elasticities

of complementarity).    As hypothesized, however, older men are relatively

more complementary with capital and have a larger elasticity of factor

price with respect to capital than do younger men (the relevant S .. 's are 1.76
                                                                     ~J

for men aged 35-64 and 1.47 for men aged 20-34; the relevant factor price

elasticities are .55 for men aged 35-64 and .46 for men aged 20 to 34).

Contrary to expectation, the number of women is estimated to have a slight

positive effect on the earnings of young men compared to a slight negative

effect on the earnings of older men.    The magnitudes of those elasticities

of complementarity and of the elasticities of factor prices between the

female work force and the two age groups of men are, however, sufficiently

slight as to suggest that male and female workers operate in essentially

separate production processes.    Given the problems noted above in estimating

the input of female labor, however, little weight ought to be given to the

link between the female work force and demand for other factors.

     The most important finding from the TL system regressions is that,

consistent with our previous results, the earnings of men aged 20-34 depend

critically on the number of young male workers.       The own elasticity of

complementarity for the number of young men is sizeable negative and far in

 excess of the cross-elasticity between young and older men, implying that an

 increase in the number of young men would reduct their wage relative to the
                                                                                             28

 wage of older men.            Most importantly, the estimated factor price elasticities

 indicate that changes in the numbers of male workers of different ages will

 substantively influence the earnings of younger and older men and thus are

 likely to alter male age-earnings profiles.

        The quantitative contribution of changes in the various inputs on

 male age-earnings profiles in the period when the profiles changed sharply

 can be evaluated by substituting tile estimated elasticities of factor

 prices with respect to quantities from table 6 into the relative wage

 determination equation (5) derived in section III and multiplying the resultant

 coefficients by the actual changes in the inputs.
                                                                                .

 in the input of female labor, aged 20-64 and                       K= the   log change in the capital

 input.     Then plugging the factor price elasticities from the table into

 L25- 34   = .24;   135 - 64    = -.02;     Lw =   .17;   K=   .11 while     w35 - 64 - W

According to these calculations the increased supply of young men was the

principal factor depressing their earnings relative to the earnings of

older men from the late 1960s to the mid 1970s.l 7



V.   Conclusion

      The analysis in this paper has shown that from the late 1960s through

the mid 1970s when the number of young workers increased .rapidly, the

earnings of young male   ~rkers   fell relative to the earnings of older male

workers, altering male age-earnings profiles, particularly for college

graduates.   Demand for labor equations based on the constant elasticity of

substitution production function and on the translogarithmic production

f~nction   suggest that the increased number of young male workers was the

major causal force underlying the increased earnings of older men relative

to the earnings of younger men.    Alternative factors that might explain the

observed twist in male age-earnings profiles--the business cycle, general

trends, the increased supply of women, and growth of capital--r07ere found to

have much smaller effects on age-earnings profiles.

      The late 1960s to mid 1970s twist in male age-earnings profiles

raises important questions about the effect of the size of a cohort on

the earnings of the cohort and about the economic determinants of cross-

sectional differences in earnings by age.     Will the relatively low earnings

of the lcrge young cohorts of the 1970s be maintained in the future?     Will

age-earnings profiles change in favor of the prospective small youth

cohorts of the 1980s?    Do demographic swings produce significant inter-

generational income inequality?     How important are differences in the relative

size of cohorts in determining the shape of cross-sectional age-earnings

profiles?
                                                                      32


     Arguments can be advanced for and aga.inst the likely permanance of

a "cohort eff ect" on the earnings of the young (20-34 year old) male

workers of the 1970s.

     Three basic forces would appear to operate to create permanent cohort

effects.   First is the tendency of many firms to promote individuals by

seniority along well-defined job ladders and to raise pay through 'standard'
increases over starting rates.      With this type of pay policy a group that

enters the market with low earnings compared to others will never catch up

to the position it would have had had it entered with higher initial earnings.

Second is the possibility that the large young worker cohort of the 1970s

has been "pushed" into jobs with flatter longitudinal age-earnings profiles

than are normally chosen by young workers (as may be occurred among college

graduates, some of whom have been unable to obtain "college type" jobs).

While some of the young may be able to switch to jobs with steeper earnings

trajectories in tl:le future, the overall rate of increase in pay may still

fall short of what would have occurred for a smaller cohort that obtained more

desirable jobs at the outset.      Third, to the extent that future promotions and

raises will be depressed by competition from a large pool of persons in the

same age groups, the large youth cohorts of the 1970s may actually lose ground

in the job market relative to other cohorts in the future.

    On the other side of the spectrum, if the low initial earnings of
persons in the 1970s are given a strict investment interpretation, they

suggest that young workers are making greater investments in on-the-job

training than in the past, presumably through selection of "learning

jobs."   This will show up in especially steep longitudinal profiles for

this cohort in the   f~ture   and thus in significant catching up.   Perhaps

more realistically, the likelihood that substitution among workers of

different ages increases with age suggests at least some diminution in
                                                                    33


the effect of cohort size over time (Welch).

    Limited evidence on cohort earnings profiles in the past and on the

jobs held by the new entrants of the 1970s suggests that some permanent

effect of cohort size on earnings is likely.   Ruggles and Ruggles'

analyses of the social security (LEED) data file reveal a noticeable drop

in the longitudinal profile for the cohort which entered the labor force

in about 1930, apparently because 'the labor market conditions at the time

of their entry had a significant depressing effect on their earnings,

relative to those who preceded them and were already established in the

labor market,' whereas the earnings of the cohort born a decade later were

'high relative to the cohorts surrounding them and seem to   hav~   enjoyed

this advantage continuously' (p. 124).   Chamberlain's evidence on the return

to schooling addresses directly the possibility that the relatively depressed

position of young college graduates compared to high school graduates is a

temporary phenomenon due to greater investments in on-the-job training.

His estimates of the return to schooling at the "overtaking point," (when

earnings are no longer depressed by investments) suggest a drop from 12%

in 1969 to 7% in 1973.   Finally, the marked decrease in the proportion of

new college graduates (see Freeman, 1976, 1977), in professional and

managerial jobs, where the profiles are traditionally the steepest, suggest
that it will be difficult for young college workers to 'catch up' significantly

in the future.   Overall, while some catch up is likely, it appears more

likely on the basis of current information that the large youth     coho~ts


of the 1970s will suffer some loss in earnings compared to the smaller

cohorts that preceeded them and to the smaller cohorts that will enter

the job market in the 1980s.

     Developments in the 1980s should provide, at the least, an interesting

'test' of alternative interpretations of the determinants of changes in
                                                                     34



male age'-earnings profiles.   If relative wages by age shift in favor of

young workers when the -number of young workers declines in the mid to late

19BO~,   thp. imoortance of demographic factors as determinants of

male age-earnings profiles will be given further support.     If the large

youth cohorts of the 1970s do not experience especially rapid longitudinal

gains in earnings in the eighties, the incompleteness of the standard

interpretation of cross-section profiles in terms of investments

in training will be further demonstrated.    Opposite patterns will, of

course, have contrary implications.

     Finally, while the importance of demographic and demand factors

relative to investments in human capital as determinants of age-earnings

profiles remains to be seen, the experience of the 1970s and earlier

analyzed in this study does suggest that greater consideration be given

to demand for labor by age in analyzing male age-earnings profiles.

7This statement is simply a speculative hypothesis.        Groups of workers could

 have similar earnings for any number of reasons unrelated to elasticities

 of substitution.       Moreover, a high elasticity of substitution need not

 produce similar wages for      group~   of workers.

    Unfortunately, there is no way to deal directly with the problem of changes

    in imputation procedures between the 1969 and 1973 March CPS tapes.

    Prior to 1976 the public use tapes do not contain "flags" for imputed

    earnings, making comparable regressions impossible.                        As the new imputation

    procedure appears to have greatly affected the earnings of workers by

    education but not by age, however, the results are unlikely to be seriously

    marred by this problem.        Regressions with the March 1975 tape (which used

    the old imputation procedure) give, in any case, results much like those

    found with the March 1978 tape.            For a detailed discussion of the imputation

    problem, see     u.s.    Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, Consumer

    Income Series F-60, No. 105.         That report shows that age comparisons are only

    modestly biased by the change in imputation procedure, but that education

    comparisons are seriously biased.             There is a marked jump in the relative

    earnings of college graduates in the March 1976 tapes due to the new

    imputation procedure.

l4While the regression calculations "explain" the bulk of the variation in the

  income of older men relative to the income of younger men, it is important

  to recognize that some observations do not appear to fit the model.              In

  particular, despite a relatively large number of younger workers in the

  late 1940s/early 1950s, the age-income profile was not as steeply sloped

  as the analysis would lead one to expect.             This may be the result of the

  effect of the Great Depression and World War II on the employment experiences

  of workers or the result of the reduction in female participation at the end

  of the war.        What is needed is a detailed study of the labor market for

  younger and older workers in that period to determine why relatively large

  numbers of young workers were 'absorbed' into the work force with little

  reduction in the earnings of young workers relative to older workers.

l5In 1974 the mean income of all women was $4142.             The mean earnings of women

  with no other income was $4101.              See U.S. Bureau of the Census, Current

  Population Reports, Consumer Income Series P-60, No. 101, table 71, p. 145.


l6In 1974 there were 59.2 million women reporting income and 42.9 million

  reporting labor market earnings in the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Current

  Population Reports, Consumer Income Series P-60, No. 101 (table 71, p. 145).

  These figures are similar to those in other years.

17Using a different data set, with different definitions of age groups and a

 different time period, Joseph Anderson also has found that a large fraction

 of the change in the relative wages of the young is due to their   increas~d


  numbers.   However, he also attributes a large portion of the change to

  greater complementarity between capital and middle aged (25-54 year old)

 workers than between capital and younger workers, those aged 14-24.      While

  both Anderson's results and those in this study show a depressant effect of

  the increased relative humber on the wages of workers, they differ in the

  estimated effect of capital, which may highlight the problems of measuring

  that variable.   Differences in the age groups covered may also explain

  the moderately different results obtained between Anderson's data set

 and the one used here.
