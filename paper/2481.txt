                   Target Zones and Exchange Rate Dynamics




                                  ABSTRACT


     This   paper develops a highly simplified model of exchanqe
rate behavi or wi thin the band under a tar get zone r egi me. It shows
that. the expectation that authorities wii.l defend the band exerts
a stabilizing eff oct on exchange rate behavior wi thin the band,
even when the authori. ties are not actively i riterveni ng. The extent
of stabilization can be related in a straightforward way to three
factors: the sensitivity of the current exchange rate to expected
depreciation, the volatility of the process driving exchange rate
"fundamentals', and the credi hi. ii ty of the commitment by
authorities to defend the target zone.

     This paper presents a simple model of exchange rate behavior
under a target zone regime. It is essentially the same as the
modeL presented in Kr ugman .1 987); the di ffer erices are techni cal
and exposi tional , but hopefully this 'icr sion does produce some
value—added,      The main new    elements are      a   continuous—time
formulation of the process driving "fundamentals", and a different
approach to the determination of the pci nt at which the exchange
rate reaches the edge of t.he band. In the present version of the
model, it is possible to derive a surprisingly simple closed—form
analysis of the effects of' a target zone on the exchange rate. As
the paper shows, a target zone will lead to more stable exchange
rate behavior within the zone than free fi oati rig. The extent of
stabilization can be related in        a straightforward way to the

sensitivity of the exchange rate to expected appreciation or
depreciation,   arid the credibility of the government commitment. to
defend the target. zone.



THE MODEL



     The exchange rate is assumed to be determined by two factors:
"fundamentals", which evol ye exogenous 1 y over ti me, and i ts own
expected rate of change. For the purposes of the model, it is not
important. to specify exactly what the fundamentals are; they miht
be monetary variables, or they might include a variet.y of other
factors. All that we need is the assumption that the fundamental.

which implies that. the variance over a period t I.s simply
     It is useful to make a dist-incti on between the exchange rate
that would prevail in the absence of active government
intervention, and the actual exchange rate that prevails given
that inter veriti on. Let us denote the log of the non--i rit.er vent on
exchange rate as s; it is       related to the fundamentals and to
expected changes in the exchange rate by

how the authorities do this will not be specified in the model.
One   example that may clarify the point is to imagine that x

takes

However, the model is more general than this, and may encompass a
variety of different mechanisms. However it is done, we assume
that whenever the shadow exchange rate would lie outside the
target zone, the author! ties are able to insure that the actual
exchange rate remains at t.he boundary:

(3) s =    s   if s > s
      S=   S   if S >   S >

      s = s if s > s



      Finally,for converii ence it is helpful to choose uni ts so
that the band is centered around zero, i.e., s = — s.
     This is an extremely simple, rudimentary model of the
exchange rate. In particular, two of the usual sources of
interesting dynamics in exchange rate models are lacking: because
of the random walk assumption about fundamentals, there is no room

                                 3
for responses to anticipated future shocks; also, the model lacks

any intrinsic" dynamics      arising from slowly adjusting variables
such as the distribution of world wealth or a sticky domestic
price level. The payoff to excluding these important and realistic
issues it that it allows us to focus solely on the impact of the
target zone on exchange rate dynamics; as we will see, we can
derive some surprisingly clear and powerful conclusions about this

impact.



EXCHANGE RATE BEHAVIOR INSIDE THE BAND


     Inside the target zone the actual and shadow exchange     rates
coincide, so that the exchange rate obeys the equation



(4) s = x    +   E[ds/dt.]

     The way to solve for exchange rate behavior is to look for an
 equilibrium in state space              that is, for an equilibrium
function s = g(x) such that (4) is always satisfied. We note that
when x follows the diffusion process Cl), and where gC.) has a
cont.inuotis second derivative, the expected rate of change of s is
determined by

(5) E[ds/dt] = g'Cx)E[dx/dtJ    +   (l/2)g''Cx)E[Cdx/dt)2)

     Since   x follows a diffusion process without drift, ECdx/dt]

CS) E(dsdt3     =   g"Cx)o2

        It follows that the function gC.) must         be   one for which

    The function C8) may be simplified by exploiting the symmetry
of the assumed target zone. Since the target zone is centered
around zero, and since there is no drift in the fundamentals, we
can assume that gCO) c    This can only be true if B = -A. So the

      As we will see in a moment, in a target zone A must be
negative.     This implies an S--shaped curve 1 .i ke that shown in Figure
1, one for which s K x in the upper part of the target zone and s
> x in the lower part --- that is, the S lies below the 4 degree
line in the upper- part. of the band and below it. in the lower- part.
      To understand this gecimeLr-y, it. is useful to rearrange C?) to
get

(12) s -- x     Cya2/2)g''Cx)

This says that the deviation of the exchange rat.e from the
fundamental is proportional to the convexit. of the
fundamentals—exchange rate relationship. The reason is Jensen's
inequality: since the expected chartge in x is zero, the expected
change in the exchange rate, which is a functi on of x, is positive
where this functi on is convex, negati ye where this furict i on is
concave. In the lower part. of the target zone, where g(x) is
convex, the expected change in the exchange rate is pcsi tive; this
"drags" the exchange rate above the 4 degree line. Conversely, i r
the upper part of the zone the concavity of gCx) implies an
expected depreciation that drags the exchange rate below the
fundamental.

THE STAB I LI ZI NG EFFECT OF THE TARGET ZONE



                                     6
     For the gCx) drawn in Fiqure 1, it is apparent that the
target zone has a stabilizing effect on the exchange rate within
the band. The S—curve is always flatter than the 45—degree line,

implying that fluctuations in the fundamental x are less than
fully reflected in the exchange rate; this is in contrast. to free
floating, in which the exchange rate would simply         move   up ard down
the 45--degree line. Interestingly, this stabilization takes place
even when the authorities are not actively defendi rig the band:
they only have to act. when the fundamentals reach the levels x or
x. The reason is of course the expectation that they' will defend
the zone in future if necessary. Because of this, when the
exchange rate is near the top of the band, it essentially has more
room to go down than up, and conversely at the bottom; the market
recognizes     this,     and   t hi s   real i zati on creates   r egr essi ye
expectations that      stabilize the rate.
     But   does the function gCx) actually lie in the              position
indicated? To show this, we need to demonstrate that A in equation
Cli) is in fact negative —- or what is the same thing, that gCx)
is in fact S-shaped.

     The key to demonstrating this is to focus on bow gCx)
intersects the edge of the band. As drawn in               Figure i, the
function gCx is exactly tangent to the limits of the target zone.
What we need to show is that this is the correct depiction.
     Figure 2 ShOWS        three   possible ways in which gCx) might
intersect s.    In case 1 a convex gCx) crosses s; in case 2 a

                                        7
concave gcx) does the same thing; in            case   3 a concave gCx is just
tangent to s. Which of these is the correct picture?

        Recall two points. First, I or x > x, the level at which
intervention by the authorities becomes necessary, we have s = s.
Thus in each case the actual exchange rate path is indicated by
the heavy line, and the continuation of gCx) is indicated by the
broken line. Secondly, intervention takes place only when s >           -S

                                                                             s.

        In each of the case indicated in Figure 2. we denote by E the
first point at which          the   authorities intervene. What we can show
is that in cases 1 and 2, s at point E is less than s. That is,
if the perceived fundamentals—exchange rate realtionship were as
illustrated, the exchange rate at E would be dragged back inside
the band, contradicting the assumption that intervention becomes
necessary     at S. Only in case 3 is s > s. Thus only a                tangency
equilibrium is possible.
     Consider what happens in cases 1 and 2. If s were to remain
equal to gCx), then s at x would equal gCx); that is the
definition of gCx). However in both cases 1 and 2, if x rises
above x, s is constrained to lie below gCx); while if x lies below
x,     s is still on      gCx). Thus the ected change in s is
unambiguously smaller than on gçx). This implies that s <               gCx) at
E ---   contradicting   the   assumption     that E lies on the band.
        In case 3, by contrast, at x > x we have s > gCx), because
gCx)    has turned downward. Thus in that case s > gCO  s, and the
exchange     rate does lie on the band.

        An alternative way of thinking about this result, which

                                         8
recalls our interpretation of the geometry of g(x) , is. to note
that in cases 1 and 2 the actual relationship between x and s is
less convex than g(x). implying an s below g(x); only in case 3 is
the r ci ati onshi p mor-e convex.
     A similar argument rules out any gCx) that turns downward
before reaching 5: it is straightforward to show that the point at
which such a gCx) would cross s on the way down is equally
urisustai riabi e.
      The equilibrium          g(x),       then, must   he   precisely tangent to the
top   of the band (and by symmetry to the bottom as well). This
obsrvation allows us to der-ive a simple measure of the extent to
which the target  zone stabi ii zes expectations.
      The key is that g(x) reaches a maximum of s at x. Thus we may
differentiate        (ii) to   get

the exchange rate would fluctuate up and down the 45-degree line,
and would therefore cross the value s when x equalled s. What the
target   zone does is to create stabiliiizir,g expectations that keep

the rate within the band for a widened range of fundamentals even
when the authorities are not currently i ntez- veni ng; the extent               of
that widening is         measured by x        5.   We   note that the stabilizing
effect depends on two parameters: y, which is the sensitivity of
the exchange rate to the expected rate of depreciation, and
the volatility of the fundamentals.




DYNAMICS WITH IMPERFECT CREDIBILITY



       Up to this point we have assumed that                 the   market. believes
that the authorities will in             fact. do whatever is necessary to
defend   the tar get.    zone. Real I sti call y, of course, we need to take
into account. the possibility of a failure t.o honor commitments.
Fortunately, it. is now straightfor-ward to consider the possibility
of   an imperfectly credible target. zone.

       Suppose that the market believes that the zone will be
defended with probability ,              and that with probability 1- no


                                         10
response wi. 11 occur when the exchanqe rate reachses the edge of
the hand. Then what will happen when the exchange rate does reach
the edge of the band is a testing of the authorities' resolve. If
the authorities do defend the band, they will now have a fully
credible         target zone; if they        do    not,   the system    will   revert to
free   floating.
       The consequence of such a test is shown ir Figure 3. Suppose
that the exchange rate reaches the edge of the zone when the
fundamentals reach the level x. Then if the authorities turn out
to be credible, the exchange rate                         will move onto its full
credibility schedule at gC), while if they do not it will jump to
the 46—degree line at x. Since the market knows that one of these

two events will occur, and since any expected jump would                     leid an
infinite     expected rate of appreciation,                 is defined implicitly by
the requirement that the expected jump equal zero:


C17) s =     gCx)       + C1—Ø)x



Corresponding to this new intersection is                              a   fundamentals
exchange—rate relationship defined by choosing A so that the
function intersects the edge of                the    band at x. We can call this

gCx,).       It is      immediately apparent that               <   x, and     therefore

gCx4)       is    steeper than gCx). Thus imperfect credibility reduces
the stabilizing effect of the target zone. It is also apparent
that   as 0      goes   to one,    gCx, 0)   converges to gCx), while as           goes
to   zero   it    merges   with the 46-degree line.

CONCLUSI ONS



     This paper has set out a highly simplified model of exchange
rate behavior under a target zone regime. The method of solution
is one that is still somewhat unfamiliar in international
economics, and the geometry        in which the convexity of the
relationship between fundamentals and prices plays a crucial role
—— is new and somewhat surprising,
      The malt-i substantive result is that the expectation that the
authorities will defend a target zone will exert a stabilizing
influence on exchanqe rate behavior inside the zone. The extent of

this stabilizing influence depends on the sensitivity of the
current exchange rate to          exchange    rate expectations,   the
volatility of the underlying determinants of the exchange rate,
and the credibility of the authorities' commitment.

     The obvious next step in this research is to make the model
more realistic and interesting; this will involve both allowing a
more complex process generating fundamentals, and introducing some
"intrinsic" dynamics   arising   from such   sources as sluggish price
adj ustment.
