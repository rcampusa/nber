Trading Up and the Skill Premium

JEL No. J2,O4

                                        ABSTRACT

We study the impact on the skill premium of increases in the quality of goods consumed by
households ("trading up"). Our empirical work shows that high- quality goods are more intensive
in skilled labor than low-quality goods and that household spending on high-quality goods rises
with income. We propose a model consistent with these facts. This model accounts for the past
rise in the skill premium with more plausible rates of skill-biased technical change than those
required by the canonical model. It also implies that an expansion of the skilled labor force
reduces the skill premium by much less than in the canonical model.

1     Introduction
U.S. income inequality has greatly increased in the last four decades. This increase has
motivated a plethora of policy proposals aimed at narrowing the gap between rich and
poor. These proposals include making income taxes more progressive (Diamond and
Saez (2001) and Landais, Picketty and Saez (2011)), introducing wealth taxes (Saez and
Zuckman (2019)), subsidizing college tuition for students from low-income households
(Chetty et al. (2017)), and investing in neighborhoods to promote upward mobility
(Chetty and Hendrem (2018)).
    In evaluating these and other policy proposals, it is useful to understand the dy-
namics of income inequality: are there stabilizing forces that naturally narrow the gap
between rich and poor? One such force is the likely increase in the relative supply of
high-skill workers. In the canonical model used by Katz and Murphy (1992) and many
others, this increase lowers the skill premium, naturally reducing income inequality.
    In this paper, we argue that this stabilizing force is likely to be weaker than sug-
gested by the canonical model. This weakness stems from the fact that as income rises
households "trade up," that is, they increase the quality of the goods and services they
consume. Trading up fosters inequality in labor earnings because, as we show in this
paper, high-quality goods are more intensive in skilled labor than low-quality goods.
So, as households improve the quality of what they consume, they increase the demand
for skilled labor, contributing to a rise in the skill premium.
    This paper has an empirical and a theoretical component. In our empirical work,
we show that skill intensity rises with quality and that the quality of household con-
sumption rises with income.
    To study the relation between quality and skill intensity, we proceed as follows. We
use the price of a good or service as a proxy for its quality. The idea underlying this
approach is that if consumers are willing to pay more for an item, they perceive it to be
of higher quality. Our price measures come from two sources: Nielsen Homescan and


                                            1
Yelp!, a website where consumers post review information about different goods and
services.
       We match each establishment in the Yelp! data and each manufacturing firm in
the Nielsen Homescan data with the Microdata of Occupational Employment Statistics
(OES) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We combine these data with the U.S.
Department of Commerce Current Population Survey (CPS) to construct measures of
skill intensity for each establishment and manufacturing firm in our data.
       To document the relation between quality and income, we use data from Nielsen
Homescan as well as data on durable expenditures from the Consumer Expenditure
Survey (CEX).
       In our theoretical work, we propose a simple model consistent with our two facts.
The model is designed to be as similar as possible to the canonical model used by
Katz and Murphy (1992) to study the dynamics of the skill premium. In our model,
both skill-biased technical change (SBTC) and Hicks-neutral technical change (HNTC)
increase real income, thus expanding the demand for quality. Since quality is intensive
in high-skill workers, the demand for these workers rises, leading to an endogenous rise
in the skill premium and a widening of the income distribution.
       Our model has implications for how we interpret the past dynamics of the skill
premium. Using Fernald's (2014) estimates of the rate of HNTC, we compute the rate
of SBTC consistent with the rate of change in the quality of goods consumed estimated
by Bils and Klenow (2001).1 We find that our model accounts for the observed rise in
the skill premium in the last four decades with an annual rate of SBTC of 1.05 percent
per year. In contrast, the canonical model used by Katz and Murphy (1992) requires a
rate of SBTC of 5.5 percent per year.
       Our model also has implications for the future dynamics of the skill premium. To
explore these implications, we forecast the increase in the supply of skilled workers.
   1
    These estimates are obtained by regressing the Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation measure on
the growth rate of expenditures instrumented with the slope of the quality Engel curve.



                                                2
To isolate the effect of this supply increase, we abstract from HNTC and SBTC. The
canonical model implies a 21 percent fall in the skill premium. In contrast, our model
predicts a 15 percent fall in the skill premium. This smaller decline in the skill premium
occurs because the preponderance of high-skill workers in the labor force is associated
with higher household income which boosts the demand for quality, increasing the
demand for skilled labor.
   To explore these results and study the robustness of our conclusions, we consider
two variants of the benchmark model. The first variant has two types of households,
one composed by high-skill workers and the other by low-skill workers. These house-
holds consume different levels of quality, so there are two quality levels produced in
equilibrium. We find that the results are similar to those of the benchmark model. The
reason for this similarity is that in our basic calibration the price-quality schedule is
not far from linear, so producing two levels of quality instead of one does not affect
substantively the properties of the equilibrium.
   In the second variant of the benchmark model, the household consumes two types of
goods, a basic good with a constant level of quality and a quality good, whose quality
can vary on a continuum. The level of SBTC required to explain the rise in the skill
premium in this model is in between that implied by our benchmark model and the
canonical model, but closer to the benchmark model. These properties result from
the presence of two effects. First, a rise in income is spent in part on the basic good,
weakening the degree of trading up. Second, since the quality good is superior, its share
in spending rises with income. This effect increases the impact of income rises on the
degree of trading up and on the skill premium.
   Our work is related to five strands of literature. The first strand is the large body
of work on SBTC surveyed by Acemoglu and Autor (2011). The second strand is
the literature on the role of capital deepening in explaining the evolution of the skill
premium (e.g. Krusell, Ohanian, R´
                                 ios-Rull, and Violante (2000), Polgreen and Silos
(2008), and Burstein and Vogel (2017)). We show in the Appendix that incorporat-

                                            3
ing the trading-up phenomenon in these models reduces the resulting estimates of the
elasticity of substitution between unskilled labor and capital. The third strand is work
on skill-biased structural change (e.g. Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008), Buera and Ka-
boski (2012), Buera, Kaboski and Rogerson (2015), Boppart (2015), and Alon (2018)).
This work emphasizes how rises in income shift demand towards sectors that are more
intensive in skilled work. In contrast, we emphasize that, as income rises, the demand
for quality increases, raising the demand for skilled labor within a given sector. One
important difference between these two mechanisms is that the process of upgrading
quality within a sector is presumably unbounded while sectoral reallocation is likely to
be bounded. The fourth strand is work on the importance of quality choice in growth
models (e.g. Grossman and Helpman (1991a,b), Stokey (1991), Zweim¨
                                                                 uller (2000),
and Foellmi and Zweim¨
                     uller (2006)), trade models (e.g. Verhoogen (2008) and Fieler,
Eslava and Xu (2017)) and macro models (e.g. Jaimovich, Rebelo, and Wong (2019)).
The fifth strand is the industrial-organization literature on product differentiation (e.g.
Shaked and Sutton (1982) and Berry (1994)).
    This paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 contain our empirical work. In
Section 4 we present our benchmark model and discuss its implications for the rate of
SBTC required to explain the rise in the skill premium. We also consider an extension
of the model with two heterogeneous households. In Section 5 we analyze the model
with two goods, one with constant quality and the other with variable quality. Section
6 concludes.


2     Quality and Skill Intensity
In this section, we measure the intensity of skilled labor in establishments that are in
the same sector but produce products of different quality. To accomplish this goal, we
first construct measures of both the quality of goods produced and skill intensity by
establishment. We then study the relation between quality and skill intensity.


                                            4
       There are three approaches used in the literature to measure quality. The first
approach, which we adopt in this paper, is to use relative prices as proxies for quality.
The idea underlying this approach is that if consumers are willing to pay more for an
item, they perceive it to be of higher quality.2 The second approach, is to infer quality
from the materials and labor costs used in production (e.g. Veerhoogen (2008)). The
third approach, is to structurally estimate quality using data on prices and quantities
combined with functional form assumptions about household utility (e.g. Veerhoogen
(2008) and Hottman, Redding and Weinstein (2016)). We focus on relative prices as
measures of quality because it allows us to use a broader sample of goods and of firms
included in the OES data set.3
       There is strong evidence that relative prices are positively correlated with the quality
measures produced by the other two approaches. For example, Veerhoogen (2008) shows
that higher-quality items, which have higher costs of production, also have higher prices.
Hottman, Redding and Weinstein (2016) and Khandelwal (2010) find that quality is
strongly positively correlated with relative prices within product groups.
       Before we dive into our empirical analysis, it is useful to illustrate our results with
data for the restaurant sector. According to OES data, the key occupations in restau-
rants are: managers and executives, chefs and head cooks, first-line supervisors of food
preparation, cooks and food preparation workers, waiters and waitresses, serving work-
ers, and marketing and sales. Chefs, a high-skill occupation, represents on average 20
percent of the workforce in a full-service restaurant but only 2 percent in a limited-
service restaurant.4 As income rises and consumers trade up in the quality of the
restaurants they patronize, the demand for chefs expands, contributing to a rise in the
skill premium.
   2
     See Jaimovich, Rebelo and Wong (2019) for evidence that supports this assumption.
   3
     Structural estimation generally requires price shifters to instrument for price changes. A commonly
used price shifter for an item sold in a particular county is the average price of the item in other counties.
Using this shifter restricts the analysis to items sold in many counties which results in a substantial
reduction in sample size.
   4
     At Alinea, a high-end restaurant in Chicago, chefs represent 30 percent of the workforce.


                                                      5
2.1    Measuring Skill Intensity
Our measure of the intensity of skilled labor is based on two data sets. The first is
the OES data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It covers 1.1 million
establishments, representing 62 percent of total employment and spanning all sectors
of the North American Industry Classification System at a 6-digit level. Unfortunately,
the OES does not contain information on worker education attainment. For this reason,
we calculate the distribution of employees across twelve wage bins for each occupation
and establishment from the OES and relate this wage distribution to the wages of skilled
workers estimated using the CPS. We use the information regarding wages, education
and industry in the CPS as follows. For every industry in the CPS, we compute the
average wage of college graduates. We classify a worker in the OES as skilled if her
wage exceeds the average wage of college graduates for her industry. We then compute
for each establishment in the OES data the fraction of employment and of the wage bill
accounted for by skilled workers.
   We proceed similarly to construct two other measures of the share of skilled workers.
For our second measure, we classify workers as skilled if their wage exceeds the average
wage of workers with "some college or more" for the worker's industry. For our third
measure, we classify workers as skilled if their wage exceeds the average wage for all
workers in the respective industry.

    Notes: This table shows the average share of skilled workers per establishment by sector computed
using OES surveys of establishments from May 2004 to November 2007. We consider three definitions
of skilled workers. In "Skill 1, 2 and 3" a worker is skilled if his/her wage exceeds the average wage
of college graduates in the industry, the average wage of workers with some college education in the
industry, and the average wage of workers in the industry, respectively. The three average wages for
each industry are estimated with CPS data. Columns 3, 5 and 7 (labeled "Emp") refer to the average
employment share of skilled workers per establishment. Columns 4, 6 and 8 (labeled "Wages") refers
to the average share of wages received by skilled workers per establishment. See text for more details.




                                                  7
       Table 1 displays our results for different sectors. Consider for example the sector
of manufacturing. Using the first measure of skill, we find that the fraction of man-
ufacturing workers who are skilled is 13.9 percent and that these workers earn 43.1
percent of the wage bill. Using the second, broader classification of skill, we find that
the fraction of manufacturing workers share of the wage bill earned by these workers
are 20.9 and 49.4 percent, respectively. Using the third and broadest classification of
skill, we find that the fraction of manufacturing workers share of the wage bill earned
by these workers are 29.8 and 59.6 percent, respectively.

2.2       Quality Measures
We use prices of goods as a proxy for their quality. Our price measures come from two
sources. The first is data from Yelp!, a website where consumers post review information
about different goods and services. The second, is Nielsen Homescan data.

2.2.1      Yelp!-based Quality Measures

For each store and location pair, Yelp! asks users to classify the price of the goods and
services they purchased into one of four categories: $ (low), $$ (middle), $$$ (high),
and $$$$ (very high). Because there are few observations in the very-high category, we
merge the last two categories into a single high-price category.
       We match Yelp! establishments to the OES establishments in three steps. First, we
match the contact phone numbers of Yelp! establishments to the contact phone number
of the OES establishments. Whenever this method does not work, we base the match
on name, industry (NAICS 3-digit), and zip code.5 When multiple OES establishments
are matched to one (or multiple) Yelp! establishment(s), we average the skill measures
   5
    A major challenge is that the phone number in the OES database can be either the phone number
of the establishment or the phone number of the contact person for the establishment, such as the
person's mobile phone number. We obtain industry codes of Yelp establishments by matching the Yelp
establishments to the ReferenceUSA database, which covers the near universe of establishments in the
U.S. Establishments from the two data sets with the same industry, zip code, and similar names based
on bigram are also matched. This fuzzy name matching increases the match rate of the two data sets.


                                                 8
of all the OES establishments that are matched to each Yelp! establishment, and assign
that average skill measure to the Yelp! establishment.6 Third, because zip codes are
not available for every establishment in the OES database, we conduct a matching
procedure similar to that used in our second step based on name, industry (NAICS 3-
digit) and county. With these three steps, we obtain the share of skilled labor for 9,908
Yelp! establishments. These data covers the retail, accommodation, entertainment,
and information services sectors.

2.2.2      Nielsen-based Quality Measures

In order to extend our analysis to the manufacturing sector, we use the Nielsen Home-
scan data. This data set contains prices paid and quantities of groceries purchased at
a barcode (UPC) level for 113 thousand households over the period 2004-10. Nielsen
organizes bar codes into 613 product modules according to where they would likely be
stocked in a store.
       To construct a measure of quality for each manufacturing firm, we proceed as follows.
First, we link each item k (defined at a UPC level) in Nielsen with the manufacturing
firm f that produced the UPC using information obtained from GS1 US.7 We focus on
the 2006 data set to match the sample period of the OES data.
       Second, we compute the sales-weighted average price across all transactions made
during the month t, pkf t , for each item k produced by firm f . Similarly, for each
product module m(k ) that item k belongs to, we calculate pm(k)t , the sales-weighted
average price within the product module. For each item k , we then calculate the price
pkf t in month t relative to the average price in the product module, pm(k)t :

                                         Rkf t = pkf t /pm(k)t .
   6
     For instance, two Starbucks coffee shops may locate in the same zip code. In this case, our approach
assumes that the two coffee shops share the same skill measure.
   7
     We thank David Argente, Munseob Lee and Sara Moreira for sharing their code to link UPCs to
firms with us. These links between items and firms are also used in Hottman, Redding and Weinstein
(2016) and Argente, Lee and Moreira (2019).


                                                   9
By dividing prices by the average price in the product module, we can compare the
relative prices of items across different categories of goods.
   For single-product firms, our measure of quality is the average relative price for
each given item produced by the firm in 2006. For multi-product firms, we compute
the firm f 's relative price as a weighted average of the relative price of different products,
weighted by sales in 2006 (wkf ):

                               Rf,2006 =        wk,f,2006 Rk,f,2006 ,
                                           k 

where  denotes the set of all products in the Nielsen data.
   Third, we link each manufacturing firm f in the Nielsen-GS1 database to the OES
firms. To do so, we perform a fuzzy merge of the first component of the firm names
from GS1-Nielsen firm with the first component of the OES legal or trade names. We
take a conservative approach in classifying a successful fuzzy merge. A merge between
Nielsen-GS1 and the OES is defined as successful if one of the following three situations
occur: (i) the similarity score is above 95 percent, (ii) the similarity score, computed
using the Levenshtein distance, is above 90 percent and two names share the same first
two words; or (iii) the similarity score is above 85 percent and one name contains the
other name. This approach yields about 1,600 firms, which include over 29,000 OES
establishments.

2.3    Quality and Skill Intensity
Table 2 documents our first fact using the Yelp! data set: the share of high-skill workers
employed increases with the quality of the goods produced by the firm. Consider, for
example, the results we obtain using our measure of skilled workers based on the average
wage of college graduates in the industry. The fraction of high-skill workers is 3.54, 6.38
and 9.49 in our low-, middle- and high-quality tier, respectively. Our estimates of skill
intensity naturally vary with the breath of the definition of skill. But, as Table 2 shows,


                                                10
our three alternative definitions of high skill generate similar estimates of the differences
in skill intensity of high versus low quality goods.

     Notes: This table shows the average share of skilled workers per establishment per Yelp! quality
tier. Low quality refers to the $ Yelp! category. Middle quality refers to the $$ Yelp! category. High
quality refers to the $$$ and $$$$ Yelp! categories. The statistics are based on the OES survey of
establishments from May 2004 to November 2007. We consider three definitions of skilled workers. In
"Skill 1, 2 and 3" a worker is skilled if his/her wage exceeds the average wage of college graduates in
the industry, the average wage of workers with some college education in the industry, and the average
wage of workers in the industry, respectively. The three average wages for each industry are estimated
with CPS data. Columns 3, 5 and 7 (labeled "Emp") refer to the average employment share of skilled
workers per establishment. Columns 4, 6 and 8 (labeled "Wages") refers to the average share of wages
received by skilled workers per establishment. See text for more details.


    Table 3 provides results analogous to those in Table 2 obtained using Nielsen's
Homescan data. Here too, the share of high-skill workers employed is an increasing
function of the quality of the goods produced by the firm. Consider, for example, the
results we obtain using our measure of skilled workers based on the average wage of
college graduates in the industry. The fraction of high-skill workers is 1.2 to 1.5 times
higher in the high-quality tier when compared with the low-quality tier. The difference
between the skill intensity of high- and low-quality products is lower than in the Yelp!
data. This property is likely to reflect smaller differences in the quality of groceries,
which are the most important category of goods in Nielsen Homescan, than in other
categories such as durables.

     Notes: This table shows the average share of skilled workers per establishment for each quality tier
for the food manufacturing sector. The low, middle and high quality tiers are based on the firms in
the bottom third, middle third and top third of relative prices (within each product category) of firms
in Nielsen Homescan data, respectively. The statistics are based on the OES survey of establishments
from May 2004 to November 2007. We consider three definitions of skilled workers. In "Skill 1, 2 and
3" a worker is skilled if his/her wage exceeds the average wage of college graduates in the industry, the
average wage of workers with some college education in the industry, and the average wage of workers
in the industry, respectively. The three average wages for each industry are estimated with CPS data.

establishment. Columns 4, 6 and 8 (labeled "Wages") refers to the average share of wages received by
skilled workers per establishment. See text for more details.




2.4     Quality and Routine Work
Acemoglu and Autor (2011) argue that the distinction between skilled and unskilled
workers may be less relevant to study new forms of automation. These forms of au-
tomation, such as artificial intelligence, might replace routine tasks that are performed
by high-skill workers (e.g. radiologists).
    In Table 4, we study the relation between quality and the intensity of routine and
non-routine work. Two patterns emerge from our data. First, the share of routine
workers is lower in the production of high-quality goods when compared to that low



                                                   12
quality goods. So quality is intensive in non-routine work. Second, the part of non-
routine work that rises with quality is abstract work, not manual work.


            Table 4: Quality and share of workers performing different tasks

    Notes: This table shows the average share of workers per establishment performing each of the
three following tasks: routine, non-routine manual, and non-routine abstract. We stratify the summary
statistics by quality tier for establishments in the food-manufacturing sector. The low, middle and
high quality tiers are based on firms in the bottom third, middle third and top third of relative
prices of firms in Nielsen Homescan data, respectively. The statistics are based on the OES survey of
establishments from May 2004 to November 2007. Columns 3, 5 and 7 (labeled "Emp") refer to the
average employment share of routine, non-routine manual and non-routine abstract per establishment,
respectively. Columns 4, 6 and 8 (labeled "Wages") refers to the average share of wages received by
of routine, non-routine manual and non-routine abstract per establishment, respectively. See text for
more details.




3     Quality and Income
Our second empirical fact is that the quality of the goods and services consumed by
households rises with income. We document this fact using data from the CEX and the
Nielsen Homescan Data. Our findings corroborate previous results in the literature.
Bils and Klenow (2001) show that for a wide range of durable goods in the CEX,
households with higher total expenditures consume higher-quality goods. Similarly,
Faber and Fally (2018), Jaravel (2018), and Argente and Munseob (2016) show that


                                                 13
higher-income households consume higher-quality goods. There is also a large trade
literature that shows that as countries get richer, they increase the quality of what they
consume (see, e.g. Verhoogen (2008) and Fieler, Eslava and Xu (2017)).

3.1    CEX
Our first data set, are durable expenditures from the CEX. Our data covers 73,000
households over the period 1980-2013. Durables are defined as categories whose items
have a life that exceeds 2 years. These categories include home furnishing (e.g carpet-
ing, curtains, mattresses, and sofas), appliances (e.g. dryers, microwaves, stoves, and
radios), electronics, and vehicles. The advantage of using durables expenditures is that,
given that households are unlikely to buy more than one item at a time, we can, as in
Bils and Klenow (2001), use expenditures as a measure of the price paid for each item.
   We estimate the quality Engel curve as follows. As in Bils and Klenow (2001), we
express the unit price of an item paid by household h at time t as xht = zht qht , where
zht is the quality-adjusted price and qht is the quality of the item. We estimate , the
elasticity of quality with respect to income, using the following specification:

                               ln(qht ) = 0 +  ln(yht ) +   ht


where y denotes the income of household h in period t, and         ht   denotes the residual.
   We can rewrite this specification as

                         ln(xht ) = 0 +  ln(yht ) + ln(zht ) +   ht .                       (1)

The logarithm of quality-adjusted price, ln(zht ), is an unobservable variable that reflects
differences in prices across time and across households that are not related to the
choice of quality. It can, for instance, be due to differences in shopping intensity across
households which affects the prices paid for the same item. It may also be due to
differences in the discounts available in different locations. As in Bils and Klenow


                                            14
(2001), we include demographic controls to account for these unobservable factors that
may affect prices paid. These controls include the age of the households, family size,
household fixed effects, and time fixed effects.
   Table 5 reports our regression results using 5 income quintile dummies, so that  is a
vector. This table shows that high-income households pay on average 80 percent more
than low-income households for items of a given category. In our view, these differences
are too large to be explained by price discrimination or different search intensities.
For example, Aguiar and Hurst (2006) estimate that doubling the shopping frequency
lowers the price paid for a given good by only 7 to 10 percent.




3.2    Nielsen Homescan
We supplement the empirical evidence on the relation between income and quality for
durable goods with a second data set, the Nielsen Homescan data, that focuses on
non-durable goods such as grocery products.
                                                  ¯imt , for every item i in product
   We compute an average price across households, P
module m and time t. By using this average price we ensure that differences in overall
prices paid by households reflect differences in choice of item-store, rather than shopping
intensity (i.e. using coupons and taking advantage of promotions). For each household,
we compute the price of module m at time t as:

                            log (Phmt ) =                ¯imt .
                                                wiht log P
                                            i

We then estimate the following regression:

              log (Phmt ) = 0 +       k 1 (yht  k ) + Xht + t + m + hmt ,              (2)
                                  k

where 1 (yht  k ) is a dummy variable equal to one if the household income is in quintile

                                            15

in which price differentials are relatively small when compared with categories such as
durable goods.


4     A Simple Model
In this section, we consider a simple model that is consistent with our two empirical
facts. First, firms that produce higher quality goods employ a higher share of high-skill
workers. In other words, quality is skill intensive. Second, the quality of the goods a
household consumes rises with income. In other words, quality is a normal attribute.
We then consider the implications of our model for the measurement of SBTC.
    Before we delve into the details of our model, we review the key features of the
canonical model used to explain the rise in the skill premium. In this model, output,
Y , is produced according to the following production function:

                                                            1/
                           Y = A [ (SH ) + (1 - )L ]             ,                      (3)

where S denotes the level of SBTC, A denotes the level of HNTC, H is the supply of
skilled work, and L is the supply of unskilled work.
    Output is produced by firms that are competitive in product and factor markets.
The optimization conditions for these firms imply that the skill premium, defined as
the ratio of the wage rate of skilled, WH , and unskilled, WL , workers, is given by:
                                                       -1

                                   =    St                  .                           (4)
                                WL   1-           L
This expression implies that changes in A have no impact on the skill premium. Com-
puting logarithmic growth rates of the two sides of equation (4), we obtain:

                           WH                                        H

                                           18
      According to the estimates in Acemoglu and Autor (2010), the relative supply of
effective labor of skilled workers H/L increased by about 110 percent and the skill
premium increased 22 percent between 1970 and 2008. As in Acemoglu and Autor
(2010), we assume that  equals 0.41.8 Equation (5) implies that  log (S ) = 210.8
percent, which corresponds to an average annual rate of SBTC of 5.5 percent.

4.1       Homogeneous households
We make some simplifying assumptions so that our model is as similar as possible to
the canonical model used in the SBTC literature. These assumptions are: (i) no capital
in production; (ii) a single production sector; and (iii) households consume a single unit
of the consumption good, so changes in expenditures translate fully into changes in the
quality of the goods consumed. These assumptions allow us to derive results without
taking a stand on the form of the utility function.


Household We consider a representative household composed by the same fraction
of skilled and unskilled workers present in the population. The household pools its
resources and buys a single unit of a consumption good of quality q at a price P (q ).
The household budget constraint is given by

                                      P (q ) = WH H + WL L,

where H and L denote high-skill and low-skill workers respectively. We treat the supply
of high- and low-skill workers as exogenous and assume that workers are identical within
each skill group. Household utility is given by

                                             U = V (q ),

where V (q ) > 0 , V (q )  0.
  8
      Estimates for  generally range from 0.16 (Card and Lemieux (2001) to 0.5 (Angrist (1995)).



                                                 19
Production Final goods are produced by competitive firms using skilled and un-
skilled labor according to the production function
                                                                 1
                         Y = A  (SH ) + q - (1 - ) (L)           
                                                                     ,                  (6)

where  > 0,   0, and q denotes the quality of the good produced. When  = 0 this
production function is identical to the one used in the canonical model (equation (3)).
Firms only produce the level or levels of quality demanded by households.
   The equilibrium price of a good of quality q is given by:
                                                                         -1
                       1   1

                                                   1      
                                                              -1
                                                                
                                                                         
              P (q ) =    1- (S ) 1- WH  + (1 - ) 1- (q ) -1 WL               .
                       A
   The production function (6) with  > 0 together with the perfect-competition as-
sumption implies two key properties. First, P (q ) > 0, i.e. the price of a final good is
increasing in its quality. Second, quality is intensive in high-skill labor, i.e., the labor
share of high-skill labor, WH H/ (WH H + WL L) is increasing in q .


Skill Premium The firms' optimization conditions imply that the skill premium is
given by:
                                                        -1
                               WH   q  (S )        H
                                  =                          .                          (7)
                               WL   (1 - )         L
   Computing growth rates, we see that the change in the skill premium is the one
obtained in the canonical model (equation (5)) plus the effect of trading up on the skill
premium, which is given by the term  log(q ) in the expression below:

                    WH                                       H
             log           =  log (S ) + ( - 1)  log             +  log(q ).            (8)
                    WL                                       L
   Equations (7-8) show that quality plays a role that is similar to that of SBTC. Other
things equal, a rise in quality increases the demand for skilled labor raising the skill
premium.



                                            20
SBTC and HNTC Combining the household budget constraint and the firms' first-
order condition we obtain the following equation:
                                                   1
                                                           1-

                                             WL        L
                              A×S =                             1   .                     (9)
                                         1                      
                                                  WH H
                                        L
                                                  WL L
                                                         +1

Equation (9) implies that, holding constant H and L, a change in A has the same
impact on the skill premium as a change in S . This equivalence holds because in our
model a change in A triggers a change in q :

                                                                        (1-)/ 1/
                                   WH                  WH H
               q = A(1 - )1/          H +L                  +1                     ,     (10)
                                   WL                  WL L

and this change in q has an effect on the skill premium that is similar to that of a rise
in S (see equation (7)).

4.1.1   Quantitative results

The estimates in Acemoglu and Autor (2010) suggest that between 1970 and 2008 the
skill premium increased by 25 percentage points, while the effective ratio of high-skill
labor to low-skill labor increased by 110 percentage points. Below, we use our model
to characterize the combinations of SBTC and HNTC that are consistent with these
observed changes in WH /WL , H and L.
   Using equation (9) to compute logarithmic growth rates, we obtain

               1              1-              1     WH H
 A + S =         (WH - WL ) +    (H - L) - L +  1 +                                    . (11)
                                                    WL L

   Following Acemoglu and Autor (2010), we set  = 0.41. Given this value of , we
can compute the right-hand side of equation (11), which is equal to 1.92 percent on an
annual basis. The left-hand side of the equation gives us the combinations of A and
S that match the right-hand side.


                                             21
      Table 7 reports results for both our model and the canonical model for different
combinations of HNTC and SBTC. We choose  equal to 1.15 so that for our benchmark
calibration (row 3) our model is consistent with the Bils-Klenow estimates for q (3.8
percent per year).

            Notes: All numbers in percentages. A and S are reported
            on an annual basis. (WH /WL ) is the value for the entire sample.



      Line 1 corresponds to the case where there is no HNTC or SBTC. In the canonical
model, the skill premium falls by 65 percent. In our model, this fall is only 46 percent.
The reason for this result is that in our sample more workers became skilled over time,
creating a rise in income that induces households to trade up, expanding the demand
for high-skill labor and increasing the skill premium.
      In line 3, we set the rate of SBTC to zero and choose the annual rate of HNTC
to match Fernald's (2014) estimates for TFP growth for the period 1970 to 2008 (0.87
percent per year). Our model predicts a 25 percent fall in the skill premium because
the rise in the demand for skilled workers is not strong enough to overcome the increase
in the relative supply of skilled workers. In this calibration, HNTC accounts for 30
percent of the rise in the skill premium while in the canonical model it accounts for
zero percent of this rise.9
  9
  In the absence of HNTC and SBTC, the skill premium falls by 46 percent (row 1 of column 4).
HNTC and SBTC together raise the change in the skill premium from -46 to +25 percent. With


                                             22
   Row 3 reports results for our benchmark specification. We set the annual rate of
HNTC to match Fernald's (2014) estimates and choose the annual growth rate of SBTC
so that our model is consistent with the observed rise in the skill premium. The required
annual rate of SBTC is 1.05 percent, a much more plausible number that the 5.5 percent
required by the canonical model to match the observed rise in the skill premium. In
the canonical model, the configuration of HNTC and SBTC considered in row 3 results
in a 48 percent fall in the skill premium. Comparing rows 2 and 3 we see that even
though in our benchmark calibration the rate of SBTC is only 1.05 percent per year,
the presence of SBTC is essential to produce a rise in the skill premium.


The future of the skill premium Our model can shed some light on the future
evolution of the skill premium. We start by forecasting the fraction of high-skill workers
in 2026 using data from the U.S. Department of Education. To simplify, we treat
this fraction as exogenous. High-skill workers are defined as those with educational
attainment equal to some college or associate degree, bachelor's and advanced degree.
A linear regression fits well the data from 1992 to 2016, so we base our projections on
this regression. We forecast a rise in the fraction of high-skill workers from 62 percent
in 2008 to 71 percent in 2026.
   To isolate the impact of this increase in the supply of skilled workers, we first
abstract from technical progress. We calibrate our model with the same value of 
used in the benchmark case (1.15). Our results are reported in the first row of Table 8.
The canonical model implies a moderation in income inequality with the skill premium
falling by 21 percent. In contrast, our model predicts a decline of only 15 percent
in the skill premium. This smaller decline in the skill premium occurs because the
preponderance of high-skill workers in the labor force means higher household income
which boosts the demand for quality, increasing the demand for skilled labor.
HNTC and no SBTC, the skill premium falls by 25 percent. So the fraction of the rise in the skill
premium accounted for by HNTC is [-25 - (-46)]/(25 - (-46)) = 30 percent.



                                               23
      Table 8: Forecasting the Skill Premium: Trading up and Canonical Model

                   0.8    0. 0          25                 -21




   Next, we use the forecast of the rate of change in HNTC produced by Fernald (2016),
which is 0.8 percent per year. Our results are reported in row 2 of Table 8. Our model
implies that the skill premium will increase by 25 percent between 2008 and 2026, the
same that occurred between 1970 to 2008. These results reflect the fact that, according
to our projections, the fraction of high-skill workers will increase by less in the future
than in the 1970-2008 period.

4.2    Heterogenous Households
In the model described above we make several simplifying assumptions to derive ana-
lytical results about the impact of trading up on the skill premium. In particular, there
is only one quality level produced in equilibrium. So the model cannot, by construction,
match the cross-sectional relation between quality and the share of high-skill workers
used in production.
   In this subsection, we extend the model by considering an economy where there is
more than one consumption good produced in equilibrium. This version of our model
has two types of households. The first type has only low-skill workers and the second
type only high-skill workers. These households receive different income levels and, as a
result, they consume goods of different quality.



                                             24
Production Household type j  {L, H } consumes goods of quality qj which are
produced according to

                                           -                      1/
                        Yqj = A  (SHj ) + qj (1 - ) Lj                    .

   The price of a good of quality qj is

                1 1/(1-) /(1-) /(1-)                                          (-1)/

        Pqj =           S     WH     + qj-1 (1 - )1/(1-) WL                           .
                A
   We assume perfect labor mobility which implies that the skill premium is identical
in both the high- and low-quality production sector. The first-order conditions for
competitive output producers imply that the skill premium in each sector j is given by:
                                                             -1
                          WH                            Hj
                             =    q × S                           .
                          WL   1- j                     Lj
   For future reference, we note that using the expression for the skill premium implies
that total expenditure in each of the goods produced is given by
                                                   WH    Hq,j
                         Pq,j Yq,j = WL Lq,j 1 +                      .
                                                   WL    Lq,j

Households There is a measure (H ) of skilled workers and (L) = 1 - (H ) of
unskilled workers. The supply of skilled work measured in efficiency units is: H =
Hq,L + Hq,H . Similarly, the supply of unskilled workers in efficiency units is: L =
Lq,L + Lq,H .
   The maximization problem of high-skill households is:

                                   max U = V (qH ),

subject to
                                    P (qH ) = WH H .




                                           25
   Similarly, the maximization problem of low-skill households is:

                                     max U = V (qL ),

subject to
                                      P (qL ) = WL L.


Equilibrium Using the budget constraints of low- and high­skill workers, we obtain:
                                          WH        Hq,L
                              Lq,L 1 +                         = L,
                                          WL        Lq,L

                                      WH       Hq,H            WH
                           Lq,H 1 +                        =      H.
                                      WL       Lq,H            WL
   As in the previous section we look for combinations of SBTC and HNTC that are
consistent with the observed changes in the skill premium and aggregate changes in L
and H .
   To solve this two-sector model we proceed as follows. We guess Hq,L /Lq,L . The
budget constraint of low-skill workers implies a value for Lq,L . Using this value, we can
compute Hq,L and Hq,H . We can then compute the ratio of the two qualities produced:
                                               -1
                                  WH HH

                                               -1          =        .

                                          +1         L

Given the observed skill premium, the overall measures of high- and low-skill workers,
and the equilibrium sectoral allocation, these identify the ratio of qualities, qH /qL . With
this ratio we then verify that the skill premium is identical in both sectors.
   Before commenting on the implications for the measurement of the SBTC, we note
that we can compute the share of high-skill workers in labor income (WH H/ (WL H + WH L))
in the production of the high- and low-quality good. Importantly, the model has no
free parameters that allows us to target these ratios, so it is of interest to see whether


                                               26
the model comes close to the observed numbers in the data. The ratio of these shares is
2.4 in the beginning of the sample and 2.5 in the end of the sample. We also compare
the share of high-skill labor (H/ (H + L)) used in the production of the high- and the
low-quality good. The ratio of these shares is 2.8 in the beginning of the sample and
3.6 in the end of the sample. These values somewhat higher than those reported in
Table 2 for the ratio of highest quality ($$$) and the lowest quality ($).
   Once we find the equilibrium sectoral allocation, we use the fact that each consumer
purchases one unit of the good and thus, Yq,j = (j ) from which it follows that for each
sector the following equation holds

                             -1     WH HH                            WH
            A -  qH =            1+                   + H -             H .
                                    WL LH                            WL
   The right hand side is a given number (given the data and the equilibrium sectoral
allocation). Hence given different values of A we can recover q for each of the two
sectors. Then from the skill premium equation,
                                                           -1
                           WH                         Hj
                              =    qj ×S                        .
                           WL   1-                    Lj
we can recover the consistent value of S .
   We re-do the analysis for the same configurations of  , A and S used in Table 7.
The results are almost identical, showing that our results are robust to introducing the
form of income heterogeneity embodied into this model. The reason for this robustness
is that in our calibration the price-quality schedule is close to linear, so that producing
two levels of quality instead of one does not affect substantively the properties of the
equilibrium. The linearity of the price-quality schedule comes from two sources. First,
the value of  (0.41) is close to 0.5 which makes the exponent ( - 1)/ in equation (4.2)
close to one. Second, the value of  (1.15) is also close to one.
   An interesting question is: how do real wages of low- and high-skill workers evolve
over time in our benchmark calibration? We deflate wages with the price level evaluated


                                            27
at a constant quality level, the one consumed in the beginning of the sample. These
quality levels are denoted by q0H and q0L for high-skill and low-skill households, respec-
tively. The real wage for high- and low-skill workers are WH /P (q0H ) and WL /P (q0L ),
respectively. The prices P (q0H ) and P (q0L ) change between the beginning and end of
the sample as a result of endogenous changes in wages and the two types of techni-
cal progress, SBTC and HNTC. The annual rate of change in prices are as follows:
P (q0L ) = -1.3 percent, and P (q0H ) = -4.7 percent. Since WL is the numeraire,
the rate of change in the real wage of the low-skill household is the symmetric of the
price change: WL /P (q0L ) = -1.3 percent. The rate of change in the real wage of
the high-skill household is: WH /P (q0H ) = 5.3 percent. Since the price of quality
falls more for the high-skill workers than for the low-skill workers, the ratio of the real
wages of high- and low-skill grows by more than the skill premium. In other words, the
divergence in real wages across skill groups exceeds the rise in the skill premium.


5     Quantity and Quality
In our benchmark model, whenever a household receives additional income it devotes it
fully to increasing the quality of the good it consumes. In this section, we explore how
the impact of trading up changes when the household buys both one unit of a quality
good, available in a continuum of different qualities, and a basic good (C ) with a fixed
level of quality.
    We assume that the utility function takes the form used by Bils and Klenow (2001):

                                    C 1-1/    q 1-1/q
                               U=          +          .                               (12)
                                    1 - 1/   1 - 1/q

The budget constraint of the representative household is

                             P (q ) × 1 + C = HWH + LWL .




                                            28
The basic good is produced according to the following production function
                                                             1
                          Yc = A [ (SHc ) + (1 - ) (Lc ) ]  .

The quality good is produced according to
                                                                 1
                       Yq = A  (SHq ) + q - (1 - ) (Lq )         
                                                                     .

The labor market clearing conditions are

                                     H = Hc + Hq ,
                                      L = Lc + Lq .

The goods market clearing conditions are

                                         Yq = 1,
                                         Yc = C .

   We calculate the annual rate of change in SBTC that rationalizes the rise in the
skill premium over the period 1970-2008. We use the same annual rate of HNTC (0.83)
and the same value of  (0.41) used in the benchmark model. The value of  is set to
one and the ratio q / is chosen to match the estimates of Bils and Klenow (2001),
which are 0.76.
   We search for combinations of ,  , and  that allow us to match three targets. The
first is the annual growth rate for qt estimated by Bils and Klenow (3.8 percent). The
second is the average share of quality goods in expenditure (41 percent). The third is
the ratio of the share of skilled labor in income in high quality goods versus low quality
goods from Table 3:
                                       WH Hq
                                    WH Hq +WL Lq
                                       WH Hc
                                                   = 1.6
                                    WH Hc +WL Lc

Here we are using the basic good as the low quality good and the quality good as the


                                            29
high-quality good.
    We find that the level of SBTC necessary to rationalize the skill premium is 1.4
percent. This value is in between the value obtained for the benchmark model (1.05
percent) and the canonical model (5.5 percent), but closer to the value implied by the
benchmark model.
    The intuition for these results is as follows. A rise in income produces less trading
up because some of the additional income is spent on the basic good. As a result, the
effect a rise in income on the skill premium is weaker than in the benchmark model.
There is, however, another effect. The utility function (12) implies that the quality
good is a superior good, so its share in spending rises as income rises, expanding the
demand for skilled workers and contributing to increasing the skill premium. This effect
is absent in our benchmark model. In that model the share of income spent in the high
quality good cannot rise because it is already 100 percent.


6     Conclusions
In this paper, we show empirically that as income rises, households trade up to higher
quality goods and that these goods are intensive in skilled labor. As a result, the demand
for high-skill labor rises, increasing the skill premium. This trading-up phenomenon
amplifies the effect of skill-biased technical change by creating an endogenous rise in
the demand for skilled workers.
    In the canonical model, technical change has to be skill biased to produce a rise
in the skill premium. In our model, any factor that raises income increases the skill
premium. This idea has important implications for the future evolution of the skill
premium. Growth in income that is not accompanied by an increase in the supply of
skilled workers is likely to increase the skill premium even in the absence of skill-biased
technological change.
    Acemoglu and Autor (2011) argue that the distinction between skilled and unskilled


                                            30
workers may be less relevant to study forms of automation such as artificial intelligence
which may replace routine tasks performed by high-skill workers. Motivated by this
argument, we study the relation between quality and the intensity of routine and non-
routine work. We find that low-quality goods are intensive in routine work and that
high-quality goods are intensive in non-routine, abstract work. So, as households trade
up, we expect to see a rise in the relative wages of non-routine, abstract workers.
   The choice of the quality of goods and services consumed by households has implica-
tions not just for the skill premium but also for changes in the overall wage distribution.
We find that quality increases lead to a relative decline in the demand for routine work-
ers. According to the estimates of Autor and Dorn (2013), workers in the 10th to 50th
percentile of the 1980 wage distribution have jobs with a high share of routine tasks.
So the wages of these workers are likely to decline relative to the wages of workers on
the bottom and top of the wage distribution.
   Taken as a whole, our evidence suggests that considering endogenous changes in
the quality of consumption is an important avenue for future work on the dynamics of
income inequality.

      mium
Krusell, Ohanian, R´
                   ios-Rull, and Violante (2000), which we refer to as KORV, argue
that capital deepening associated with investment-specific technical progress explains
much of the rise in the skill premium. To re-examine their analysis, we adopt their func-
tional form for the production function. Output with quality q is produced according
to the following nested CES function
                                                                           1-
                                                                            
                                                       -                
               Yq =   KS    (KE   + (1 - )H ) + q          (1 - ) (L)           ,    (13)

where KS is the stock of structures and KE is the stock of equipment.
    To retain the one-sector character of the model, we assume that investing Iqt units of
output with quality qt yields P (qt ) units of installed capital. The capital accumulation
equation takes the form

                            KSt+1 = Pqt IqSt + (1 -  )KSt ,
                            KEt+1 = Pqt IqEt + (1 -  )KEt ,

where IqSt and IqEt denote the investment in structures and equipment, respectively.
    The market clearing condition for output is:

                                Yqt = 1 + IqSt + IqEt /zt ,

where 1/zt is the relative price of equipment. Recall that the representative household
buys one unit of a good with quality qt .
    We use the wage of low-skill workers as the numeraire,

                                         WL = 1,

but for clarity we retain the symbol WL in the derivations below.

one, we obtain the same expression for the skill premium equation used in KORV.

7.1      Some Analytics
Recall that  is the parameter that governs the elasticity of substitution between capital
and high-skill workers. To see the effects of the presence quality on the point estimates
for , it is useful to log-linearize equation (20),
                   1
  ( -  )                      KE - H + ( - 1) H - L + q = WH - WL . (21)
           1 + WH H/ (RE KE )

where x
      ^ denotes the logarithmic growth rate of x. Solving equation (21) for  , we
obtain


                 1 + WH H/ (RE KE )
           =                           ×                                            (22)
                       KE - H
                       (KE - H )

                   1 + WH H/ (RE KE )

   Capital-skill complementarity requires   . How are these estimates affected by
trading up? The answer to this question depends on the value of q [1+WH H/ (RE KE )]/(KE -
H ). In the KORV data KE - H > 0. Since  > 0, an increase in q implies that the
right-hand side is overall a higher number. Since  < 0, then the degree of capital skill


                                             38
complementarity required to match the same empirical facts is reduced.
       Trading up also affects the point estimates of , the parameter that governs the de-
gree of substitutability between unskilled workers and the composite good of equipment
capital and skilled workers. To see this effect, note that the value of , as a function of
a given value of  can be expressed as
                                              WH H

       The change in the level of quality affects only the denominator reducing the value
of . As a result, the degree of substitutability of unskilled labor and the composite
good of equipment and skilled worker (1/(1 - )) falls.
       In this analysis we were holding constant the value of  when analyzing the effects
of quality on the measurement of  and vice versa when analyzing the effect of quality
for the measurement of  . Naturally, both of these estimates can change as a results of
quality. We thus proceed by jointly estimating these two parameters.

7.2       Estimation
In this section, we estimate the production function using the approach proposed by
Polgreen and Silos (2008).10 In this approach, the posterior distribution is obtained by
combining a prior distribution for the vector of parameters with a measurement-error-
based likelihood function for the data.
       The estimation is based on three conditions. The first is the equation for the labor
share in income

Estimating  and           We begin by replicating the analysis of Polgreen and Silos
(2008) and estimate  and  in a model without quality choice. The resulting estimates
are  = 0.4470,  = -0.3871.
   We now estimate  and  in a model with quality choice. Since we do not have a
time series for q , we consider a constant trend in quality at the annual growth rate
estimated by Bils and Klenow (2001). We obtain the following estimates:  = 0.2485
and  = -0.3730. As suggested by our analytical results, incorporating quality choice
into the model implies a fall in the degree of substitutability of unskilled labor and
the composite good of equipment and skilled worker (1/(1 - )). This elasticity of
substitution between unskilled labor and capital falls from 1/ (1 - 0.4470) = 1.81 to
1/ (1 - 0.2485) = 1.33.
