        A Model of Diffusion in the Production of an Innovation



                                    Summary




        This paper is an attempt to explain diffusion in the production of an

innovation. Diffusion in production is defined as the increase in number

of producers, or net entry, in the market for a new product.           It is to be

distinguished from the more familiar problem in the literature on technical

change, namely, the diffusion among      producers     in the use of new products and,

hence, of changes in production processes for "old" products (or services).

        The empirical results confirm that a simple model —         simple in tenus of

number of variables ——     is   sufficient to explain most of diffusion in the         pro-
                                                                           diffusion of
duction of an innovation. The principal variable that explains

entry is the demonstration effect. The principal variable that retards entry

is the accumulated experience and goodwill of existing firms. A limiting

force is the population of potential entrants. None of these variables

appears to lend itself readily to influence by public policy.

        The first stage in diffusion ——       the   Interval from first commercial

introduction of the product to entry by competitors ——           varies   greatly in

 duration. Institutional variables, including public policy, may             have   a greater

 impact on the length of this first stage, which is not covered by this study,

 than   on   the diffusion process in the periods examined in this paper.

       This paper      is   an   attempt to explain the process of diffusion in the
 production     of an innovation. Diffusion in production is defined as the increase

 in number of producers, or net entry, in the market for a new product. It is to

 be distinguished from the more familiar problem in the literature on technical

 change, namely, the diffusion among producers in the use of new products and,

hence,   of   changes in production       processes for "old" products (or services).
       In    an earlier paper, Gort and Klepper1 showed that a typical "diffusion in

production" process involves a number of stages. Phase I encompasses the interval

in   which the      original producers of a new product remain without competitors in

the market •        Phase   II is the interval from the "take—off" point of net entry to
the time     that    net entry decelerates drastically. Phase III is the ensuing
period of low or zero net entry and Phase IV is the subsequent period of negative
net entry. Phase V represents the new equilibrium in the number of producers
that   coincides with the maturity of the product market and              continues   until some
new fundamental        disturbance generates a change in market structure. The present
study focuses        on the period from roughly the beginning of Stage II until the
peak   in number of producers is reached sometime in Stage III. It does not deal

with   the   subsequent     development   of what may be considered a mature market,

including     the    characteristic    interval   in   which the number of producers declines.
Then
       For given expected prices and demand, the division of the market between

existing firma and new entrants depends on V, a vector of observed attributes

of th. population of potential entrants, and C, a vector of observed attributes

of the population of earlier entrants (and now existing firms) in the market.

Th. average probability of entry in time t              for   the population of potential

entrants can be written as:

We assume that the unobserved attributes of individual firms            (which   include such

 facotre as the personalities and biases of managers, chance perceptions of

alternative opportunities, differences in risk aversion, etc.) are randomly

distributed among firms with a con set of observed characteristics.'

       Apart from the attributes of existing firma and potential entrants the

expected   returns to new     entrants, discounted for risk, (and, hence4 the entry

rate)   will depend upon a) the perceived risks associated with entry            and b)      the
expected   profit margin for the most efficient producers. Assuming a market without

entry   barriers and an     equilibrium price at which output    is greater   than   zero,   the
expected profit margin will depend upon the extent of any          transitory    disequilibrium
between supply and       demand. To be sure, profit   margins   will   also depend upon entry
barriers—that      is, monopoly power. But higher entry barriers cannot, by definition,
raise the rate of net entry. Consequently, an excess of actual over              "normal"

competitive rates of return will raise entry only to the extent that such              returns

arise from disequilibrium.2
       Assuming   an absence of entry barriers, we have indicated that        entry   will
depend upon perceived risks, disequilibrium induced deviations between actual
and "normal" competitive profit margins, and the attributes (mainly costs) of
existing   firms and of     the population   of potential entrants. Before specifying

the   relevant (and empirically measurable) variables that control each of these

elements, our model must be developed further with respect to the two components

that   generate the net entry rate, namely, gross entry and gross exit.

      Let N denote the population of potential entrants in the market for a new

product. At time t, the number of potential entrants will then be N — nt—i where

       is   the number that            have already entered——that is, the number of producers

at   t—i. The number            of expected entrants at time t is          therefore:

              Ft              (N   -   iii)                                                         (1)



where Ft is the expected number of entrants in t and Pt is the choice probability

of entry at t. Similarly, the expected number of gross exits is:

                   —        x   n1                                                                  (2)



where        is the expected number of gross exits,                      is the probability of exit

at time t, and nt—i, the number of existing firms, represents the population

from which     exiting firms               are   drawn.    Combining equations (1)   and (2), we have:
                   —
                       I'   x          —

where        is the actual net entry in t and u is a random number obeying the                      usual

assumptions of regression.'

        Our next task is to specify the variables on which the probability of entry

and exit           and             depend and to indicate an appropriate and measurable proxy

variable for N, the population of potential entrants. In general terme, we have

already     noted      that     P depends upon disequilibria between supply and delMnd, upon

the perceived risks of entry, and on the attributes (mainly production and marketing

Coats)      of existing         firms and of the population of potential entrants. We now turn

to a more concrete specification of these variables.

unbserved expected net entry.

       A correct measure of the magnitude of transitory disequilibrium is the

 difference between actual price,                                        In the absence of

 rate in demand and, hence, output, per firm. That is:

period in creating new capacity and             partly    from dynamic adjustment costs. The

latter lead to diseconoinies with high growth and such diseconomies are assumed

to   be an increasing function of the growth rate.1 As a result, with a high

growth rate per firm,            prices can be expected to rise, thus raising    the expected
rate of return to entry.
       We turn now    to risk. We cannot, of course, measure all the forces that
Influence   risk.     However,      for   a given objective probability distribution of rates

of return to investment in a new             product   market, the perceived risk to a potential
entrant   is   a   function of how many other firms made successful investments         in the
same market. We characterize thi. as              the    "demonstration effect" and assie it to
be a function of nt—i, the number of existing firms in the market.

       If we assume       that   entry (or diffusion in use) depends exclusively on the

demonstration effect,        ni, and the        population of potential entrants (or users),

I,   a familiar model of diffusion emerges. First, consider the              case where cs(t),

      We have now specified the demonstration effect as controlling perceptions

 of risk and we have specified our proxy for transitory disequilibrium.    Next,

 consider the attributes of existing firms in the market and of the population of

 potential entrants. As a simplification, and in the absence of contrary informa-

 tion, we assume that both sets of firms are drawn from a coimnon universe except

with respect to one class of attributes. Existing firms will have accumulated

over the period they have been in the market a stock of knowledge and experience,

of human capital that is not rapidly reproducible, and of goodwill in the market.

Consequently, they have an advantage over new entrants which is an increasing

function of the accumulated volume of past production (and sales). We approximate

the effect of such accumulated experience by     Eq1/Zq where Eq_1 is the
accumulated aggregate output from the initial introduction of the product to t—l.

It is deflated by
                        the accumulated aggregate output to the end of the

interval covered by our data to permit the use of pooled cross—section as well

as time—series data.

     The effect of accumulated experience
                                             will, ceteris paribus, steadily increase
over time until it becomes a prohibitive barrier to entry for most firms. However

the faster the rate of technical change in production processes or products, the

less is the relevance of past experience for the future, and the higher the

technical change in products the smaller is the effect of accumulated goodwill.

A proxy for technical change should therefore have a positive sign in our model.

     To conclude the discussion of gross entry, we specify that the population of

potential entrants, ,   is   proportional to the number of firms in the host industry
of the product innovation. Implicit in this is the assumption there are

technological and marketing linkages among product markets in the same industry.

It further assumes the size of the population of firms technically equipped to

enter an industry (though not already in it) is related to the number of firms
                                                —7—



in the     industry. Obviously these assumptions are       viewed only as approximations
to   reaLity.     How good    such approximations are is an empirical   question   as is our
compromise    with theory in defining the boundaries of industries in accordance
with   the 4—digit SIC classification.

       Turning now to           the   probability of exit, we must once again, in the

context of limited information, start with simplifying assumptions. Specifically,

we start with the premise that existing firms have valid engineering forecasts

of their costs, and that the principal surprises and disappointment. leading to

exit   result     f rain errors in forecasting prices and market demand (or output).

Obviously, there will be instances of exit arising from unique          historical cir-
cumstances such as the retirement of an          owner-manager, or the inability of some

firms to    produce a product that appeals to end users. But how important these
special circumstances are is an empirical question to be tested indirectly by

the adequacy of the general variables as explanations of the relevant phenomenon.

       To test our hypotheses on exit, we employed a method first developed by Solow.1

$a].y, we constructed a number of hypothetical series of expected output and
pric, by the model of adaptive expectations. The model specifies that

       •     + A(x—x)        where   x   and   are, respectively, the expected and the

actual values of       the   variable under consideration at time t,   and A is the speed
of   adjustment with values between zero and one. For a given A, a time series of

the   expected output and       price can be constructed by iteration, starting with a

singl. initial      value    and using the observed time series of output and price as

elements. We created hypothetical time series of the expected output and price

for A —    0.1,    0.5 and 0.9, representing a slow, moderate,and fast adjustment process.

Assuming that      the expected and     actual values   are the same   at   some imitial point

in time, a time series of error rates in expectations can              be   generated,

               t   —
                       L,2,...,T,   based on the differences between the actual and

expected values.

       Using the time     series    of error rates in expectations of output and         price,
we took two—year averages of the error rates in expectations as well as the

annual estimates. This was done partly because of the arbitrariness of a one—

year interval in assessing the effects of disappointments and surprises on exit

decisions, but partly also to differentiate between immediate (short—run) and

lagged (long—run) effects. Accordingly we used q for output (or p for price)
and        for   output (or            for price) in our equation where q (or p) is the

       Before turning to empirical tests, a review of some of the economic issues
raised   by our model may      be   helpful. First, can   a   general model devoid of the

imique   institutional aspects of each product market explain               the observed pheno—

menon? For example, we have said nothing about the role of a small number of
critical patents as entry barriers even though patents are commonly believed to
have had a role in some of          the product markets with which we dealt. Second,

though diseconomie.       of   scale have often been proposed by economists as

eiplanationa     for   entry instead of       faster growth by existing firms,       we have
excluded this      variable from our model. Since th. average siza of firm normally

continues to grow       long   after      net entry approaches zero, diseconomies of scale

are   viable explanations of the history of diffusion in production only if special

assumptions are made about shifts over time           in the minimum and maximum efficient

       A third basic issue is our assumption that there is a definable and

measurable population of potential entrants as distinct from the universe of

business    firms. And finally,               there is the question of the power           of several
variables,     in terms of their effect on entry.                   In particular, what is         the

influence of the demonstration effect, of accumulated experience and                           goodwill,
and of dynamic        adjustment     costs?

Estimation Procedure

       The estimating procedure that was appropriate differed from ordinary least

squares    because of the need to impose                inequality   constraints on the parameters.

Since the probability of entry or of exit cannot be less than zero or greater

than 1, and        since    OLS estimates do not guarantee parameters that fall within

these limits, a constraint needs to be imposed. The imposition of constraints,

as the section on statistical results will show,                     considerably        improved our

results    in terms        of consistency         of estimates with theory.

      We   may specify        our model       for   Et, actual      net   entry,   as   follows:


                          Zw         +
                                         u,         t1,2,...,T                                           (7)

                                                    j—l,2,...,9..


and
      x    (j—l2,...,L) is an explanatory variable of the probability of entry at

time t or                    (ju"2+l,...g) is an explanatory variable of the probability

of   exit at   time t, or
                                         Os       are parameters associated with the explanatory

variables,     xj's.
      We may       write our     linear inequality constraints in the form

       We assume that the error term u satisfies the usual Gauss—Markov

conditions.       The above procedure can be formulated as a quadratic

programming problem and solved by a finite computational routine such as the

Lemke algorithm. The resulting estimates of 0 will be asymptotically unbiased,

consistent, and   efficient, provided   the specification is correct •

Data
       The sample of product innovations was selected from a set of forty—six

product histories developed in connection with a related research project.2 Of

the forty—six, only six had data on output, prices, number of firms, and

patents, over the entire period necessary for our analysis.

Our method of analysis involves tKe pooling of cross—section and         time—series data
so that complete, or almost complete, histories were essential.

       Information on number of firma was obtained from Thomas'      Register   of American

Manufactures,. supplemented by correspondence with industry experts and         by   a
variety of other trade sources. Annual data on the number of patents issued for
each product were obtained from the United States Patent Office. Data on prices
and output were derived from a variety of government and private sources,
including trade publications and information provided by companies in the relevant
product markets. Counts of product and process improvements subsequent to the
initial introduction of each of the six products were also derived from a wide
variety of published and unpublished sources, including product histories
provided by individual companies. N was based on data from the Census of Manufac-
tures for 1947, 1954, 1958, and 1963.

      As previously noted, the period chosen for each of the six products,
encompassed the interval from take—off in entry or the time when the complete
data became available to the time when the number of firms in the market reached
its   historical peak. The products and relevant time intervals are listed below.

1. DDT, 1944—52 (9 years)

2. Strepto*ycin, 1946—53 (8 years)

3. Styrene, 1955-65 (U years)

4. Television        receivers,    1946—55 (10      years)
5.    Transistors, 1954—61 (8 years)

6. Cathode ray tubes, 1948—1959 (12 years)

strong explanatory variables and with the correct signs for the lagged variables.

Our beet results were with a moderate speed of adjustment coefficient , X —          .5,
for       errors in output expectations and a much faster adjustment, A —      .9,   for

errors in price expectations. The reversal of signs on current and lagged errors

in expectations is, a priori, plausible. Greater expected than realized values

reflect optimism and, in the short run, should not lead to exit. It takes time

for disappointments to take their effect on decisions to leave the market.

      Among the negative results, dynamic adjustment costs leading to disequilibria——

at least to the extent that this variable can be measured by the growth rate in

output per firm——did not have a statistically significant effect on entry.

Neither did the proxies for rate of technical. change. In the case of the

annual volume of patenting, the deficiency is in the choice of proxy. The number

of   patents does not capture   technological change for two reasons: first, impor-

tant patents are not distinguished from trivial   ones and, second, it is in any
event an index    of the Input of innovative effort rather than of the output of
innovations.    We employed this proxy only because It has       been widely used In
economic literature (we believe, incorrectly) as an index of technical change.
Our second index of technical change, the number of product and production

process Improvements    failed to contribute to explaining the phenomenon perhaps
because the    information is too   thin to be ueed in the context of a model tested
against   annual data. Too many of the annual observations were zeros.

entry history is decomposed into stages each consisting of a number of years, the
frequency of product and production process innovations is much higher during
periods of high than of low entry.

       The positive results appear to be quite robust in the sense that minor
changes in either the list of variables (as indicated in Table 1) or the choice
of a lag (to conserve space, results using alternative lags are not shown) do
not   markedly change th. a's and 8's.   Similarly, the use of alternative speed
of adjustment coefficients for expectation errors, while it reduces the R2, does

not, in moat instances, change the signs or the statistical significance of the

key variables. In contrast,    if inequality constrained least squares is sub-
stituted   by ordinary least squares estimation——a procedure we have indicated is

inappropriate——the results are materially affected.

       Pinally, a question might be raised whether, because of unidentified

structural changes, net entry declines simply as the time approaches the point

at which the number of   producers is at a historical peak. Using T as the
symbol for that point, we added T—t to the list of variables in the model
specified by equation (10). The    additional variable contributed nothing to
explaining   net entry and, in fact, R2 adjusted for degrees of freedom declined.

Conclusions

       The empirical results confirm that a simple model—simple in terms of

number of variables——is sufficient to explain most of the phenomenon of diffusion

in the production of an innovation. The principal variable that explains

diffusion of entry is the demonstration effect. The principal variable that

retards entry and finally brings it to an end is the accumulated experience and

goodwill of existing firms, operating as a barrier to entry. A limiting force

is the population of potential entrants approximated by the number of firms in

the host industry of a product innovation (minus, of course, the number that

have already entered). None of these variables appears to lend itself readily

to influence by public policy.

    Our study begins with the point in time corresponding to entry by the
first   competitors of the   initial innovators. The first stage——the interval
from first commercial introduction of the product to entry by competitors—
varies greatly in duration. It may      well be   that institutional variables,

including public policy, have a greater impact on the length of this
                                                                           first
