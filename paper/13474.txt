Introduction

       Currie and Stabile (2006) (hereafter, JCMS) made a significant contribution to our

understanding of the influence of ADHD symptoms on a variety of school outcomes including

participation in special education, grade repetition and test scores. They did so using samples of

children ages 4-12 who are then tracked for 6 years, in the United States and Canada. Their

contributions include using a broad sample of children, including symptoms rather than only

diagnosed cases of ADHD and estimating sibling fixed effects models to control for unobserved

family effects. In this paper we extend their findings by looking at a sample of slightly older

children and confirm and extend many of the JCMS findings in terms of a broader set of

measures of human capital.

       Our contribution is to explore the issue of the impact of ADHD on a sample of somewhat

older children and examine educational outcomes that occur somewhat later in life. We also

explore family effects: that is, does having a sibling with ADHD play a role in human capital

accumulation? We first report on the consistency of our results with those of JCMS using both a

full sample and then a sibling or fixed effects approach. We then ask if the effect of ADHD on

outcomes of older children is as negative as those on younger children. Finally we report on

findings relating to family effects; that is, is the human capital accumulation of children who

have a sibling with ADHD negatively affected? Following JCMS we also use responses to a set

of symptoms of ADHD rather than focusing only on children with ADHD diagnosis.

       As noted in JCMS, ADHD is the most common mental illness among young children.

Children with ADHD may be hyperactive, inattentive or both. As such, they are more likely to

have difficulties in concentrating and carrying out tasks in school, may be disorderly at home and


                                                 2
in school and may be disruptive to those around them. With the exception of JCMS and recent

papers by Fletcher and Wolfe (2007) and Fletcher and Lehrer (2007), most studies of the

outcomes of ADHD on children do not control for other factors which may be associated with

the both the frequency of ADHD and these poor outcomes, such as living in disadvantaged

communities and/or having parents with low levels of human capital. We follow these studies in

using family fixed effects in an attempt to control for unobserved factors that might lie behind

the prevalence of ADHD and negative outcomes.

       We conduct our analysis using the restricted version of the National Longitudinal Study

of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is a school-based, longitudinal study of the

health-related behaviors of adolescents and their outcomes in young adulthood. Beginning with

an in-school questionnaire administered to a nationally representative sample of students in

grades 7 through 12 in 1994-95, the data include follows up with a series of in-home interviews

of students approximately one year and then six years later. Additional data are derived from

questionnaires filled in by parents, siblings, fellow students, and school administrators. Our

measure of ADHD is based on a series of survey questions that are more comprehensive than

that used by JCMS; however, they are retrospective in that they are asked of individuals when

they are young adults (ages 18-28) and are asked to reflect on their experiences while they were

ages 5-12. Compared to the information used by JCMS, our measure of ADHD has the

advantage of self reporting (individuals report their own symptoms) and a larger set of questions

but the disadvantage of being retrospective. Because the questionnaires differ, the continuous

scales, though similar in concept, are not equivalent, in our comparative work with JCMS, we



                                                 3
focus on the 90% cut-off indicator of ADHD but also convert the estimated coefficients for the

specifications that include the scale scores to be as comparable as possible.

        Table 1 provides a comparison of the data set we are using with the U.S. based data set

used by JCMS. The first item is a comparison of the ADHD frequency. As noted above, the two

data sets use a somewhat different measure, though both are survey based and look at

characteristics. The Add Health measure is a retrospective measure filled in by the individual

themselves during Wave III when respondents were 18-28 years of age. The survey asks

respondents to think back to when they were between 5 and 12 and report how often they

performed a set of behaviors (e.g. squirmed in their seat, had difficulty sustaining attention in

tasks).1 In contrast, the measured used by JCMS was asked of parents of children ages 4-14 and

5 of 26 questions were used to create the hyperactivity scale. Both then refer to approximately

the same childhood ages and are based on symptoms rather than only on diagnosis. The first row

illustrates the higher mean number of questions on the Add Health scale but both show that the

full sample and sibling sample are similar.2 The second and third rows report the ADHD

measure using a cut-off for significant presence of ADHD symptoms. For both data sets, males

are much more likely to be above this threshold than females. Again, the full sample and sibling

subsamples are similar. The slightly lower value for the Add Health data is based on our choice

to link the measure to clinical significance. The included measure closely mirrors the symptoms


1
  One item asked in the retrospective ADHD section of wave III (“You were spiteful or vindictive”) is not a DSM-
IV ADHD symptom and was excluded from analyses; while 1 DSM-IV impulsivity symptom (“Often interrupts or
intrudes on others”) was not included in the retrospective ADHD section. Thus, our analyses included responses to 9
inattentive and 8 hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. Following Kollins et al. (2005) as well as community based
samples (Murphy and Barley 1996), a symptom was considered present if it was experienced “often” or “very
often.”
2
  Only the ADHD scale score is statistically different between the full and sibling sample in the Add Health data.

serving as the criteria for diagnosing ADHD in the 2000 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for

Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR).3

        The grade repetition indicator refers to years 1994-2000 for the NLS-Y data and grades

7-12 for Add Health. When we add grade 6 so that the same number of years are in both, the

means are quite similar (5.8% vs. 6.8%). We chose to only examine this outcome in grades 7-12,

however, as we prefer an indicator of grade repetition following the report of symptoms, which

are asked for ages 5-12.4 Special education indicators are quite similar across data sets and

across the full and sibling data sets.5 Finally, in terms of family background, we note that family

income (in 1994) is remarkably similar across data sets while the mother’s education suggests

somewhat better educated mothers among the Add-Health population. (This may reflect the

oversampling of disadvantaged individuals in the NLS-Y.) The difference in child’s age reflects

the different sampling strategies of the two samples and also suggests our ability to look at

longer term outcomes compared to the NLS-Y data analysis.



Results

        We move now to estimation of the relationship of the human capital and ADHD

symptoms. The equations take two forms:

        (1) Yi = α + βADHDi + λX i + ε i



3
  The DSM-IV-TR criteria can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/symptom.htm. The Add Health
survey contains all items except the impulsivity question, “Often interrupts or intrudes on others.”
4
  Our results do not significantly change if we use grades 6-12 rather than 7-12.
5
  The NLS-Y measure includes parent reports for the year 2000 when children were approximately 8-16 years old.
The Add Health measure includes parent reports for the year 1994/95 when the children were approximately 12-18
years old.

                                                       5
where Yi is one of the human capital outcomes for child i, ADHD is an indicator of a child’s

ADHD symptoms over ages 5-12, X is a set of additional covariates and β and λ are coefficients

to be estimated, and

           (2) Yif = α + β ADHDif + λZ if + μ f + ε i

where Z is a subset of covariates X that differ between siblings, and f indexes families or

siblings.

           Replication Results: Our initial set of estimates are quite similar to JCMS and are

reported in Table 2.6 To show comparability between our results and JCMS, we initially focus

on grade repetition and special education. The first results shown in Table 2 are those using

dummy variable indicators for ADHD in the NLSY and for Add Health. The Add Health

measure reflects the clinically relevant cutoffs for ADHD described above and the NLSY

measure indicates whether the child is in the upper decile of the hyperactivity scale.7 These

results in rows 1 and 2 that use dummy variables are very similar with coefficients of .06 versus

.07 for grade repetition and .08 and .12 for special education. The next two rows report results

using the full scale. Because the scales differ in the two samples, we multiply the coefficients by

the standard deviation of the scale scores (8.89 in Add Health and 3.81 in the NLSY) to obtain

adjusted or standardized coefficients. The resulting estimates are nearly identical for the two

samples. The standardized coefficients for grade repetition are .018 for Add Health and .015 for

NLSY; for special education they are .031 and .028 respectively. All four adjusted coefficients

are statistically significant at the 95 percent level. Both sets of results thus provide evidence that

6
    Full results for all tables are presented in the appendix.


                                                                 6
the mental health symptoms of ADHD are tied to statistically significant increased probabilities

of grade repetition and of being placed in special education.8 We consider the results using Add

Health to closely replicate those of NLSY and hence should be viewed as comparable to the

JCMS results. On this basis we proceed to extend the JCMS results by considering longer term

educational outcomes.

        Extended Results: Because the children in Add Health are older, we are able to analyze

longer run human capital outcomes. We do this below first for those within secondary schools

and then move on to longer term measures of human capital using the same sample and same

approach - OLS followed by family fixed effects.

        We begin with grade point average, computed as the average letter-grade in mathematics,

English, history, and science classes during wave 1.9 Here we find that the OLS results suggest

on average a quarter point lower GPA for those with ADHD symptoms; once family fixed

effects are taken into account this is reduced somewhat–to -.15 and is no longer statistically

significant at the 95% level. This change may be due solely to the addition of unobserved family

factors or may also tie to the smaller sample size. Nevertheless, taken together we view these

results as an indication of a negative influence of ADHD on grades.




7
  As mentioned above, the Add Health scale is based on DSM-IV criteria whereas the NLSY scale is somewhat ad
hoc and is based on five hyperactivity questions available in the 26-question Behavior Problems Index.
8
  JCMS find that using their ADHD cutoff, boys are more likely to be placed in special education and that negative
effects on test scores are confined to boys. Our results are roughly consistent with those of JCMS. We find that
boys with ADHD symptoms are more likely to be placed in special education, but the difference is not statistically
significant (4%, p-value <.14). We also find suggestive evidence that boys with ADHD are more likely to repeat a
grade (2.6%, p-value <.11). Full results are presented in the appendix.
9
  In cases where students were not enrolled in a particular subject (e.g. history), their grades for their enrolled
subjects were used.

                                                         7
       Turning to our other within secondary school indicators, Suspended, Expelled and Drop-

out, we find that in every case of these measures of human capital at older ages, the full sample

results suggest a link between ADHD symptoms and higher probabilities of these outcomes but

the FE estimates are smaller than the full sample estimates. Only in the case of suspensions is

there any finding of a link between ADHD and this outcome once fixed effects are estimated. In

the case of suspensions, the higher probability estimated in both models is approximately 0.15.

Finally when we look at longer term measures of years of education and probability of attending

college, our FE estimates suggest there is not a significant influence of ADHD on either of these

measures of length of schooling once unobserved family effects are taken into account. (Our full

sample results are consistent with the existing literature which finds a negative and sizeable

negative influence of ADHD on years of schooling, the probability of not completing high

school and the lower probability of attending college).

       At first glance then, it appears that the influence of ADHD on human capital outcomes

are short-term in nature, once unobserved family effects are taken into account. The results

appear stronger in the sense that the results for shorter term outcomes are generally consistent

with those of JCMS.

       The results for longer term educational outcomes seem somewhat counter-intuitive. We

would expect that the influence of ADHD might indeed reduce human capital, and if not

cumulative, would have a long run influence. To explore this, we developed another hypothesis:

that ADHD has negative influences on not just the child with the symptoms, but also on others

such as family members and in particular, on siblings. This could occur as families over longer

periods of time attempt to compensate the child having ADHD, which would reduce

                                                 8
investments, including time, with the other children, and lower measured differences between

siblings. Or there could be a direct negative influence of living with a disruptive sibling who has

ADHD. Thus we estimate a third equation to capture the idea that having a sibling with ADHD

may have a negative influence on a child’s human capital accumulation:

         (3) Yi = α + βADHDi + δADHD j + λX i + ε i

where ADHD j indicates the presence of another child in this child’s family who has ADHD.

The result presented in Table 4 are consistent with our hypothesis: having a sibling with ADHD

reduces the human capital of the child with ADHD and the longer run measures of human capital

for additional children in the household. These results then suggest that other family fixed

effects results underestimate the human capital consequences of ADHD for they only have

analyzed the individual directly affected. Here we find that siblings also suffer a long term

reduction in human capital. Since these estimates which are based on equation (3) do not contain

family fixed effects10 they are subject to omitted variables bias. To test the sensitivity of these

results, we first estimate a specification with an extended number of family-level characteristics

and subsequently estimate a random effects specification. We find the sibling spillover results

presented in Table 4 to be robust (see appendix table 10A).11



Conclusion

10
   In this context, family fixed effects are collinear with the inclusion of dummy variables indicating each siblings’
ADHD status and we would only be able to identify the sibling ADHD spillover effects off of families with more
than two siblings in the data who are discordant in ADHD status (less than 40 individuals).
11
   Including the community unemployment rate, the community proportion in poverty, maternal smoking status,
father’s education level, parent’s general health status, parent’s age, reports of parents’ alcoholism status, receipt of
AFDC or Food Stamps, and parental reports of education expectations decreases the coefficient on sibling spillovers


                                                           9
        In this paper, we corroborate the short-term educational consequences of ADHD shown

by JCMS and extend the examination to longer-term educational outcomes of children with

ADHD symptoms. Like the results by JCMS for the children in the NLS-Y, we find evidence

that children in the Add Health dataset who have ADHD symptoms are more likely to repeat a

grade and receive special education services. We then show that standard OLS results imply that

children with ADHD face longer-term educational disadvantages, including lower grade point

averages, increases in suspension and expulsions, and fewer completed years of schooling.

However, we find that nearly all of these results are not robust to the inclusion of family fixed

effects, suggesting that short term consequences of educational outcomes do not lead to longer

term educational consequences in a straightforward manner.

        Why might we expect to find short term but not long term consequences of childhood

ADHD symptoms on educational outcomes? We conjecture that over a longer time period, either

parents are more able to compensate children with ADHD, which could lead to smaller within-

sibling differences in educational outcomes or having a disruptive sibling with ADHD reduces

the human capital of other children in the family. Building on this conjecture, we extend the

literature by adding measures of ADHD symptoms of siblings to predict own-education

outcomes and find evidence that having a sibling with ADHD is harmful to education outcomes.

This suggests that the consequences of ADHD extend beyond those found by Currie and Stabile

and strengthen their call for additional school resources to focus on those with ADHD

symptoms.

              Coefficients in rows 3-6 represent the estimated coefficients of the scale score
              multiplied by the standard deviation of the scale scores (8.89 in Add Health and 3.81 in
              the NLSY) for comparability between scales. Full results for the Add Health
              specifications (Rows 1, 3, and 5) can be found in Tables 2A and 3A in the appendix.

           high school from the sample. Sample sizes vary for the full sample between 14,068 and
           12,511 depending on the outcome. For the family sample, the sample size varies
           between 3.019 and 2,662. Results using the ADHD scale rather than a binary indicator
           as well as using the 90% cutoff of the ADHD scale (following JCMS) are quite similar

                  statistically significant at the 90% level. All results use robust standard errors clustered at the
                  school or family level. Basic models include all covariates listed in Table 9A (column 1).
                  Extended models include the covariates in the Basic models and the community unemployment
                  rate, the community proportion in poverty, maternal smoking status, father’s education level,
                  parent’s general health status, parent’s age, reports of parents’ alcoholism status, receipt of AFDC
                  or Food Stamps, and parental reports of education expectations. Random Effects specifications
                  only contain the following covariates: general health status, birth order, sex, and age.
