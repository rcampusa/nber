                                              ABSTRACT

This paper reviews the problems and potential benefits of integrating personality psychology into economics.
Economists have much to learn from and contribute to personality psychology.

   What can economists learn from and contribute to personality psychology? What do we learn from

personality psychology? Personality traits predict many behaviors—sometimes with the same or greater

strength as conventional cognitive traits. Personality psychology considers a wider array of actions than

are usually considered by economists and enlarges the economist’s way to describe and model the world.

Personality traits are not set in stone. They change over the life cycle. They are a possible avenue for policy

intervention.

   Personality psychologists lack precise models. Economics provides a clear framework for recasting the

field. Economics now plays an important role in clarifying the concepts and empirical content of psychology.

More precise models reveal basic identification problems that plague measurement in psychology. At an

empirical level, “cognitive” and “noncognitive” traits are not easily separated.

   Moreover, personality psychologists typically present correlations and not causal relationships. Many

contemporaneously measured relationships suffer from the problem of reverse causality. Economists can apply

their tools to define and estimate causal mechanisms. In addition, psychological measures have substantial

measurement error. Econometric tools account for measurement error, and doing so makes a difference.

Economists formulate and estimate mechanisms of investment—how traits can be changed for the better.

   There are major challenges in integrating personality psychology and economics. Economists need to

link the traits of psychology with the preferences, constraints and expectation mechanisms of economics. We

need to develop rigorous methods for analyzing causal relationships in both fields. We also need to develop

a common language and a common framework to promote interdisciplinary exchange.

   There is a danger in assuming that basic questions of content and identification have been answered by

psychologists at the level required for rigorous economic analysis. In explaining outcomes, how important is

the person? How important is the situation? How important is their interaction? I address these issues in

this paper.




1.0.     A Brief History of Personality Psychology
Alfred Binet, architect of the first modern intelligence test that became the Stanford-Binet IQ test, noted

that performance in school


     “...admits of other things than intelligence; to succeed in his studies, one must have qualities
     which depend on attention, will, and character; for example a certain docility, a regularity of
     habits, and especially continuity of effort. A child, even if intelligent, will learn little in class if
     he never listens, if he spends his time in playing tricks, in giggling, is playing truant.”

     -Binet (1916, p. 254)


                                                        3
   All later pioneers have made similar statements. Many feature the Big Five trait “Conscientiousness” as

a main determinant of success.1 Before considering the Big Five traits, it is useful to briefly examine the

modern concept of cognition by way of contrast.




2.0.        Cognition: “g”— a single factor that is claimed to

            represent intelligence
Traditional “g” is a product of early Twentieth Century psychology. The concept of “g” has been broadened

even beyond the traditional subcomponents of “fluid” and “crystallized” intelligence. Figure 1 summarizes

current thinking where “g” or general intelligence is at the top of a large pyramid of cognitive traits.

3.0.      Personality Traits
Early pioneers used a lexical approach to define personality. They classified words that are used to describe

people. This practice culminated in the “Big Five” derived from factor analysis of measurements of person-

ality extracted from a variety of measures—observer reports, tests and measured productivity on the job

(Costa and McCrae, 1992; Goldberg, 1993). No single “gp ” explains all traits. There are strong correlations

within clusters but weak correlations across clusters.

   The Big Five predict many outcomes. The Big Five are defined without reference to any context (i.e.,

situation). This practice gives rise to an identification problem that I discuss below.




4.0.        The Person-Situation Debate: A Strong Influence

            on Behavioral Economics
Is variation across people in behavior a consequence of personal traits or of situations? Economists are still

badly divided over this question. The modern origins of the debate start with the works of psychologist

Walter Mischel:


      “. . . with the possible exception of intelligence, highly generalized behavioral consistencies have not
      been demonstrated, and the concept of personality traits as broad dispositions is thus untenable”

      -Mischel (1968, p. 146)


   Many behavioral economists hold a similar view and appeal to Mischel as a guiding influence.


      “The great contribution to psychology by Walter Mischel [. . . ] is to show that there is no such
      thing as a stable personality trait.”

      -Thaler (2008)


   The accumulated evidence speaks strongly against the claims of Mischel and the behavioral economists.2




5.0.        Personality Psychology After the Person-Situation

            Debate
Correlational evidence shows that for many outcomes, measured personality traits are as predictive, and

are sometimes more predictive, than standard measures of cognition. Traits are stable across situations.

Situations also matter. Behavioral genetics show that personality traits are as heritable as cognitive traits.

Alterations in brain structure and function through accidents, disease and by experiments affect measured

personality.3

  3 See   Almlund et al. (2011).

6.0.      The Predictive Power of Personality Traits
A growing body of evidence suggests that personality measures–especially those related to Conscientiousness,

and, to a lesser extent, Neuroticism–predict a wide range of outcomes. The predictive power of any particular

personality measure tends to be less than the predictive power of IQ but in some cases rivals or exceeds it.




7.0.      Difficulties in Synthesizing Studies of the Effects of

          Personality
Measures of personality and cognition differ among studies. Different studies use different measures of

predictive power. Many studies do not address the question of causality, i.e., does the measured trait cause

(rather than just predict) the outcome?

   Few economists or psychologists working on the relationship between personality and outcomes address

the issue of causality, and when they do so, it is usually by employing early measures of cognition and

personality to predict later outcomes This practice trades an endogeneity problem with an errors in variables

problem. Almlund et al. (2011) discuss alternative approaches to causality building on the analysis of Hansen

et al. (2004).




8.0.      Main Findings from Predictive Analyses
The predictive power of “g” decreases with the level of job complexity. Personality traits are predictive at

all levels of job complexity. Conscientiousness is the most predictive Big Five trait across many outcomes

such as educational attainment, grades, job performance across a range of occupational categories, longevity

and criminality. Neuroticism (and related Locus of Control) predicts schooling outcomes and labor market

search. Other traits play roles at finer levels. I now present examples of the power of personality traits.



8.1. Educational Attainment and Achievement
In explaining educational attainment, Conscientiousness plays a powerful role. See Figure 2.

et al., 2011.)
Note: The figure displays standardized regression coefficients from multivariate of years of school attended on the Big Five and
intelligence, controlling for age and age-squared. The bars represent standard errors. The Big Five coefficients are corrected for
attenuation bias. The Big Five were measured in 2005. Years of schooling were measured in 2008. Intelligence was measured
in 2006. The measures of intelligence were based on components of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). The data is
a representative sample of German adults between the ages of 21 and 94.




    Another example is the GED in America. GEDs are high school dropouts who exam certify to be high

school equivalents. They have the same cognitive skills as high school graduates but much lower noncognitive

skills. See Figures 3 and 4.




                                                                8

    GEDs earn at the rate of dropouts. Their lower levels of noncognitive skill leads to lower wages than

ordinary high school graduates even though they have the same level of cognitive skills.

    Cognitive and noncognitive skills are both important in explaining college graduation. See Figures 5 and

6 . Persons with low levels of noncognitive skills are unlikely to graduate college, as are persons with low

levels of cognitive skills.

    Similar results hold for course grades. See Figure 7. Indeed, course grades are a good measure of

conscientiousness. (See Almlund et al., 2011; Borghans et al., 2011.)

Notes: All correlations are significant at the 1% level. The correlations are corrected for scale reliability and come from a meta
analysis representing a collection of studies representing samples of between N=31,955 to N=70,926, depending on the trait.

8.2. Labor Market Outcomes
Intelligence is the greatest single predictor of job performance, especially in complex tasks, but noncognitive

skills are also important predictors. See Figure 8.

Notes: The values for personality are correlations that were corrected for sampling error, censoring, and measurement error.
Job performance was based on performance ratings, productivity data and training proficiency. The authors do report the
timing of the measurements of personality relative to job performance. Of the Big Five, the coefficient on Conscientiousness is
the only one that is statistically significant with a lower bound on the 90credibility value of 0.10. The value for IQ is a raw
correlation.
Sources: The correlations reported for personality traits come from a meta-analysis conducted by Barrick and Mount (1991).
The correlation reported for IQ and job performance come from Schmidt and Hunter (2004).




8.3. Longevity
Personality traits also predict longevity. In particular, Conscientiousness is a better predictor than IQ. See

Figure 9.

Status (SES)




Notes: The figure represents results from a meta-analysis of 34 studies. Average effects (in the correlation metric) of low
socioeconomic status (SES), low IQ, low Conscientiousness (C), low Extraversion/Positive Emotion (E/PE), Neuroticism (N),
and low Agreeableness (A) on mortality. Error bars represent standard error. The lengths of the studies represented vary from
1 year to 71 years.

9.0.       Conceptualizing Personality Within an Economic

           Model
How should one conceptualize these correlations and establish a causal basis for them? Recent work (Almlund

et al., 2011) develops economic models of personality and their implications for measurement of personality

and preference. They place the concept of personality within an economic framework. Personality is defined

as an emergent property of a system. Economic models frame and solve a central identification problem in

empirical psychology: How to go from measurements of personality to personality traits.

    It is important to distinguish personality traits from measured personality. One definition of

personality by a leading psychologist is:

      “Personality traits are the relatively enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that
      reflect the tendency to respond in certain ways under certain circumstances.”

      -Roberts (2009, p. 140)

    His conceptual framework for personality is presented in Figure 10. Personality is a property of a system.

This type of analysis is typical of the models used in personality psychology.

10.0.      An Economic Framework for Conceptualizing and

           Measuring Personality and Personality Traits
How can we interpret personality within economic models? Through preferences (the standard approach),

constraints (Borghans et al., 2008) or through expectations? Or does it operate through all three?



10.1. Personality Affects Productivity
Almlund et al. (2011) develop models in which productivity in task j depends on the traits of agents

represented by trait vector θ, and the “effort” they expend on the task, ej :


                              Pj = φj (θ , ej ),    j ∈ J = {1, . . . , J} , ej ∈ E, θ ∈ Θ.                          (1)

might diminish effort in another. If tasks are mutually exclusive, we obtain the Roy model (Heckman and

Honoré, 1990; Heckman and Sedlacek, 1985).



10.2. Identifying Personality Traits From Measured Performance

           on Tasks
I next consider a basic identification problem. Some tasks may require only a single trait or only a subset

of all of the traits. Divide θ into “mental” (µ) and “personality” (π) traits, θµ and θπ . To use performance

on a task (or on multiple measures of the task) to identify a trait requires that performance on certain

tasks (performance on a test, performance in an interpersonal situation, etc.) depends exclusively on one

component of θ, say θ1,j , as well as on the effort used in the task. Thus measurement assumes task j output




                                                               14
is generated by the following relationship:


                                                  Pj = φj ( θ1,j , ej ).
                                                            |{z}
                                                               single
                                                                trait
                                                              used in
                                                              trait j


We need to standardize for effort at a benchmark level, say e∗ , to use Pj to identify a measure of the trait

θ1,j .

    The activity of picking a task (or a collection of tasks) that measure a particular trait (θ1,j in our example)

is called operationalization in psychology. Demonstrating that a measure successfully operationalizes a

trait is called construct validity. Note, however, that we need to standardize for effort to measure the

trait. Otherwise variation in effort produces variation in the measured trait across situations with different

incentives.



10.3. A Fundamental Identification Problem
Operationalization and construct validation require heroic assumptions. Even if one adjusts for effort in

a task, measured productivity may depend on multiple traits. Thus two components of θ (say θ1,µ , θ1,π )

may determine productivity in j. Without further information, one cannot infer which of the two traits

produces the productivity in j. In general, even having two (or more) measures of productivity that depend

on (θ1,µ , θ1,π ) is not enough to identify the separate components.

    Consider the following case of two productivity measures for the two tasks j and j 0 :


                                       Pj = φj (θ1,µ , θ1,π , ej )

                                      Pj 0 = φj 0 (θ1,µ , θ1,π , ej 0 ) ,   j 6= j 0 .


    Standardize measurements at a common level of effort ej = ej 0 = e∗ . Note that if the supports of ej and

ej 0 are disjoint, no (θ1,µ , θ1,π ) exists. Assume that the φk () are known. If the system of equations satisfies

a local rank condition, then one can solve for the pair (θ1,µ , θ1,π ) at e∗ . Only the pair is identified. One

cannot (without further information) determine which component of the pair is θ1,µ or θ1,π .

    In the absence of dedicated constructs (constructs that are generated by only one component of θ),

there is an intrinsic identification problem that arises in using measures of productivity in tasks to infer

traits. Analysts have to make one normalization in order to identify the traits. However, we need only one

such construct joined with patterned structures on how θ enters other task to identify the vector θ (e.g. one

10.5. Measures of Personality in Psychology Based on Linear Fac-

            tor Analysis
Such measures account for measurement error, and identify factors that can be interpreted as traits. Cunha

et al. (2010) develop nonlinear factor models (nonlinear and nonparameteric). Using these models they

establish that measurement error is quantitatively important. The share of error variance for proxies of

cognition, personality and investment ranges from 1%–90%. Not accounting for measurement error produces

downward-biased estimates of self-productivity effects and perverse estimates of investment effects.




11.0.       A Definition of Personality
I now add preferences and goals to the analysis. Preferences and goals also shape effort. They are personality

traits broadly defined. Income is the return to productivity:

                                                                           J
                                                                           X
                                                          Income =               Rj Pj
                                                                           j=1




                                                                      18
Preferences are defined over final consumption goods X, productivity P and effort e:


                                                U (X, P, e | ψ) , ψ ∈ Ψ.                                              (3)


Agents have preferences over goods, agents may value the output of tasks in their own right and agents may

value the effort devoted to tasks. The agents maximize (3) with respect

11.1. Adding Uncertainty
Let I be the information possessed by an agent. “E” denotes the expectation operator. The agent can be

interpreted as making decisions based on


                                                E [U (X, P, e | ψ) | I] .                                             (5)



11.2. Personality Traits
Personality traits are the components of e, θ and ψ that affect behavior. We observe measured personal-

ity—behaviors generated by incentives, goals, and traits.



11.3. Actions
Actions are styles of behavior that affect how tasks are accomplished. They are aspects of behavior that go be-

yond effort. Smiling, cajoling, etc. are examples. Tasks are accomplished by taking actions. The ith possible
                                                                                                                     
action to perform task j is denoted ai,j , i ∈ {1, . . . , Kj }. Array actions in a vector aj = a1,j , . . . , aKj ,j ∈ A.

Actions may be the same or different across the tasks. The productivity of the agent in task j depends on

the actions taken in that task:
                                                                                
                                            Pj = τj a1,j , a2,j , . . . , aKj ,j .                                    (6)


   The actions themselves depend on traits θ and “effort” ei,j :


                                                   ai,j = νi,j (θ, ei,j )                                             (7)




                                                             19
where
                                         Kj                    J
                                         X                     X
                                               ei,j = ej and         ej = ē.
                                         i=1                   j=1

Actions generalize the notion of effort to a broader class of behaviors.

   Let M be the set of actions, including actions that do not directly contribute to productivity. Let M be

the index set of items in M


                                   ai,m = νi,m (θ, ei,m ) , m ∈ M, A ⊆ M.


The agent solves

                                         max E [U (a, X, P, e | ψ) | I]


with respect to X and e given the stated constraints.

   We can introduce situations indexed by h ∈ H. For a person with traits θ and effort vector ej with action

ai,j , using the specification (7), the action function can be expanded to be dependent on situation h:


                                            ai,j,h = νi,j (θ, ei,j,h , h).                                   (8)



11.4. A Definition of Personality
Let T ∈ T be a vector of traits (θ, ψ, ē). Personality is a response function.


                                    Personality: a = a (R, W, T, h, Y, I) .                                  (9)


The behavior that constitutes personality is defined as a pattern of actions in response to the constraints,

endowments, and incentives facing agents given their goals and preferences.

   Actions—not traits—constitute the data used to identify the traits. Personality psychologists use actions

(e.g., “dispositions”) to infer traits. Identification issues similar to those previously discussed apply to this

broader set of measurements of behaviors.



11.5. Personality as Enduring Actions
Many personality psychologists define personality as “enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviors”

that reflect tendencies of persons to respond in certain ways under certain circumstances. (See Cervone

and Pervin (2009).) What are enduring patterns of actions? “Enduring actions” are the average of the a



                                                         20
functions for a person with a given trait vector T = t over situations and efforts.



11.6. Average Actions
Consider task j and trait vector T = (θ, ψ, ē). Define the average action for information set I:

                                        Z
                      āT,j,I =                     νi,j (θ, ei,j , h) g (h, ei,j | T = (θ, ψ, ē), I) dh dei,j
                                  ST ,I (h,ei,j )



where ST,I (h, ei,j ) is the support of (h, ei,j ) given T and I. g (h, ei,j | T = (θ, ψ, ē), I) is the density of

(h, ei,j ) given T = (θ, ψ, ē) and information set I. āT,j,I is the “enduring action” of agents across situations

in task j with information I, i.e., the average personality. Only if νi,j is separable in T , the marginal

effect of personality trait vector θ is the same in all situations.

   One can define the “enduring traits” in a variety of ways, say by averaging over tasks, j, situations, h,

or both. Only under separability in T will one obtain the same marginal effect of θ. Epstein (1979) and

a subsequent literature present evidence against nonseparability but in favor of an “enduring trait” that is

common across situations. He argues strongly against the extreme form of situational specificity assumed in

modern behavioral economics.




12.0.      Stability and Change in Personality Traits and

           Preferences
While it is commonly thought that personality traits are stable, at least in adult life, in fact traits change

over the life cycle. See Figures 13–16.




                                                                    21

12.1. Processes of Development Discussed in the Literature
There are many hypothesized mechanisms of change. Two common processes discussed in the literature are

ontogeny (programmed developmental processes common to all persons) and sociogeny (shared socialization

processes). Personality also changes through external forces above and beyond common ontogenic and

sociogenic processes. Such changes operate through alterations in normal biology, such as brain lesions and

chemical interventions. A channel that receives a lot of attention in economics is investment: educational

interventions and parental investment that affect personality throughout the lifecycle.



12.2. Life Cycle Dynamics
Let T v be traits at age v, v ∈ {1, . . . , V } ∈ V. Information I v may be updated through various channels

of learning. The technology of skill formation (Cunha and Heckman, 2007, 2009) postulates the following

equation of motion:

                          T v+1 = η v (        Tv         ,   IN v , hv ), v = 0, . . . , V − 1.       (10)

                                      self-productivity investment

   Functions can be nonautonomous (v-dependent). Situations may change over time as a function of past

actions, past situations, investment, information, and the like:


                                              hv+1 = χv (hv , IN v , av ) .                            (11)


Information I v may also change over the life cycle through experimentation and learning:


                                          I v+1 = ρv (I v , av , T v , IN v , hv ) .                   (12)


Figure 17 summarizes the dynamics of skill formation as formulated in Cunha and Heckman (2007, 2009).

   Cunha et al. (2010) estimate technology (10) using longitudinal data on the development of children

with rich measures of parental investment and of child traits. Self-productivity becomes stronger as children

become older, for both cognitive and noncognitive capability formation. The elasticity of substitution for

cognitive inputs is smaller in the adolescent years, so that it is more difficult to compensate for the effects

of adverse environments on cognitive endowments at later ages than it is at earlier ages.

   This finding explains the evidence on ineffective cognitive remediation strategies for disadvantaged ado-

lescents. Personality traits foster the development of cognition but not vice versa. Cunha et al. (2010)

show that it is equally easy to substitute for deficits in personality traits at both early and late stages for

socioemotional skills over the life cycle.

   Overall, 16% of the variation in educational attainment is explained by factors extracted from adolescent

cognitive traits, 12% is due to factors extracted from adolescent personality (socioemotional traits), and 15%

is due to factors extracted from measured parental investments.



12.3. The Causal Effects of Schooling on Cognitive and Personality

            Traits
Using the methodology of Hansen et al. (2004), it is possible to estimate the causal effect of schooling on

cognitive and noncognitive measurements. See Figures 18–21. Schooling has substantial effects on both

types of traits.

12.4. The Evidence from Interventions
The Perry Preschool program intervened early in the lives of disadvantaged children. It has a 7–10%

rate of return per annum. (See Heckman et al., 2010.) The Perry Preschool Program did not have a

lasting improvement on cognitive ability, but it did improve important later-life outcomes through changes

in personality (Heckman et al., 2011).


   Figure 22: Perry Preschool Program: IQ, by Age and Treatment Group




Notes: IQ measured on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (Terman and Merrill, 1960). Test was administered at program
entry and each of the ages indicated.
Source: Cunha et al. (2006) and Heckman and Masterov (2007) based on data provided by the High Scope Foundation.




   The Perry Preschool Program worked primarily through socioemotional channels. It raised scores on

achievement tests but not IQ tests. As previously noted, socioemotional factors and cognitive factors both

explain performance on achievement tests (Duckworth, 2007; Borghans et al., 2008; Borghans et al., 2009).




13.0.       Personality and Preference Parameters
Measures of personality predict a wide range of life outcomes that economists study. Personality psycholo-

gists define traits as relatively stable, person-specific determinants of behavior. Preferences are the natural

counterpart of these traits in economics. However, the exact link between personality and preferences is

unclear. Table 3 shows one possible correspondence between conventional economic preference parameters

and personality measures.

                                    The evidence relating personality to time preferences is mixed. Using data from an

                           experiment involving college students, Daly, Delaney and Harmon [2009] find that a factor that

                           loads heavily on self-control, consideration of future consequences, elaboration of consequences,

                           affective mindfulness, and Conscientiousness, is negatively associated with the discount rate.

                           Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2010] measure time preferences experimentally, and while time

                           preference is related to cognition, Openness to Experience is the only Big Five trait that explains

                           some of the variation in time preference. Figure 7 reports correlations between experimental

                           measures of time preference, Big Five factors, and measures of cognition. 156 Here only cognitive

                           measures are correlated with time preference.

14.0.      Summary and Conclusions
What can economists take from and contribute to personality psychology? What do we learn from personality

psychology? Personality traits predict many behaviors sometimes with the same strength as conventional

cognitive traits. Personality psychology considers a wider array of actions than are usually considered by

economists. It enlarges the economist’s way to describe and model the world. Cognition is one aspect of

personality broadly defined.

   Personality traits are not set in stone. They change over the life cycle. They are a possible avenue for

intervention and policy.

   Personality psychologists lack precise models. Economics provides a framework for recasting the field.

More precise models reveal basic identification problems that plague measurement in psychology. Such

analyses show that, at an empirical level, “cognitive” and “noncognitive” traits are not easily separated.

   Personality psychologists typically present correlations—not causal relationships. Many contemporane-

ously measured relationships suffer from the problem of reverse causality. Econometric tools can be used

to define and estimate causal mechanisms and to understand the causes of effects. Psychological measures

have substantial measurement error. Econometric tools account for measurement error, and doing so makes

a difference. Economists can formulate and estimate mechanisms of investment—how traits can be changed

for the better.

   There are major challenges in linking the traits of psychology with the preferences, constraints and

expectation mechanisms of economics. Developing rigorous methods for analyzing causal relationships in

both fields remains to be done. Developing a common language and framework to promote interdisciplinary

exchange is required. There is a danger in assuming that basic questions of content and identification have

been answered by psychologists at the level required for rigorous economic analysis.
