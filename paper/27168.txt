When Selling Becomes Viral: Disruptions in Debt Markets in the COVID-19 Crisis and the
Fed’s Response

                                           ABSTRACT

We study disruptions in debt markets during the COVID-19 crisis. The safer end of the credit
spectrum experienced significant losses that are hard to fully reconcile with standard default or
risk premium channels. Corporate bonds traded at a large discount to their corresponding CDS,
and this basis widened most for safer bonds. Liquid bond ETFs traded at a large discount to their
NAV, more so for Treasuries, municipal bonds, and investment-grade corporate than high-yield
corporate. These facts suggest investors tried to sell safer, more liquid securities to raise cash.
These disruptions disappeared nearly as fast as they appeared. We trace this recovery back to the
unprecedented actions the Fed took to purchase corporate bonds rather than its interventions in
extending credit. The March 23rd announcement to buy investment-grade debt boosted prices and
lowered bond spreads (particularly at shorter maturities and the safer end of investment-grade)
while having virtually no effect on high-yield debt. April 9th, in contrast, had a large effect on
both investment-grade and high-yield, even for the riskier end of high yield which would only
indirectly benefit from the policy. These facts highlight the importance of financial frictions early
on in the crisis, but also challenge existing theories of these frictions.

1.    Introduction

Bond markets were distressed in March 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis affected financial
markets. This paper attempts to quantify this distress and studies the effect of interven-
tions by the Federal Reserve in debt markets.
     As motivation, Figure 1 plots the evolution of the yield spread of a 6-year bond issued
by Google – one of the largest companies in the world with a AA credit rating and nearly
$120 billion in cash as of the end of 2019 (exceeding total liabilities by around $45 billion).
We also plot the 5-year credit default swap (CDS) for Google along with the spread. Both
the CDS and bond spread are around 25 basis points through early February.

                       Figure 1: Google: Bond Spread and CDS Spread.

     Google’s bond spread spikes dramatically in March, increasing around 150 basis points.
Meanwhile the CDS spread barely budged. This picture highlights that bond prices – even
for extremely safe firms – plummeted substantially more that what one would reasonably
attribute to default based either on the CDS or on Google’s financial position.
     The case of Google is not special; rather, it illustrates a much broader pattern in the

                                                   2
first half of March of 2020. During that period the cumulative return on investment grade
corporate debt was -20%, about as much as the overall stock market over the same period.
This is unusual in part because debt (particularly investment-grade) typically has a beta
far below 1.1 In keeping with the picture above, much of this fall in investment grade
coincided with “disruptions” in debt markets. For example, we find that the CDS-bond
basis (the difference in spread implied by the CDS and the bond prices) for a basket of
investment-grade companies widened substantially to around 300 bps as corporate bond
prices fell. Similarly, other disruptions appeared as well. The prices of bond ETFs expe-
rienced large departures from their net asset values, including for ETFs with a matched
mutual fund. Thus, the same portfolio of bonds had different prices for mutual fund and
ETF investors, and these spreads were substantial, averaging around 5% across several
categories of debt.
    These broad disruptions are important – the investment-grade corporate bond market
totals around $7 trillion and is one of the most important sources of funding for US corpo-
rations. More generally, disruptions in debt markets and spikes in credit spreads would
likely have negative real effects if they persist as credit spreads are strongly associated
with declines in future economic activity (Gilchrist and Zakrajek, 2012).2
    We find these disruptions were most salient in investment-grade bonds in general
(corporate, but also municipal bonds and Treasuries), with somewhat less of an effect
in high-yield debt. For example, CDS and bond spreads moved more in tandem for
high-yield debt, while many large investment-grade bond have an experience similar to
Google. Similarly, investment-grade corporate and municipal bond ETFs traded at a large
discount to their NAV as asset prices were dropping. High-yield ETFs, while they experi-
enced a similar price decline, did not see such dislocation. A potential explanation for this
   1 Haddad    and Muir (2019) present theory and evidence that this type of behavior is typical of episodes
of poor health of the financial.

                                                     3
pattern is that as bond investors got into trouble and tried to convert their assets in cash,
they sold the most liquid bonds first (as well as liquid ETFs), putting large downward
pressure on prices and driving up yields. This is consistent with the CDS basis evidence:
rather than sell these bonds at low prices (high yields), why wouldn’t investors instead
simply buy relatively cheap protection in the CDS market? While this may approximate
a risk-free bond, it does not help raising cash and freeing up balance sheet space. This
can also help explain NAV discounts because ETFs tend to be more liquid and more eas-
ily converted to cash than the underlying bonds. These facts thus help us to distinguish
channels for the drop in prices.
   We then turn to large-scale interventions in debt markets by the Federal Reserve dur-
ing this period using high frequency event studies and show how Fed interventions af-
fected debt markets. In particular, the March 23 announcement to purchase investment
grade bonds raised investment grade bond prices by 7% on announcement with virtually
no effects on other asset prices. The typical investment-grade bond in our index has a
duration of just over 9 years, so this price change represents an implied decline in yields
of around 75 bps. We see larger effects on shorter maturity bonds that were directly tar-
geted in the program (below 5 years in maturity) with an implied decline in yields of over
200 bps. We also find larger effects on the safer end of the investment grade spectrum in
terms of credit rating. Thus, the effects were most concentrated at lower maturities and
lower credit risk. This decrease came in part through a default risk channel (lowering of
CDS spreads) but also largely through improving liquidity (a shrinkage of the CDS-bond
basis). In contrast, the April 9th announcement, which increased bond purchases and
extended the scope to include “fallen angels,” raised the price of both investment-grade
and high-yield bonds and appeared to have broader effects on other asset prices as well.
   We also compare these disruptions to those experienced in 2008 (Krishnamurthy,
2010) to gauge magnitudes. While the magnitude of disruptions in debt markets dur-
ing the recent episodes were large and comparable to 2008, the experience of 2020 differs

                                             4
along two major dimensions (so far). First, not only did the disruptions appear extremely
quickly — in a matter of days rather than months — but also disappeared quickly fol-
lowing a fast and unprecedented response by the Fed. Of course, we do not observe the
counterfactual evolution of the disruptions absent Fed intervention. Second, the deterio-
ration of prices was particularly severe for investment-grade debt, while during the 2008
crisis disruptions were more pronounced in more illiquid asset classes.
   Our results speak to theories and channels of asset price movements in March 2020,
particularly for corporate bonds. First, asset prices can be depressed either through cash
flow or risk premium channels. The relative behavior of investment grade and high yield,
and the behavior of bond spreads compared to CDS or ETFs compared to NAV speak
against these as full explanations for the drop in investment grade bonds. A default and
risk premium channel should have equal effects on the CDS and the yield spread. Further,
a risk premium channel would typically have a larger effect on high yield compared to
investment grade bonds. This is because high yield has a higher probability of default
and so is more sensitive to an increase in the premium per unit of default risk. A cash
flow (default risk) channel may well play a role in overall bond prices. A sensible story
is that the COVID-19 crisis raised the probability of a disaster, and this would have an
effect on corporate debt. However, this also does not explain why this doesn’t show up
in CDS, and this story would require more assumptions to explain differential patterns in
investment grade and high yield (e.g., if one assumes the disaster will trigger default for
all firms across the ratings spectrum it can explain why investment grade falls as much
as high yield). Instead, our results are consistent with selling pressure to convert more
liquid bonds into cash, and are also consistent with theories of a safety demand channel
(Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2012; Moreira and Savov, 2016).
   Section 2 describes the aggregate behavior of debt markets. Section 3 zooms in on
particular disruptions and how they relate to overall movements. Section discusses the
impact of Fed interventions. Finally, Section 5 discusses implications of our results and

remaining questions.
    Related Literature
    Several papers have specifically focused on liquidity in bond markets in the COVID-
19 crisis as well, including Kargar et al. (2020), Fleming et al. (2020) and Schrimpf et al.
(2020). This relates to a broader literature on asset pricing and intermediation in various
asset classes (He and Krishnamurthy, forthcoming; Haddad and Muir, 2019; Haddad and
Sraer, 2020). Bahaj and Reis (2020) show CIP deviations in the current crisis and point to
strain in dollar funding markets. Finally, Gormsen and Koijen (2020) study the impact of
COVID-19 on future growth expectations by studying dividend futures. ? discusses the
case for corporate bond purchases in the current crisis.
    A broader literature studies how these disruptions arise more generally. First, there
may be large changes in asset market liquidity. Investment grade bonds may be liquid in
normal times, but become far less liquid in periods of severe stress (Moreira and Savov,
2016).3 This fits more generally into a literature on safety demand (Longstaff, 2004; Green-
wood and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2018; Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2012; Green-
wood and Vayanos, 2014). Second, the ability to obtain funding can have a significant
impact on bonds. That is, disruptions in repo markets, increases in haircuts, and so on
can lead to difficulties in funding in debt markets that then feedback into prices (Brunner-
meier and Pedersen, 2009; Duffie, 2010; Lewis et al., 2017). Bai and Collin-Dufresne (2019)
and Fontana et al. (2010) study the CDS bond basis with a focus on 2008, while Longstaff
et al. (2005) examine CDS and bond spreads over a longer sample. For overviews of dis-
ruptions in the 2008 crisis see also Duffie (2010) and Mitchell and Pulvino (2012).4 Further,
He and Milbradt (2014) show how bond liquidity can feedback into default.
    Another literature focuses on the effects of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve on

use an event study to assess the effects of quantitative easing in 2008-2009.5 Greenwood
et al. (2018) discuss this event study methodology when asset markets may be partially
segmented.



2.      Aggregate Changes in Debt Prices

Before getting at disruptions within each market, we consider overall movements in
prices for various types of debt during the COVID-19 crisis. Figure 2 reports cumula-
tive returns for a variety of debt markets between February 1 and April 23 2020. As a
benchmark, we report the cumulative returns on the S&P500 index. Of the asset classes
we report, stocks experience the largest decline: a cumulative return around -35% from
peak to through, with the minimum reached in the third week of March. They subse-
quently rebound but the cumulative return is still as low as about -15% in late April.
Next in terms of poor performance is corporate debt. We report the returns on two large
corporate bond ETFs of the iShares family, LQD and HYG. These funds aim at captur-
ing the universe of investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, respectively. We
provide more details on the ETFs in Section 3.2. For now, we just take them as represen-
tative of returns in these asset classes. Both indices exhibit a similar pattern as stocks.
While their decline started almost two weeks after stocks, its magnitude is substantial:
the two indices drop by about 20% from peak to through. Notably, the drop for the three
weeks from March 1st to 20th is about the same for investment grade, high yield, and
the overall stock market, with investment grade actually suffering slightly larger losses.
After that, the two corporate bond indices recover. By the end of our sample, investment-
grade bonds are virtually back to their early 2020 level and the loss in high-yield debt is
of -10%. Similarly, we measure the returns of municipal bonds using MUB, which tracks

Standard & Poor’s National AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index. The performance of this
fund has an extremely similar trajectory to investment-grade debt, albeit of somewhat
smaller magnitude. For example, the dip in returns is only of about -12%. Finally, we use
TLT to track long-term Treasuries. Consistent with an environment of decreasing interest
rate, cumulative returns on Treasuries are positive. However, they also experience a large
drop between March 9 and March 19, which reverts quickly after that.

parison highlights that the magnitude of the decline in prices is comparable to the worst

                                                                  8
historical episodes. In the 2008 episode, high-yield bonds closely track the stock market,
while investment grade declines by much less. Another salient aspect is the speed that
asset pricing movements took place in the recent episode. While one can think of the start
of the GFC going back to the summer of 2007 when it became clear that the subprime
segment of the mortgage market had issues, it was not until October 2008 that the stock
market had a decline as large as experienced in the first two weeks of March. The speed
of the policy response can to some extent also be gauged from the behavior of long-term
treasuries. During the recent period Treasuries rallied by 20% as the market went down.6
    We place these asset price movements in context by scaling all returns to have a beta
of 1 with the stock market on Figure 4. In particular, we use the last two years of daily data
up to January of 2020 to estimate the beta of each fund with respect to the stock market.
We then use this estimate to leverage each fund to have a beta of 1. This calculation pro-
vides a simple way to illustrate how unusual the price movements in investment-grade
credit are during the recent period. By this beta-adjusted metric, corporate investment-
grade bonds dropped by more than twice the stock market, while high yield bonds also
dropped by more than the market but not as much. This observation suggests that the
investment-grade market in particular, which is the core funding market for US com-
panies and totals over $7 trillion, was dysfunctional. We investigate this possibility in
Section 3. In Appendix Figure 17, we show this graph instead as cumulative abnormal
returns where each series is regressed on the stock market, daily changes in the VIX, and
daily changes in 10 year Treasury yields. We find similar patterns – investment grade
appeared especially to drop by much more than would be implied by just the fall in the
stock market, increase in volatility, or changes in longer term yields. Naturally, one would
expect the beta of debt to increase during times of distress, and somehow mitigate this
   6A  unique aspect of the recent episode (which we discuss in Section 3) is that the long-term Treasury
market seems to have malfunctioned in the second week of March while in 2008 they only started rallying
in mid November (by 30%) and peaked in the end of the year.

observation. However, the quantitative challenge remains: rarely does the beta of debt
increases to values close to 1 in standard approaches to reconcile debt and equity prices
such as the Merton model.
    This “disconnect” between the stock market and credit markets is suggestive that
market segmentation played an important role, i.e., that investment-grade debt was hit
especially hard relative to what one would expect from other asset prices. Intermediary-
based models imply powerful amplification that could potentially make sense of this dis-
connect. However, in contrast with the GFC where the weak balance sheets of banks were

Figure 4: Returns during the COVID-19 crisis across asset classes, normalized by beta.
This figure reports the cumulative log returns for the stock market (S&P500), an investment-grade corporate
bond ETF (LQD) and a high-yield corporate bond ETF (HYD) through the COVID-19 crisis (January 2020
through early April). Returns are scaled to all have a beta of 1.


front and center to understand the severity of the crisis, in the recent period banks appear
to much better capitalized. For example, while in 2007 US banks had 6% of their assets in
tier 1 capital, in the end of 2019 they had 15%. Meanwhile, primary dealers also became
much less relevant in the corporate bonds market. In 2007 dealer net positions were about
15% of the total universe of US issued investment grade corporate bonds. Now they con-
sistently hold less than 0.5% of the market. Therefore primary dealers are unlikely to be
a source of shock amplification, but their absence could potentially explain why move-
ments in investment grade were so brisk. For example, early in the fall of 2008 even with


                                                    11
impaired balance sheets, primary dealers increased their position in corporate bonds by
about 4% of the total investment-grade universe outstanding and only reversed to their
previous position by the end of 2008. This would be as if they had purchased 240 billion
dollars of corporate bonds during the recent period, a net supply of liquidity in line with
what the Federal Reserve did in the recent March 23. In contrast, through mid-March of
2020, if anything dealers decreased positions which were already small to start with.
   Starting March 15th the Fed unveiled interventions in a brisk place. We summarize
announcement dates and the respective policy interventions in Table 1. Most of the early
announcements were targeted at short-term funding markets in line with what was done
in 2008: swap lines with core central banks (March 15), the introduction of the Com-
mercial Paper Lending Facility and Primary Dealer Lending Facilities (March 17), Money
Market Lending Facility (March 18 and March 20), swap lines with periphery central
banks (March 20), certification of large foreign institutions to repo treasuries with the
Fed (March 31), and exclusion of treasuries and deposits from the leverage calculation
for bank holding companies (April 1). These interventions targeted what are broadly de-
scribed as money markets and to a large extent were classic liquidity operations. But on
March 23, the FED went beyond the playbook used in 2008 by unveiling facilities that
explicitly take on credit risk by directly buying investment grade corporate debt, asset
backed securities, and short-term municipal securities. The Treasury provided an equity
backstop to these facilities. On April 9, the Fed further expanded these programs. In
Section 4, we show that these two interventions in particular had powerful effects on the
corporate bond market. The March 23rd announcement primarily impacts investment-
grade credit but has little impact on other markets (including high-yield). In fact the ef-
fects appear most concentrated at the safer end of the investment-grade spectrum. April
9th appears to be broader, affecting both investment grade and high yield (and stocks to
some extent), and particularly affecting the higher risk end of high yield which would not
directly benefit from the intervention. In contrast, most of the other interventions did not

                                            12
appear to have major effects.



3.    Disruptions in the Pricing of Debt

Under the view that distress within the financial sector drives in part these price move-
ments, a natural consequence is the appearance of pricing disruptions: breakdowns in
how prices are connected across markets. These disruptions give the appearance of ar-
bitrage opportunities emerging. For example, Duffie (2018), Mitchell and Pulvino (2012),
and Krishnamurthy (2010) give an overview of some of these disruptions in previous
episodes. Bai and Collin-Dufresne (2019) and Fontana et al. (2010) study the CDS bond
basis in 2008, Fleckenstein et al. (2014) and Hu et al. (2013) focus on disruptions in Trea-
suries, and Du et al. (2017) document covered interest parity violations. Of course, issues
with the functioning of markets could also occur even if the large price movements are
not due to this disruption. In this section we document a number of these disruptions
and how they are related to the unusual fluctuations in bond prices. Several other papers
document liquidity effects in bonds in the COVID-19 episode (Kargar et al., 2020; Fleming
et al., 2020; Schrimpf et al., 2020).


3.1   Synchronization of Disruptions

Figure 5 plots disruptions across different bond categories where each disruption is nor-
malized to have unit standard deviation so that they are on the same scale in the figure.
We return to absolute magnitudes of each and the details of the construction of each se-
ries shortly. We plot the CDS-bond basis for investment grade bonds (difference between
CDS and bond yield spread), along with the on-the-run off-the-run spread, which com-
pares yields for a newly issued 30-year Treasury and an “old” 30-year Treasury bond with
remaining maturity 29.5 years. We also add the average deviation between bond ETF net

asset values (NAV) and the ETF price average across corporate bonds, municipal bonds,
MBS, and a long term Treasuries. A negative value indicates the ETF price was below
NAV. Again, we discuss this construction in more detail shortly.
   The most salient feature of Figure 5 is that these disruptions are fairly synchronized
despite being across different asset categories in the fixed income space, and all occur
in line with the height of the crash in investment grade debt in March. This points to
widespread issues in liquidity, funding, or arbitrage capital across many assets. We now
zoom in on each of these disruptions individually.



                                             14
3.2     ETF-NAV Basis

Fixed income ETFs have grown substantially over the past decade, passing $1 trillion in
assets as of last June.7 We compute deviations of ETF prices from net asset value (NAV) in
several ways for several categories of funds (see Pan and Zeng (2019) for a longer history
of NAV deviations). First, we compare share prices for Vanguard ETFs and matched
Vanguard mutual funds – both give a claim to the same underlying portfolio of securities
but ETF prices were trading at a large discount in mid March. This means mutual fund
investors could have sold their mutual fund shares, purchased the ETF, and captured
this difference in prices while having the exact same portfolio of underlying assets. The
discounts are very large – up to 10%, with an average peak of around 5%. The average
annual return across the four fixed income funds we study (muni, corp, Treasury, MBS)
is around 4% – around the same size as the average peak discount. We also choose these
particular funds because the ETFs are large and very liquid. We plot the behavior of the
difference between the ETF and the mutual fund shares in Panel A of Figure 6.
      We plot iShares NAV discounts in Panel B of Figure 6 of ETFs tracking similar indices.
These have advantage that they correspond directly to the portfolios we consider in our
main analysis on investment grade bonds, high yield bonds, municipal bonds, and Trea-
suries and we use these exact funds in our high frequency event studies. A downside is
they don’t have a matched mutual fund, so NAV discounts require a different process to
try to arbitrage.
      If an investor does not already own the mutual fund, how does the arbitrage process
work to try to capture this spread when the ETF trades at a discount? The arbitrage
process can only be done by authorized participants (APs) who are allowed to redeem
or create shares, which for bond ETFs consist mainly of primary dealers (Pan and Zeng,
2019).8 The AP would buy the ETF, redeem the shares, and receive the underlying basket

of securities which they would then sell. This highlights a few issues: when bond markets
are illiquid it may be either that it will take time to sell the bonds during which prices may
change or the AP can’t sell the bonds at NAV (e.g., NAV could be based on stale bond
prices due to some bonds not trading frequently). Further, the more illiquid the market
for bonds the more the arbitrage requires balance sheet space that may be expensive at
this point in time, and we later show primary dealer bond inventory shrunk substantially
for many years after the 2008 crisis implying they may not have been in a position to
execute this trade easily. Furthermore, providing liquidity to investors expose AP’s to
adverse selection and volatility risk as shown in Drechsler et al. (2018). Appendix Figure
15 shows that AP’s did in fact redeem shares in large amounts (30 billion USD) exactly
when these discrepancies arose, suggesting they did view this as a mispricing.
    Pan and Zeng (2019) find empirical evidence for two of these channels. Note, how-
ever, that whichever of these frictions may be present, the very large magnitude of the
discounts means that these frictions (liquidity and/or balance sheet space) must be quite
large to justify discounts of this magnitude. The size of the NAV discount would imply
very little depth and liquidity in bond markets or very constrained balance sheets or both.
Of course, a non-authorized participant could also take advantage of the NAV discount
by simply buying the apparently underpriced ETF, though this is unhedged and involves
risk. For example, the NAV discount may remain open for a while and the NAV gap
could close but the ETF price could still continue to fall.
    An important aspect of Figure 6 Panel B that helps with the liquidity story is the
behavior of the high yield NAV discount (black dashed line). Notably, similar to what
we will show in stocks, there was no discount in high yield in mid March when there
was a large discount for the other categories. That is, for high yield NAV kept in line
igroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS,
Jefferies (https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/whitepaper/viewpoint-etf-primary-trading-
role-of-authorized-participants-march-2017.pdf).



                                                17
with the ETF. This is evidence against a pure price staleness story – that NAV in the mid
March period only reflects stale bond prices which may lag their “true” prices reflected
in the ETF. If anything, high yield bonds tend to be less liquid and likely more prone to
price staleness than investment grade, MBS, and so on. This is another sense in which
dislocations appeared larger in investment grade bonds, and we find the same effects
when studying the CDS bond basis.
    These disruptions in NAV were unique to the safest parts of bond markets, and par-
ticularly investment grade. We already discussed that high yield did not face a large NAV
discount. Figure 7 shows the same picture for the stock market, and shows no substantial
deviations. Interesting, large discounts emerge in Treasury and Municipal bond ETFs.
First, this shows that these deviations were showing up exactly in assets typically per-
ceived as safer. Second, this highlights less liquidity issues in stocks at the time and less
market disfunction. Notably, stock volatility in this period is extremely elevated, so one
needs more than high volatility to explain the behavior of bond ETF discounts. Third,
we see that the deviations are as large as the price movements of the ETF, so these were
economically meaningful deviations.
    Another key point about Figure 7 is that for treasuries the NAV moved more than the
ETF price. This suggests that the gap that opened up between ETF prices and bond prices
in their basket was not about slow updating of the NAV, but rather about the more liquid
asset, the ETF in this case, trading at lower prices than the less liquid asset, the basket of
individual bonds.
    The appendix looks at several of these NAV departures in more detail, plotting the
evolution of ETF prices along with the implied discounts. Figure 18 shows corp bonds
and MBS, Figure 19 shows a total bond index and municipal index.

3.3     CDS-Bond Basis

To get a better understanding of the source of these disruptions we zoom in on corpo-
rate bonds. The TRACE database allows us to observe all trades up to 03/31/2020. We
complement this data with daily CDS data from ICE through Capital IQ. To make sure
that these CDS prices are representative of market conditions we focus only on names
that belong to the on-the-run CDX indexes. CDX IG for investment grade and CDX HY
for high yield as the components of indexes tend to be the most liquid names in the CDS
market. We also only use the 5 year maturity which is also known to be the most liquid
point of the credit curve. To further focus on the most relevant bonds of the Investment
Grade universe we use the bonds held by the LQD iShares ETF (as of 3/2/2020). We then
match these bonds from the LQD portfolio with trades on TRACE and CDS prices for
each name. To compute the basis we focus on bonds with durations ranging from four
to six years. We duration match each bond with the treasury bond rate to compute the
bond spread and compute the cds-bond basis by subtracting the bond spread from the
CDS spread, so that when the basis is negative the bond is cheap relative to a portfolio
that replicates the bond cash-flow with treasuries and the CDS.
      In Figure 8 we see that bond spreads increased sharply starting on the week of March
2nd for both Investment Grade and High Yield, but CDS for Investment Grade bonds
barely changed. At the peak three fourths of the bond spread was due to the basis that
reached 300 basis point on March 20th. In the High Yield market instead we see a large
increase in the CDS spreads. While the basis also increases, it increases by much less
(proportionally). This contrasts with what happen in the Fall of 2008 where riskier bonds
experienced much larger basis than safer bonds. Some bonds like the ones issued by Berk-
shire Hathaway famously experienced positive basis back then. This contrasts sharply
with what happen in March 2020.
      Figure 9 show that this pattern of distortions being larger on safer bonds also hold

within Investment Grade. The Figure shows in the x-axis the CDS spread change from
February 28th (roughly the start of event in financial markets) to March 20th, one business
day before the first Federal reserve intervention directly targeting the corporate bond
market, and the y-axis we have the bond spread change during the same period. Each dot
is a firm, so the bonds spreads and the basis are averaged within firm. This figure shows
a striking pattern. We see that within High Yield, CDS and spread changes go roughly
one-to-one with the changes of the pricing of bonds and CDS moving very consistently
with each other (i.e. the high yield bonds are all around the forty-five degree line). In
Investment Grade on the other hand we have a cloud of firms with very small changes in
CDS spreads and huge increases in bond spreads. Strikingly every single IG firm is above
the fort-five degree line, i.e., for all these firms the basis went up and for some almost the
entire spread change is due to the basis. We highlight a few examples of specific firms
shortly. A natural interpretation here is that for these very safe firms bond prices got
disconnected from fundamentals and were instead shaped exclusively by some investors
need to sell these bonds quickly.


                                                                                 22
      It is important to point out that the fact that we can cleanly identify large pricing dis-
ruptions in the Investment Grade segment of the corporate bonds market does not mean
that these disruptions were contained there. The examples in the introduction and the
cross-sectional evidence here presented shows that the disruptions are particularly large
in the very safest names of investment grade. The way to think about this fact is not that
these disruptions only impacted safe firms, but because these firms have very solid bal-
ance sheets breaking the feedback from bad funding conditions into default risk He and
Xiong (2012); He and Milbradt (2014) which gives us the ability to cleanly identify the
pricing disruptions in these markets. It is certainly plausible that the disturbances that
impacted the price of very safe debt were even stronger in high yield debt and beyond,
but because the feedback from liquidity conditions into the ability of the firm to oper-
ate, these distortions impact the firm default risk and it’s CDS prices. Thus according to
theory the safe firms are the ideal laboratory to measure these distorton


3.4     Corporate Bond Liquidity

Is the drop in corporate bond prices just the manifestation of a trading freeze, with unin-
formative prices? Certainly liquidity in bond markets played an important role as shown
in Kargar et al. (2020).
      However, we find substantial discounts in liquid bonds that traded frequently. Figure
10 tracks the behavior of three bonds for Google, Amazon, and Goodyear, respectively,
as well as their respective CDS. The duration of each are roughly around 5 years at 5.86,
5.25, and 5, respectively. First, Amazon and Google are investment grade with strong
credit ratings and balance sheets, and each has a bond spread and respective CDS around
30 bps in January. The dots in the graph highlight intraday movements in yield. As
spreads widen going into March, prices also become more volatile with large intraday
movements. One can also see these bonds trade frequently through this period. Yet the


                                               23
high frequency price volatility is dwarfed by both the overall price movement and the
difference in yield and CDS for these companies – CDS do not reflect substantially more
risk and hardly move. The third panel plots Goodyear, which is in the high yield index.
Notably, spreads start out much higher, reflecting the lower credit rating, but also the
CDS tracks spreads fairly closely as the crisis unfolds with both rising to nearly 700 bps.
These examples are consistent with the earlier results on the CDS-Bond basis and are
representative of what happen more broadly in bond markets.
      To highlight that these prices moved with plenty of trading, Figure 11 plots trading
volume by week from February to April. Volume in investment grade didn’t decline sub-
stantially, and if anything appears to fall more for high yield toward the end of March. We
don’t take this to imply that there weren’t trading frictions or that these weren’t impor-
tant to understand these events (see Kargar et al. (2020)). Rather, our point is that there
does not appear to be a complete collapse in trade such that microstructure issues likely
drive all the aggregate moves in prices.
      Figure 12 plots primary dealer positions in corporate bonds. Most importantly, it
shows that dealer positions were a small fraction of what they were in 2008, making up
just 0.1% of the total investment grade market cap, compared to 10% in 2008. If anything,
dealer positions shrink through the first half of March, while they increased their holdings
from roughly 7% of the IG market to about 11% through the acute phase of the 2008 crisis,
highlighting that dealers are much less active in bond markets and did not play a role in
absorbing the shocks in 2020.

4.    The Effect of Fed Interventions

4.1   An Overview of the Federal Reserve’s Interventions in Debt Mar-
      kets

Starting March 15th the fed unveiled interventions in a brisk place. We summarize an-
nouncement dates and the respective policy interventions in Figure 1. Most of the early
announcements were targeted at short-term funding markets in line with what was done
in 2008: Swap lines with core central banks (March 15), Commercial paper lending fa-
cility and Primary Dealer lending facilities (March 17), Money market lending facility
(March 18 and March 20), Swap lines with periphery central banks (March 20), certifi-
cation of large foreign institutions to repo treasuries with the FED (March 31), and ex-
clusion of treasuries and deposits from the leverage calculation for holding companies

(April 1). These interventions targeted what are broadly described as money markets and
to a large extent were classic liquidity operations. But on March 23 the FED went beyond
the playbook used in 2008 by unveiling facilities (with an equity backstop provided by
the treasury) that explicitly take on credit risk by directly buying investment grade cor-
porate debt, asset backed securities, and short-term municipal securities. On April 9, the
FED further expanded these programs. In Section 4, we show that these two interven-
tions in particular had powerful effects on the corporate bond market. The March 23rd
announcement primarily impacts investment grade credit but has little impact on other
markets (including high yield). In fact the effects appear most concentrated at the safer
end of the investment grade spectrum. April 9th appears to be broader, affecting both
investment grade and high yield (and stocks to some extent), and particularly affecting
the higher risk end of high yield which would not directly benefit from the intervention.

In contrast, most of the other interventions did not appear to have major effects.

4.2     Event Study Around Fed Announcements

We start with a high frequency study of key Fed announcements on asset prices, high-
lighting a few interventions from Table 1. We use ETFs for this purpose because this
allows us to get high frequency intraday data to see the immediate impact of announce-
ments – this is important for identification as there is a lot of intraday price movement in
this period. After assessing this we move to daily data on yields on a number of bonds.
      Results are given in Figure 13 where the x-axis denotes 10 minute intervals. We take
the log of all series and normalize them to 0 just before the event, hence the y-axis denotes
the return relative to the value immediately before the event. For example, for investment
grade corporate on March 23rd, we see a 6% return on the announcement.
      Because both the March 23 and April 9 announcements were held outside of stock-

market trading hours, the identification on the effect of FED policy relies on comparing
the closing price of the last business day with the opening price after the announcement.
A concern is that other news came out between the close and open that raised IG or HY
bond prices that confounds our inference, and we alleviate this in two ways. First, the
the stock market response doesn’t suggest good macroeconomic news arrived on these
dates (the market was down slightly in the first even and close to flat in the second).
Second, and more importantly, we use the fact that the Credit Default Swap market is
open during these announcements, so we don’t have to rely on close to open reactions.
In Figure 14 below we use tick-by-tick transaction on data on the Investment Grade and
High-Yield CDX indexes to show that the market responded exactly at the time of the FED
announcement. For example, we see that on March 23rd both High Yield and Investment
Grade debt had spreads increasing by 15% (i.e if spreads were 200bps, they increased
to 230bps). We see that around the announcement IG spreads go down sharply while
High Yield spreads remain elevated – and this occurs within a 5 minute window of the
announcement. On April 9th we see both reacting strongly. Both are directionally in line
with the evidence from ETFs.
   The purchase of investment grade bonds on March 23 increases prices for the invest-
ment grade ETF by 7%. Note that there is no effect in either stocks or high yield, and the
effect for investment grade is very discrete, occurring within a tight window. While this
plot is in price space, it is useful to consider the implied effect on yields for investment
grade corporate bonds. The average duration in LQD ETF is around 9.5 years, hence we
can approximate the change in yield space as being around -70bps. Notably, the price
of the short term corporate bond ETF – which focuses on maturities below 5 years, also
increases by about the same amount, around 6%. While this represents the same change
in price, it implies a much larger change in yields because of shorter duration. The short
term corporate bond ETF has a duration of about 2.65 years, hence the implied drop in
yield is over 200 bps. This makes sense because the program is targeted at investment

grade corporate bonds with a maturity below 5 years, hence this is where we see the
largest decline in yields.
    The purchase of investment grade as well as high yield bonds which were previ-
ously investment grade (“fallen angels”) on April 9 increases prices for the investment
grade ETF by about 3% using just the immediate reaction and about 4.7% using the reac-
tion through the end of day. For investment grade, this translates roughly to an implied
decline in yields of about 30-50bps. For high yield, the effective duration is shorter at
about 4 years, so a 6% increase in the ETF translates roughly to a decline in yields around
150bps. These roughly accord with what we see in OAS changes in Panel B of Table 2
which regresses OAS changes on event dummies. Following Krishnamurthy and Vissing-
Jorgensen (2011) we use 2 day changes (1 day after relative to 1 day before) rather than the
high frequency approach to allow for illiquidity effects in corporate bonds. The implied
yield changes from the ETF prices are a bit larger in magnitude, but in the same ballpark,
as the effect on yields in Panel B. Panel B also shows a useful pattern across the rating
spectrum: March 23rd appears to have a larger effect on the safest bonds, even within
the investment grade category. We have already shown that within investment grade
there was a larger effect on shorter maturities, hence the March 23rd announcement in
total has the largest effect on safer short maturity bonds where we have documented the
larger price distortions. The maturity effect is consistent with the bonds that are directly
targeted in the program. April 9th, in contrast, has a larger effect on the risky end of
investment grade and the whole spectrum of high yield, even those that are far from in-
vestment grade. Thus April 9th represented a broader effect on credit markets than what
was directly targeted.

4.3     How Narrow are the Effects of the Fed Interventions?

The March 23 announcement targeted investment grade companies in particular and we
saw that bonds of High Yield firms do not respond at all to this announcement. Thus, it is
natural to ask how narrow are the effects of the Fed intervention. To start addressing this
question we exploit the fact that the policy targeted bonds with maturities shorter than
five years in particular. In Panel A of Figure 13 we show announcement effects for an
ETF that holds the shorter end of the maturity spectrum (1 to 5 years), and one that holds
intermediate maturities (5 to 10). We see that while the effect is substantially stronger in
the ETF that holds directly targeted bonds, it is also sizable on the intermediate maturity
ETF and does tell us that the Fed policy does have some positive spillovers for assets that
were not directly targeted.



                                                         33
   We use bond-level data from TRACE to get more precisely at this distinction, focusing
on bonds that are in either of the two ETFs LQD and HYD. Because individual bonds
trade less frequently and with larger spreads, we compare the average spread on the
trading day after the announcement to the average spread on the trading day before the
announcement. Table 3 compare response across bonds with different ratings. We report
the change in log spread, that is the proportional change in spread, the raw change in
spread in basis points, and the change in spread relative to the increase in spread from
the start of 2020 until March 20. Panel A compares investment-grade and high-yield
bonds. We observe a slightly larger recovery in absolute magnitude for investment grade
(85 bps vs 67 bps), but proportionally a much smaller change for high-yield debt: of about
6% relative to 26%, and a much smaller decrease in spreads for high yield relative to the
increases experienced before the interventions. Panel B confirms this result across the
entire rating scale. Ratings decrease are of almost the same magnitude across ratings,
if anything bigger for safer bonds. Proportionally they are much larger for safer bonds.
For example AA+ spreads, at the top of investment-grade, recover by about 50% while
BBB-, at the bottom, recover only by 13%. Further, there is a discrete drop off in spread
recovery once one hits the high yield spectrum. The discrete shift implies that even firms
with similar default risk, but one which happened to just fall into the high yield category,
experienced very different effects on the March 23rd announcement.
   Table 4 repeats this comparison across maturity. The change in spreads decreases
roughly monotonically as we go from shorter to longer maturity. For maturities between
2 and 3 years, bond spreads decrease by about 120bps for both high- and low-rated bonds.
In contrast, bonds with maturities between 9 and 10 years, only experience decreases of
about 60 to 75 bps. Again, these differences are magnified when comparing them to the
overall level of spreads (by focusing on the change in logs) or relative to the increase in
spread before the Fed interventions. Further, there again seems to be a larger decrease
around the 5 year maturity mark, consistent with these bonds benefitting most from the

program.
   The comparisons we have drawn so far considered broad spillovers of the Fed inter-
ventions throughout debt markets. Next, we identify a more specific type of spillover
within firms. To the extent that the bond purchase help short-maturity debt financing,
they should bring stability to firms borrowing this way. So if we compare the debt spread
among firms with long-maturity debt, we can hypothesize than the firms who also is-
sued short-maturity debt should experience a stronger recovery. Table 5 implements this
comparison. Panel A shows that firms that have short-term debt (which we define as ma-

turity less than 5 years) experience a spread decrease of 90bps following the announce-
ment, whereas firms with no short-term debt only recover by 50bps. Panel B confirms that
this difference is not driven by different maturity of the long-term debt, by implementing
this comparison within maturity buckets. For all maturity groups, we observe a stronger
recovery of spreads for firms that also issue short-term debt.



5.   Implications

Together, these results inform our understanding of why bond markets suffered so much
during March 2020. We review in turn several potential explanations for this phenomenon
and point out their strength and limitations. We emphasize that we only draw relative
conclusions for bond markets – we do not claim, for example, some of these explanations

Table 5: Response to the March 23rd Fed Announcement: Firms with and without
Short-Term Debt. We compare firms that have existing short term debt (remaining ma-
turity less than 5 years) to those that do not. Specifically, we look at the change in bond
spreads of longer maturity debt for those that do and don’t have short maturity debt
outstanding.

aren’t responsible for the behavior of the stock market over the same period.


Fundamental distress. A first explanation for the drop in price experienced across mar-
ket is that expected payoffs of the assets have dramatically decreased. After all, the
COVID-19 crisis and the public policy response to it have led the way to a sharp drop
in GDP, unemployment is hitting extreme heights, and many firms are on the brink of
bankruptcy. This uncontroversial negative effect on the economy suggests poor perfor-
mance of firms’ stocks and bonds ahead. However, several of our findings challenge this
view.
   First, safe debt and high-yield debt experienced comparable losses. Both have lost
less than the stock market but overall losses were of a similar order of magnitude. As we
have already pointed out, it is difficult to explain these relative magnitudes in standard
models. When economic conditions deteriorate, equity holders lose first, and it is likely
that the most fragile high-yield firms default before investment-grade firms. This simple

                                                 37
mechanism implies a clear ranking of losses that does not show up in the data.
   Second, zooming in on extremely safe firms reinforces this point. The accounting
information of many of these firms (Google, Amazon, Microsoft ...) suggest they do not
face much risk of bankruptcy in the near future. These firms often hold large amounts
of cash in excess of their near-term liabilities. Financial markets also convey a similar
message. CDS contracts, which insure against the default of these firms, experience very
little movement in this episode. The departure of CDS and bond spread from each other is
suggestive of financial frictions at play, but more importantly highlights that large swarth
of the markets are not pricing fundamental distress for those firms.
   One potential resolution of these tensions is to rely on expectations of a total economic
collapse, where all firms default simultaneously. A high probability of such an event (and
no possibility of milder intermediate recession) would affect all debt contracts and stocks
similarly. Such a view is actually not very plausible for multiple reasons. Not only would
it need to have an extremely high probability (over 10% over the next 5 years to explain
the price of safe bonds), but also would still not explain spreads on CDS contracts and
the response to the Fed interventions. Specifically, the March 23rd intervention had very
large effects on investment grade bonds without impacting High Yield debt at all. This
suggests that the original driver of these price movements is unlikely to be this ”end of
the world” event.


Risk compensations. If bond prices did not drop due to a fall in cash-flow expectations,
it has to be that bonds had high expected returns looking forward. A prominent set
of theories of expected returns is based on the idea that they constitute compensation
for aggregate risks affecting everybody in the economy. Under this view, risk premia
can vary due to changes in the risk of the economy (as in Bansal and Yaron (2004)) or
variations in willingness to bear risk (as in Campbell and Cochrane (1999)).
   These theories face similar challenges to explanations based on cash-flow. Increases

                                            38
in economic risk naturally have a larger impact on more risky firms. And, a lower will-
ingness to bear risk should move more the price of more risky assets. Here again, the
concentration of large price drops, as well as pricing disruptions, in the safer firms runs
against the grain of these models. This observation contrasts with previous episodes
where the risk explanation and explanations based on financial frictions lined up more
closely. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, non-agency mortgage-backed
securities suffered large losses. It is difficult to assess how much of this was because of
unusual default prospects, or financial distress among investors in these securities.


Financial frictions.   The consistent pattern of disruptions we document is suggestive
of explanations rooted in distress in the financial sector. Specifically, the early phases of
the COVID-19 crisis not only saw extreme declines in asset prices, but also large pricing
disruptions. Large bond ETFs traded at discounts relative to their NAV, bonds traded at
a discount relative to the corresponding CDS. These disruptions are not the usual small
mismatches associated with market microstructure distortions such as bid-ask spread,
but rather of the same order of magnitude as the overall price drops. The emergence of
these disruptions indicates two things: typical arbitrageurs were unable to equate prices
across markets, and some participants in these markets became unwilling to buy some
assets relative to others. For example, investors in bonds were willing to trade at a much
lower price than in CDS.
   The fact that arbitrageurs in bond markets had a limited ability to absorb the sudden
large flows is not surprising: since 2008, the corporate bond holdings of primary dealers
have steadily decreased, and are now tiny relative to size of the market. However, sev-
eral observations about dealers during March and April 2020 does not suggest that they
are distressed, nor that they are the root cause of price drops. Dealers do not appear to
attempt to reduce drastically their holdings of bonds. While intermediation spreads and
trading volume both increase, suggesting a period of larger than usual flows to interme-

                                             39
diaries, there is no clear sense that dealers are particularly in trouble. For example it is not
the case that every market is disrupted in the same way as would be expected if the shock
originated in the dealer sector. Or there is no evidence that most of the price disruptions
are intermediation spreads collected by the dealers.
    These observations leave us with the question of what pushed prices to diverge so
much. One interpretation which lines up well with our evidence is some investors were
particularly desperate for cash, possibly due to mounting losses, and liquidated many
positions to obtain cash on short notice. These investors focused on the initially more
liquid and safe securities: Treasury ETFs, investment-grade corporate bond ETFS, and
the most liquid securities within each universe. Such importance for cash or equivalently
freeing balance sheet space would explain why the response in CDS of investment-grade
companies was so muted compared to the movements in bond prices. It also explains
why investment-grade bonds, usually the most liquid, saw the largest change in prices,
converging to discounts similar to the already illiquid high-yield bonds. Under this in-
terpretation, an enterprise for future research will be to identify who are these investors,
and why balance sheet space suddenly became so expensive for them.9 Doing so is par-
ticularly important given the overall size of corporate debt market, and the impact these
disruptions would have on firm’s ability to fund themselves if they lasted. The flip side of
this question is why deep pocket investors did not step in to prove liquidity in corporate
bonds markets. This is particularly surprising given that the most acute disruptions hap-
pened in treasury and Investment Grade corporate bond markets where deep pocketed
long-term investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, foreign central banks,
and sovereign wealth funds are active participants.
    Another important observation is that the disruptions did not last. We find that un-
   9 One  such candidate are insurance companies. Insurers hold about a third of the corporate bond mar-
ket and experienced substantially larger deterioration in stock price than the market during this episode.
Chodorow-Reich et al. (2020) discuss how insurers can weather illiquidity in bond markets when in good
health, but might also amplify distress if they are sufficiently affected.


                                                   40
precedented actions the Federal Reserve played a major role in shrinking these disrup-
tions quickly. Disruptions in investment-grade corporate debt shrunk right when the
Fed first announced it would buy corporate bonds, and when it extended its programs
to “fallen angels”, i.e. firms that would become ”high yield” after the COVID-19 shock.
Both increased sharply in value precisely at the time of these interventions. Exactly be-
cause these interventions were so unprecedented, announcement effects provide us with
a particularly clean estimation of the effects of these actions on financial markets. We find
that the effects of the interventions were large and of the same order of magnitude of the
interventions themselves (several hundreds of billions of dollars). That said, it remains
unclear the ultimate goals of the Fed intervention, and whether it should have intervened.
Specifically, the rational for the 2008 interventions– limited risk-bearing capital in the fi-
nancial sector and widespread bank runs– didn’t seem present in 2020.
    Echoing our previous comments, the Fed might have wanted to stop a financial crisis
in the making if some of the major actors of corporate lending would have gotten in
more trouble. Or, it might have tried to just directly subsidize credit for industrial firms
with the intention to accelerate the recovery process once the pandemic is controlled. In
both of these views, the response to the initial intervention on March 23 is only a half-
success. As we show in Section 4 (see also Figure 20 in the appendix) the intervention
doesn’t seem to effect markets more broadly. While the recovery of corporate bond is
important in itself, the lack of response of other asset classes is inconsistent with the Fed
interventions being effective in eliminating the potential of a deeper recession. The more
widespread effects on April 9 suggests more success in this view, but maybe at the cost of
promising an unlimited quantity of interventions. Dissecting exactly which mechanisms
played a role in creating large and heterogeneous responses to the Fed interventions will
be key to evaluate the overall value of these interventions, and will require being able
to take a more precise stand on how the situations would have evolved absent these
interventions. Here again, this task will require a better understanding of the root causes

                                             41
of the disruptions. We plan to continue pursuing this objective as our paper evolves.

             Figure 17: Cumulative abnormal returns during the Covid Crisis.
This figure reports the cumulative abnormal log returns for an investment-grade corporate bond ETF
(LQD), a high-yield corporate bond ETF (HYD), and municipal bond ETF (MUB) through the Covid-19
crisis (January 2020 through early April). Daily returns are regressed on the stock market returns, changes
in the VIX, and changes in 10 year Treasury yields and we plot the cumulative sum of residuals. This high-
lights whether the movements in each series are well explained by changes in the market, volatility, or long
term rates.
