Employee Satisfaction, Labor Market Flexibility, and Stock Returns Around The World

                                              ABSTRACT

We study the relationship between employee satisfaction and abnormal stock returns around the world,
using lists of the “Best Companies to Work For” in 14 countries. We show that employee satisfaction
is associated with positive abnormal returns in countries with high labor market flexibility, such as
the U.S. and U.K., but not in countries with low labor market flexibility, such as Germany. These results
are consistent with high employee satisfaction being a valuable tool for recruitment, retention, and
motivation in flexible labor markets, where firms face fewer constraints on hiring and firing. In contrast,
in regulated labor markets, legislation already provides minimum standards for worker welfare and
so additional expenditure may exhibit diminishing returns. The results have implications for the differential
profitability of socially responsible investing (“SRI”) strategies around the world. In particular, they
emphasize the importance of taking institutional features into account when forming such strategies.

   This paper studies the relationship between employee satisfaction and stock returns around the

world. Theory provides conflicting predictions as to whether employee satisfaction is beneficial or

harmful to firm value. On the one hand, employee welfare can be a valuable tool for recruitment,

retention, and motivation. For the typical 20th-century firm, the bulk of its value stemmed from its

physical capital. In contrast, most modern firms’ key assets are their workers – not only senior

management, but also rank-and-file employees. For example, in knowledge-based industries such

as software, pharmaceuticals, and financial services, non-managerial employees engage in product

development and innovation, and build relationships with customers and suppliers, and mentor

subordinates. Employee-friendly policies can attract high-quality workers to a firm and ensure that

they remain within the firm, to form a source of sustainable competitive advantage.

   Relatedly, employee satisfaction can be a valuable motivational tool.                In traditional

manufacturing firms, motivation was simple because workers’ output could be easily measured,

allowing the use of monetary “piece rates” (Taylor (1911)). In the modern firm, workers’ tasks are

increasingly difficult to quantify, such as innovation or building client relationships. The reduced

effectiveness of extrinsic motivators increases the role for intrinsic motivators such as satisfaction.

This role is microfounded in both economics and sociology. The efficiency wage theory of Akerlof

and Yellen (1986) argues that employees view a positive working environment as a “gift” from the

firm and respond with a “gift” of increased effort (Akerlof (1982)). Sociological theories argue that

satisfied employees identify with the firm and internalize its objectives, thus inducing effort

(McGregor (1960)).

   On the other hand, employee satisfaction can represent wasteful expenditure by management.

Taylor (1911) argued that workers should be treated like any input – management’s goal is to

extract maximum output from them while minimizing their cost. Under this view, satisfaction is an

indicator that employees are overpaid or underworked, both of which reduce firm value. Indeed,


                                                  2
agency problems may lead to managers tolerating insufficient effort and/or excessive pay, at

shareholders’ expense. The manager may enjoy more pleasant relationships with his subordinates

by not holding them down to their reservation utility (Jensen and Meckling (1976)). Alternatively,

high wages may constitute a takeover defense, as modeled by Pagano and Volpin (2005a).

Cronqvist et al. (2009) find that salaries are higher when managers are more entrenched, which

supports the view that high worker pay is inefficient.

   The relative importance of the above costs and benefits will depend on the institutional context.

In flexible labor markets, firms face fewer restrictions on the contracts they can offer. When hiring

constraints are weaker, the recruitment benefits of employee satisfaction are stronger. Since one’s

rivals also face few hiring constraints, the retention benefits of employee satisfaction are also more

important. Flexible labor markets also feature fewer firing constraints. Since it is easier for firms to

dismiss underperforming workers and replace them with superior ones, the recruitment benefits of

employee satisfaction are again greater. In addition, the greater risk of firing means that employees

invest in general rather than firm-specific skills, which also increases their ability to be recruited

elsewhere (Hall and Soskice (2001), Thelen (2001)). Separately, the motivational benefits are also

likely higher. Under the efficiency wage theory of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984), workers exert effort

to avoid being fired from a satisfying job, and thus employee satisfaction has greater motivational

impact when the likelihood of firing is stronger. The motivational effect of employee satisfaction

may be particularly important for rank-and-file employees, who are harder to incentivize with

equity since they individually have a small effect on firm value.

   In regulated labor markets, hiring and firing are harder, and thus the recruitment, retention, and

motivational benefits are lower. In addition, expenditure on employee satisfaction is likely to

exhibit diminishing marginal returns. When labor market regulations already ensure a minimum




                                                   3
level of worker welfare, companies with high satisfaction relative to their peers may be exceeding

the optimal level: the marginal benefit of their expenditure may not justify its cost.

   Edmans (2011, 2012) shows that companies with high employee satisfaction, as measured by

inclusion in the list of the “100 Best Companies to Work For in America”, outperform their peers

by 2-3% per year. The use of stock returns (rather than, say, accounting performance or Tobin’s Q)

as the dependent variable mitigates concerns that causality runs from firm performance to employee

satisfaction, since any publicly-observed performance measure should already be incorporated into

the stock price at the start of the return compounding window.             These results suggest that

satisfaction is positively correlated with firm value and that these benefits are not immediately

capitalized by the market. However, these papers only study the U.S. – a country with particularly

flexible labor markets – and so the external validity of their results is limited. It is unclear whether

these results are generalizable to other countries, especially those with less flexible labor markets.

   This paper addresses this open question. We study the link between employee satisfaction and

stock returns in 14 countries around the world, and investigate how this relationship depends on the

country’s level of labor market flexibility. The list of the “100 Best Companies to Work For in

America” is published by the Great Place to Work® Institute in San Francisco. The Institute

produces similar Best Companies (“BC”) lists in more than 45 countries, of which 15 have at least

10 publicly traded BCs. We use two measures of country-level labor market flexibility, which are

available for 14 of these 15 countries. The first measure is the OECD Employment Protection

Legislation (“EPL”) index, also used by Pagano and Volpin (2005b) and Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin

(2014). The second is the labor market flexibility categories of the Fraser Institute’s Economic

Freedom of the World index, also used by Bernal-Verdugo, Furceri, and Guillaume (2012a, 2012b),

Freeman, Kruse, and Blasi (2008), and Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, and Schweiger (2008).




                                                   4
   We find that the alphas documented by Edmans (2011, 2012) for the U.S. are not anomalous in

a global context. An equal-weighted BC portfolio generates a Carhart (1997) 4-factor monthly

alpha of 22 basis points in the U.S. from 1998-2013, statistically significant at the 1% level. This

alpha is only the 10th highest out of the 14 countries that we study. High returns to Best Companies

are not limited to the U.S., although the alphas for most other countries are not statistically

significant due to the smaller sample size. For example, the monthly alpha is 77 basis points in

Japan from 2007-2013 and (an insignificant) 81 basis points in the U.K. from 2001-2013. (The

different time periods reflect the different years in which the BC list was initiated). However, we

also document significant heterogeneity across countries.      For example, Germany exhibits an

insignificantly negative alpha of 45 basis points. Thus, while the previously-documented results

generally hold out of sample, they do not extend to every country.

   We next show that the abnormal returns to the BCs are significantly increasing in their country’s

labor market flexibility, using both measures. We conduct a pooled panel regression controlling for

other firm-level determinants of stock returns identified by Brennan, Chordia, and Subrahmanyam

(1998), such as size, book-to-market, dividend yield, past returns, trading volume, and the stock

price.   To ensure that our labor market flexibility measure is not simply proxying for other

differences between countries, we control for other country-level variables such as the rule of law,

size of the capital market, and the existence of one-share-one-vote (all from La Porta, Lopez-de-

Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997)), GDP growth, and the anti-director rights index of Spamann

(2010). We find that, a one standard deviation decrease in the EPL measure is associated with a

0.49% higher market-adjusted monthly return to being a BC. Similarly, a one standard deviation

increase in the EFW measure is associated with a 0.67% higher market-adjusted monthly return to

being a BC. The results are similar using a Fama-MacBeth (1973) analysis.




                                                 5
   Overall, our results suggest that the association between employee satisfaction and stock returns

depends critically on the institutional context. These results have important implications for both

managers and investors. Starting with the former, even if the Edmans (2011, 2012) results can be

interpreted as causal, they do not suggest that managers should necessarily increase expenditure on

employee-friendly programs in countries with low labor market flexibility. Moving to the latter, it

suggests that investors can only expect to earn alpha from investing in firms with high employee

satisfaction in countries with high labor market flexibility.

   This paper contributes to a number of literatures. First, it builds on the literature linking various

measures of employee welfare to various measures of firm performance. Abowd (1989) shows that

announcements of pay increases reduce market valuations dollar-for-dollar, Diltz (1995) finds that

stock returns are uncorrelated with the Council of Economic Priorities minority management and

women in management variables, and negatively correlated with family benefits, and Dhrymes

(1998) find no relationship with KLD’s employee relations variable. In contrast, Edmans (2011,

2012) documents a positive relationship employee satisfaction and stock returns. However, the

above studies only analyze the U.S. Given the importance of labor market institutions, it is unclear

whether these relationships generalize more widely.

   Second, since employee welfare is frequently used as a screen by socially responsible investors

(Renneboog, Ter Horst, and Zhang (2008a, 2011)), this paper contributes to research on the link

between socially responsible investing (“SRI”) and investor returns. This literature has mixed

results. Hamilton, Jo and Statman (1993), Kurtz and DiBartolomeo (1996), Guerard (1997), Bauer,

Koedijk, and Otten (2005), Schröder (2007), and Statman and Glushkov (2009) find no or a mixed

relationship between various SRI screens and investment returns; Geczy, Stambaugh, and Levin

(2005), Brammer, Brooks, and Pavelin (2006), Renneboog, Ter Horst, and Zhang (2008b), and

Hong and Kacperczyk (2009) find a negative relationship; and Moskowitz (1972), Luck and Pilotte


                                                   6
(1993), Derwall et al. (2005), and Edmans (2011, 2012) find a positive link. All of the above

studies focus on U.S. data and their generalizability to other countries is again unclear.                  In

particular, the value of various forms of Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) – employee

welfare, gender diversity, animal rights, environmental protection, and whether the firm is in a “sin”

industry (such as tobacco, alcohol, and gambling) – likely depends on the institutional context, such

as regulations and cultural norms. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to study the investment

performance of a SRI screen in a global context.1

    Finally, this paper adds to the literature comparing the performance of investment strategies

across countries. Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) find that value strategies are profitable

not only in the U.S., but also in the U.K., continental Europe, and Japan. Momentum strategies are

profitable in the first three regions, but not Japan. Chui, Titman, and Wei (2010) argue that cultural

factors explain the differential profitability of momentum strategies across countries: in particular,

countries with greater individualism exhibit higher momentum profits.

    This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 develops our hypotheses and Section 2 describes

the data. Section 3 studies the abnormal returns to the BCs across different countries. Section 4

presents the core results of our paper, relating these abnormal returns to measures of labor market

flexibility. Section 5 concludes.



1. Hypothesis development

    We first discuss whether we should expect to find any long-run abnormal returns to the Best

Companies lists at all, either positive or negative. Our return compounding window starts at the

beginning of the month after list publication. Thus, since these lists are public, we should find no

 Ioannou and Serafeim (2012) and Cheng, Ioannou, and Serafeim (2014) study the determinants and consequences of
corporate social responsibility in a cross-country context, but do not investigate stock returns.



                                                      7
abnormal returns if the market is semi-strong efficient. Regardless of the institutional context, and

thus regardless of the direction of the link (if any) between employee welfare and firm value, the

positive or negative value of list inclusion should be capitalized by the market before the start of the

return compounding window.

    However, there is significant prior evidence that intangible assets are not fully priced by the

stock market.       Firms with high R&D as measured by expenditure (Chan, Lakonishok, and

Sougiannis (2001); Lev and Sougiannis (1996)), advertising as measured by expenditure (Chan,

Lakonishok, and Sougiannis (2001), patent quality as measured by citations (Deng, Lev, and Narin

(1999)), and software quality as measured by development costs (Aboody and Lev (1998)) all earn

higher long-run returns. Consistent with these findings, Edmans (2011, 2012) documents that Best

Companies in the U.S. outperform their peers by 2-3% per year, and that the value of list inclusion

is not fully capitalized by the market until 4-5 years later. Indeed, equity analysts systematically

under-predict the earnings announcements of these companies.

    Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the value of employee satisfaction will not be fully

capitalized by the stock market immediately upon list inclusion, and thus that there will be long-

horizon returns.2 We now discuss our hypothesis for whether this value will be positive or negative,

and why it may depend on a country’s level of labor market flexibility. Employee satisfaction has

both benefits and costs. Starting with the benefits, worker welfare is likely to improve recruitment,

retention, and motivation. For the reasons discussed in the introduction, these benefits are likely to

be particularly strong in countries with flexible labor markets, in which hiring and firing are easier.

Thus, in such countries, we hypothesize that expenditure on employee welfare is a value-creating

investment that is underappreciated by the market.

2
  An alternative channel through which list inclusion can lead to long-run stock returns is through attracting demand
from socially responsible investors. Edmans (2011) estimates this effect for the U.S. and found it to be very small
compared to the magnitude of the abnormal returns.



                                                         8
   However, as with any investment, the returns are likely decreasing. In regulated labor markets,

regulations already impose a floor on worker welfare, leading to a downward movement along the

marginal benefit curve. In addition, due to the increased restrictions in hiring and firing, labor

mobility is less frequent and so the recruitment, retention, and motivational benefits are likely

smaller, causing a downward shift in the marginal benefit curve. Both of these forces reduce the

marginal benefit of further expenditure on worker welfare, potentially below its marginal cost.

Indeed, firms may spend excessively on employee satisfaction due to an agency problem. The

theory of Pagano and Volpin (2005a) argues that employee benefits such as high wages can be used

as a takeover defense. Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin (2014) find employment protection increases labor

costs and reduces firms’ profitability. Cronqvist et al. (2009) show that entrenched managers pay

their employees more.      Similarly, countries with regulated labor markets tend to have more

powerful labor unions (see, e.g., Nickell (1997)) – indeed, centralized collective bargaining is a

component of the labor market flexibility categories of the Economic Freedom of the World

database. Thus, high employee satisfaction may result from the influence of labor unions, rather

being in shareholders’ interest. Gorton and Schmid (2004) find that, when labor has a voice in

corporate governance, profitability and valuation are lower. Chen, Kacperczyk, and Ortiz-Molina

(2011) hypothesize that labor unions protect wages in a downturn, and find that they increase a

firm’s operating leverage and cost of equity. Unions also protect underperforming managers and

reduce a firm’s value (Atanassov and Kim (2009), Lee and Mas (2012)).

   As a result, we predict that the BCs generate positive abnormal returns in countries with high

labor market flexibility, and that the returns to list inclusion decrease with labor market flexibility.



2. Data and summary statistics

2.1. Measures of employee satisfaction


                                                    9
   Our main data source is the Best Companies lists compiled by the Great Place to Work®

Institute. The first list focused on U.S. companies and was published in a 1984 book entitled the

“The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America”, which was later updated in 1993; from 1998

onwards it has been published every January in Fortune magazine. Two-thirds of the score comes

from a 57-question survey that the Institute administers to 250 employees randomly selected in each

firm. The remaining one-third comes from the Institute’s evaluation of factors such as a company’s

demographic makeup, pay and benefits programs, and culture. The companies are scored in four

areas: credibility (communication to employees), respect (opportunities and benefits), fairness

(compensation, diversity), and pride/camaraderie (teamwork, philanthropy, celebrations), and the

top 100 firms are publicly announced in rank order. According to the Institute, a Great Place to

Work is a place in which “you can trust people you work for, have pride in what you do, and enjoy

the people you work with”. The list is highly regarded as a thorough measure of employee

satisfaction, receiving significant attention from shareholders, management, employees and the

media, and has since been extended to more than 45 countries around the world.

   We include countries with more than five years’ history of BC listings, and exclude those where

firm-level stock return and accounting data are unavailable, e.g. Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, and

Venezuela. For each country, we only include BCs that are both headquartered and publicly listed

in that country. Table 1 describes the 14 countries that have data on labor market flexibility (which

we will describe in Section 2.2) and where at least 10 BCs are headquartered and publicly listed.

Column (1) shows the start year of BC listings for each country. The numbers of public BCs per

country are reported in column (3). Since the earliest start year for a non-U.S. country is 1998 (for

Brazil), our sample period is from February 1998 to December 2013, although we will also study

the U.S. from February 1984 to December 2013 to verify comparability with Edmans (2011, 2012).




                                                 10
   To form BC portfolios, we use the beginning of the month immediately after the latest

publication date of lists for each country as our portfolio formation date. For example, the U.S. list

is typically published in mid-January, and so we use February 1 as the portfolio formation date.

Thus, our analyses are joint tests of the value of employee satisfaction and the extent to which this

value is immediately capitalized by the market. The constituents of BC portfolios are rebalanced

once a year on the same day. Column (2) reports the portfolio formation dates for each country.

   For the U.K. and U.S., the number of firms in the list has remained constant over time. For the

other countries, this number has increased over time – for example, the first list in Germany (in

2003) contains 50 firms, while in 2013 it contains 100. Column (6) of Table 1 indicates the number

of BCs selected in the initial list and the 2013 list for each country.



2.2. Measures of labor market flexibility

   We use two measures of labor market flexibility.            The first is the OECD’s Employment

Protection Legislation (“EPL”) index, which is available for 34 OECD and 9 emerging countries.

The index measures the procedures involved in hiring workers on either fixed-term or temporary

contracts, and the procedures and costs involved in dismissing individuals and groups of workers.

The index is based on statutory laws, collective bargaining agreements, case law, contributions from

OECD member countries, and experts’ advice from each country. It has three components:

   Individual dismissal of workers with regular contracts (category EPR) measures three aspects of

dismissal protection: (i) procedural inconveniences of the dismissal process faced by employers,

such as notification and consultation requirements; (ii) length of notice periods and conditions of

severance pay; and (iii) difficulty of dismissal, such as the circumstances under which a dismissal

can be made possible, and repercussions for the employer if an unfair dismissal is discovered.




                                                    11
    Additional costs for collective dismissals (category EPC) measures the extra costs faced by

employers when they dismiss several workers simultaneously, over and above the costs applicable

for individual dismissals.

    Regulation of temporary contracts (category EPT) measures regulations for fixed-term and

temporary work contracts in terms of job type and duration, requirements for such workers to

receive equal pay and working conditions to permanent employees, and regulations for the setup

and operations of work agencies.

    The first two measures capture the ease of dismissal. As mentioned in the introduction, fewer

constraints on firing increase the motivational benefits of employee satisfaction (as workers will

exert greater effort to avoid being fired from a satisfying job), and also its recruitment benefits

(since the ease of firing raises the number of vacancies the firm can create). The third measure

captures constraints on hiring, which reduce the recruitment benefits of employee satisfaction.

Separately, regulations on hiring and firing impose a minimum level of employee welfare, leading

to a downward movement along the marginal benefit curve for expenditure on employee

satisfaction. Thus, in regulated labor markets, firms with high satisfaction relative to their peers

may be operating in the region in which the marginal benefit does not justify the cost.

    The EPL index has been used in Pagano and Volpin (2005b) and Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin

(2014). Following both papers, we calculate EPL as the average of the three sub-indicators’ scores;

high EPL implies low labor market flexibility.3 Column (1) of Table 1, Panel B reports the time

series mean of EPL for each country from 1998-2013, and columns (2)-(4) of report the time series

mean of each index. As a rough check that our EPL measure is linked to labor mobility, and thus

the retention and recruitment benefits of employee satisfaction, we were able to collect data on


3
 The OECD reports EPL as a weighted average of the three broad categories, where the weights depend on the number
of sub-indicators in each group. Our results are robust to this weighted measure of EPL.



                                                       12
labor turnover rates for seven countries in our sample from the OECD. Their correlation with our

employment protection legislation index is -0.73. Similarly, the labor economics literature shows

that employment protection is negatively associated with labor turnover (Bertola (1999), Autor,

Kerr, and Kugler (2007), Messina and Vallanti (2007), OECD (2013)).

   Our second measure of labor market flexibility is calculated based on data from the Fraser

Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World (“EFW”) database. The database contains indices on

labor market flexibility, which are also used by labor economics studies such as Bernal-Verdugo,

Furceri, and Guillaume (2012a, 2012b), Freeman, Kruse, and Blasi (2008), and Haltiwanger,

Scarpetta, and Schweiger (2008). The indices have been referred as a comprehensive measure of

the “de facto strictness of labor regulations” (Feldmann (2009)). We use the EFW indices across

six policy categories. All indices are standardized on a 0-10 scale, with higher values indicating

more flexible labor markets:

   Hiring regulations and minimum wage (category 5Bi) is based on the World Bank’s Doing

Business Difficulty of Hiring Index. The index measures three areas: (i) whether fixed-term

contracts are prohibited for permanent tasks; (ii) the maximum cumulative duration of fixed-term

contracts; and (iii) the ratio of the minimum wage for a trainee or first-time employee to the average

value added per worker.

   Hiring and firing regulations (category 5Bii) is derived from the World Economic Forum’s

Global Competitiveness Report’s survey question “How would you characterize the hiring and

firing of workers in your country?” Respondents assign a score from 1 (“impeded by regulations”)

to 7 (“flexibly determined by employers”) which are then standardized onto a 0-10 scale.

   Centralized collective bargaining (category 5Biii) is based on the World Economic Forum’s

Global Competitiveness Report’s survey question “How are wages generally set in your country?”.

to each individual company”) which are then standardized onto a 0-10 scale.

   Hours regulations (category 5Biv, previously called “mandated cost of hiring a worker”) is

based on the World Bank’s Doing Business Rigidity of Hours Index, which measures (i) whether

there are restrictions on night work; (ii) whether there are restrictions on weekly holiday work; (iii)

whether the work-week can consist of 5.5 days; (iv) whether the work-week can extend to 50 hours

or more (including overtime) for 2 months a year to respond to a seasonal increase in production;

and (v) whether paid annual vacation is 21 working days or fewer.

   Mandated cost of worker dismissal (category 5Bv) is based on the World Bank’s Doing

Business data. It includes the cost of the advance notice requirements, severance payments, and

penalties due when dismissing a redundant worker.

   Conscription (category 5Bvi) is based on the use and duration of military conscription. Lower

ratings of labor market flexibility are assigned to countries with longer conscription periods.

Columns (6)-(11) of Table 1, Panel B report the time series mean of each index across the sample

period.

   Categories 5Bi, 5Bii and 5Biv capture the ease of hiring (similar to category EPT in the EPL

index, although the latter focuses on temporary contracts), and category 5Bv captures the ease of

firing (similar to categories EPR and EPC in the EPL index). Category 5Biii measures the power of

labor unions. Labor unions impose restrictions on contracts which hinder both hiring and firing,

and may press for higher employee satisfaction even if not in shareholders interest. Category 5Bvi

captures a regulatory intervention to the supply-side. Where conscription is greater, the recruitment

benefits of employee satisfaction are smaller since individuals have less freedom to join firms.

    The current form of the EFW data is available annually from 2002 to 2013.4 We construct a

composite measure of labor market flexibility (EFW) that equals the average of the six indices in

each country-year. Column (5) of Table 1, Panel B reports the mean of the composite indicator for

each country.



3. Empirical results

3.1. Country-level alphas

    We first calculate the Carhart (1997) four-factor alphas to the BC portfolios in each country:



                                                                                                      1



where Rct is the U.S. dollar returns to a BC portfolio (either equal-weighted or value-weighted) in

month t for country c in excess of the U.S. one-month treasury rate. Stock returns are taken from

the Center for Research in Security Prices (“CRSP”) for U.S. firms and Datastream for other firms.

Both active and inactive firms are included to avoid survivorship bias. We winsorize stock returns

at the 0.5% and 99.5% level in each country. Results are very similar without winsorization.

    is an intercept that captures the abnormal risk-adjusted return. MKTct, HMLct, SMBct, and

MOMct, are, respectively, the Fama and French (2012) regional factors on market, value, size, and

momentum, collected from Kenneth French’s website. We use the Europe factors for all European

countries, the North American factors for Brazil, Chile, Canada and the U.S., the Japan factors for

Japan, and the Asia-Pacific Excluding Japan factors for Korea and India.




4
 The EFW also provided labor market flexibility data in 2000 and 2001 but on different components, which are not
comparable to the data from 2002 onwards.



                                                      15
        is an error term. Standard errors are corrected for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation

using Newey-West’s (1987) estimator with four lags.

    Table 2 reports results for equal-weighted portfolios. Three of the 14 countries (Denmark,

Germany, and Greece) have insignificantly negative alphas. The remaining 11 countries have

positive alphas, which are significant at the 10% level or better for Chile, Japan, Sweden, and the

U.S. In terms of economic significance, the U.S. has the tenth highest alpha out of the fourteen

countries, suggesting that it is not an outlier. Table 3 reports results for value-weighted portfolios.

Denmark, France, Germany, and Greece have negative alphas, with Denmark’s being significant at

the 10% level. The alphas for Chile, the U.K., and the U.S., are significantly positive at the 10%

level or better.



3.2. Characteristics controls

    While Section 3.1 controls for the BCs’ covariance with risk factors, this section controls for

firm characteristics that may also affect stock returns. We first run the following pooled panel

regression across all firms (both BCs and non-BCs) within a country, at the firm-month level:



                                                                                 (2)


Rit is the return on stock i in month t. BCit is a dummy variable that equals one if firm i was

included in the most recent BC list prior to month t, and zero otherwise. FirmControlsit include the

control variables used in Brennan, Chordia, and Subrahmanyam (1998), calculated using CRSP and

Compustat for U.S. firms and Datastream and Worldscope for non-U.S. firms. SIZE is the log of

firm i’s market capitalization at the end of month t-2. BM is the log of firm i’s book-to-market ratio

at the end of month t-2. YLD is firm i’s dividend yield as measured by the sum of all dividends paid

over the previous 12 months prior to month t, divided by the share price at the end of month t-2.

                                                  16
RET2-3 is the log of one plus firm i’s cumulative return over months t-3 through t-2. RET4-6 and

RET7-12 are defined similarly. VOL is the log of firm i’s dollar trading volume in month t-2. PRC

is the log of firm i’s price at the end of month t-2. FEt are month fixed effects to control for

macroeconomic cycles. Standard errors are clustered by firm.

   Results for each country are reported in Table 4.         The coefficient on the BC dummy is

significantly positive for Canada, Chile, Greece, India, Japan, Korea, and the U.S. For example, in

the U.S., being a BC is associated with an additional monthly return of 28 basis points. Denmark,

Finland, France, Germany, and Sweden have insignificantly negative coefficients on the BC

dummy.

   We next run Fama-MacBeth (1973) cross-sectional regressions for each country in a given

month t:



                                                                                 (3)


where Ri is the return on stock . BCi is a dummy variable that equals one if firm            has been

included in the most recent BC list, and zero otherwise. FirmControlsi include the control variables

used in Brennan, Chordia, and Subrahmanyam (1998).                Standard errors are adjusted for

heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation using Newey-West’s (1987) estimator with four lags. We

then take the time-series average of the monthly coefficients for each country. While the pooled

panel regression weights each firm-month observation equally, the Fama-MacBeth (1973) approach

weights each month equally.

   Results for each country are reported in Table 5.          Consistent with prior results, the BC

coefficient is significantly positive at the 5% level or better in Canada, India, Japan, Korea, and the

U.K. The coefficients are negative and insignificant for Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Greece.

Overall, the results suggest that the positive returns to Best Companies in the U.S. do extend to

                                                  17
other countries, but there is significant heterogeneity between countries. In the next section, we

study how this heterogeneity is related to labor market flexibility.



4. The role of labor market flexibility

    This section examines how the relationship between employee satisfaction and stock returns

depends on the degree of labor market flexibility.                   Holderness (2014a, 2014b) argues that

international empirical analyses should be conducted at the firm level, rather than at the country

level, as the latter approach ignores between-firm, within-country variation. In our context, using

country averages (e.g. regressing country-level alpha on labor market flexibility) will ignore other

firm-specific determinants of stock returns. We thus study the impact of labor market flexibility

using firm-level analyses that take into account firm characteristics.

    We start by enhancing the pooled panel regression in equation (2) with measures of labor

market flexibility and country-level controls, and estimating it across the full sample of all

countries:




                                                       4




where Returncit is either the raw return (Rcit) or the market-adjusted return (i.e. the raw return in

excess of the market return) for firm i in country c in month t.5 EPLct is the employment protection

legislation indicator for country c in month t and EFWct is the labor market flexibility indicator. To

5
  We also use the abnormal return (      ) for firm in country at month as the dependent variable.                    is
calculated as the CAPM-adjusted abnormal return using either a 5- or 3-year rolling-window beta. Results are similar.




                                                           18
ensure that our EPL and EFW variables are not simply proxying for other country-level differences,

we include CountryControlsct, a vector of other country-level control variables:          RuleofLawc

measures the rule of law from La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997); Gdpgct

measures GDP growth for country c in month t taken from the World Bank; SoCMc measures the

size of capital market, specifically the number of listed domestic firms per (million) capita from La

Porta et al. (1997); ADRIc measures the anti-director rights index corrected by Spamann (2010); and

OSOVc measures the presence of one-share one-vote from La Porta et al. (1997). In particular, the

returns to Best Companies capture not only the value of employee satisfaction, but the extent to

which this value is not immediately capitalized by the market. Thus, we include a control for the

size of the capital market as a proxy for market efficiency. Standard errors are clustered by firm.

   Panel A of Table 6 presents the results using EPL as the measure of labor market flexibility.

Columns (1) – (3) use raw returns as the dependent variable. In column (1), which contains no

measures of labor market flexibility or country controls, BC has a positive coefficient of 0.760,

which is significant at the 1% level. However, in column (3) when interactions with EPL and the

country controls are added, the coefficient on BC is no longer significant. Instead, the coefficient

on BC*EPL is a significantly negative -0.693. Thus, BCs are not associated with higher returns on

average, but only in countries with weak employment protection legislation. Columns (4) – (6) use

the market-adjusted return (i.e. the raw return minus the market return) as the dependent variable.

The results are slightly stronger, with the coefficient on BC*EPL falling to -0.790. A one standard

deviation decrease in EPL is associated with a 0.49% increase in the monthly market-adjusted

return to being a BC.

   Panel B presents the results using EFW as the measure of labor market flexibility, which are

similar to Panel A. For both raw returns and market-adjusted returns in columns (3) and (6), the

coefficient on BC is insignificant, but the coefficient on BC*EFW is positive and significant at the


                                                  19
1% level. For example, the coefficient of 0.394 in column (6) indicates that a one standard

deviation increase in EFW is associated with a 0.67% increase in the monthly market-adjusted

return to being a BC.

   Table 7 presents the results of Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions for the full sample,

which includes country-level controls and measures of labor market flexibility. The results are very

similar to Table 6, with the coefficients on BC*EPL being significantly negative and those on

BC*EFW being significantly positive.



5. Conclusions

   This paper studies how the relationship between employee satisfaction and stock returns

depends critically on the level of a country’s labor market flexibility. The alphas documented by

Edmans (2011, 2012) for the U.S. are not anomalous in a global context, in terms of economic

significance, and do extend to several other countries.      However, they do not automatically

generalize to every country – being listed as a Best Company to Work For is associated with

superior returns only in countries with high labor market flexibility. These results are consistent

with the idea that the recruitment, retention, and motivational benefits of employee satisfaction are

most valuable in countries in which firms face fewer constraints on hiring and firing. These

benefits are lower in countries with inflexible labor markets, leading to a downward shift in the

marginal benefit of expenditure on employee welfare. Moreover, in such countries, regulations

already provide a floor for worker welfare, leading to a movement down the marginal benefit curve.

Both forces reduce the marginal benefit of investing in worker satisfaction, and thus being listed as

a Best Company may reflect an agency problem.

   The results emphasize the importance of the institutional context for both managers and

investors. Edmans (2011, 2012) uses long-run stock returns as the dependent variable to mitigate


                                                 20
concerns about reverse causality from firm performance to employee satisfaction – any publicly-

available performance measure should be incorporated into the stock price at the start of the return

compounding window. However, these papers do not make strong claims about causality, as it may

be that a third, unobservable variable (e.g. management quality) drives both employee satisfaction

and stock returns. Even if their results are interpreted as causal, it is not the case that managers can

hope to increase stock returns by investing in employee satisfaction, as a positive link only exists in

countries with high labor market flexibility. Turning to investors, a strategy of investing in firms

with high employee satisfaction will only generate superior returns in countries with high labor

market flexibility. Given that the vast majority of empirical asset pricing studies that uncover alpha

are based on U.S. data, the results emphasize caution in applying these strategies overseas. This

caution is especially warranted for strategies that are likely to be dependent on the institutional or

cultural environment, such as socially responsible investing strategies.         Just as the value of

employee satisfaction depends on the flexibility of labor markets and existing regulations on worker

welfare, the value of other SRI screens such as gender diversity, animal rights, environmental

protection, and operating in an ethical industry also likely depend on the context.

                                      Panel B: Employment protection legislation and labor market flexibility
Panel B summarizes the employment protection legislation (EPL) indicators from OECD and the labor market flexibility index (EFW) based on the
Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World database. Column (1) presents the average scores of employment protection legislation index for
each country. They are based on the average of three components, namely the individual dismissal of workers with regular contracts (EPR),
additional costs for collective dismissals (EPC), and regulation of temporary contracts (EPT). Columns (2) – (4) report the average per country for
these components, respectively. Column (5) presents the average scores of the aggregate labor market flexibility index calculated as the average of its
six components. Column (6) presents the average score of hiring regulations and minimum wage per country (5Bi). Column (7) presents the average
score of hiring and firing regulations (5Bii). Column (8) presents the average score of centralized collective bargaining (5Biii). Column (9) presents
the average score of hours regulations. Column (10) presents the average score of mandated cost of worker dismissal (5Bv). Column (11) presents
the average score of military conscription (5Bvi). The sample period is from 1998 to 2013 for EPL and from 2002 to 2013 for EFW.

Table 2
Risk-adjusted returns of equal-weighted BC portfolios

This table reports regression results of monthly returns of equal-weighted portfolios of Best Companies using
Carhart’s (1997) four-factor model:
               R      α     β     MKT        β     HML       β     SMB        β     MOM        ε
where Rct is the return on equal-weighted portfolio of listed BCs in month t for country c in excess of the
risk-free rate. α is the intercept that captures the abnormal risk-adjusted return. MKTct, HMLct, SMBct, and
MOMct, are, respectively, the Fama and French (2012)’s regional factors on market, value, and size, and
momentum. Coefficient estimates are shown in bold, and their standard errors are displayed in parentheses
below, adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation (Newey and West (1987)). ***, **, and * indicate
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively. The sample period is from February 1998 to
December 2013. For the US we also extend the sample period from February 1984 to December 2013.

Table 3
Risk-adjusted returns of value-weighted BC portfolios

This table reports regression results of monthly returns of value-weighted portfolios of Best Companies using
Carhart’s (1997) four-factor model:
               R      α     β     MKT        β     HML       β     SMB        β     MOM        ε
where Rct is the return on value-weighted portfolio of listed BCs in month t for country c in excess of the
risk-free rate. α is the intercept that captures the abnormal risk-adjusted return. MKTct, HMLct, SMBct, and
MOMct, are, respectively, the Fama and French (2012)’s regional factors on market, value, and size, and
momentum. Coefficient estimates are shown in bold, and their standard errors are displayed in parentheses
below, adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation (Newey and West (1987)). ***, **, and * indicate
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively. The sample period is from February 1998 to
December 2013. For the US we also extend the sample period from February 1984 to December 2013.

where Rit is the raw return for firm i in month t. BCit is a dummy variable that equals one if firm i has been
included in the most recent BC list prior to month t, and zero otherwise. The firm characteristics control
variables, FirmControlsit-2, include the following variables: SIZE is the log of firm ’s market capitalization
at the end of month t-2. BM is the log of firm i’s book-to-market ratio at the end of month t-2. YLD is firm
i’s dividend yield as measured by the sum of all dividends paid over the previous 12 months prior to month t,
divided by the share price at the end of month t-2. RET2-3 is the log of one plus firm i’s cumulative return
over months t-3 through t-2. RET4-6 and RET7-12 are defined similarly. VOL is the log of firm i’s dollar
trading volume in month t-2. PRC is the log of firm i’s price at the end of month t-2. FEt refers to month
fixed effect. Coefficient estimates are shown in bold, and their standard errors are clustered by firm and are
given in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively. The
sample period is from January 1998 to December 2013.

Fama-MacBeth regressions by country

This table reports results of firm-level cross-sectional regressions based on Fama-MacBeth’s (1973) method
in a given month t:
                                R     α      α BC        α FirmControls        ε
where Ri is the raw return for firm i in the given month t. BCi is a dummy variable that equals one if firm i
has been included in the most recent BC list prior to the given month t, and zero otherwise. The firm
characteristics control variables, FirmControlsi, include the following variables: SIZE is the log of firm ’s
market capitalization at the end of month t-2. BM is the log of firm i’s book-to-market ratio at the end of
month t-2. YLD is firm i’s dividend yield as measured by the sum of all dividends paid over the previous 12
months prior to month t, divided by the share price at the end of month t-2. RET2-3 is the log of one plus
firm i’s cumulative return over months t-3 through t-2. RET4-6 and RET7-12 are defined similarly. VOL is
the log of firm i’s dollar trading volume in month t-2. PRC is the log of firm i’s price at the end of month t-
2. Coefficient estimates are calculated as the time-series average of the monthly coefficients for each
country and shown in bold, and their standard errors are displayed in parentheses below, adjusted for
heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation (Newey and West (1987)). ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%,
5%, and 10% level, respectively. The sample period is from January 1998 to December 2013.

Pooled panel regressions across countries

                           Panel A: Measuring labor market flexibility with EPL
This table reports the results of pooled panel regressions across countries:


where Returncit is either the raw return (Rcit) or the market-adjusted return (i.e. the raw return in excess of the
market return) for firm i in country c in month t. BCcit is a dummy variable that equals one if firm i has been
included in the most recent BC list in country c prior to month t, and zero otherwise. EPLct is the
Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) indicator from OECD for country c at time t and is based on the
legislations in three broad categories: individual dismissal of workers with regular contracts, collective
dismissals, and temporary contracts. CountryControlsct indicate the following country-level control variables
for country c at time t: RuleofLawc measures the law and order tradition from LLSV(1997); Gdpgct measures
the GDP growth taken from the World Bank; SoCMc measures the size of capital market, specifically the
number of listed domestic firms per (million) capita from LLSV(1997); ADRIc measures anti-director rights
index corrected by Spamann (2010); OSOVc measures one-share one-vote from LLSV (1997).
FirmControlscit include the following variables: SIZE is the log of firm i’s market capitalization at the end of
month t-2. BM is the log of firm i’s book-to-market ratio at the end of month t-2. YLD is firm i’s dividend
yield as measured by the sum of all dividends paid over the previous 12 months prior to month t, divided by
the share price at the end of month t-2. RET2-3 is the log of one plus firm i’s cumulative return over months
t-3 through t-2. RET4-6 and RET7-12 are defined similarly. VOL is the log of firm i’s dollar trading volume
in month t-2. PRC is the log of firm i’s price at the end of month t-2. FEt refers to month fixed effect.
Standard errors are clustered by firm and are given in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively. The sample is from January 1998 to December 2013.

Table 6 (Cont’d)

                           Panel B: Measuring labor market flexibility with EFW
This table reports the results of pooled panel regressions across countries:


where Returncit is either the raw return (Rcit) or the market-adjusted return (i.e. the raw return in excess of the
market return) for firm i in country c in month t. BCcit is a dummy variable that equals one if firm i has been
included in the most recent BC list in country c prior to month t, and zero otherwise. EFWct is the labor
market flexibility indicator for country c at time t and is calculated as the average score of six indicators on
hiring regulations and mini wage, hiring and firing regulations, centralized collective bargaining, hours
regulations, mandated cost of worker dismissal and military conscription obtained from the Fraser Institute’s
Economic Freedom of the World database. CountryControlsct indicate the following country-level control
variables for country c at time t: RuleofLawc measures the law and order tradition from LLSV(1997); Gdpgct
measures the GDP growth taken from the World Bank; SoCMc measures the size of capital market,
specifically the number of listed domestic firms per (million) capita from LLSV(1997); ADRIc measures anti-
director rights index corrected by Spamann (2010); OSOVc measures one-share one-vote from LLSV (1997).
FirmControlscit include the following variables: SIZE is the log of firm i’s market capitalization at the end of
month t-2. BM is the log of firm i’s book-to-market ratio at the end of month t-2. YLD is firm i’s dividend
yield as measured by the sum of all dividends paid over the previous 12 months prior to month t, divided by
the share price at the end of month t-2. RET2-3 is the log of one plus firm i’s cumulative return over months
t-3 through t-2. RET4-6 and RET7-12 are defined similarly. VOL is the log of firm i’s dollar trading volume
in month t-2. PRC is the log of firm i’s price at the end of month t-2. FEt refers to month fixed effect.
Standard errors are clustered by firm and are given in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively. The sample is from January 2002 to December 2013.

Fama-MacBeth regressions across countries

                           Panel A: Measuring labor market flexibility with EPL
This table reports results of firm-level cross-sectional regressions based on Fama-MacBeth’s (1973) method
in a given month t:


where Returnci is either the raw return (Rci) or the market-adjusted return (i.e. the raw return in excess of the
market return) for firm i in country c in the given month t. BCci is a dummy variable that equals one if firm i
has been included in the most recent BC list in country c prior to the given month t, and zero otherwise.
EPLc is the Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) indicator from OECD for country c at the given month
t and is based on the legislations in three broad categories: individual dismissal of workers with regular
contracts, collective dismissals, and temporary contracts. CountryControlsc indicate the following country-
level control variables for country c at the given t: RuleofLawc measures the law and order tradition from
LLSV(1997); Gdpgc measures the GDP growth taken from the World Bank; SoCMc measures the size of
capital market, specifically the number of listed domestic firms per (million) capita from LLSV(1997);
ADRIc measures anti-director rights index corrected by Spamann (2010); OSOVc measures one-share one-
vote from LLSV (1997). FirmControlsci include the following variables: SIZE is the log of firm i’s market
capitalization at the end of month t-2. BM is the log of firm i’s book-to-market ratio at the end of month t-2.
YLD is firm i’s dividend yield as measured by the sum of all dividends paid over the previous 12 months
prior to month t, divided by the share price at the end of month t-2. RET2-3 is the log of one plus firm i’s
cumulative return over months t-3 through t-2. RET4-6 and RET7-12 are defined similarly. VOL is the log
of firm i’s dollar trading volume in month t-2. PRC is the log of firm i’s price at the end of month t-2. FEt
refers to month fixed effect. The reported coefficients are the time-series average of the monthly
coefficients. Standard errors are displayed in parentheses below, adjusted for heteroscedasticity and
autocorrelation (Newey and West (1987)). ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level,
respectively. The sample is from January 1998 to December 2013.
